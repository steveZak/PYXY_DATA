        "wiki": "Cannes (; French: [kan]; Occitan: Canas) is a city located on the French Riviera. It is a commune located in the Alpes-Maritimes department, and host city of the annual Cannes Film Festival, Midem, and Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. The city is known for its association with the rich and famous, its luxury hotels and restaurants, and for several conferences. On 3 November 2011 it hosted the 2011 G20 summit.\n\n\n== History ==\nBy the 2nd century BC, the Ligurian Oxybii established a settlement here known as Aegitna (Ancient Greek: \u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bd\u03b1). Historians are unsure what the name means. The area was a fishing village used as a port of call between the L\u00e9rins Islands.\n\nIn 154 BC, it became the scene of violent but quick conflict between the troops of Quintus Opimius and the Oxybii.In the 10th century, the town was known as Canua. The name may derive from \"canna\", a reed. Canua was probably the site of a small Ligurian port, and later a Roman outpost on Le Suquet hill, suggested by Roman tombs discovered here. Le Suquet housed an 11th-century tower, which overlooked swamps where the city now stands. Most of the ancient activity, especially protection, was on the L\u00e9rins Islands, and the history of Cannes is closely tied to the history of the islands.\nAn attack by the Saracens in 891, who remained until the end of the 10th century, devastated the country around Canua. The insecurity of the L\u00e9rins islands forced the monks to settle on the mainland, at the Suquet. Construction of a castle in 1035 fortified the city by then known as Cannes, and at the end of the 11th century construction was started on two towers on the L\u00e9rins islands. One took a century to build.\nAround 1530, Cannes detached from the monks who had controlled the city for hundreds of years and became independent.\nDuring the 18th century, both the Spanish and British tried to gain control of the L\u00e9rins Islands but were chased away by the French. The islands were later controlled by many, such as Jean-Honor\u00e9 Alziary and the Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus. They had many different purposes: at the end of the 19th century, one served as hospital for soldiers wounded in the Crimean War.\nHenry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux bought land at the Croix des Gardes and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise. His work to improve living conditions attracted the English aristocracy, who also built winter residences.\nAt the end of the 19th century, several railways were completed, which prompted the arrival of streetcars. In Cannes, projects such as the Boulevard Carnot and the rue d'Antibes were carried out. After the closure of the Casino des Fleurs (h\u00f4tel Gallia), a luxury establishment was built for the rich winter clientele, the Casino Municipal next to the pier Albert-Edouard. This casino was demolished and replaced by the new Palace in 1979.\nIn the 20th century, new luxury hotels such as the Carlton, Majestic, Martinez, and JW Marriott Cannes were built. The city was modernised with a sports centre, a post office, and schools. There were fewer British and German tourists after the First World War, but more Americans. Winter tourism gave way to summer tourism, and the summer casino at the Palm Beach was constructed.\nThe city council had the idea of starting an international film festival shortly before World War II. The first opened on 20 September 1946, held in the Casino Municipal.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nCannes has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa) and the city enjoys 11 hours of sunshine per day during summer (July), while in winter (December to February) the weather is mild. Both seasons see a relatively low rainfall and most rain occurs during October and November, when 110 mm (4.3 in) falls.\nCannes summers are long and warm, with summer daytime temperatures regularly hitting 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), while average temperatures are about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Temperatures remain high from June to September, the busiest time of the year.\nMean temperatures drop below 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) for only three months of the year (December to February). The spring and autumn are also warm, although more suited to those who prefer slightly cooler weather.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nThe Promenade de la Croisette is the waterfront avenue with palm trees. La Croisette is known for picturesque beaches, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, boutiques and luxury hotels. Le Suquet, the old town, provides a good view of La Croisette. The fortified tower and Chapel of St Anne house the Mus\u00e9e de la Castre. A distinctive building in Cannes is the Russian Orthodox church.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\n\n=== Villas ===\nCannes of the 19th century can still be seen in its grand villas, built to reflect the wealth and standing of their owners and inspired by anything from medieval castles to Roman villas. They are not open to the public. Lord Brougham's Italianate Villa El\u00e9onore Louise (one of the first in Cannes) was built between 1835 and 1839. Also known as the Quartier des Anglais, this is the oldest residential area in Cannes. Another landmark is the Villa Fi\u00e9sole (known today as the Villa Domergue) designed by Jean-Gabriel Domergue in the style of Fiesole, near Florence, which may be visited on appointment.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite ===\n\nIt took the Man in the Iron Mask 11 years to leave the tiny, forested St Marguerite Island. The mysterious individual was believed to be of noble blood, but his identity has never been proven. His cell can be visited in the Fort of St Marguerite, now renamed the Mus\u00e9e de la Mer (Museum of the Sea). This museum also houses discoveries from shipwrecks off the island, including Roman (1st century BC) and Saracen (10th century AD) ceramics.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Saint-Honorat ===\n\nCistercian monks are the only inhabitants of the smaller, southern St Honorat Island. Monks have inhabited the island since AD 410 and, at the height of their powers, owned Cannes, Mougins, and Vallauris. Medieval vestiges remain in the stark church, which is open to the public, and in the ruins of the 11th-century monastery on the sea shore. The monks inhabit the L\u00e9rins Abbey and divide their time between prayer and producing red and white wines.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire de Provence houses artifacts from prehistoric to present, in an 18th-century mansion. The Mus\u00e9e de la Castre has objects from the Pacific Atolls, Peruvian relics and Mayan pottery. Other venues include the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, Mus\u00e9e de la Mer, Mus\u00e9e de la Photographie and Mus\u00e9e International de la Parfumerie.\n\n\n=== Theatre and music ===\nCannes is not renowned for traditional theatre. However, small venues stage productions and host short sketches during the annual International Actors' Performance Festival. Popular theaters include the Espace Miramar and the Alexandre III.\n\n\n=== Festivals and show events ===\nThe Cannes Film Festival founded in 1946 is held annually, usually in May, at the Palais des Festivals et des Congr\u00e8s.\nThe Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity is a global event and awards show for those working in advertising and related fields, held annually in June.\nMidem, the foremost trade show for the music industry.\nMIPIM, the world's largest property-related trade show.\nCarnival on the Riviera is an annual parade through the streets to mark the 21-day period prior to Shrove Tuesday.\nThe International Festival of Games is festival of bridge, belote, backgammon, chess, draughts, tarot and more (February).\nCannes Yachting Festival is an event for boating enthusiasts in the Vieux Port (September).\nThe International Actors' Performance Festival: comedy sketches and performances by fringe artists\nThe International Luxury Travel Market brings together under one roof the top international luxury travel providers and suppliers from all around the world.[1]\nLe Festival d'Art Pyrotechnique is a magnificent annual fireworks competition held in the summer at the Bay of Cannes.\nThe Global Champions Tour showjumping league has an annual event in the ports of Cannes.\nMipcom and MIPTV, held in October and April respectively, the world's most important trade markets for the television industry.\nThe Pan-African Film Festival, held in early April and featuring films from the African diaspora.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe area around Cannes has developed into a high-tech cluster. The technopolis of Sophia Antipolis lies in the hills beyond Cannes. The Film Festival is a major event for the industry which takes place every year during the month of May. In addition, Cannes hosts other major annual events such as the MIPIM, MIPTV, MIDEM, Cannes Lions, and the NRJ Music Awards.  There is an annual television festival in the last week in September.\nThe economic environment is based on tourism, business fairs, trade and aviation.

          "My entire stay in Cannes was overshadowed by rain. I had to make the walk up to this museum in a downpour, but I can honestly say that it was worth it. A museum full of intriguing and beautiful pieces from across the ages, some of them breathtaking. An eclectic collection, the",
          "The museum has a unique collection of artefacts from around the world which are well worth the \u20ac6 entry fee. In the courtyard you will find the tower and with a small climb up 109 stairs (21m) you will find breathtaking views on Cannes. Well worth checking out.",
          "This museum is perched up on the old town, and it's a nice walk and an opportunity explore a rather diverse collection of historical treasures from around the world. The big draw for us was the view at the top of the tower, which is fantastic- a nice view of the harbor and",
          "It was only \u20ac6 each, bargain! The museum has many artifacts, collected from all over the world. It was very interesting. We timed it perfectly as the Tower was open. I'm not a lover of heights but I made it to the top and I'm so glad I did, the views of Cannes were stunning.",
          "Just visited this tiny museum at the hilltop of cannes, on Sunday 21/05. I was pretty amazed by one welcoming employee and an astonishing view First, an adorable and smiling black woman at the entrance explained me nicely about each room and what to find. She then suggested me",
          "To reach the museum, you have to walk up and at the end you will have a nice view from the top, especially on the harbor. That's the best part, in my opinion. Entrance in not that expensive, money has a discrete value, even if museum is not that exceptional. Its visit is",
          "Very nice place to visit on a hot day in Cannes and not so busy than in the city , go to the top of the tower and you will see Cannes from high up",
          "The location itself is very nice. You can see all around the city too. It's not expensive museum but you get to see some interesting items and collections from around the world. Arts, artifacts, sculptures, etc.",
          "Of course do not expect to find le mus\u00e9e du Louvre. But this is an interesting museum well worth a couple of hours visit. Well organized displays of greco-roman artifacts and various ethnic collections. Their Pacific Ocean section has some beautiful pieces from the Marquises",
          "Inside this old castle there's a museum that hardly ever changes its collection: interesting, but not stunning. You can also climb a tower that gives you a beautiful view of the bay, the city and its surroundings.",
          "Located above Cannes, this museum in a former castle offers a variety of artifacts, everything from ancient Egypt to South Sea islands. If you had never been to a museum, this would be interesting, but overall the collection is to varied and minimal to be in any way exceptional.",
          "The museum is in the chapel of the medieval castle \"La Castre\", located in the hilltop old city of Cannes. The museum is very nice and interesting, and the scenic views of the bay of Cannes from the terrace were fabulous.",
          "Great view once you've climbed up there, which was worth going for, but it is shut on a Monday! Not sure if that is year round but worth checking first!",
          "Climbing all the stairs for the museum might very well be a waste of time. Entrance for adults (no discount) is 6 euro, which is a bit expensive for what you get. The museum is strange collection with no visible theme of different items and paintings. All signs are in French so",
          "As other reviewers have mentioned, its quite a steep hill up to the castle, but the views are worth it, as are the ethnological artefacts in the museum. I had no idea what to expect but was impressed by the smallish but interesting collection. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Nice collection of interesting stuff. The best part of the place was it's tower. You've got to go all the way up. The beautiful view of the entire town and Bay Area await you!",
          "We walked up to the musee during our visit to Cannes. It is a tough walk to get to the top, lots and lots of steps! However when you make it to the Castre you are treated to superb views of Cannes and its surrounding marinas. Well worth the effort!",
          "Interesting ethnological museum of objects brought back by explorers, but nothing about Cannes itself. Nice view from the tower, though. Worth the admission fee.",
          "After surveying the landscape we visited the museum for an hour or so which has interesting objects from different far away islands as well as some Egyptian artefacts and local paintings. Eclectic collection was worth the visit.",
          "at the top of the hill so a slight walk up hill but worth the effort great views of the bay of cannes at the top",
          "A relatively small museum, but jampacked with interesting items well displayed. I went there to see an especially interesting new display of photographs of Egyptian archaeological sites taken at the dawn of photography. Not a large display, but interesting to see before they",
          "The viewpoint in front of the church as well as next to the church provides one with panoramic views over the city and valleys. Do continue to the top, the view is worth it. It is not a massive climb and one can wind down back to town with an alternative road and explore the",
          "With a leisure walk up along the Suquet old town about 10 minutes from Cannes. Special rate for group size over 10 pax. Climb up the tower for a beautiful bird eye view over pretty Cannes. Quite many world ethnical collections and paintings on display.",
          "This museum is truly a waste of space, and the collection has absolutely nothing to do with the region. The tour has a beautiful of Cannes, but the staircase leading up to the top is really horrific and dirty.",
          "I did not go inside the museum so cannot comment on this. However, I can say it is still worth the visit just to get photos of the outside buildings.",
          "Musee de la Castre is the historical ans ethnographic museum of Cannes. It has some collections of art from different parts of the world and from the region. It is an interesting museum, but it is not essential. Outside the Museum, you can see beautiful views of Cannes and the",
          "Great view from the church, but the museum is closed on Mondays. Still worth the walk up. Someone was playing violin in the square which added to the ambiance.",
          "Excellent little museum stuffed with ethnographic relics from around the world, including a Persian permanent exhibition. Outside is almost more delightful, with a panoramic view of Cannes, the Alpes on a good day and the most delightful sea breeze. heaven with a busker too.",
          "The castle sits at the top of the old town in Cannes (le Suquet) and the views from there are fabulous. The Castle is interesting - it houses art collections and antiquities from around the world. Even if you didn't actually enter the Castle it is still worth a visit for the"

        "wiki": "The Palais des Festivals et des Congr\u00e8s (Palace of Festivals and Conferences) is a convention center in Cannes, France, the venue for the Cannes Film Festival, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity and the NRJ Music Award. The building opened in 1982.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first Palais des Festivals et des Congr\u00e8s was built in 1949 to host the Cannes Film Festival. The original building was located on the boulevard of Promenade de la Croisette on the present site of the JW Marriott Cannes. That building hosted the 4th and 6th Eurovision Song Contests in 1959 and 1961.\n\nIn response to the growing success of the Film Festival and the advent of the first business conventions, such as the MIPTV Media Market since 1965, the City of Cannes decided to build a new Palais in 1979. The new building, a six-story building designed in the Modernist style by the architects Sir Hubert Bennett and Fran\u00e7ois Druet, was constructed on the site of the municipal Casino. It opened in December 1982 and was expanded in 1999 with the construction of the Espace Riviera, a new space of 10,000 square meters. \nIn January 1992, the Society of Mixed Economy for the Events of the city of Cannes (SEMEC), was created to manage the Palais. SEMEC resulted from the merger of three non-profit organizations: Cannes Tourism, the OMACC and the association Cannes Palais des Festivals et des Congr\u00e8s.\n\n\n== Today ==\nThe Palais des Festivals is located at the top of blvd. de la Croisette, east of the port. It has an overall space capacity of 35,000 square meters for exhibitions, as well as numerous rooms and 18 auditoriums, the largest of which has a capacity of 2,300. It is the venue for the annual Cannes Film Festival (Festival de Cannes), and possesses \"modern and high-tech facilities\" for housing conferences throughout the year.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Media ==\nInstitut National de l'Audiovisuel: Construction of the Palais des festivals (1947) (commentary in French)\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Palais des festivals et des congr\u00e8s de Cannes at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website",

The worst thing is one can not enter inside the auditorium and they don\u2019t even put the posters in display. But the interesting thing is to check the street near by. It has finger impressions of famous celebrities.",

There are handprints of stars/ actors tiled on the floor outside the palace. However, we could not make out most of these due to the illegible signatures.",

          "We were taken to Cannes as part of a one day tour from Nice. The only stop in Cannes was this building that hosts the Cannes Film Festival every year. However, if there is no event going on, there is nothing else to do here. The beach nearby is good, but we didn't have much time",
          "The center is older but has hosted some outstanding events. The harbor wraps around the hall with beautiful views. The event I attended had over 23,000 people and I never felt cramped. It's an interesting venue with so many intriguing ideas for hosting event outside of the",
          "Yes, this is the building that hosts the Cannes Film Festival every May. Yes, the building is highly recognizable, and you will most probably immediately picture the red carpet photos you've seen online of the film festival. That's it, though. It's just a square building,",
          "I was there for an exhibition. Famous building, host to many world events. Otherwise nothing special. Along the sidewalk many yachts belonging to the rich.",
          "A little vicious construction on the Cannes promenade La Croisette with white tents around. But very famous building.",
          "I've been there just because of conference. The place has a huge hall and wing hall but only have a few toilet.",
          "I was here for a conference and I found the facilities to be very dated. The whole place could do with a refresh. The two main auditoriums were good, and the seats were very comfy, but in smaller conference rooms it was not as good and many rooms were difficult to find due to",
          "An unusual building which has more importance put upon it than it should. Could only see the outside as it was closed to the public. Better looking buildings all around it. Had a red carpet, so what.",
          "We didn't go inside and there is nothing to see from the outside. But, as an iconic place, I guess we should visit it at least once in a life time.",
          "Worth a stroll alongside the strand to see the Congres of Cannes. You will likely not miss it since there are always a few tourist posing in front of the stairwell with the red carpet. Walk a bit further and you will see a parking lot full of million dollar Yachts.",
          "I have to say I prefer the drives along the coast to such apparent cultural hubs. It's OK, you can say you've been, or pretend to be famous on the stairs, but a tad underwhelming.",
          "It just look like another building for me as I haven't got chance to get into this. There is lot of noise and work going on outside the building which caused lot of discomfort",
          "I live 10km from Cannes. Visitors always comment on how disappointing the Palais de Festival is. Amongst the beauty and glamor of the town, this building is a disaster. Local residents would all say the same, and I believe there are plans to either completly renovate it or knock",
          "When the festival is not on the red carpet is not out and you can only get photos of the steps with their red paintwork down the middle",
          "I was expecting something much more glamorous. Sure it's a nice convention center but in the end it doesn't quite match the surroundings and currently it was covered with blockades and just looked like an eyesore.",
          "very nice to walk around the marina and visit the place where the cannes film festival is done, there are amazing restaurants in the area,",
          "This place is nice. The red carpet is permanently there. The feeling of the Cannes Festival gives us great joy to pose and photograph, else its an ok place.",
          "If ever a building ruined a town, especialy one as grand as Cannes then The Palais des Festival is it. Its monsterous. But hey, if you want to walk in the steps of George Clooney and Sophia Loren then have your photo taken on the main staircase because thats about as close as",
          "This is the place to have conferences! Not just the cinema event that you all have read about. It is very well suited for other conferences as well.",
          "Palais des Festivals et des Congres of Cannes is the building with more glamour in Cannes. Here is, where the festival of Cannes is celebrated. It is a contemporanean building built with glass. For me, this building is too much artificial and big, then only it is useful to",
          "The hype from TV turns out underwhelming. Yes it is a pleasant building close to the waterfront with a set of red stairs. Good for a photo op, if you can get one with the crowds.",
          "Always liked to be here and enjoyed all what this beautiful city can offer, festivals fireworks, depending on the time that you are visiting, shopping, whatever you choose to do you will enjoy, love it...",
          "We visited in September so there was nothing on, so no crowds to contend with. We got to take a photo on the famous steps and look at the hand prints, that was all that was necessary really.",
          "Been here a dozen or so times for a music convention... Really nice convention center, right on the water in the middle of a beautiful old town. Lots of good restaurants all over. I suggest going to the old quarter \"Le Suguet\" for the best selection of eateries.",
          "We went to take some red carpet pics and just have a look see. Surrounding the building we found the many handprints of the stars interesting. Many of these larger than life personas have very small hands. Who knew?",
          "We went to Cannes in month of may when festival was on.So naturally there was huge crowd,traffic jams and parking problems.However we were able to see some celebrities ans see the venues from outside.Still a good experiance.So much heard and finally seen.Good experiance",
          "extremely small the building and the red carpet!! we wait long enough for a picture... not something special!!",
          "Went to see the palais just for the red carpet experience. Took some photos and posed like a famous star . That was all really. Weekend was packed so you won't be able to have the red carpet on your own like hollywood stars do.",
          "I was part of ILTM Cannes 2014, this is the place to be for the big events. This place is chic, great location and the place to be in...",
          "Not as you would expect from looking at the TV, if in the area have a look otherwise don't go out of your way.",
          "Visited here with a group of friends and we posed in front of this Palais. A few seconds of celeb status!!. Red carpet was still there, so it was wonderful to make a grand entrance!. Worth seeing all the celebrities during the Cannes Festival",
          "The Palais is a squared dirty concrete building. BUT the old town is beautiful and not at all crowded! Head towards the old city instead! You can park right at the Palais under ground, and walk from there.",
          "We visited Cannes for one day and visitd the Palais des Festivals et des Congres of Cannes. Worth the visit we discovered the pavement with hand-prints and the signatures of famous movie stars imprinted into the casts fitted into the ground. Just wonderful all the way round",
          "Across the road from JW Marriot, you might not get to see how big the structure is but when you get closer just a Lil away from the Louis Vuitton store you realise how massive it is. Upon entrance you are exposed to a large auditorium that grants access to different areas of the",
          "even if you are not a part of this festival is highly recommend to see this place ;) January is great time for visit ! less people , nice temperature and very sunny :P",
          "depends on your ship as you will have to tender in from the ship. We were on the Norwegian epic and they are well organised. Wheelchair lift down to the tender platform. Help onto the tender and off. We had a calm day so all went well. Get a map and walk to the castle museum.",
          "Everyone who visit cannes definitely go there to walk like a star in this place which is suitable also for walking by the sea!",
          "I have got to see the 68th Cannes Film Festival..... Amazing place....You may be lucky to see Hollywood stars moving around...",
          "When in Cannes you must do what all others do,so we visited \"Palais des festival et des congress\".It's a quite ugly building at the start of the \"Boulevard de la Croisette\". Here the annual film festival takes place. If you expected to see something grandiose you will be",
          "Cannes in general is a beautiful place. The beachfront is clean and the many pots of flowers along the walkway make the place welcoming. I would definitely come back in the very near future.",
          "There are cliche things you'll find yourself doing; taking your picture on the red carpet; putting your hands in the celebrity hand prints; sticking your head through a celebrity cut-out for a photo. But there are other things to do as well. There are a few kiosks where you can",
          "I wanted to see the Palais des Festival as I am a huge movie fan. I was gutted they had the main staircase cordoned off and you were not allowed anywhere near it. If ever there was a photo I wanted taken. There are large screens on the side showing new movies and a Cannes",
          "Very organized and information desk worked satisfactory. Large, so we could see everything. Sometimes sound volume was too loud. If people want to listen something just use headphones. Bathrooms was very clean. Also beverage and food ok",
          "This is a very beautiful city and during the Film Festival it is extremely busy, exciting and crowded! Very high end hotels, cars and shops...just like you would expect. We did see the red carpet and all the glitz of the festival but not really a fan! We found a great little",
          "Went to Cannes. It is truly a beautiful city. We really lucked out and the 68th film festival was going on which gave the city some excitement.",
          "Here during the Film Festival, the building always seems to be clean and tidy even though there are thousands of people passing through. The amenities are pretty good with my only gripe being that during this busy period there is only one, often congested, place to grab",
          "We could really say - something special - but nothing special. The palace is well known for its film festival and if you are passing Cannes it is worth a detour. But when you see that red carpet, make some photos, you better escape as soon as possible from that crowd.",
          "I was originally put off visiting Cannes after reading other reviews of the city during the Film Festival. I was pleasantly surprised. Didn't see any celebs but got to chat with some individuals involved in the industry while waiting for the train etc. It was interesting to see",
          "The place is just a building when it is not the festival time! But if you'd like to take pictures of the hand-casts of famous actors and actress or directors (Luc Besson is my favorite) you should visit. It is very close to the beach and easy to find. In order to feel the",
          "One big disappointment. Palais des Festivals appeared to be unremarkable concrete building. If I did not know that was the Palais des Festivals - would not pay any attention to it. It mostly repels but does not attract. Perhaps during the festival once decorated it is likely to",
          "It was lovely to visit the iconic place of Cannes, (I tried to imagine what it would be like to be there when all the stars hangout during the film festival). I was there for Mipim the UK property / investment annual event, which involved countries from around the world. It was",
          "It's a must see when visiting Cannes. While nothing spectacular in itself, it is fun to take pictures there and reminisce every time you see the movie stars during the film festival on TV on the same steps. You don't realize how close the structure is to the beach, it's on the",
          "Cannes in general was very beautiful. We spent a day there. This place however was a disappointment. Having heard so much about this place, I always imagined this to be a grandeur. Turned out to be a concrete modern architecture. Felt so much out of place considering the rest of",
          "This is right on the waterfront behind the yacht harbor. Probably billions of dollars of yachts here but our guide said the new, smart money keep their yachts in other European harbors to avoid huge French taxes. Across the road is the waterfront shopping district but bring a",
          "I really don't have much to say except we did not have the chance to go inside but took some fabulous photos outside and just imagined what it would be like during the film festival. Outside of the building on the sidewalk, you can seen some celebrity handprints with their",
          "Palais des Festivals is a catch -22 situation. Its worth going there only during the cannes festival and that will perhaps be the only time when a normal person won't be allowed near the red carpet Its a normal theater which is closed during the daytime and you can't even go",
          "This one looks much better on TV, it's just a huge ugly looking modern building that hosts the annual film festival of Cannes as well as a lot of other festivals&events. The red carpet on the stairs of the main entrance is usually there, so you can stand there and take a photo,",
          "Like other reviews have said, there is some renovations going on, but the red carpet is definitely rolled out and you can visualize all the celebrities during the festival; there are handprints in the cement and you can walk around and see who's they are. It was quite crowded on",
          "A 'must' see if you are in Cannes. Undergoing a bit of a refurb at the minute but great none the less. Have your photo taken on the 'Red Carpet' of the stars. Surrounding gardens very nivcely done with several cafes and bars nearby. The marina turns you green with envy if",
          "Beautiful. Only this time they were busy with renovations on the main stairs. But there are some side stairs for photo opportunities on the red carpet",
          "There is not really much to see besides the red carpet and many many tourists :) But it is a place to be in Cannes, to take a picture, do a pose and go explore the city :)",
          "The Palais des Festivals is a world-famous place, since both Cannes festivals take place there: the international film festival and the advertising festival (Cannes Lions). But I must say this place left me with a bad impression. Its tight atmosphere, with a low-ceilling and",
          "Every film enthusiast has a dream to visit Cannes where International Film Festival is aligned year on year and not to miss the Famous Red Carpet Walk up the stairs. Centrally located, this place in itself is a Celebrity Place on Earth. And being in Cannes, you feel proud to get",
          "Not a very attractive looking building. Not sure what to expect but it wasn't this!! It was good fun standing on the red carpet having our photo taken but hard to get a photo without lots of other tourists!! Shop is ok. Liked the handprints outside but a plaque saying who they",
          "Like most tourists visiting Cannes, we didn't miss out on getting our very own Red Carpet moment & photo shot to remember our visit. Lots of people taking photos there. Some even came prepared wearing elegant dresses & some even brought their own oscar award statues. Tip : there",
          "You cannot visit cannes without getting a staged photograph of yourself on the centres red carpet. Every A list to date has graced this carpet at some time in their career. Hosting Cannes film festival each year means a flurry of A Listers. I've been lucky enough to be",
          "If you are in Cannes and like the movies, you cannot not go to the Palais des Festivals. All others should stay clear - this is nothing but a convention hall / conference site (albeit with a red carpet on the steps) where business is conducted. For film lovers, however, this",
          "The whole building walls were covered in work-in-progress cripples, so very little could be seen. The entrance with the red carpet is nice to see but honestly nothing special.",
          "Worth a visit just to pose on the red carpeted stairs where all the stars stop for the paparazzi to take photos. Also worth looking at the handprints set in the pavement around the building. Sylvester Stallone has the biggest hand I've ever seen!",
          "Location Around 10-15 minutes walk from the railway station, clear to the port. There's nothing much in here, especially if you are visiting off season (not doing the Cannes Film Festival). There are lot of restaurants opposite to this place and a flee market.",
          "A red carpet on the stairs, it's says nothing at all, if you don't have any clue, the place is for the cannes film festival, you'll think you are in china town of cannes. yes..the imprinted hands of some actors....not interesting at all.can barely see their names",
          "Visit the best tourism office on the coast, then stroll around the Palais, putting yourself in the picture. Always lots going on here, even if you miss the Film Festival.",
          "People all want to see once the building inside, and perfect to find location. So ideally for business.",
          "We went there to see the Cannes Film Festival in May. My daughter had a pass so she was able to see some amazing movies and people, directors, etc. Unfortunately, My pass was limited but I was able to see the shorts in the Court Metrange at my leisure. It was fun to see the",
          "I was there at the Plais for the Cannes Lions Advertising Festival. This is huge place.The palais is a great place to host these kind of events. It has multiple seminar halls having two main ones called Grand Auditorium and the Debussy. Located in the beach side and the",
          "After a ridiculous 4 hour wait to leave the Independence of the Sea by Tender, due to a cock up, we found the Palais de Festivals a 10 minute walk from the quay. It's the large white building, halfway around the bay. Being a film buff, I couldn't wait to see where it all",
          "We were there on May 2014 during the Festival de Cannes. A lot of people, not much to do! Don't waste your time there just to see a red carpet.",
          "Good luck getting around this area during the film festival. Unless you have festival access or are trying to star spot then avoid this area in the afternoon as it is very congested both on foot and by car. Early morning is a much better time to scope out the area around the",
          "I am lucky enough to be covering the Cannes Film festival this year.But those ones with restricted or no access to the event should try to have a look at the surrounds of the busy Palais des Festivals anyway. Lots of people and good energy, some of them passionate about movies,",
          "As the Centre of any large events in cannes this is not really an attraction to rush to. Do your business inside then get out in the sun. Could be modernized, but that would be a huge project!",
          "I've spent hours at the Palais de Festivals at the Cannes Lions Advertising Festival attending seminars, awards ceremonies, workshops and exhibitions. It's incredibly well organised and the Cannes Lions always run very efficiently with tight security. The red carpet photo op",
          "If you have heard about the Cannes film festival, this place is good to visit once...the main theatre was closed when we visited(gearing up for the festival in May end).. but a nice photo op on the stairs, the Cannes red carpet.. good way to feel glamorous :) and just outside",
          "Travelled from Nice to Cannes (appro 6-7 euro one way 30 mins journey) by train which is convenient and faster (bus costs less 1-2 euro but takes over 2 hours) its a small town but the marina is worth the walk and nice to see a new place.",
          "Visited the casino and played some poker. I was there for about one and a half hours and was not offered a drink, not did I see a waitress. Very poor service indeed.",
          "If in Cannes, do not miss this site. Wether during the festival or not I think it is a great attraction to visit. After our little trip around the Cannes we stopped for a quick look around. Unless participant of the festival, I guess it is one of the things one visits to tick",
          "This is site of film festival and cool to do a quick stop here. Not too much to see if off season and I would recommedn to go and spen just an hour or two so you can say you were there. We focused on the out side and saw some of the awards step plaques. We were glad we stopped",
          "Transport around the French Riviera is brilliant. We took trips most days by local bus and by train. The local buses are 1.5 Euros for a single journey -- whether two stops or Nice airport to Cannes (one and a half hours). We also went to Ventimiglia on the Italian Riviera on a",
          "Simple arhitecture, old interior. I could not find anything sepcial at this place. I understand, that it is defferent during film festival, so probably shold be visited ONlY duringt this event. It has good view from the terrace to the marine bay.",
          "I don't think this is a suitable building to give fares... Sorry but thats how I feel... Its dark, narrow walking areas, to few elevators, and who wants to exhibit down in an basement? Points though for trying and for the lovely environment next to the ocean!",
          "This place is probably best viewed during the Cannes Festival. The rest of the time it is a large building with a lot of steps and you can imagine the glamorous actresses climbing all those stairs in high heels. Our kids have photos with cardboard celebs which are liberally",
          "A lovely place directly on the beach. Lots of shows take place there. We went to a french cabaret that was nice but kind of expensive. The place itself is elegant and chic.",
          "Not as big as what you expect, but it's part of what you have to see in Cannes. Very small stairs, should go at the back straight and forget the front of the building where all the tourist are.",
          "A must do in Cannes - to take a photo on the red carpet. The views from the park are spectacular and I highly recommend going, particularly in summer! Handily, the tourist information centre is just next to the Palais. There is a winding path of engraved stones, with handprints",
          "We sat at the front for this show which I highly recommend. This show has been running in Paris since 1952 and was in Cannes for three weeks so we just had to go. I thoroughly enjoyed it...fantastic girls...wonderful dancing and very sexy...",
          "This Mecca for movie buffs unfortunately only provides a photo op with most of the structure closed to tourists. Stop by, climb the steps a bit, take a picture and move on. A more permanent, thoughtful exhibition/museum on the history of the festival and or the movies themselves",
          "So you love to watch films and you also like red carpet and cinema stars. You like flashbulbs glitterati, limos with long legged Cleopatras. Then you have stepped in at the right place. This is awesomeness. This is where the glamour meets glitz and opulence meets opera. Don't",
          "Well, let's say that I was expecting much more. Worth a pic with the building, not more. The view is nice but not that unique in Cannes",
          "End of May, festival finished.. but nothing interesting to look at.. just people taking pics of themselves pretending to 'be'..",
          "It looks very ordinary when the festivities are over...but still beautifully situated within the Croisette.",
          "We sat outside the Palais watching the superyatch mooring, and the activity of the boat agents arriving to make sure the yatch owners and crew had all their requirements. We saw a few hopefull crew approaching with their portfolios to get a job on board. Eventually we had a",
          "And get some fun t-shirts from the gift shop. One of the main attractions in Cannes due to the major event The Cannes Film Festival. Hotel prices are crazy around the festival time but if you go just a few days before or after you will still catch the vibe.",
          "I felt like we got in an airplane heading back to the 80s. What is this and why does the film festival take place here? We couldn't understand. There is nothing to see here honestly, an old ugly building with a dingy red carpet and hand prints of no one still relevant including",

          "To filmmakers a trip to Cannes Film Festival is a yearly almost obligation. The chaos invades La Croisette and each year getting worst. I can't point worst experience of being in a seaside place to be as Cannes during the Festival, but why the city township and the Festival",
          "It's an average glass building on the Croisette. Nothing can be more anonymous than the way it is, even if I was there few weeks before the Festival fanfare.",
          "It's just a building with red carpet, Mommy! - That's what my kids told me when we stopped by the Festival Building for photo opportunity. Apparently, the kids are not impressed and had to admit so are the parents. The building doesn't look fancy without the glitter of the film",
          "This is a \"new\" building which contrasts with the french athmosphere of the place and the region itself. In fqact, it is ugly and has no charm at all",
          "If there is strange and ugly place in Cannes - it is Festival Palace - look like viallge ciniema house with forms of the buro building in the heart of the city. It is always busy around - youth makes some dances and gathering - so it makes the place a bit more lively, and of",
          "was here for Midem 2013. Its a convention hall. Not much else to be said about it, decent as far as convention halls go. Food over priced, so dont buy food there, bring bottled water and all should be ok!",
          "Venue handles crowds very well - efficient! thats pretty much all you can say about it. good facilities and seats are comfortable for sitting through presentations for hours.",
          "a bit old but still glamorous. it is nice to sit across from the palais during the film festival, have a glass of campaign and check out which starlets enter the theater. you do get the fill that the palais is from a bygone area, but then who cars.... it is cannes and it is",
          "Although it was not festival time, we visited the place for some photo op. The weather wasn't too great, so ended up not enjoying the walk as much as we liked, but still were happy to have visited the place.",
          "however it's just a building, but we can't look it and don't remember the red carpet and all the moovie stars that every year walk there to enter the the Moovie Festival of Cannes",
          "Well, you just have to get in line to get the photo of you on the famous red carpet to the Grand Auditorium. It is a must, whether you like it or not. Just do it!",
          "Very good walk. The palais des Festivals was not so glamorous as I thought. Lots of celebrities handprints was in reparation. But qf course I took the picture in the \"red carpet\".",
          "The place where the cannes film festival is done. Makes for a good red carpet picture. Celebrity handprints abound as well.",
          "It can be a bit dull as it does not have the charm and glitz when the Festival is over. The red carpet is still there so you can feel like a celebrity and get your picture taken going up there.",
          "The heart of the festival it was great to be in Cannes and around the Palais des Festivals with all the buzz. At other times it seems to go un-noticed.",
          "The film festival has been on my bucket list for a long time and I finally got to experience the frenzy of festival. I was amazed to see how the town embraces the swell of tourists and celebrities. We got some great photos of celebs in town for the celebration. You have to be",
          "Kind of fun to look at those movie stars hands/autograph on the street like Hollywood.",
          "Famous and beautiful. Right on the beach, it is amazing to see it.",
          "I was expecting so much more... they seem to just dress it up for the film festival, all the decor had been left to one side when we got there (3 days after the festival had finished), looked dull.",
          "Not quite as glam as when the stars are in town but interesting. All around the building are many stars names in the sidewalk (think LA) and fun spotting your faves.",
          "May 2012 we sailed on the NCL Epic from Barcelona, Naples, Rome, Pisa, Cannes, Marseilles, and back to Barcelona. The Port at Cannes is right in the downtown area. We rode tenders to the pier and spent the day walking around the town. The Cannes film festival was going on while",

          "Nice hike from the harbour / croisette - feels like a step back in time: an old church in a middle of relatively recent town dedicated to fashion and movies. The slope is quite tough but the view from the top is great. The church is quite but more historically significant than",
          "Walked up here from the cruise port. Great views from the vantage point it sits on and the interior is very nice and ornate.",
          "When going up to the castle we visited the church which was lovely. The views were really nice too I would recommend going up to see it",
          "Not a long walk from the city, nice historical place with good view on the city. Definitely worth the walk.",
          "We stopped briefly at this beautiful old church on our round Cannes tour. This atmospheric building is built on the top of a hill affording lovely views of Cannes.",
          "This is a beautiful church which is well worth a visit if you reached the top of la Souquet. The church is in old style , big and calm inside.",

          "Old European churches are always interesting to visit due to the large collections of religious art and the evidence of the faith and devotion of countless ordinary people. Notre Dame d\u2019Esperance is no exception, with approximately 500 years\u2019 worth of collection. To ensure you",
          "This is a beautiful view of the city, it is a little walk, with many steps, so it would not work for wheel chairs or strollers",
          "We climbed the hill and steep steps through Le Suquet neighborhood arriving at the castle only to find film crews prepping the courtyard and church for some event associated with the film festival. Church was closed to the public! Climbed the castle walls nearby for great views",
          "Nice cathedral, with superb views of the city from the area just outside. Nice garden area just below.",
          "Catch a wonderful view of Cannes from here. Most tourist I reckon will visit this place. If you belong the the religion, come here for Mass. Its 11.30am on Sundays.",
          "Perhaps the biggest attraction of Old Cannes, the Eglise Notre Dame d'Esperance also provides a vista of Cannes, its harbor, the Promenade of Croisette and its beaches. A very worthwhile place to visit.",
          "This church is on a hilltop in the old part of Cannes. We went here on \"le petit train\" which stops here for 10 minutes. The old church has a very musty smell on hot days. The views of old Cannes and the waterfront are very good though!",

Walking west past the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall), you\u2019ll find a combination of small roadways and steps, which will probably be easier than just the steps along the Rue de la Boucherie,",
          "This church is nice but the view from the hill which it sits on is the real draw. Stunning views of the beach and harbour can be had from the walls of this church. Enjoy the tiny shops on the easy walk up Le Suquet to get to this spot. The walk is not challenging at all.",
          "Right in the heart of the oldest part of Canes, way up high so not all the tourists and cruise ship people make it up that far. Well worth the hike, but if steep hills and stairs are tough for you, probably not something I\u2019d recommend. Lovely view of the bay and all of Cannes.",
          "We arrived in Cannes at around 6 pm after having a full day driving from Aix en Provence to Eze, Monaco and Nice. We parked in the Suquet Forville parking garage and walked into the town center. Paid 1.60 for about an hour's worth of parking. We visited on July 3 and it was",
          "You can see the church at the top of the old town hill from almost anywhere in Cannes. It's well worth the walk up the chill just for the great views however the church itself is also worth a visit. A beautiful, calm and serene place with real atmosphere. A place to think and",
          "It's a steep trek up through the old town to this rather sombre church with its landmark clock tower.",

          "The only special thing about this chapel is that it is situated atop of Cannes, offering an ideal view of the city. The chapel it self is nothing special, but as the sightseeing possibilities in Cannes is very limited (to put it nicely) you might as well pay it a visit for the",
          "Unfortunatley, when we have been there, around the church they were renovating the pavement. As to whatl we have seen, once finished we are of the opinion it will just make the place even nicer. Also, every time we were there the church itself was closed. The best though is the",

          "I walked up rue Saint Antoine to the top of this hill and the Eglise Notre Dame de l'Esperance. It was worth the visit for the scenic views of the bay of Cannes outside, and the sense of history inside.",
          "The church is at the top of a very steep hill bt well worth the climb. Compared to many European churches it is fairly plain but a very still and peaceful place to sit and contemplate. The nativity scene was one of the best I have seen with many moving pieces.",

          "We walked up the hill--long and tiring, but absolutely worth it. I thought this church was beautiful and the views were stunning! The church was free to get in. We paid a euro to light up the church but it didn't work.",
          "well worth the walk up the hill to visit the church and to see the views of Cannes. It is free to enter the church but for 1 Euro you can pay to light up the church which helps if you want to take some pictures.",
          "A long walk but great view. Took the stairs going up instead of the road. You can really save just by checking places to go on Trip Advisor. :)",
          "As the regular Franch churches from the time, inside they are not as great as the Italian ones. There are no great murals, no big organs, no artistic windows. This basilica is great only from outside. Moreover, there are great views to the modern Cannes, to La Croisette and the",
          "A short walk up to the hill and you have a great view!! It's great to spend some time and enjoy Cannes. It's also very close to restaurants and to the palais.",

          "We took a walk up through the steps of the old town and arrived at the church and museum atop the hill. Nice panoramic views of Cannes and the bay to the west. Not a terribly hard climb speaking as someone with slight mobility problems. Church was closed when we were there but",
          "If you are able to go up the hill, the church offers a magnificent view of Cannes. The church and grounds are lovely. The church also has extensive available literature for those less well-versed in Christianity or for those wanting to know more about their faith.",
          "Prepare for a walk up to the hill to pay a visit to an ancient structure and bring you refuge through its massive walls with its gifts of beautiful sight of the city of Cannes.",
          "After taking the steep walk up the streets of Le Suquet (Old Cannes), you will be rewarded with this old stone church and views of the sea and the Croissette that will take your breath away. Do not miss it!",
          "Of course it is situated on the top of the hill but you will be rewarded with the best view of Cannes when you get up there. Old church with a lot of history.",
          "Even if you do not normally visit churches or other religious monuments, you should visit this one...for the breath-taking view of the country-side. This location will give you a spanning view of the hillsides, city-scape and ocean-side. Gorgeous. If you drive up you only need",
          "Well worth a stroll up to the top of Le Suquet village to visit this quiet, magnificent church and the neighbouring fortress, plus stunning views across Cannes. The services are a little tired and the dwindling congregation is old.",
          "Did this at night and the views were great. Interesting architecture and good for walking on the walls.",
          "If you are visiting Cannes, take a stroll up to the medieval church with stunning views over Cannes. There is also a museum next to the church. The walk up is quite steep at some points, so maybe not suitable fro all pedestrians, but you can drive to the top, or take a taxi.",
          "you can wander throught he old town narrow lanes go via the steps or the sloping road, or catch the samll tourist train which stops here - the church is nice to visit and the views of the bay of cannes are excellent from here well worth the walk and not to taxing either",
          "This is part of Le Suquet on the hill in old town. Beautiful grounds surrounded by old city walls. There is a tower, but required an entry fee so we just walked around. Great views of Cannes and the water.",
          "We stopped here on the tourist train. On a beautiful sunny day, it over unparalleled views over the whole of Cannes. Watch out for the wind whipping your hair into your photos!",
          "It's a nice short walk through the old part of Cannes to get here. Outside the church we found a violin artist, many seagulls, some locals and tourists as well. Not very crowded, which is a nice thing. Once up there, you will probably have the best view in Cannes, overlooking",
          "Cannes has a beautifull sunset, and if you want to see the city, one of the best place is from Eglise Notre Dame. It is located above the city. And there is no entrance fee. And the unique thing is, to be there, the uphill street is among the houses with colorful doors. It is",
          "This beautiful church set on top of the hillock in the old historic quarter provides a great contrast against the magnificent views. One can visit the museum inside, although we did not do so. A musician was playing beautiful tones next to the church which we enjoyed along with",
          "nearly 500 years old and boasts the best view of cannes that exists. easily reachable via (many) stairs from la croisette, and you'll be rewarded. interior of the church is pretty big as village churches go, although nothing special, but the outside is beautiful, especially when",
          "Go inside this church to see the historical musical creche which is set up during the Christmas season. It is very large and old, but has been recently restored. There is a coin box to deposit one euro, which causes lights to come on, music to play, and all the animals and",
          "I like to go to different church in France to see the interior and be able to sit and pray to thank God for all my blessing,just love all the churches in France.",
          "We enjoyed this place, we dandered straight from the harbour up to the castle, we also wound around the streets and back down to the film theatre. We only walked around the castle and to be honest it was nice but it was mainly for the view, very picturesque.",
          "You can get some nice photos of the church from the outside but best of all is the ones you can get overlooking the harbour and la croisette. Inside it is very plain and boring.",
          "The Petite Train stopped here for 10 minutes. I'm glad it did, as the views were stunning. The smell of the church's candles and incense could be experienced from outside the door they were so strong. Make sure you walk the walls outside and there's a lovely spot just behind",
          "beautiful old church at the top of le suquet, you will have to be in good shape to reach it by walking, lots of stairs, if not we saw a little train cart that people rode up to the top, great view of the harbor.",

          "We visited after business hours so we did not go into the church, but we enjoyed the fantastic views over Cannes and the bay.",
          "We walked up the hill through Le Suquet to reach Eglise Notre Dame d'Esperance. What a setting overlooking the city of Cannes. The views of the city and the Mediterranean sea were breathtaking! You can go in the church which was so pretty and very peaceful.",

          "Considered the CENTRE of Cannes... This nice place is where you can get the best panoramic views of the whole city... And where you can get the best photos",
          "Visited this week but did not go in. Its a majestic beautiful building. I have been in before and its very decadent. I do not take photos inside religious buildings as I find it disrespectful. Very tranquil and peaceful. Photographs beautifully outside. Light a candle to",

          "If you have a few free hours make sure you walk La Suquet be sure to make it to the top. Here you\u2019ll find a beautiful Church with a clock tower and a stunning panorama view of the city and Le Vieux Port. Just keep up La Suquet and follow the signs to \u201cPanorama.\u201d",
          "The church was built between 1521 and 1627 and is the oldest church in Cannes. There is an interesting side chapel dedicated to the community of fishermen and their families with model fishing boats and intricate carvings. The magnificent nativity scene which, for 1 Euro will",
          "Eglise Notre-Dame de l'Esp\u00e9rance is definitely worth visiting. I would say number one if you're a catholic and want to give thanks to God or pray. The church is built on a hill so from the top you have an amazing panorama of Cannes and sea. Construction started in year 1521. The",
          "The church was celebrating Mass when I was there, so I could not enter. However, the view from the Church surrounds is wonderful - overlooking Cannes and the sea. There is effort required to climb the stairs to the church, but it is well worth it.",
          "We visited here twice withing a week: the first time was by ascent of Escalier de la Tour passing the Musee de la Castre - which was quite hard going following our walk around Ile Ste Marguerite an hour or two earlier. The second time was by the 'Little Train' which climbs up",
          "What makes this attraction is the view of Cannes from the grounds of the church. The church was not open when we visited, so I cannot speak to what is inside. It is a picturesque area to view and rest up for the descent back to town!",
          "The views were great from up there, recommend highly. Behind the historic and old church was also an art museum and so beautiful park with views to sea. Climbing up to hill was gorgeus because of all the beautiful flowers and buildings, for example very large bougainvillea which",
          "Situated in the place de la Castre the church is beautiful from that medieval era. Around the curch you will find a very nice spot to take nice pictures to the centre. Then go down again through the narrow streets with traditional shops.",

          "Part of our tour - this church is a landmark located in the old section of Cannes. It sits on top of a hill that overlooks the town and offers the best panoramic views of Cannes. Definitely worth the trip; the church was very nice inside and you can buy a candle to lite if you",
          "Top of Cannes to enjoy beautiful view of Cannes. Port, beach, La Croisette and all neighborhoods can be seen from here. It easy to reach. Just a little walk upwards. But it totally worth it. Make sure that the weather is clean.",
          "There was a wedding just leaving when I arrived...and seeing all the happy souls, filled with hope...well, it was perfect!",
          "We walked from our cruise ship to the top of this hill and the Eglise Notre Dame. It was worth the visit for the views and the sense of history inside. This is a great example of the way ancestors protected their cities and mixed in their faith, all in one location."

        "wiki": "Cannes (; French: [kan]; Occitan: Canas) is a city located on the French Riviera. It is a commune located in the Alpes-Maritimes department, and host city of the annual Cannes Film Festival, Midem, and Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. The city is known for its association with the rich and famous, its luxury hotels and restaurants, and for several conferences. On 3 November 2011 it hosted the 2011 G20 summit.\n\n\n== History ==\nBy the 2nd century BC, the Ligurian Oxybii established a settlement here known as Aegitna (Ancient Greek: \u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bd\u03b1). Historians are unsure what the name means. The area was a fishing village used as a port of call between the L\u00e9rins Islands.\n\nIn 154 BC, it became the scene of violent but quick conflict between the troops of Quintus Opimius and the Oxybii.In the 10th century, the town was known as Canua. The name may derive from \"canna\", a reed. Canua was probably the site of a small Ligurian port, and later a Roman outpost on Le Suquet hill, suggested by Roman tombs discovered here. Le Suquet housed an 11th-century tower, which overlooked swamps where the city now stands. Most of the ancient activity, especially protection, was on the L\u00e9rins Islands, and the history of Cannes is closely tied to the history of the islands.\nAn attack by the Saracens in 891, who remained until the end of the 10th century, devastated the country around Canua. The insecurity of the L\u00e9rins islands forced the monks to settle on the mainland, at the Suquet. Construction of a castle in 1035 fortified the city by then known as Cannes, and at the end of the 11th century construction was started on two towers on the L\u00e9rins islands. One took a century to build.\nAround 1530, Cannes detached from the monks who had controlled the city for hundreds of years and became independent.\nDuring the 18th century, both the Spanish and British tried to gain control of the L\u00e9rins Islands but were chased away by the French. The islands were later controlled by many, such as Jean-Honor\u00e9 Alziary and the Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus. They had many different purposes: at the end of the 19th century, one served as hospital for soldiers wounded in the Crimean War.\nHenry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux bought land at the Croix des Gardes and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise. His work to improve living conditions attracted the English aristocracy, who also built winter residences.\nAt the end of the 19th century, several railways were completed, which prompted the arrival of streetcars. In Cannes, projects such as the Boulevard Carnot and the rue d'Antibes were carried out. After the closure of the Casino des Fleurs (h\u00f4tel Gallia), a luxury establishment was built for the rich winter clientele, the Casino Municipal next to the pier Albert-Edouard. This casino was demolished and replaced by the new Palace in 1979.\nIn the 20th century, new luxury hotels such as the Carlton, Majestic, Martinez, and JW Marriott Cannes were built. The city was modernised with a sports centre, a post office, and schools. There were fewer British and German tourists after the First World War, but more Americans. Winter tourism gave way to summer tourism, and the summer casino at the Palm Beach was constructed.\nThe city council had the idea of starting an international film festival shortly before World War II. The first opened on 20 September 1946, held in the Casino Municipal.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nCannes has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa) and the city enjoys 11 hours of sunshine per day during summer (July), while in winter (December to February) the weather is mild. Both seasons see a relatively low rainfall and most rain occurs during October and November, when 110 mm (4.3 in) falls.\nCannes summers are long and warm, with summer daytime temperatures regularly hitting 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), while average temperatures are about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Temperatures remain high from June to September, the busiest time of the year.\nMean temperatures drop below 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) for only three months of the year (December to February). The spring and autumn are also warm, although more suited to those who prefer slightly cooler weather.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nThe Promenade de la Croisette is the waterfront avenue with palm trees. La Croisette is known for picturesque beaches, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, boutiques and luxury hotels. Le Suquet, the old town, provides a good view of La Croisette. The fortified tower and Chapel of St Anne house the Mus\u00e9e de la Castre. A distinctive building in Cannes is the Russian Orthodox church.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\n\n=== Villas ===\nCannes of the 19th century can still be seen in its grand villas, built to reflect the wealth and standing of their owners and inspired by anything from medieval castles to Roman villas. They are not open to the public. Lord Brougham's Italianate Villa El\u00e9onore Louise (one of the first in Cannes) was built between 1835 and 1839. Also known as the Quartier des Anglais, this is the oldest residential area in Cannes. Another landmark is the Villa Fi\u00e9sole (known today as the Villa Domergue) designed by Jean-Gabriel Domergue in the style of Fiesole, near Florence, which may be visited on appointment.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite ===\n\nIt took the Man in the Iron Mask 11 years to leave the tiny, forested St Marguerite Island. The mysterious individual was believed to be of noble blood, but his identity has never been proven. His cell can be visited in the Fort of St Marguerite, now renamed the Mus\u00e9e de la Mer (Museum of the Sea). This museum also houses discoveries from shipwrecks off the island, including Roman (1st century BC) and Saracen (10th century AD) ceramics.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Saint-Honorat ===\n\nCistercian monks are the only inhabitants of the smaller, southern St Honorat Island. Monks have inhabited the island since AD 410 and, at the height of their powers, owned Cannes, Mougins, and Vallauris. Medieval vestiges remain in the stark church, which is open to the public, and in the ruins of the 11th-century monastery on the sea shore. The monks inhabit the L\u00e9rins Abbey and divide their time between prayer and producing red and white wines.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire de Provence houses artifacts from prehistoric to present, in an 18th-century mansion. The Mus\u00e9e de la Castre has objects from the Pacific Atolls, Peruvian relics and Mayan pottery. Other venues include the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, Mus\u00e9e de la Mer, Mus\u00e9e de la Photographie and Mus\u00e9e International de la Parfumerie.\n\n\n=== Theatre and music ===\nCannes is not renowned for traditional theatre.

In addition, Cannes hosts other major annual events such as the MIPIM, MIPTV, MIDEM, Cannes Lions, and the NRJ Music Awards.

The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. It borders Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast, Switzerland, Monaco, and Italy to the east, and Andorra and Spain to the south. The overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. The country's 18 integral regions (five of which are situated overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 square kilometres (248,573 sq mi) and a total population of 67.07 million (as of May 2020). France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban areas include Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lille and Nice. France, including its overseas territories, has the most time zones of any country, with a total of 12.\nDuring the Iron Age, what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls, a collection of Celtic tribes. The area was annexed by Rome in 51 BC, developing a distinct Gallo-Roman culture that laid the foundation of the French language. The Germanic Franks arrived in 476 and formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia becoming the Kingdom of France in 987. Under King Philip Augustus, France emerged as a major European power in the Middle Ages. During the Renaissance, French culture flourished and a global colonial empire was established, which by the 20th century would become the second largest in the world. The 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots). France became Europe's dominant cultural, political, and military power in the 17th century under Louis XIV. In the late 18th century, the French Revolution overthrew the absolute monarchy, establishing one of modern history's earliest republics and drafting the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day.\nIn the 19th century, Napoleon took power and established the First French Empire. His subsequent Napoleonic Wars (1803\u201315) shaped the course of European and world history. Following the collapse of the Empire, France endured a tumultuous succession of governments culminating with the establishment of the French Third Republic in 1870. France was a major participant in World War I, from which it emerged victorious, and was one of the Allies in World War II, but came under occupation by the Axis powers in 1940. Following liberation in 1944, a Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War. The Fifth Republic, led by Charles de Gaulle, was formed in 1958 and remains today. Algeria and nearly all other colonies became independent in the 1960s, with most retaining close economic and military connections with France.\nFrance retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts the world's fifth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the leading tourist destination, receiving over 89 million foreign visitors in 2018. France is a developed country with the world's seventh-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the tenth-largest by PPP. In terms of aggregate household wealth, it ranks fourth in the world. France performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, and human development. It is considered a great power in global affairs, being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the Eurozone, and a member of the Group of 7, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and La Francophonie.\n\n\n== Etymology and pronunciation ==\n\nOriginally applied to the whole Frankish Empire, the name France comes from the Latin Francia, or \"country of the Franks\". Modern France is still named today Francia in Italian and Spanish, while Frankreich in German, Frankrijk in Dutch and Frankrike in Swedish all mean \"Land/realm of the Franks\".\nThere are various theories as to the origin of the name Frank. Following the precedents of Edward Gibbon and Jacob Grimm, the name of the Franks has been linked with the word frank (free) in English. It has been suggested that the meaning of \"free\" was adopted because, after the conquest of Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation. Another theory is that it is derived from the Proto-Germanic word *frankon, which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a francisca. However, it has been determined that these weapons were named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around.In English, 'France' is pronounced  FRANSS in American English and  FRAHNSS or  FRANSS in British English. The pronunciation with  is mostly confined to accents with the trap-bath split such as Received Pronunciation, though it can be also heard in some other dialects such as Cardiff English, in which  is in free variation with .\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory (before the 6th century BC) ===\n\nThe oldest traces of human life in what is now France date from approximately 1.8 million years ago. Over the ensuing millennia, Humans were confronted by a harsh and variable climate, marked by several glacial eras.\nEarly hominids led a nomadic hunter-gatherer life. France has a large number of decorated caves from the upper Palaeolithic era, including one of the most famous and best preserved, Lascaux (approximately 18,000 BC). At the end of the last glacial period (10,000 BC), the climate became milder; from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the Neolithic era and its inhabitants became sedentary.\nAfter strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia, metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium, initially working gold, copper and bronze, and later iron. France has numerous megalithic sites from the Neolithic period, including the exceptionally dense Carnac stones site (approximately 3,300 BC).\n\n\n=== Antiquity (6th century BC\u20135th century AD) ===\n\nIn 600 BC, Ionian Greeks from Phocaea founded the colony of Massalia (present-day Marseille), on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This makes it France's oldest city. At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated parts of eastern and northern France, gradually spreading through the rest of the country between the 5th and 3rd century BC.\n\nThe concept of Gaul emerged during this period, corresponding to the territories of Celtic settlement ranging between the Rhine, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean. The borders of modern France roughly correspond to ancient Gaul, which was inhabited by Celtic Gauls. Gaul was then a prosperous country, of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to Greek and Roman cultural and economic influences.\nAround 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain Brennus and his troops made their way to Italy through the Alps, defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Allia, and besieged and ransomed Rome. The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a formal peace treaty with Rome. But the Romans and the Gauls would remain adversaries for the next centuries, and the Gauls would continue to be a threat in Italy.Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region Provincia Nostra (\"Our Province\"), which over time evolved into the name Provence in French. Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix in 52 BC. According to Plutarch and the writings of scholar Brendan Woods, the Gallic Wars resulted in 800 conquered cities, 300 subdued tribes, one million men sold into slavery, and another three million dead in battle.Gaul was divided by Augustus into Roman provinces. Many cities were founded during the Gallo-Roman period, including Lugdunum (present-day Lyon), which is considered the capital of the Gauls. These cities were built in traditional Roman style, with a forum, a theatre, a circus, an amphitheatre and thermal baths. The Gauls mixed with Roman settlers and eventually adopted Roman culture and Roman speech (Latin, from which the French language evolved). The Roman polytheism merged with the Gallic paganism into the same syncretism.\nFrom the 250s to the 280s AD, Roman Gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians. Nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul. In 312, Emperor Constantin I converted to Christianity. Subsequently, Christians, who had been persecuted until then, increased rapidly across the entire Roman Empire. But, from the beginning of the 5th century, the Barbarian Invasions resumed. Teutonic tribes invaded the region from present-day Germany, the Visigoths settling in the southwest, the Burgundians along the Rhine River Valley, and the Franks (from whom the French take their name) in the north.\n\n\n=== Early Middle Ages (5th\u201310th century) ===\n\nAt the end of the Antiquity period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory, known as the Kingdom of Syagrius. Simultaneously, Celtic Britons, fleeing the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, settled the western part of Armorica. As a result, the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany, Celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region.\nThe first leader to make himself king of all the Franks was Clovis I, who began his reign in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors of the province in 486. Clovis claimed that he would be baptized a Christian in the event of his victory against the Visigoths, which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis regained the southwest from the Visigoths, was baptized in 508, and made himself master of what is now western Germany.\nClovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than Arianism; thus France was given the title \"Eldest daughter of the Church\" (French: La fille a\u00een\u00e9e de l'\u00c9glise) by the papacy, and French kings would be called \"the Most Christian Kings of France\" (Rex Christianissimus).\n\nThe Franks embraced the Christian Gallo-Roman culture and ancient Gaul was eventually renamed Francia (\"Land of the Franks\"). The Germanic Franks adopted Romanic languages, except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where Germanic languages emerged. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from Clovis's: Paris, Orl\u00e9ans, Soissons, and Rheims. The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household). One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Islamic invasion of Gaul at the Battle of Tours (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms. His son, Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the Carolingian dynasty. Pepin's son, Charlemagne, reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across Western and Central Europe.\nProclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III and thus establishing in earnest the French Government's longtime historical association with the Catholic Church, Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son, Louis I (Emperor 814\u2013840), kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive his death. In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, the empire was divided between Louis' three sons, with East Francia going to Louis the German, Middle Francia to Lothair I, and West Francia to Charles the Bald. West Francia approximated the area occupied by, and was the precursor to, modern France.During the 9th and 10th centuries, continually threatened by Viking invasions, France became a very decentralized state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. Thus was established feudalism in France. Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king. For example, after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror added \"King of England\" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France, creating recurring tensions.\n\n\n=== High and Late Middle Ages (10th\u201315th century) ===\n\nThe Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet, Duke of France and Count of Paris, was crowned King of the Franks. His descendants\u2014the Capetians, the House of Valois, and the House of Bourbon\u2014progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the Kingdom of France, which was fully declared in 1190 by Philip II of France (Philippe Auguste). Later kings would expand their  directly-possessed  domaine royal  to cover over half of modern continental France by the 15th century, including most of the north, centre and west of France. During this process, the royal authority became more and more assertive, centered on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility, clergy, and commoners.\nThe French nobility played a prominent role in most Crusades to restore Christian access to the Holy Land. French knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as Franj caring little whether they really came from France. The French Crusaders also imported the French language into the Levant, making French the base of the lingua franca (litt. \"Frankish language\") of the Crusader states. French knights also made up the majority in both the Hospital and the Temple orders. The latter, in particular, held numerous properties throughout France and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the French crown, until Philip IV annihilated the order in 1307. The Albigensian Crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical Cathars in the southwestern area of modern-day France. In the end, the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomous County of Toulouse was annexed into the crown lands of France.From the 11th century, the House of Plantagenet, the rulers of the County of Anjou, succeeded in establishing its dominion over the surrounding provinces of Maine and Touraine, then progressively built an \"empire\" that spanned from England to the Pyrenees and covering half of modern France. Tensions between the kingdom of France and the Plantagenet empire would last a hundred years, until Philip II of France conquered, between 1202 and 1214 most of the continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and Aquitaine to the Plantagenets. Following the Battle of Bouvines, the Angevin court retreated to England, but persistent Capetian\u2013Plantagenet rivalry would pave the way for another conflict, the Hundred Years' War.\nCharles IV the Fair died without an heir in 1328. Under the rules of the Salic law the crown of France could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line. Accordingly, the crown passed to Philip of Valois, a cousin of Charles, rather than through the female line to Charles' nephew, Edward of Plantagenet, who would soon become Edward III of England. During the reign of Philip of Valois, the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power. Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England in 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, and England and France went to war in what would become known as the Hundred Years' War. The exact boundaries changed greatly with time, but French landholdings of the English Kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders, such as Joan of Arc and La Hire, strong French counterattacks won back most English continental territories. Like the rest of Europe, France was struck by the Black Death; half of the 17 million population of France died.\n\n\n=== Early modern period (15th century\u20131789) ===\nMain articles: French Renaissance (c. 1400\u2013c. 1650), Early modern France (1500\u20131789), French Wars of Religion (1562\u20131598) and Ancien R\u00e9gime (c. 1400\u20131792)\nThe French Renaissance saw a spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the French language, which would become the official language of France and the language of Europe's aristocracy. It also saw a long set of wars, known as the Italian Wars, between France and the House of Habsburg. French explorers, such as Jacques Cartier or Samuel de Champlain, claimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of the First French colonial empire. The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572. The Wars of Religion were ended by Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots. Spanish troops, the terror of Western Europe, assisted the Catholic side during the Wars of Religion in 1589\u20131594, and invaded northern France in 1597; after some skirmishing in the 1620s and 1630s, Spain and France returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659. The war cost France 300,000 casualties.Under Louis XIII, the energetic Cardinal Richelieu promoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced the royal power by disarming domestic power holders in the 1620s. He systematically destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private violence (dueling, carrying weapons, and maintaining private army). By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu established \"the royal monopoly of force\" as the doctrine. During Louis XIV's minority and the regency of Queen Anne and Cardinal Mazarin, a period of trouble known as the Fronde occurred in France. This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal absolute power in France.\n\nThe monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV. By turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles, Louis XIV's personal power became unchallenged. Remembered for his numerous wars, he made France the leading European power. France became the most populous country in Europe and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century. France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Louis XIV also revoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile.\nUnder Louis XV, Louis XIV's great-grandson, France lost New France and most of its Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War (1756\u201363). Its European territory kept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such as Lorraine (1766) and Corsica (1770). An unpopular king, Louis XV's weak rule, his ill-advised financial, political and military decisions \u2013 as well as the debauchery of his court\u2013 discredited the monarchy, which arguably paved the way for the French Revolution 15 years after his death.Louis XVI, Louis XV's grandson, actively supported the Americans, who were seeking their independence from Great Britain (realised in the Treaty of Paris (1783)). The financial crisis aggravated by France's involvement in the American Revolutionary War was one of many contributing factors to the French Revolution. Much of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the discovery of oxygen (1778) and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers (1783), were achieved by French scientists. French explorers, such as Bougainville and Lap\u00e9rouse, took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe. The Enlightenment philosophy, in which reason is advocated as the primary source for legitimacy and authority, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and helped pave the way for the French Revolution.\n\n\n=== Revolutionary France (1789\u20131799) ===\n\nFacing financial troubles, King Louis XVI summoned the Estates-General (gathering the three Estates of the realm) in May 1789 to propose solutions to his government. As it came to an impasse, the representatives of the Third Estate formed into a National Assembly, signalling the outbreak of the French Revolution. Fearing that the king would suppress the newly created National Assembly, insurgents stormed the Bastille on 14 July 1789, a date which would become France's National Day.\nIn early August 1789, the National Constituent Assembly abolished the privileges of the nobility such as personal serfdom and exclusive hunting rights.\nThrough the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (27 August 1789) France established fundamental rights for men. The Declaration affirms \"the natural and imprescriptible rights of man\" to \"liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression\". Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth.\nIn November 1789, the Assembly decided to nationalize and sell all property of the Roman Catholic Church which had been the largest landowner in the country. In July 1790, a Civil Constitution of the Clergy reorganized the French Catholic Church, cancelling the authority of the Church to levy taxes, et cetera. This fueled much discontent in parts of France, which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later. While King Louis XVI still enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrous flight to Varennes (June 1791) seemed to justify rumors he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. His credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility.\nIn August 1791, the Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia in the Declaration of Pillnitz threatened revolutionary France to intervene by force of arms to restore the French absolute monarchy. In September 1791, the National Constituent Assembly forced King Louis XVI to accept the French Constitution of 1791, thus turning the French absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy. In the newly established Legislative Assembly (October 1791), enmity developed and deepened between a group, later called the 'Girondins', who favored war with Austria and Prussia, and a group later called 'Montagnards' or 'Jacobins', who opposed such a war. A majority in the Assembly in 1792 however saw a war with Austria and Prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government, and thought that France would win a war against those gathered monarchies. On 20 April 1792, therefore, they declared war on Austria.\n\nOn 10 August 1792, an angry crowd threatened the palace of King Louis XVI, who took refuge in the Legislative Assembly.\nA Prussian army invaded France later in August 1792.\nIn early September, Parisians, infuriated by the Prussian army capturing Verdun and counter-revolutionary uprisings in the west of France, murdered between 1,000 and 1,500 prisoners by raiding the Parisian prisons. The Assembly and the Paris city council seemed unable to stop that bloodshed. The National Convention, chosen in the first elections under male universal suffrage, on 20 September 1792 succeeded the Legislative Assembly and on 21 September abolished the monarchy by proclaiming the French First Republic.\nEx-King Louis XVI was convicted of treason and guillotined in January 1793.\nFrance had declared war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic in November 1792 and did the same on Spain in March 1793; in the spring of 1793, Austria and Prussia invaded France; in March, France created a \"sister republic\" in the \"Republic of Mainz\".\nAlso in March 1793, the civil war of the Vend\u00e9e against Paris started, evoked by both the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790 and the nationwide army conscription early 1793; elsewhere in France rebellion was brewing too.\nA factionalist feud in the National Convention, smoldering ever since October 1791, came to a climax with the group of the 'Girondins' on 2 June 1793 being forced to resign and leave the Convention.\nThe counter-revolution, begun in March 1793 in the Vend\u00e9e, by July had spread to Brittany, Normandy, Bordeaux, Marseilles, Toulon, and Lyon. Paris' Convention government between October and December 1793 with brutal measures managed to subdue most internal uprisings, at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. Some historians consider the civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of possibly 450,000 lives. By the end of 1793 the allies had been driven from France.\nFrance in February 1794 abolished slavery in its American colonies, but would reintroduce it later.\nPolitical disagreements and enmity in the National Convention between October 1793 and July 1794 reached unprecedented levels, leading to dozens of Convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined.\nMeanwhile, France's external wars in 1794 were going prosperous, for example in Belgium.\nIn 1795, the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of (Catholic) religion and fair distribution of food.\nUntil 1799, politicians, apart from inventing a new parliamentary system (the 'Directory'), busied themselves with dissuading the people from Catholicism and from royalism.\n\n\n=== Napoleon and 19th century (1799\u20131914) ===\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799 becoming First Consul and later Emperor of the French Empire (1804\u20131814; 1815). As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's Empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the battles of Jena-Auerstadt or Austerlitz. Members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms. These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the Metric system, the Napoleonic Code and the Declaration of the Rights of Man. In June 1812, Napoleon attacked Russia, reaching Moscow. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian attacks, and finally winter. After the catastrophic Russian campaign, and the ensuing uprising of European monarchies against his rule, Napoleon was defeated and the Bourbon monarchy restored. About a million Frenchmen died during the Napoleonic Wars. After his brief return from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, the monarchy was re-established (1815\u20131830), with new constitutional limitations.\nThe discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830, which established the constitutional July Monarchy. In that year, French troops conquered Algeria, establishing the first colonial presence in Africa since Napoleon's abortive invasion of Egypt in 1798. In 1848 general unrest led to the February Revolution and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and introduction of male universal suffrage, which were briefly enacted during the French Revolution, were re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, the president of the French Republic, Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the second Empire, as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in Crimea, in Mexico and Italy which resulted in the annexation of the duchy of Savoy and the county of Nice, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the Third Republic. By 1875, the French conquest of Algeria was complete and approximately 825,000 Algerians were killed as a result.\n\nFrance had colonial possessions, in various forms, since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries, its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and became the second largest in the world behind the British Empire. Including metropolitan France, the total area of land under French sovereignty almost reached 13 million square kilometers in the 1920s and 1930s, 8.6% of the world's land. Known as the Belle \u00c9poque, the turn of the century was a period characterized by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In 1905, state secularism was officially established.\n\n\n=== Contemporary period (1914\u2013present) ===\n\nFrance was a member of the Triple Entente when World War I broke out. A small part of Northern France was occupied, but France and its allies emerged victorious against the Central Powers at a tremendous human and material cost. World War I left 1.4 million French soldiers dead, 4% of its population. Between 27 and 30% of soldiers conscripted from 1912 to 1915 were killed. The interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the Popular Front government (annual leave, eight-hour workdays, women in government).\nIn 1940, France was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany and Italy. Metropolitan France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north, an Italian occupation zone in the south-east and Vichy France, a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany, in the south, while Free France, the government-in-exile led by Charles de Gaulle, was set up in London. From 1942 to 1944, about 160,000 French citizens, including around 75,000 Jews, were deported to death camps and concentration camps in Germany and occupied Poland. In September 1943, Corsica was the first French metropolitan territory to liberate itself from the Axis. On 6 June 1944, the Allies invaded Normandy and in August they invaded Provence. Over the following year the Allies and the French Resistance emerged victorious over the Axis powers and French sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, aimed to continue to wage war against Germany and to purge collaborators from office. It also made several important reforms (suffrage extended to women, creation of a social security system).\n\nThe GPRF laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the Fourth Republic, which saw spectacular economic growth (les Trente Glorieuses). France was one of the founding members of NATO (1949). France attempted to regain control of French Indochina but was defeated by the Viet Minh in 1954 at the climactic Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Only months later, France faced another anti-colonialist conflict in Algeria. The systematic torture and repression, as well as the extrajudicial killings that were perpetrated to keep control of Algeria, then considered as an integral part of France and home to over one million European settlers, wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war.In 1958, the weak and unstable Fourth Republic gave way to the Fifth Republic, which included a strengthened Presidency. In the latter role, Charles de Gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the Algerian War. The war was concluded with the \u00c9vian Accords in 1962 that led to Algerian independence. The Algerian independence came at a high price; the large toll on the Algerian population. It resulted in half million to a million deaths and over 2 million internally displaced Algerians. A vestige of the colonial empire are the French overseas departments and territories.\n\nIn the context of the Cold War, de Gaulle pursued a policy of \"national independence\" towards the Western and Eastern blocs. To this end, he withdrew from NATO's military integrated command (while remaining in the NATO alliance itself), launched a nuclear development programme, and made France the fourth nuclear power. He restored cordial Franco-German relations to create a European counterweight between the American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a supranational Europe, favouring a Europe of sovereign nations. In the wake of the series of worldwide protests of 1968, the revolt of May 1968 had an enormous social impact. In France, it is considered to be the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (as the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before) it announced a split between the French people and de Gaulle who resigned shortly after.\nIn the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed economies in the world, but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational European Union, notably by signing the Maastricht Treaty (which created the European Union) in 1992, establishing the Eurozone in 1999, and signing the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. France has also gradually but fully reintegrated into NATO and has since participated in most NATO sponsored wars.\n\nSince the 19th century France has received many immigrants. These have been mostly male foreign workers from European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed. During the 1970s France faced economic crisis and allowed new immigrants (mostly from the Maghreb) to permanently settle in France with their families and to acquire French citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims (especially in the larger cities) living in subsidized public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates. Simultaneously France renounced the assimilation of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to French traditional values and cultural norms. They were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely to integrate.Since the 1995 Paris M\u00e9tro and RER bombings, France has been sporadically targeted by Islamist organisations, notably the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015 which provoked the largest public rallies in French history, gathering 4.4 million people, the November 2015 Paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II, and the deadliest in the European Union since the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the 2016 Nice truck attack, which caused 87 deaths during Bastille Day celebrations. Op\u00e9ration Chammal, France's military efforts to contain ISIS, killed over 1,000 ISIS troops between 2014 and 2015.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location and borders ===\n\nThe vast majority of France's territory and population is situated in Western Europe and is called Metropolitan France, to distinguish it from the country's various overseas polities. It is bordered by the Northern Sea in the north, the English Channel in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and Andorra and Spain in the south and southwest. With the exception of the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to as l'Hexagone (\"The Hexagon\"). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is Corsica. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes 41\u00b0 and 51\u00b0 N, and longitudes 6\u00b0 W and 10\u00b0 E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone. Its continental part covers about 1000 km from north to south and from east to west.\nFrance has several overseas regions across the world, which are organized as follows:\n\nIn South America: French Guiana.\nIn the Atlantic Ocean: Saint Pierre and Miquelon and, in the Antilles: Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Martin and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy.\nIn the Pacific Ocean: French Polynesia, the special collectivity of New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna and Clipperton Island.\nIn the Indian Ocean: R\u00e9union island, Mayotte, Kerguelen Islands, Crozet Islands, St. Paul and Amsterdam islands, and the Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean\nIn the Antarctic: Ad\u00e9lie Land.France has land borders with Brazil and Suriname via French Guiana and with the Kingdom of the Netherlands through the French portion of Saint Martin.\nMetropolitan France covers 551,500 square kilometres (212,935 sq mi), the largest among European Union members. France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding Ad\u00e9lie Land), is 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi), 0.45% of the total land area on Earth. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the Alps in the southeast, the Massif Central in the south central and Pyrenees in the southwest.\nDue to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered across the planet, France possesses the second-largest Exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world, covering 11,035,000 km2 (4,260,000 mi2), just behind the EEZ of the United States, which covers 11,351,000 km2 (4,383,000 mi2), but ahead of the EEZ of Australia, which covers 8,148,250 km2 (4,111,312 mi2). Its EEZ covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world.\n\n\n=== Geology, topography and hydrography ===\n\nMetropolitan France has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, the Morvan, the Vosges and Ardennes ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rh\u00f4ne valley, allow easy communications. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft) above sea level, Mont Blanc, located in the Alps on the French and Italian border, is the highest point in Western Europe. Although 60% of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks, these risks remain moderate.\n\nThe coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the French Riviera, coastal cliffs such as the C\u00f4te d'Alb\u00e2tre, and wide sandy plains in the Languedoc. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, the Rh\u00f4ne and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rh\u00f4ne divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. The Garonne meets the Dordogne just after Bordeaux, forming the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) empties into the Atlantic Ocean. Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the north-eastern borders. France has 11 million square kilometres (4.2\u00d710^6 sq mi) of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe French metropolitan territory is relatively large, so the climate is not uniform, giving rise to the following climate nuances:\n\u2022 The hot-summer mediterranean climate (Csa) is found along the Gulf of Lion. Summers are hot and dry, while winters are mild and wet. Cities affected by this climate: Arles, Avignon, Fr\u00e9jus, Hy\u00e8res, Marseille, Menton, Montpellier, Nice, Perpignan, Toulon.\n\u2022 The warm-summer mediterranean climate (Csb) is found in the northern part of Brittany. Summers are warm and dry, while winters are cool and wet. Cities affected by this climate: Belle-\u00cele-en-Mer, Saint-Brieuc.  \n\u2022 The humid subtropical climate (Cfa) is found in the Garonne and Rh\u00f4ne's inland plains. Summers are hot and wet, while winters are cool and damp. Cities affected by this climate: Albi, Carcassonne, Lyon, Orange, Toulouse, Valence.\n\u2022 The oceanic climate (Cfb) is found around the coasts of the Bay of Biscay, and a little bit inland. Summers are pleasantly warm and wet, while winters are cool and damp. Cities affected by this climate: Amiens, Biarritz, Bordeaux, Brest, Cherbourg-en-Cotentin, Dunkirk, Lille, Nantes, Orl\u00e9ans, Paris, Reims, Tours.\n\u2022 The degraded oceanic climate (degraded-Cfb) is found in the interior plains and in the intra-alpine valleys, far from the ocean (or sea). Summers are hot and wet, while winters are cold and gloomy. Cities affected by this climate: Annecy, Besan\u00e7on, Bourges, Chamb\u00e9ry, Clermont-Ferrand, Colmar, Dijon, Grenoble, Langres, Metz, Mulhouse, Nancy, Strasbourg.\n\u2022 The subalpine oceanic climate (Cfc) is found at the foot of all the mountainous regions of France. Summers are short, cool and wet, while winters are moderately cold and damp. No major cities are affected by this climate.\n\u2022 The warm-summer mediterranean continental climate (Dsb) is found in all the mountainous regions of southern France between 700 and 1400 meters a.s.l. Summers are pleasantly warm and dry, while winters are very cold and snowy. City affected by this climate: Barcelonnette.\n\u2022 The cool-summer mediterranean continental climate (Dsc) is found in all the mountainous regions of southern France between 1400 and 2100 meters a.s.l. Summers are cool, short and dry, while winters are very cold and snowy. Place affected by this climate: Isola 2000.\n\u2022 The warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb) is found in all the mountainous regions of the Northern half of France between 500 and 1000 meters a.s.l. Summers are pleasantly warm and wet, while winters are very cold and snowy. Cities affected by this climate: Chamonix, Mouthe. In January 1985, in Mouthe, the temperature has dropped under -41\u00b0C.  \n\u2022 The subalpine climate (Dfc) is found in all the mountainous regions of the northern half of France between 1000 and 2000 meters a.s.l. Summers are cool, short and wet, while winters are very cold and snowy. Places affected by this climate: Cauterets Courchevel, Alpe d'Huez, Les 2 Alpes, Peyragudes, Val-Thorens.\n\u2022 The alpine tundra climate (ET) is found in all the mountainous regions of France, generally above 2000 or 2500 meters a.s.l. Summers are chilly and wet, while winters are extremely cold, long and snowy. Mountains affected by this climate: Aiguilles-Rouges, Aravis, the top of Cr\u00eat de la neige (rare, altitude 1718 m) and the top of Grand-Ballon (rare, altitude 1423 m).\n\u2022 The ice cap climate (EF) is found in all the mountainous regions of France that have a glacier. Summers are cold and wet, while winters are extremely cold, long and snowy. Mountains affected by this climate: Aiguille du midi, Barre des \u00c9crins, Belledonne, Grand-Casse, Mont Blanc (4810 m), Pic du Midi de Bigorre.\n\u2022 In the overseas regions, there are three broad types of climate:\n\nA tropical climate (Am) in most overseas regions including eastern French Guiana: high constant temperature throughout the year with a dry and a wet season.\nAn equatorial climate (Af) in western French Guiana: high constant temperature with even precipitation throughout the year.\nA subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc), characterized by mild, wet summers and cool, but generally not cold, damp winters. Cities or places affected by this climate: Port-aux-Fran\u00e7ais, Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon.An ice cap climate (EF): extremely cold year-round in Ad\u00e9lie Land.\n\nFrance was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry, in 1971. Although it is one of the most industrialized countries in the world, France is ranked only 19th by carbon dioxide emissions, behind less populous nations such as Canada or Australia. This is due to the country's heavy investment in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis, which now accounts for 75 percent of its electricity production and results in less pollution. According to the 2018 Environmental Performance Index conducted by Yale and Columbia, France was the second-most environmentally-conscious country in the world (after Switzerland), compared to tenth place in 2016 and 27th in 2014.\n\nLike all European Union state members, France agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by the year 2020, compared to the United States plan to reduce emissions by 4% of 1990 levels. As of 2009, French carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of China's. The country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 euros per tonne of carbon emitted, which would have raised 4 billion euros of revenue annually. However, the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening French businesses.\n\nForests account for 31 percent of France's land area\u2014the fourth-highest proportion in Europe\u2014representing an increase of 7 percent since 1990. French forests are some of the most diverse in Europe, comprising more than 140 species of trees. There are nine national parks and 46 natural parks in France, with the government planning to convert 20% of its Exclusive economic zone into a Marine protected area by 2020. A regional nature park (French: parc naturel r\u00e9gional or PNR) is a public establishment in France between local authorities and the national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty, to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area. A PNR sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation, sustainable economic development and protection of the natural environment based on each park's unique landscape and heritage. The parks foster ecological research programs and public education in the natural sciences. As of 2019 there are 54 PNRs in France.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThe French Republic is divided into 18 regions (located in Europe and overseas), five overseas collectivities, one overseas territory, one special collectivity \u2013 New Caledonia and one uninhabited island directly under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France \u2013 Clipperton.\n\nRegions\nSince 2016 France is mainly divided into 18 administrative regions: 13 regions in metropolitan France (including the territorial collectivity of Corsica), and five located overseas. The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments, which are numbered mainly alphabetically. This number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle number plates. Among the 101 departments of France, five (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and R\u00e9union) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are also simultaneously overseas departments (DOMs), enjoy exactly the same status as metropolitan departments and are an integral part of the European Union.\nThe 101 departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements, which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054 cantons. These cantons are then divided into 36,658 communes, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council. Three communes\u2014Paris, Lyon and Marseille\u2014are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements.\nThe regions, departments and communes are all known as territorial collectivities, meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive. Arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions. However, this was not always the case. Until 1940, the arrondissements were territorial collectivities with an elected assembly, but these were suspended by the Vichy regime and definitely abolished by the Fourth Republic in 1946.\n\nOverseas territories and collectivitiesIn addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic has five overseas collectivities (French Polynesia, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna), one sui generis collectivity (New Caledonia), one overseas territory (French Southern and Antarctic Lands), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean (Clipperton Island).\nOverseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic, but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area (with the exception of St. Bartelemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007). The Pacific Collectivities (COMs) of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia continue to use the CFP franc whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro. In contrast, the five overseas regions used the French franc and now use the euro.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe French Republic is a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic with strong democratic traditions. The Constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by referendum on 28 September 1958. It greatly strengthened the authority of the executive in relation to parliament. The executive branch itself has two leaders: the President of the Republic, currently Emmanuel Macron, who is head of state and is elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a 5-year term (formerly 7 years), and the Government, led by the president-appointed Prime Minister.\n\nThe French Parliament is a bicameral legislature comprising a National Assembly (Assembl\u00e9e nationale) and a Senate. The National Assembly deputies represent local constituencies and are directly elected for 5-year terms. The Assembly has the power to dismiss the government, and thus the majority in the Assembly determines the choice of government. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6-year terms (originally 9-year terms), and one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years.The Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say. The Government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament.\nUntil World War II, Radicals were a strong political force in France, embodied by the Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party which was the most important party of the Third Republic. Since World War II, they were marginalized while French politics became characterized by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, centred on the French Section of the Workers' International and its successor the Socialist Party (since 1969); and the other right-wing, centred on the Gaullist Party, whose name changed over time to the Rally of the French People (1947), the Union of Democrats for the Republic (1958), the Rally for the Republic (1976), the Union for a Popular Movement (2007) and The Republicans (since 2015). In the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, radical centrist party En Marche! became the dominant force, overtaking both Socialists and Republicans.\nAs of 2017, voter turnout was 75 percent during recent elections, higher than the OECD average of 68 percent.\n\n\n=== Law ===\n\nFrance uses a civil legal system, wherein law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law in a common law system). Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under Louis XIV). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As Guy Canivet, first president of the Court of Cassation, wrote about the management of prisons: Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality. That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.\n\nFrench law is divided into two principal areas: private law and public law. Private law includes, in particular, civil law and criminal law. Public law includes, in particular, administrative law and constitutional law. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited). While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court: ordinary courts (which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by the Court of Cassation and administrative courts are headed by the Council of State.\nTo be applicable, every law must be officially published in the Journal officiel de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise.\nFrance does not recognise religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions; it has long abolished blasphemy laws and sodomy laws (the latter in 1791). However, \"offences against public decency\" (contraires aux bonnes m\u0153urs) or disturbing public order (trouble \u00e0 l'ordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution. Since 1999, civil unions for homosexual couples are permitted, and since 2013, same-sex marriage and LGBT adoption are legal. Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881. Some consider hate speech laws in France to be too broad or severe, undermining freedom of speech.\nFrance has laws against racism and antisemitism, while the 1990 Gayssot Act prohibits Holocaust denial.\nFreedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State is the basis for la\u00efcit\u00e9 (state secularism): the state does not formally recognize any religion, except in Alsace-Moselle. Nonetheless, it does recognize religious associations. The Parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995, and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004. In 2010, it banned the wearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public; human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch described the law as discriminatory towards Muslims. However, it is supported by most of the population.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nFrance is a founding member of the United Nations and serves as one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council with veto rights. In 2015, France was described as being \"the best networked state in the world\", because it is a country that \"is member of more multi-lateral organisations than any other country\".France is a member of the G8, World Trade Organization (WTO), the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) and the Indian Ocean Commission (COI). It is an associate member of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) and a leading member of the International Francophone Organisation (OIF) of 84 fully or partly French-speaking countries.As a significant hub for international relations, France hosts the second largest assembly of diplomatic missions in the world and the headquarters of international organisations including the OECD, UNESCO, Interpol, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and la Francophonie.Postwar French foreign policy has been largely shaped by membership of the European Union, of which it was a founding member. Since the 1960s, France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU. In the 1960s, France sought to exclude the British from the European unification process, seeking to build its own standing in continental Europe. However, since 1904, France has maintained an \"Entente cordiale\" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries, especially militarily.\n\nFrance is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), but under President de Gaulle, it excluded itself from the joint military command to protest the Special Relationship between the United States and Britain and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies. However, as a result of Nicolas Sarkozy's pro-American politics (much criticised in France by the leftists and by a part of the right), France re-joined the NATO joint military command on 4 April 2009.In the early 1990s, the country drew considerable criticism from other nations for its underground nuclear tests in French Polynesia. France vigorously opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, straining bilateral relations with the United States and the United Kingdom.\nFrance retains strong political and economic influence in its former African colonies (Fran\u00e7afrique) and has supplied economic aid and troops for peacekeeping missions in Ivory Coast and Chad. Recently, after the unilateral declaration of independence of Northern Mali by the Tuareg MNLA and the subsequent regional Northern Mali conflict with several Islamist groups including Ansar Dine and MOJWA, France and other African states intervened to help the Malian Army to retake control.\nIn 2017, France was the fourth-largest donor (in absolute terms) of development aid in the world, behind the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This represents 0.43% of its GNP, the 12th highest among the OECD. The organisation managing the French help is the French Development Agency, which finances primarily humanitarian projects in sub-Saharan Africa. The main goals of this support are \"developing infrastructure, access to health care and education, the implementation of appropriate economic policies and the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy\".\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nThe French Armed Forces (Forces arm\u00e9es fran\u00e7aises) are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the President of the Republic as supreme commander. They consist of the French Army (Arm\u00e9e de Terre), French Navy (Marine Nationale, formerly called Arm\u00e9e de Mer), the French Air Force (Arm\u00e9e de l'Air), the French Strategic Nuclear Force (Force Nucl\u00e9aire Strat\u00e9gique, nicknamed Force de Frappe or \"Strike Force\") and the Military Police called National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale), which also fulfils civil police duties in the rural areas of France. Together they are among the largest armed forces in the world and the largest in the EU.\nWhile the Gendarmerie is an integral part of the French armed forces (gendarmes are career soldiers), and therefore under the purview of the Ministry of the Armed Forces, it is operationally attached to the Ministry of the Interior as far as its civil police duties are concerned.\nWhen acting as general purpose police force, the Gendarmerie encompasses the counter terrorist units of the Parachute Intervention Squadron of the National Gendarmerie (Escadron Parachutiste d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale), the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale), the Search Sections of the National Gendarmerie (Sections de Recherche de la Gendarmerie Nationale), responsible for criminal enquiries, and the Mobile Brigades of the National Gendarmerie (Brigades mobiles de la Gendarmerie Nationale, or in short Gendarmerie mobile) which have the task to maintain public order.\nThe following special units are also part of the Gendarmerie: the Republican Guard (Garde r\u00e9publicaine) which protects public buildings hosting major French institutions, the Maritime Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie maritime) serving as Coast Guard, the Provost Service (Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9), acting as the Military Police branch of the Gendarmerie.\n\nAs far as the French intelligence units are concerned, the Directorate-General for External Security (Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ext\u00e9rieure) is considered to be a component of the Armed Forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defense. The other, the Central Directorate for Interior Intelligence (Direction centrale du renseignement int\u00e9rieur) is a division of the National Police Force (Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Police Nationale), and therefore reports directly to the Ministry of the Interior. There has been no national conscription since 1997.France has a special military corps, the French Foreign Legion, founded in 1830, which consists of foreign nationals from over 140 countries who are willing to serve in the French Armed Forces and become French citizens after the end of their service period. The only other countries having similar units are Spain (the Spanish Foreign Legion, called Tercio, was founded in 1920) and Luxembourg (foreigners can serve in the National Army provided they speak Luxembourgish).\nFrance is a permanent member of the Security Council of the UN, and a recognised nuclear state since 1960. France has signed and ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. France's annual military expenditure in 2018 was US$63.8 billion, or 2.3% of its GDP, making it the fifth biggest military spender in the world after the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, and India.French nuclear deterrence, (formerly known as \"Force de Frappe\"), relies on complete independence. The current French nuclear force consists of four Triomphant class submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. In addition to the submarine fleet, it is estimated that France has about 60 ASMP medium-range air-to-ground missiles with nuclear warheads, of which around 50 are deployed by the Air Force using the Mirage 2000N long-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's Super \u00c9tendard Modernis\u00e9 (SEM) attack aircraft, which operate from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The new Rafale F3 aircraft will gradually replace all Mirage 2000N and SEM in the nuclear strike role with the improved ASMP-A missile with a nuclear warhead.\nFrance has major military industries with one of the largest aerospace industries in the world. Its industries have produced such equipment as the Rafale fighter, the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, the Exocet missile and the Leclerc tank among others. Despite withdrawing from the Eurofighter project, France is actively investing in European joint projects such as the Eurocopter Tiger, multipurpose frigates, the UCAV demonstrator nEUROn and the Airbus A400M. France is a major arms seller, with most of its arsenal's designs available for the export market with the notable exception of nuclear-powered devices.\nThe Bastille Day military parade held in Paris each 14 July for France's national day, called Bastille Day in English-speaking countries (referred to in France as F\u00eate nationale), is the oldest and largest regular military parade in Europe.\nOther smaller parades are organised across the country.\n\n\n=== Government finance ===\n\nThe Government of France has run a budget deficit each year since the early 1970s. As of 2016, French government debt levels reached 2.2 trillion euros, the equivalent of 96.4% of French GDP. In late 2012, credit rating agencies warned that growing French Government debt levels risked France's AAA credit rating, raising the possibility of a future downgrade and subsequent higher borrowing costs for the French authorities.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nA member of the Group of Seven (formerly Group of Eight) leading industrialized countries, as of 2018, it is ranked as the world's tenth largest and the EU's second largest economy by purchasing power parity. France joined 11 other EU members to launch the euro in 1999, with euro coins and banknotes completely replacing the French franc (\u20a3) in 2002.France has a mixed economy that combines extensive private enterprise with substantial state enterprise and government intervention. The government retains considerable influence over key segments of infrastructure sectors, with majority ownership of railway, electricity, aircraft, nuclear power and telecommunications. It has been relaxing its control over these sectors since the early 1990s. The government is slowly corporatising the state sector and selling off holdings in France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, Air France, as well as in the insurance, banking, and defense industries. France has an important aerospace industry led by the European consortium Airbus, and has its own national spaceport, the Centre Spatial Guyanais.\n\nAs of 2009, the World Trade Organization (WTO) reported France was the world's sixth largest exporter and the fourth largest importer of manufactured goods. As of 2016, the World Factbook ranked France seventh largest exporter. In 2008, France was the third largest recipient of foreign direct investment among OECD countries at $118 billion, ranking behind Luxembourg (where foreign direct investment was essentially monetary transfers to banks located there) and the United States ($316 billion), but above the United Kingdom ($96.9 billion), Germany ($25 billion), or Japan ($24 billion). In the same year, French companies invested $220 billion outside France, ranking France as the second largest outward direct investor in the OECD, behind the United States ($311 billion), and ahead of the UK ($111 billion), Japan ($128 billion) and Germany ($157 billion).Financial services, banking and the insurance sector are an important part of the economy. Three largest financial institutions cooperatively owned by their customers are located in France. The Paris stock exchange (French: La Bourse de Paris) is an old institution, created by Louis XV in 1724. In 2000, the stock exchanges of Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels merged into Euronext. In 2007, Euronext merged with the New York stock exchange to form NYSE Euronext, the world's largest stock exchange. Euronext Paris, the French branch of the NYSE Euronext group is Europe's 2nd largest stock exchange market, behind the London Stock Exchange.\nFrance is a member of the Eurozone (around 330 million consumers) which is part of the European Single Market (more than 500 million consumers). Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. France introduced the common European currency, the Euro in 2002.French companies have maintained key positions in the insurance and banking industries: AXA is the world's largest insurance company. The leading French banks are BNP Paribas and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, ranking as the world's first and sixth largest banks in 2010 (by assets), while the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale group was ranked the world's eighth largest in 2009.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nFrance has historically been a large producer of agricultural products. Extensive tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and EU subsidies have combined to make France the leading agricultural producer and exporter in Europe (representing 20% of the EU's agricultural production) and the world's third biggest exporter of agricultural products.Wheat, poultry, dairy, beef, and pork, as well as internationally recognized processed foods are the primary French agricultural exports. Ros\u00e9 wines are primarily consumed within the country, but Champagne and Bordeaux wines are major exports, being known worldwide. EU agriculture subsidies to France have decreased in recent years but still amounted to $8 billion in 2007. That same year, France sold 33.4 billion euros of transformed agricultural products. France produces rum via sugar cane-based distilleries almost all of which are located in overseas territories such as Martinique, Guadeloupe and La R\u00e9union. Agriculture is an important sector of France's economy: 3.8% of the active population is employed in agriculture, whereas the total agri-food industry made up 4.2% of French GDP in 2005.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nWith 83 million foreign tourists in 2012, France is ranked as the first tourist destination in the world, ahead of the United States (67 million) and China (58 million). This 83 million figure excludes people staying less than 24 hours, such as North Europeans crossing France on their way to Spain or Italy. It is third in income from tourism due to shorter duration of visits. The most popular tourist sites include (annual visitors): Eiffel Tower (6.2 million), Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles (2.8 million), Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle (2 million), Pont du Gard (1.5 million), Arc de Triomphe (1.2 million), Mont Saint-Michel (1 million), Sainte-Chapelle (683,000), Ch\u00e2teau du Haut-K\u0153nigsbourg (549,000), Puy de D\u00f4me (500,000), Mus\u00e9e Picasso (441,000), and Carcassonne (362,000).\n\n\n==== Paris ====\nFrance, especially Paris, has some of the world's largest and most renowned museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world (5.7 million), the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay (2.1 million), mostly devoted to Impressionism, and Centre Georges Pompidou (1.2 million), dedicated to contemporary art. Disneyland Paris is Europe's most popular theme park, with 15 million combined visitors to the resort's Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park in 2009.\n\n\n==== French Riviera ====\nWith more than 10 millions tourists a year, the French Riviera (French: C\u00f4te d'Azur), in Southeast France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Paris region. It benefits from 300 days of sunshine per year, 115 kilometres (71 mi) of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants. Each year the C\u00f4te d'Azur hosts 50% of the world's superyacht fleet.\n\n\n==== Ch\u00e2teaux ====\nWith 6 millions tourists a year, the castles of the Loire Valley (French: ch\u00e2teaux) and the Loire Valley itself are the third leading tourist destination in France; this World Heritage site is noteworthy for its architectural heritage, in its historic towns but in particular its castles, such as the Ch\u00e2teaux d'Amboise, de Chambord, d'Uss\u00e9, de Villandry, Chenonceau and Montsoreau. The Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly, Versailles and Vaux-le-Vicomte, all three located near Paris, are also visitor attractions.\n\n\n==== UNESCO World Heritage Sites and protected areas ====\nFrance has 37 sites inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage List and features cities of high cultural interest, beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, and rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity (green tourism). Small and picturesque French villages are promoted through the association Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (literally \"The Most Beautiful Villages of France\"). The \"Remarkable Gardens\" label is a list of the over 200 gardens classified by the French Ministry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks. France attracts many religious pilgrims on their way to St. James, or to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es that hosts several million visitors a year.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\n\n\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France (EDF), the main electricity generation and distribution company in France, is also one of the world's largest producers of electricity. In 2003, it produced 22% of the European Union's electricity, primarily from nuclear power. France is the smallest emitter of carbon dioxide among the G8, due to its heavy investment in nuclear power. As of 2016, 72% of the electricity produced by France is generated by 58 nuclear power plants. In this context, renewable energies are having difficulty taking off. France also uses hydroelectric dams to produce electricity, such as the Eguzon dam, \u00c9tang de Soulcem and Lac de Vouglans.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nThe railway network of France, which as of 2008 stretches 29,473 kilometres (18,314 mi) is the second most extensive in Western Europe after that of Germany. It is operated by the SNCF, and high-speed trains include the Thalys, the Eurostar and TGV, which travels at 320 km/h (199 mph) in commercial use. The Eurostar, along with the Eurotunnel Shuttle, connects with the United Kingdom through the Channel Tunnel. Rail connections exist to all other neighboring countries in Europe, except Andorra. Intra-urban connections are also well developed with both underground services (Paris, Lyon, Lille, Marseille, Toulouse, Rennes) and tramway services (Nantes, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Grenoble, Montpellier...) complementing bus services.\nThere are approximately 1,027,183 kilometres (638,262 mi) of serviceable roadway in France, ranking it the most extensive network of the European continent. The Paris region is enveloped with the most dense network of roads and highways that connect it with virtually all parts of the country. French roads also handle substantial international traffic, connecting with cities in neighboring Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Andorra and Monaco. There is no annual registration fee or road tax; however, usage of the mostly privately owned motorways is through tolls except in the vicinity of large communes. The new car market is dominated by domestic brands such as Renault (27% of cars sold in France in 2003), Peugeot (20.1%) and Citro\u00ebn (13.5%). Over 70% of new cars sold in 2004 had diesel engines, far more than contained petrol or LPG engines. France possesses the Millau Viaduct, the world's tallest bridge, and has built many important bridges such as the Pont de Normandie.\n\nThere are 464 airports in France. Charles de Gaulle Airport, located in the vicinity of Paris, is the largest and busiest airport in the country, handling the vast majority of popular and commercial traffic and connecting Paris with virtually all major cities across the world. Air France is the national carrier airline, although numerous private airline companies provide domestic and international travel services. There are ten major ports in France, the largest of which is in Marseille, which also is the largest bordering the Mediterranean Sea. 12,261 kilometres (7,619 mi) of waterways traverse France including the Canal du Midi, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean through the Garonne river.\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\n\nSince the Middle Ages, France has been a major contributor to scientific and technological achievement. Around the beginning of the 11th century, Pope Sylvester II, born Gerbert d'Aurillac, reintroduced the abacus and armillary sphere, and introduced Arabic numerals and clocks to Northern and Western Europe. The University of Paris, founded in the mid-12th century, is still one of the most important universities in the Western world. In the 17th century, mathematician Ren\u00e9 Descartes defined a method for the acquisition of scientific knowledge, while Blaise Pascal became famous for his work on probability and fluid mechanics. They were both key figures of the Scientific Revolution, which blossomed in Europe during this period. The Academy of Sciences was founded by Louis XIV to encourage and protect the spirit of French scientific research. It was at the forefront of scientific developments in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. It is one of the earliest academies of sciences.\nThe Age of Enlightenment was marked by the work of biologist Buffon and chemist Lavoisier, who discovered the role of oxygen in combustion, while Diderot and D'Alembert published the Encyclop\u00e9die, which aimed to give access to \"useful knowledge\" to the people, a knowledge that they can apply to their everyday life. With the Industrial Revolution, the 19th century saw spectacular scientific developments in France with scientists such as Augustin Fresnel, founder of modern optics, Sadi Carnot who laid the foundations of thermodynamics, and Louis Pasteur, a pioneer of microbiology. Other eminent French scientists of the 19th century have their names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.\nFamous French scientists of the 20th century include the mathematician and physicist Henri Poincar\u00e9, physicists Henri Becquerel, Pierre and Marie Curie, who remained famous for their work on radioactivity, the physicist Paul Langevin and virologist Luc Montagnier, co-discoverer of HIV AIDS. Hand transplantation was developed on 23 September 1998 in Lyon by a team assembled from different countries around the world including Jean-Michel Dubernard who, shortly thereafter, performed the first successful double hand transplant. Telesurgery was developed by Jacques Marescaux and his team on 7 September 2001 across the Atlantic Ocean (New-York-Strasbourg, Lindbergh Operation). A face transplant was first done on 27 November 2005 by Dr. Bernard Devauchelle.\n\nFrance was the fourth country to achieve nuclear capability and has the third largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world. It is also a leader in civilian nuclear technology. France was the third nation, after the former USSR and the United States, to launch its own space satellite and remains the biggest contributor to the European Space Agency (ESA). The European Airbus, formed from the French group A\u00e9rospatiale along with DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG (DASA) and Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas SA (CASA), designs and develops civil and military aircraft as well as communications systems, missiles, space rockets, helicopters, satellites, and related systems. France also hosts major international research instruments such as the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility or the Institut Laue\u2013Langevin and remains a major member of CERN. It also owns Minatec, Europe's leading nanotechnology research center.\nThe SNCF, the French national railroad company, has developed the TGV, a high speed train which holds a series of world speed records. The TGV has been the fastest wheeled train in commercial use since reaching a speed of 574.8 km/h (357.2 mph) on 3 April 2007. Western Europe is now serviced by a network of TGV lines.\nAs of 2018, 69 French people have been awarded a Nobel Prize and 12 have received the Fields Medal.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nWith an estimated 2020 population of 67.08 million people, France is the 20th most populous country in the world, the third-most populous in Europe (after Russia and Germany), and the second most populous in the European Union (after Germany).\nFrance is an outlier among developed countries in general, and European countries in particular, in having a relatively high rate of natural population growth: by birth rates alone, it was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006. Between 2006 and 2016, France saw the second highest overall increase in population in the EU, and was one of only four EU countries where natural births accounted for most population growth. This was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in 1973, and coincides with the rise of the total fertility rate from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010.\nAs of January 2017 the fertility rate declined slightly to 1.93 children per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1, and considerably below the high of 4.41 in 1800. France's fertility rate and crude birth rate nonetheless remain among the highest in the EU. However, like many developed nations, France's population is aging; the average age is 42.6 years, while close to a fifth of French people are 65 or over. Average life expectancy at birth is 82.2 years, the ninth highest in the world.\nFrom 2006 to 2011 population growth averaged 0.6 percent per year; since 2011, annual growth has been between 0.4 and 0.5 percent annually. Immigrants are major contributors to this trend; in 2010, 27 percent of newborns in metropolitan France had at least one foreign-born parent and 24 percent had at least one parent born outside of Europe (excluding French overseas territories).\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nMost French people are of Celtic (Gauls) origin, with an admixture of Italic (Romans) and Germanic (Franks) groups. Different regions reflect this diverse heritage, with notable Breton elements in western France, Aquitanian in the southwest, Scandinavian in the northwest, Alemannic in the northeast and Ligurian in the southeast.\nLarge-scale immigration over the last century and a half has led to a more multicultural society. In 2004, the Institut Montaigne estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were White (85% of the population), 6 million were Northwest African (10%), 2 million were Black (3.3%), and 1 million were Asian (1.7%).Since the French Revolution, and as codified in the 1958 French Constitution, it is illegal for the French state to collect data on ethnicity and ancestry. In 2008, the TeO (\"Trajectories and origins\") poll conducted jointly by INED and the French National Institute of Statistics estimated that 5 million people were of Italian ancestry (the largest immigrant community), followed by 3 million to 6 million of Northwest African ancestry, 2.5 million of Sub-Saharan African origin, 500,000 ethnic Armenian, and 200,000 people of Turkish ancestry. There are also sizable minorities of other European ethnic groups, namely Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, and Greek.France has a significant Gypsy (Gitan) population, numbering between 20,000 and 400,000. Many foreign Romani people are expelled back to Bulgaria and Romania frequently.It is currently estimated that 40% of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration the country has received since the early 20th century; between 1921 and 1935 alone, about 1.1 million net immigrants came to France. The next largest wave came in the 1960s, when around 1.6 million pieds noirs returned to France following the independence of its Northwest African possessions, Algeria and Morocco. They were joined by numerous former colonial subjects from North and West Africa, as well as numerous European immigrants from Spain and Portugal.\nFrance remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually. In 2005, it was Western Europe's leading recipient of asylum seekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications (albeit 15% decrease from 2004). In 2010, France received about 48,100 asylum applications\u2014placing it among the top five asylum recipients in the world and in subsequent years it saw the number of applications increase, ultimately doubling to 100,412 in 2017. The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curb Eastern European migration, and immigration remains a contentious political issue.\nIn 2008, the INSEE (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) estimated that the total number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5 million (8% of the population), while their French-born descendants numbered 6.5 million, or 11% of the population. Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second-generation immigrants, of which more than 5 million were of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi ancestry. In 2008, France granted citizenship to 137,000 persons, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and Turkey.In 2014, the INSEE published a study which reported doubling of the number of Spanish immigrants, Portuguese and Italians in France between 2009 and 2012.\nAccording to the French Institute, this increase resulting from the financial crisis that hit several European countries in that period, has pushed up the number of Europeans installed in France.\nStatistics on Spanish immigrants in France show a growth of 107 percent between 2009 and 2012, i.e. in this period went from 5300 to 11,000 people.\nOf the total of 229,000 foreigners who were in France in 2012, nearly 8% were Portuguese, 5% British, 5% Spanish, 4% Italians, 4% Germans, 3% Romanians, and 3% Belgians.\n\n\n=== Major cities ===\n\nFrance is a highly urbanized country, with its largest cities (in terms of metropolitan area population in 2016) being Paris (12,568,755 inh.), Lyon (2,310,850), Marseille (1,756,296), Toulouse (1,345,343), Bordeaux (1,232,550), Lille (1,187,824), Nice (1,006,402), Nantes (961,521), Strasbourg (785,839) and Rennes (727,357). (Note: There are significant differences between the metropolitan population figures just cited and those in the following table, which indicates the population of the communes). Rural flight was a perennial political issue throughout most of the 20th century.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nAccording to Article 2 of the Constitution, the official language of France is French, a Romance language derived from Latin. Since 1635, the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise has been France's official authority on the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal weight. There are also regional languages spoken in France, such as Occitan, Breton, Catalan, Flemish (Dutch dialect), Alsatian (German dialect), Basque, and Corsican. Italian was the official language of Corsica until 9 May 1859.The Government of France does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. The perceived threat from anglicisation has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France. Besides French, there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of France, eight spoken in French metropolitan territory and 69 in the French overseas territories.\nFrom the 17th to the mid-20th century, French served as the pre-eminent international language of diplomacy and international affairs as well as a lingua franca among the educated classes of Europe. The dominant position of French language in international affairs was overtaken by English, since the emergence of the United States as a major power.For most of the time in which French served as an international lingua franca, it was not the native language of most Frenchmen: a report in 1794 conducted by Henri Gr\u00e9goire found that of the country's 25 million people, only three million spoke French natively; the rest spoke one of the country's many regional languages, such as Alsatian, Breton or Occitan. Through the expansion of public education, in which French was the sole language of instruction, as well as other factors such as increased urbanisation and the rise of mass communication, French gradually came to be adopted by virtually the entire population, a process not completed until the 20th century.\nAs a result of France's extensive colonial ambitions between the 17th and 20th centuries, French was introduced to the Americas, Africa, Polynesia, South-East Asia, as well as the Caribbean. French is the second most studied foreign language in the world after English, and is a lingua franca in some regions, notably in Africa. The legacy of French as a living language outside Europe is mixed: it is nearly extinct in some former French colonies (The Levant, South and Southeast Asia), while creoles and pidgins based on French have emerged in the French departments in the West Indies and the South Pacific (French Polynesia). On the other hand, many former French colonies have adopted French as an official language, and the total number of French speakers is increasing, especially in Africa.\nIt is estimated that between 300 million and 500 million people worldwide can speak French, either as a mother tongue or a second language.\nAccording to the 2007 Adult Education survey, part of a project by the European Union and carried in France by the INSEE and based on a sample of 15,350 persons, French was the native language of 87.2% of the total population, or roughly 55.81 million people, followed by Arabic (3.6%, 2.3 million), Portuguese (1.5%, 960,000), Spanish (1.2%, 770,000) and Italian (1.0%, 640,000). Native speakers of other languages made up the remaining 5.2% of the population.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nFrance is a secular country in which freedom of religion is a constitutional right. French religious policy is based on the concept of la\u00efcit\u00e9, a strict separation of church and state under which public life is kept completely secular.\nAccording to a survey held in 2016 by Institut Montaigne and Institut fran\u00e7ais d'opinion publique (IFOP), 51.1% of the total population of France was Christian, 39.6% had no religion (atheism or agnosticism), 5.6% were Muslims, 2.5% were followers of other faiths, and the remaining 0.4% were undecided about their faith. Estimates of the number of Muslims in France vary widely. In 2003, the French Ministry of the Interior estimated the total number of people of Muslim background to be between 5 and 6 million (8\u201310%). The current Jewish community in France is the largest in Europe and the third-largest in the world after Israel and the United States, ranging between 480,000 and 600,000, about 0.8% of the population as of 2016.Catholicism has been the predominant religion in France for more than a millennium, though it is not as actively practised today as it was. Among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% are Roman Catholic. During the French Revolution, activists conducted a brutal campaign of de-Christianisation, ending the Catholic Church as the state religion. In some cases clergy and churches were attacked, with iconoclasm stripping the churches of statues and ornaments. After alternating between royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century, in 1905 France passed the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, which established the principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9.To this day, the government is prohibited from recognizing any specific right to a religious community (except for legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the local law in Alsace-Moselle). It recognizes religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. Conversely, religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policy-making. Certain groups, such as Scientology, Children of God, the Unification Church, and the Order of the Solar Temple are considered cults (\"sectes\" in French), and therefore do not have the same status as recognized religions in France. Secte is considered a pejorative term in France.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nThe French health care system is one of universal health care largely financed by government national health insurance. In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, the World Health Organization found that France provided the \"close to best overall health care\" in the world. The French healthcare system was ranked first worldwide by the World Health Organization in 1997. In 2011, France spent 11.6% of GDP on health care, or US$4,086 per capita, a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe but less than in the United States. Approximately 77% of health expenditures are covered by government funded agencies.Care is generally free for people affected by chronic diseases (affections de longues dur\u00e9es) such as cancer, AIDS or cystic fibrosis. Average life expectancy at birth is 78 years for men and 85 years for women, one of the highest of the European Union and the World. There are 3.22 physicians for every 1000 inhabitants in France, and average health care spending per capita was US$4,719 in 2008.\nAs of 2007, approximately 140,000 inhabitants (0.4%) of France are living with HIV/AIDS.Even if the French have the reputation of being one of the thinnest people in developed countries,\nFrance\u2014like other rich countries\u2014faces an increasing and recent epidemic of obesity, due mostly to the replacement in French eating habits of traditional healthy French cuisine by junk food. The French obesity rate is still far below that of the United States\u2014currently equal to American rate in the 1970s\u2014and is still the lowest of Europe. Authorities now regard obesity as one of the main public health issues and fight it fiercely. Nevertheless, rates of childhood obesity are slowing in France, while continuing to grow in other countries.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nIn 1802, Napoleon created the lyc\u00e9e, the second and final stage of secondary education that prepares students for higher education studies or a profession. Nevertheless, Jules Ferry is considered the father of the French modern school, leading reforms in the late 19th century that established free, secular, and compulsory education (currently mandatory until the age of 16)French education is centralized and divided into three stages: Primary, secondary, and higher education. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked France's education as about the OECD average in 2015. Primary and secondary education are predominantly public, run by the Ministry of National Education. While training and remuneration of teachers and the curriculum are the responsibility of the state centrally, the management of primary and secondary schools is overseen by local authorities. Primary education comprises two phases, nursery school (\u00e9cole maternelle) and elementary school (\u00e9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire). Nursery school aims to stimulate the minds of very young children and promote their socialization and development of a basic grasp of language and number. Around the age of six, children transfer to elementary school, whose primary objectives are learning about writing, arithmetic and citizenship. Secondary education also consists of two phases. The first is delivered through colleges (coll\u00e8ge) and leads to the national certificate (Dipl\u00f4me national du brevet). The second is offered in high schools (lyc\u00e9e) and finishes in national exams leading to a baccalaureate (baccalaur\u00e9at, available in professional, technical or general flavors) or certificate of professional competence (certificat d'aptitude professionelle).\nHigher education is divided between public universities and the prestigious and selective Grandes \u00e9coles, such as Sciences Po Paris for Political studies, HEC Paris for Economics, Polytechnique, the \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales for Social studies and the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des mines de Paris that produce high-profile engineers, or the \u00c9cole nationale d'administration for careers in the Grands Corps of the state. The Grandes \u00e9coles have been criticized for alleged elitism, producing many if not most of France's high-ranking civil servants, CEOs, and politicians.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nFrance has been a center of Western cultural development for centuries. Many French artists have been among the most renowned of their time, and France is still recognized in the world for its rich cultural tradition.\nThe successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation, and the creation of the Ministry of Culture in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public. The Ministry of Culture has been very active since its creation, granting subsidies to artists, promoting French culture in the world, supporting festivals and cultural events, protecting historical monuments. The French government also succeeded in maintaining a cultural exception to defend audiovisual products made in the country.\nFrance receives the highest number of tourists per year, largely thanks to the numerous cultural establishments and historical buildings implanted all over the territory. It counts 1,200 museums welcoming more than 50 million people annually. The most important cultural sites are run by the government, for instance through the public agency Centre des monuments nationaux, which is responsible for approximately 85 national historical monuments.\nThe 43,180 buildings protected as historical monuments include mainly residences (many castles) and religious buildings (cathedrals, basilicas, churches), but also statues, memorials and gardens. The UNESCO inscribed 45 sites in France on the World Heritage List.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nThe origins of French art were very much influenced by Flemish art and by Italian art at the time of the Renaissance. Jean Fouquet, the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance at first hand. The Renaissance painting School of Fontainebleau was directly inspired by Italian painters such as Primaticcio and Rosso Fiorentino, who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of Baroque era, Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, lived in Italy.\n\nThe 17th century was the period when French painting became prominent and individualised itself through classicism. Louis XIV's prime minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert founded in 1648 the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture to protect these artists, and in 1666 he created the still-active French Academy in Rome to have direct relations with Italian artists.\nFrench artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists Antoine Watteau, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher and Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as Napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as Jacques-Louis David and the highly influential Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts defined the style known as Academism. At this time France had become a centre of artistic creation, the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements, at first Romanticism with Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, and Realism with Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet, a style that eventually evolved into Naturalism.\n\nIn the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting became even more important, with the development of new styles of painting such as Impressionism and Symbolism. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were Camille Pissarro, \u00c9douard Manet, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir. The second generation of impressionist-style painters, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Paul Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Georges Seurat, were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions, as well as the fauvist artists Henri Matisse, Andr\u00e9 Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck.At the beginning of the 20th century, Cubism was developed by Georges Braque and the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such as Vincent van Gogh, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and Wassily Kandinsky.\nMany museums in France are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and painting works. A huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, such as Mona Lisa, also known as La Joconde. While the Louvre Palace has been for a long time a museum, the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station Gare d'Orsay, in a major reorganisation of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).Modern works are presented in the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, which moved in 1976 to the Centre Georges Pompidou. These three state-owned museums welcome close to 17 million people a year. Other national museums hosting paintings include the Grand Palais (1.3 million visitors in 2008), but there are also many museums owned by cities, the most visited being the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (0.8 million entries in 2008), which hosts contemporary works. Outside Paris, all the large cities have a Museum of Fine Arts with a section dedicated to European and French painting. Some of the finest collections are in Lyon, Lille, Rouen, Dijon, Rennes and Grenoble.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survived are Chinon, Ch\u00e2teau d'Angers, the massive Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes and the so-called Cathar castles. During this era, France had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe. Some of the greatest examples of Romanesque churches in France are the Saint Sernin Basilica in Toulouse, the largest romanesque church in Europe, and the remains of the Cluniac Abbey.\nThe Gothic architecture, originally named Opus Francigenum meaning \"French work\", was born in \u00cele-de-France and was the first French style of architecture to be copied in all Europe. Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being the Saint Denis Basilica (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are Notre-Dame de Chartres and Notre-Dame d'Amiens. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church: Notre-Dame de Reims. Aside from churches, Gothic Architecture had been used for many religious palaces, the most important one being the Palais des Papes in Avignon.\n\nThe final victory in the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the French Renaissance and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in the Loire Valley, from 1450 with as a first reference the Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau. Such residential castles were the Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord, the Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau, or the Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise.\n\nFollowing the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, Baroque architecture replaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one. In the secular domain, the Palace of Versailles has many baroque features. Jules Hardouin Mansart, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architect of the baroque era; he is famous for his dome at Les Invalides. Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as the Place Stanislas in Nancy. On the military architectural side, Vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.\n\nAfter the Revolution, the Republicans favoured Neoclassicism although it was introduced in France prior to the revolution with such buildings as the Parisian Pantheon or the Capitole de Toulouse. Built during the first French Empire, the Arc de Triomphe and Sainte Marie-Madeleine represent the best example of Empire style architecture.Under Napoleon III, a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque Palais Garnier were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; for example, Haussmann's renovation of Paris. The architecture associated to this era is named Second Empire in English, the term being taken from the Second French Empire. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc. In the late 19th century, Gustave Eiffel designed many bridges, such as Garabit viaduct, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the iconic Eiffel Tower.\nIn the 20th century, French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The Louvre Pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 meters (121 feet). France's largest financial district is La Defense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located. Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the Millau Viaduct. Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, Christian de Portzamparc or Paul Andreu.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nThe earliest French literature dates from the Middle Ages, when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French medieval texts are unknown, such as Tristan and Iseult and Lancelot-Grail. Other authors are known, for example Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes and Duke William IX of Aquitaine, who wrote in Occitan.\nMuch medieval French poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the Matter of France, such as The Song of Roland and the various chansons de geste. The Roman de Renart, written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the medieval character Reynard ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer was Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, whose novel Gargantua and Pantagruel has remained famous and appreciated until now. Michel de Montaigne was the other major figure of the French literature during that century. His most famous work, Essais, created the literary genre of the essay. French poetry during that century was embodied by Pierre de Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay. Both writers founded the La Pl\u00e9iade literary movement.\nDuring the 17th century, Madame de La Fayette published anonymously La Princesse de Cl\u00e8ves, a novel that is considered to be one of the very first psychological novels of all times. Jean de La Fontaine is one of the most famous fabulists of that time, as he wrote hundreds of fables, some being far more famous than others, such as The Ant and the Grasshopper. Generations of French pupils had to learn his fables, that were seen as helping teaching wisdom and common sense to the young people. Some of his verses have entered the popular language to become proverbs, such as \"\u00c0 l'\u0153uvre, on conna\u00eet l'artisan.\"[A workman is known by his chips].\n\nJean Racine, whose incredible mastery of the alexandrine and of the French language has been praised for centuries, created plays such as Ph\u00e8dre or Britannicus. He is, along with Pierre Corneille (Le Cid) and Moli\u00e8re, considered as one of the three great dramatists of France's golden age. Moli\u00e8re, who is deemed to be one of the greatest masters of comedy of the Western literature, wrote dozens of plays, including Le Misanthrope, L'Avare, Le Malade imaginaire, as well as Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme. His plays have been so popular around the world that French language is sometimes dubbed as \"the language of Moli\u00e8re\" (la langue de Moli\u00e8re), just like English is considered as \"the language of Shakespeare\".\nFrench literature and poetry flourished even more in the 18th and 19th centuries. Denis Diderot's best-known works are Jacques the Fatalist and Rameau's Nephew. He is however best known for being the main redactor of the Encyclop\u00e9die, whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century (in fields such as arts, sciences, languages, and philosophy) and to present them to the people, to fight ignorance and obscurantism. During that same century, Charles Perrault was a prolific writer of famous children's fairy tales including Puss in Boots, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Bluebeard. At the start of the 19th century, symbolist poetry was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine and St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9.The 19th century saw the writings of many renowned French authors. Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as \"the greatest French writer of all times\" for excelling in all literary genres. The preface of his play Cromwell is considered to be the manifesto of the Romantic movement. Les Contemplations and La L\u00e9gende des si\u00e8cles are considered as \"poetic masterpieces\", Hugo's verse having been compared to that of Shakespeare, Dante and Homer. His novel Les Mis\u00e9rables is widely seen as one of the greatest novel ever written and The Hunchback of Notre Dame has remained immensely popular.\nOther major authors of that century include Alexandre Dumas (The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte-Cristo), Jules Verne (Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea), \u00c9mile Zola (Les Rougon-Macquart), Honor\u00e9 de Balzac (La Com\u00e9die humaine), Guy de Maupassant, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier and Stendhal (The Red and the Black, The Charterhouse of Parma), whose works are among the most well known in France and the world. The Prix Goncourt is a French literary prize first awarded in 1903. Important writers of the 20th century include Marcel Proust, Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Antoine de Saint Exup\u00e9ry wrote Little Prince, which has remained popular for decades with children and adults around the world. As of 2014, French authors had more Literature Nobel Prizes than those of any other nation. The first Nobel Prize in Literature was a French author, while France's latest Nobel prize in literature is Patrick Modiano, who was awarded the prize in 2014. Jean-Paul Sartre was also the first nominee in the committee's history to refuse the prize in 1964.\n\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n\nMedieval philosophy was dominated by Scholasticism until the emergence of Humanism in the Renaissance. Modern philosophy began in France in the 17th century with the philosophy of Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Blaise Pascal, and Nicolas Malebranche. Descartes revitalised Western philosophy, which had been declined after the Greek and Roman eras. His Meditations on First Philosophy changed the primary object of philosophical thought and raised some of the most fundamental problems for foreigners such as Spinoza, Leibniz, Hume, Berkeley, and Kant.\n\nFrench philosophers produced some of the most important political works of the Age of Enlightenment. In The Spirit of the Laws, Baron de Montesquieu theorised the principle of separation of powers, which has been implemented in all liberal democracies since it was first applied in the United States. Voltaire came to embody the Enlightenment with his defence of civil liberties, such as the right to a free trial and freedom of religion.\n19th-century French thought was targeted at responding to the social malaise following the French Revolution. Rationalist philosophers such as Victor Cousin and Auguste Comte, who called for a new social doctrine, were opposed by reactionary thinkers such as Joseph de Maistre, Louis de Bonald and F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Robert de Lamennais, who blamed the rationalist rejection of traditional order. De Maistre is considered, together with the Englishman Edmund Burke, one of the founders of European conservatism, while Comte is regarded as the founder of positivism, which \u00c9mile Durkheim reformulated as a basis for social research.\nIn the 20th century, partly as a reaction to the perceived excesses of positivism, French spiritualism thrived with thinkers such as Henri Bergson and it influenced American pragmatism and Whitehead's version of process philosophy. Meanwhile, French epistemology became a prominent school of thought with Jules Henri Poincar\u00e9, Gaston Bachelard, Jean Cavaill\u00e8s and Jules Vuillemin. Influenced by German phenomenology and existentialism, the philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre gained a strong influence after World War II, and late-20th-century-France became the cradle of postmodern philosophy with Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nFrance has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed a number of talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Fran\u00e7ois Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the \"Roi Soleil\", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer for the harpsichord.\n\nFrench composers played an important role during the music of the 19th and early 20th century, which is considered to be the Romantic music era. Romantic music emphasised a surrender to nature, a fascination with the past and the supernatural, the exploration of unusual, strange and surprising sounds, and a focus on national identity. This period was also a golden age for operas. French composers from the Romantic era included: Hector Berlioz (best known for his Symphonie fantastique), Georges Bizet (best known for Carmen, which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas), Gabriel Faur\u00e9 (best known for his Pavane, Requiem, and nocturnes), Charles Gounod (best known for his Ave Maria and his opera Faust), Jacques Offenbach (best known for his 100 operettas of the 1850s\u20131870s and his uncompleted opera The Tales of Hoffmann), \u00c9douard Lalo (best known for his Symphonie espagnole for violin and orchestra and his Cello Concerto in D minor), Jules Massenet (best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty, the most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892)) and Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns (he has many frequently-performed works, including The Carnival of the Animals, Danse macabre, Samson and Delilah (Opera), Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and his Symphony No. 3).\n\nLater came precursors of modern classical music. \u00c9rik Satie was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian avant-garde, best known for his Gymnop\u00e9dies. Francis Poulenc's best known works are his piano suite Trois mouvements perp\u00e9tuels (1919), the ballet Les biches (1923), the Concert champ\u00eatre (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites (1957), and the Gloria (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed. Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. The two composers invented new musical forms and new sounds. Ravel's piano compositions, such as Jeux d'eau, Miroirs, Le tombeau de Couperin and Gaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the Rapsodie espagnole, Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9, his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and his orchestral work Bol\u00e9ro (1928). More recently, the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolutions of contemporary classical music.\n\nFrench music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music at the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as chanson fran\u00e7aise, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are \u00c9dith Piaf, Georges Brassens, L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg. Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries, bands such as Noir D\u00e9sir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira, or Shaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity.\nOther French artists with international careers have been popular in several countries, most notably female singers Dalida, Mireille Mathieu, Myl\u00e8ne Farmer, Aliz\u00e9e and Nolwenn Leroy, electronic music pioneers Jean-Michel Jarre, Laurent Garnier and Bob Sinclar, later Martin Solveig and David Guetta. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), electronic duos Daft Punk, Justice and Air also reached worldwide popularity and contributed to the reputation of modern electronic music in the world.Among current musical events and institutions in France, many are dedicated to classical music and operas. The most prestigious institutions are the state-owned Paris National Opera (with its two sites Palais Garnier and Op\u00e9ra Bastille), the Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole in Toulouse and the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux. As for music festivals, there are several events organised, the most popular being Eurock\u00e9ennes (a word play which sounds in French as \"European\"), Solidays and Rock en Seine. The F\u00eate de la Musique, imitated by many foreign cities, was first launched by the French Government in 1982. Major music halls and venues in France include Le Z\u00e9nith sites present in many cities and other places in Paris (Paris Olympia, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Mogador, \u00c9lys\u00e9e Montmartre).\n\n\n=== Cinema ===\n\nFrance has historical and strong links with cinema, with two Frenchmen, Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re (known as the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers) credited with creating cinema in 1895. The world's first female filmmaker, Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9, was also from France. Several important cinematic movements, including the late 1950s and 1960s Nouvelle Vague, began in the country. It is noted for having a strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the Government of France. France remains a leader in filmmaking, as of 2015 producing more films than any other European country. The nation also hosts the Cannes Festival, one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world.Apart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland (Roman Polanski, Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski), Argentina (Gaspar No\u00e9, Edgardo Cozarinsky), Russia (Alexandre Alexeieff, Anatole Litvak), Austria (Michael Haneke) and Georgia (G\u00e9la Babluani, Otar Iosseliani) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as Luc Besson, Jacques Tourneur or Francis Veber in the United States.\nAlthough the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan. French films account for 35% of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the United States, compared to 14% in Spain and 8% in the UK. France is in 2013 the 2nd exporter of films in the world after the United States.Until recently, France had for centuries been the cultural center of the world, although its dominant position has been surpassed by the United States. Subsequently, France takes steps in protecting and promoting its culture, becoming a leading advocate of the cultural exception. The nation succeeded in convincing all EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalised sectors of the WTO in 1993. Moreover, this decision was confirmed in a voting in the UNESCO in 2005: the principle of \"cultural exception\" won an overwhelming victory with 198 countries voting for it and only 2 countries, the United States and Israel, voting against.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\nFashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern \"haute couture\" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression Haute couture is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards.\nThe association of France with fashion and style (French: la mode) dates largely to the reign of Louis XIV when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. But France renewed its dominance of the high fashion (French: couture or haute couture) industry in the years 1860\u20131960 through the establishing of the great couturier houses such as Chanel, Dior, and Givenchy. The French perfume industry is world leader in its sector and is centered on the town of Grasse.In the 1960s, the elitist \"Haute couture\" came under criticism from France's youth culture. In 1966, the designer Yves Saint Laurent broke with established Haute Couture norms by launching a pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter (\"ready to wear\") line and expanding French fashion into mass manufacturing. With a greater focus on marketing and manufacturing, new trends were established by Sonia Rykiel, Thierry Mugler, Claude Montana, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Christian Lacroix in the 1970s and 1980s. The 1990s saw a conglomeration of many French couture houses under luxury giants and multinationals such as LVMH.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nBest-selling daily national newspapers in France are Le Parisien Aujourd'hui en France (with 460,000 sold daily), Le Monde and Le Figaro, with around 300,000 copies sold daily, but also L'\u00c9quipe, dedicated to sports coverage. In the past years, free dailies made a breakthrough, with Metro, 20 Minutes and Direct Plus distributed at more than 650,000 copies respectively. However, the widest circulations are reached by regional daily Ouest France with more than 750,000 copies sold, and the 50 other regional papers have also high sales. The sector of weekly magazines is stronger and diversified with more than 400 specialized weekly magazines published in the country.The most influential news magazines are the left-wing Le Nouvel Observateur, centrist L'Express and right-wing Le Point (more than 400.000 copies), but the highest circulation for weeklies is reached by TV magazines and by women's magazines, among them Marie Claire and ELLE, which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papers Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 and Charlie Hebdo, as well as Paris Match. Like in most industrialized nations, the print media have been affected by a severe crisis in the past decade. In 2008, the government launched a major initiative to help the sector reform and become financially independent, but in 2009 it had to give 600,000 euros to help the print media cope with the economic crisis, in addition to existing subsidies.\n\nIn 1974, after years of centralised monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency ORTF was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations remained under state-control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending state monopoly on radio. French television was partly liberalized in the next two-decade with the creation of several commercial channels, mainly thanks to cable and satellite television. In 2005 the national service T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Num\u00e9rique Terrestre introduced digital television all over the territory, allowing the creation of other channels.\nThe four existing national channels are owned by state-owned consortium France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, funded by advertising revenue and TV licence fees. Public broadcasting group Radio France run five national radio stations. Among these public media are Radio France Internationale, which broadcasts programs in French all over the world, and Franco-German TV channel TV5 Monde. In 2006, the government created global news channel France 24. Long-established TV channels TF1 (privatized in 1987), France 2 and France 3 have the highest shares, while radio stations RTL, Europe 1 and state-owned France Inter are the least listened to.\n\n\n=== Society ===\n\nAccording to a BBC poll in 2010, based on 29,977 responses in 28 countries, France is globally seen as a positive influence in the world's affairs: 49% have a positive view of the country's influence, whereas 19% have a negative view. The Nation Brand Index of 2008 suggested that France has the second best international reputation, only behind Germany. A global opinion poll for the BBC saw France ranked the fourth most positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany, Canada and the United Kingdom) in 2014.According to a poll in 2011, the French were found to have the highest level of religious tolerance and to be the country where the highest proportion of the population defines its identity primarily in term of nationality and not religion. As of 2011, 75% of French had a favourable view of the United States, making France one of the most pro-American countries in the world. As of 2017, the favourable view of the United States had dropped to 46%. In January 2010, the magazine International Living ranked France as \"best country to live in\", ahead of 193 other countries, for the fifth year running.The French Revolution continues to permeate the country's collective memory. The tricolour flag of France, the anthem \"La Marseillaise\", and the motto Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9, defined in Title 1 of the Constitution as national symbols, all emerged during the cultural ferment of the early revolution, along with Marianne, a common national personification. In addition, Bastille Day, the national holiday, commemorates the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789.A common and traditional symbol of the French people is the Gallic rooster. Its origins date back to Antiquity, since the Latin word Gallus meant both \"rooster\" and \"inhabitant of Gaul\". Then this figure gradually became the most widely shared representation of the French, used by French monarchs, then by the Revolution and under the successive republican regimes as representation of the national identity, used for some stamps and coins.France is one of the world leaders of gender equality in the workplace: as of 2017, it has 36.8% of its corporate board seats held by women, which makes it the leader of the G20 for that metric; and was ranked in 2019 by the World Bank as one of the only 6 countries in the world where women have the same work rights as men.France is one of the most liberal countries in the world when it comes to LGBT rights: a 2013 Pew Research Center poll found that 77% of the French think that same-sex relationships should be accepted by society, one of the highest acceptance rates in the world (comparable to that of other Western European nations). France legalized same-sex marriage and adoption in 2013. The government has used its diplomatic clout to support LGBT rights throughout the world, notably in the United Nations.France is also committed to protecting the environment: in 2018, France was ranked 2nd in the Environmental Performance Index (behind neighboring Switzerland), out of 180 countries ranked by Yale University in that study. Being the host country of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference, the French government was instrumental in securing the 2015 Paris agreement, a success that has been credited to its\"openness and experience in diplomacy\" (though the US, after the election of President Trump in 2016, then announced it will withdraw from the agreement).\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nFrench cuisine is renowned for being one of the finest in the world. According to the regions, traditional recipes are different, the North of the country prefers to use butter as the preferred fat for cooking, whereas olive oil is more commonly used in the South. Moreover, each region of France has iconic traditional specialities: Cassoulet in the Southwest, Choucroute in Alsace, Quiche in the Lorraine region, Beef bourguignon in the Bourgogne, proven\u00e7al Tapenade, etc. France's most renowned products are wines, including Champagne, Bordeaux, Bourgogne, and Beaujolais as well as a large variety of different cheeses, such as Camembert, Roquefort and Brie. There are more than 400 different varieties.A meal often consists of three courses, hors d'\u0153uvre or entr\u00e9e (introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), fromage (cheese course) and/or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Hors d'\u0153uvres could include terrine de saumon au basilic, lobster bisque, foie gras, French onion soup or a croque monsieur. The plat principal could include a pot au feu or steak frites. The dessert could be mille-feuille pastry, a macaron, an \u00e9clair, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, mousse au chocolat, cr\u00eapes, or Caf\u00e9 li\u00e9geois.\n\nFrench cuisine is also regarded as a key element of the quality of life and the attractiveness of France. A French publication, the Michelin guide, awards Michelin stars for excellence to a select few establishments. The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. By 2006, the Michelin Guide had awarded 620 stars to French restaurants, at that time more than any other country, although the guide also inspects more restaurants in France than in any other country (by 2010, Japan was awarded as many Michelin stars as France, despite having half the number of Michelin inspectors working there).In addition to its wine tradition, France is also a major producer of beer and rum. The three main French brewing regions are Alsace (60% of national production), Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Lorraine. France produces rum via distilleries located on islands such as Reunion Island in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nFrance hosts \"the world's biggest annual sporting event\", the Tour de France, and other popular sports played in France include: football, judo, tennis, rugby and p\u00e9tanque. France has hosted events such as the 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, and will host the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The country also hosted the 1960 European Nations' Cup, UEFA Euro 1984, UEFA Euro 2016 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. The Stade de France in Saint-Denis is France's largest stadium and was the venue for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup finals. Since 1903, France is famous for its 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car endurance race. Several major tennis tournaments take place in France, including the Paris Masters and the French Open, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments. French martial arts include Savate and Fencing.\n\nFrance has a close association with the Modern Olympic Games; it was a French aristocrat, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who suggested the Games' revival, at the end of the 19th century. After Athens was awarded the first Games, in reference to the Olympics' Greek origins, Paris hosted the second Games in 1900. Paris was the first home of the International Olympic Committee, before it moved to Lausanne. Since 1900, France has hosted the Olympics on 4 further occasions: the 1924 Summer Olympics, again in Paris and three Winter Games (1924 in Chamonix, 1968 in Grenoble and 1992 in Albertville).Similar to the Olympics, France introduced Olympics for the deaf people (Deaflympics) in 1924 with the idea of a French deaf car mechanic, Eug\u00e8ne Rubens-Alcais who paved the way to organise the inaugural edition of the Summer Deaflympics in Paris.Both the national football team and the national rugby union team are nicknamed \"Les Bleus\" in reference to the team's shirt colour as well as the national French tricolour flag. Football is the most popular sport in France, with over 1,800,000 registered players, and over 18,000 registered clubs. The football team is among the most successful in the world, with two FIFA World Cup victories in 1998 and 2018, one FIFA World Cup second place in 2006, and two UEFA European Championships in 1984 and 2000.\n\nThe top national football club competition is Ligue 1. France has produced some of the greatest players in the world, including three time FIFA World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane, three time Ballon d'Or recipient Michel Platini, record holder for most goals scored at a World Cup Just Fontaine, first football player to receive the L\u00e9gion d'honneur Raymond Kopa, and the record goalscorer for the French national team Thierry Henry.The French Open, also called Roland-Garros, is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early June at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris. It is the premier clay court tennis championship event in the world and the second of four annual Grand Slam tournaments.Rugby union is popular, particularly in Paris and the southwest of France. The national rugby union team has competed at every Rugby World Cup, and takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship. Stemming from a strong domestic league, the French rugby team has won 16 Six Nations Championships, including 8 grand slams; and has reached the semi-final of the Rugby World Cup 6 times, going on to the final 3 times.\nRugby league in France is mostly played and followed in the South of France, in cities such as Perpignan and Toulouse. The Catalans Dragons and Toulouse Olympique are the most notable clubs currently playing in the Super League and the RFL Championship is the top-tier rugby league competitions in Europe. The Elite One Championship is the professional competition for rugby league clubs in France.\nJudo is an important sport in France. It is the second country, after Japan, to have the most gold medals. Teddy Riner has won ten World Championships gold medals, the first and only judoka to do so, and David Douillet has won four, making them respectively the first and third top judokas in the world in terms of gold medals.\nIn recent decades, France has produced world-elite basketball players, most notably Tony Parker. The French National Basketball Team won gold at the FIBA EuroBasket 2013. The national team has won two Olympic Silver Medals: in 2000 and 1948.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nOutline of France\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"France.\" in Europe, edited by Ferdie McDonald and Claire Marsden, Dorling Kindersley, (Gale, 2010), pp. 144\u2013217. online\n\"France.\" in Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Nations, edited by Timothy L.

        "wiki": "Stefan Szczesny (born 9 April 1951) is a German painter, draughtsman, and sculptor.\nHe is best known for co-founding the Neue Wilde movement in the early 1980s.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== 1951\u20131994 ===\nStefan Szczesny was born in Munich as the son of the philosopher and publisher Gerhard Szczesny and his wife Martha Meuffel, a theatre producer. Upon attending primary and secondary schools in Munich, he acquired his first training as a painter at a private art school in Munich (1967\u20139). From 1969 to 1975, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. His mentor there was the abstract painter G\u00fcnter Fruhtrunk. During this time, he also attended lectures in art history and philosophy at Ludwig Maximilian University and worked as a freelance art critic.\nUnder the influence of his mentor Fruhtrunk Szczesny experimented in these years with abstract and minimalist art. A major turn-about occurred in 1975-76, when Szczesny was in Paris on a scholarship of the German Academic Exchange Service. The encounter there with the paintings of Delacroix caused Szczesny to rethink abstract and minimalist tenets and to return, eventually, to figuration.\nThe break was not immediate: in 1979, for instance, he exhibited relatively abstract paintings at the Kunstforum of the St\u00e4dtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus; many of the works created during a stay at the Villa Romana in Florence in 1980, too, display abstract features. Nonetheless, it was as a figurative painter that Szczesny eventually gained wide public attention, in particular as the organiser of, and participant in, the 1981 exhibition Rundschau Deutschland. Rundschau Deutschland brought together works of a number of young German-speaking figurative painters who later came to be known as the Neue Wilde.\nSzczesny was one of the protagonists of the Neue Wilde.  In 1982, he participated in a number of \"Neue Wilde\"-related exhibitions, such as \"5 aus K\u00f6ln\" (\"5 from Cologne\", with Walter Dahn, Jiri Dokoupil, Gerhard Kever and Andreas Schulze) and \"Die neue K\u00fcnstlergruppe Die wilde Malerei\" (\"The new group of painters: Wild painting\"), both in Cologne. From 1984 to 1988, he edited the journal \"Malerei. Peinture. Painting\", which offered an important forum for the new figurative painters.\nMore than other Neue Wilde painters, however, Szczesny was (and still is) interested in art historical tradition. In a 1985 interview, for instance, Szczesny remarked: \"If C\u00e9zanne paints Bathers, whom Titian, Delacroix and Courbet had painted before, and Renoir paints them and Picasso paints them again, and Matisse paints them again, then Szczesny, too, paints them again!\" It is in line with this declaration that in 1982/83, the year after the Neue Wilden explosion, Szczesny \u2013 in Rome at the time, as the recipient of the Rome Prize of the Prussian Academy of Arts \u2013 turned his attention to the roots of European art. He created a series of \"Roman paintings\" exploring the world of Greco-Roman myth. Similarly, in 1984 he created a number of paintings focusing on the (Ovidian) theme of metamorphosis; these were exhibited in one of Szczesny's largest early exhibitions, alongside ancient sculpture at the Glyptothek and Staatliche Antikensammlung in Munich.\nThe first comprehensive retrospective of Szczesny's work followed in 1988, curated by Klaus Honneff at the Rheinisches Landesmuseum in Bonn.\nIn late 80s and early 90s, Szczesny's work was shown in many exhibitions. The artist, during these years, discovered his love of the Caribbean, evinced for instance in his Jamaica paintings of 1990. But Szczesny was engaged in other projects, too. For instance, he painted a series of portraits of personal \"culture heroes\", from Bach to James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Glenn Gould and Jimi Hendrix. He also created comprehensive stage designs (e.g. for Gert Pfafferodt's production of Schiller's \"Kabale und Liebe\").\n\n\n=== 1994\u20132001 ===\nIn 1994, Szczesny relocated to New York, setting up his studio at 12 Warren Street. The exposure to the New York art scene (post Andy Warhol) had an important effect on the artist. He began better to understand art as a professional business. One of the results was the founding, in 1996, of the \"Szczesny Factory\". The Factory is modelled on the large-scale workshops of the Italian Renaissance and Warhol's Factory. It has since allowed him wide-ranging activities, including book publications, architectural projects and collaborations with fashion labels (such as Escada).\nTwo major art projects implemented during these years (and in the Szczesny Factory framework) were the \"Kempinski Art Project\" in 1998, which involved the comprehensive artistic design of the Kempinski Hotel Bahia in Estepona/Marbella; and the \"Living Planet\" art project at the Expo 2000 in Hanover, which involved the creation of twelve painted murals, with dimensions of H 300 x W 830 cm each, depicting a map of life and suggesting the importance of protecting endangered species.\nIn the mid-90s, Szczesny also began visiting the island of Mustique. He has travelled there regularly since and has created a number of Mustique-inspired paintings. His relation to Mustique is documented in his book on Mustique (2002).\n\n\n=== 2001\u20132010 ===\nIn 2001, Szczesy moved to Saint-Tropez in South France. In view of Szczesny's love of nature and the Mediterranean. In taking it, he also continued the tradition of painters such as Paul Signac or Henri Matisse who had lived and worked in Saint-Tropez.\n\nIn 2001/02, Szczesy spent some time in a studio in Seville, Spain, where he created a number of Flamenco-inspired artworks. In 2002, a film documenting his achievements (\"Szczesny \u2013 The film\", directed by the Austro-American director Curt Faudon) was presented at the 55th Cannes Film Festival. In 2005, Szczesny began producing his so-called \"shadow sculptures\", cut from black steel plates and depicting lush vegetation and sensual female figures as symbols of life. In 2007, the exhibition \"Mainau \u2013 The dream of an earthly paradise\" offered a comprehensive overview of Szczesny's wide-ranging artistic output. On the occasion, Szczesny transformed Mainau island into a total work of art, creating a large number of ceramics in various shapes and sizes, large glass stelae and many other objects, including a bridge and a painted zeppelin NT. In 2008, Szczesny began work on a series of \"golden paintings\"; in these, Szczesny uses the powerful symbol that is gold and its associations with bounty and glory to celebrate life's beauty. In 2010, Szczesny opened his large new studio in Saint-Tropez.\n\n\n=== 2011\u2013present ===\nIn 2011, Szczesny began to collaborate with the car company Jaguar, as the company's brand ambassador. The collaboration has allowed the artist to realise major art projects. In 2011, Jaguar presented an exhibition of Szczesny's shadow sculptures in St. Moritz, on Sylt and in Saint-Tropez. In 2012, around a large number of sculptures, ceramics and paintings were shown in Frankfurt (and in particular in Frankfurt\u2019s Palmengarten).\nIn 2014, a retrospective of the work of Stefan Szczesny is hosted at the Palais des Papes in Avignon.\nIn 2017 the Citadelle de Saint-Tropez hosted a comprehensive sculpture retrospective 2005-2017 by Stefan Szczesny.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n\n=== Single exhibitions (selection) ===\n1976 Goethe-Institut, Paris, France\n1979 \"Seven Paintings\", St\u00e4dtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus, Kunstforum M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany\n1980 \"Perspektiven \u201880\", Art II, Basel, Switzerland\n1981 \"Works on paper 1977\u201381\", Galerie Friedrich and Knust, Munich, Germany\n1983 \"Immagini Romane\", Villa Massimo, Rome, Italy\n1984 \"Metamorphoses\", Glyptothek und Staatliche Antikensammlung, Munich, Germany\n1985 \"Paintings and works on paper\", Kunstverein Pforzheim, Reuchlinhaus, Germany\n1988 \"Szczesny 1978-1987\", Rheinisches Landesmuseum, Bonn, Germany\n1989 \"Works on paper\", Goethe Institut, Madrid, Spain\n1990 \"Paintings and works on paper 1969-1989\", Kunstverein Mannheim, Germany\n1991 \"Portraits (Idols - Myths - Models)\", Kunstverein Heidelberg, Germany\n1992 \"L\u2019annunziazione della Pittura\", Arte Contemporanea Hirmer & Museo Comunale, Greve/Chianti, Italy\n1992 \"Portraits\", Kunsthalle Bremen, Germany\n1993 \"Caribbean Style\", Neue Galerie der Stadt Linz, Austria (later at Lok Gallery, New York)\n1994 \"Portraits\", Nikki Diana Marquardt Gallery, Paris, France\n1994 \"Portraits of Musicians\", K\u00f6lner Philharmonie, Cologne, Germany\n1996 \"Eva dancing with the mirror\", Fassbender Fine Art, Chicago, USA\n1997 \"Szczesny, 1975\u20131996\", Haus am L\u00fctzowplatz, Berlin, Germany\n1997 Ceramics, Badisches Landesmuseum, Karlsruhe, Germany\n1997 Paintings and ceramics, Gerhard-Marcks-Haus, Bremen, Germany\n1998 \u201eSzczesny - C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur\", Kunsthalle Emden, Germany\n1998 \"La joie de vivre\", Museo del Grabado Espa\u00f1ol Contempor\u00e1neo, Marbella, Spain\n1999 \"C\u00f4te d\u2018Azur\", Museum Moderner Kunst, W\u00f6rlen - Passau, Germany\n1999 \"Painting meets photography\", Fondazione Levi, Venice, Italy\n1999 \"Szczesny.

          "A very extensive exhibition of Marina Picasso's inheritance of her Grandfather's Nudes. Worth seeing. Wander through the rooms, pondering Picasso's sense of passion of the female being. Friendly and very helpful staff. Also boasts a little shop where one can buy various art"

        "wiki": "Cannes (; French: [kan]; Occitan: Canas) is a city located on the French Riviera. It is a commune located in the Alpes-Maritimes department, and host city of the annual Cannes Film Festival, Midem, and Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. The city is known for its association with the rich and famous, its luxury hotels and restaurants, and for several conferences. On 3 November 2011 it hosted the 2011 G20 summit.\n\n\n== History ==\nBy the 2nd century BC, the Ligurian Oxybii established a settlement here known as Aegitna (Ancient Greek: \u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bd\u03b1). Historians are unsure what the name means. The area was a fishing village used as a port of call between the L\u00e9rins Islands.\n\nIn 154 BC, it became the scene of violent but quick conflict between the troops of Quintus Opimius and the Oxybii.In the 10th century, the town was known as Canua. The name may derive from \"canna\", a reed. Canua was probably the site of a small Ligurian port, and later a Roman outpost on Le Suquet hill, suggested by Roman tombs discovered here. Le Suquet housed an 11th-century tower, which overlooked swamps where the city now stands. Most of the ancient activity, especially protection, was on the L\u00e9rins Islands, and the history of Cannes is closely tied to the history of the islands.\nAn attack by the Saracens in 891, who remained until the end of the 10th century, devastated the country around Canua. The insecurity of the L\u00e9rins islands forced the monks to settle on the mainland, at the Suquet. Construction of a castle in 1035 fortified the city by then known as Cannes, and at the end of the 11th century construction was started on two towers on the L\u00e9rins islands. One took a century to build.\nAround 1530, Cannes detached from the monks who had controlled the city for hundreds of years and became independent.\nDuring the 18th century, both the Spanish and British tried to gain control of the L\u00e9rins Islands but were chased away by the French. The islands were later controlled by many, such as Jean-Honor\u00e9 Alziary and the Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus. They had many different purposes: at the end of the 19th century, one served as hospital for soldiers wounded in the Crimean War.\nHenry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux bought land at the Croix des Gardes and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise. His work to improve living conditions attracted the English aristocracy, who also built winter residences.\nAt the end of the 19th century, several railways were completed, which prompted the arrival of streetcars. In Cannes, projects such as the Boulevard Carnot and the rue d'Antibes were carried out. After the closure of the Casino des Fleurs (h\u00f4tel Gallia), a luxury establishment was built for the rich winter clientele, the Casino Municipal next to the pier Albert-Edouard. This casino was demolished and replaced by the new Palace in 1979.\nIn the 20th century, new luxury hotels such as the Carlton, Majestic, Martinez, and JW Marriott Cannes were built. The city was modernised with a sports centre, a post office, and schools. There were fewer British and German tourists after the First World War, but more Americans. Winter tourism gave way to summer tourism, and the summer casino at the Palm Beach was constructed.\nThe city council had the idea of starting an international film festival shortly before World War II. The first opened on 20 September 1946, held in the Casino Municipal.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nCannes has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa) and the city enjoys 11 hours of sunshine per day during summer (July), while in winter (December to February) the weather is mild. Both seasons see a relatively low rainfall and most rain occurs during October and November, when 110 mm (4.3 in) falls.\nCannes summers are long and warm, with summer daytime temperatures regularly hitting 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), while average temperatures are about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Temperatures remain high from June to September, the busiest time of the year.\nMean temperatures drop below 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) for only three months of the year (December to February). The spring and autumn are also warm, although more suited to those who prefer slightly cooler weather.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nThe Promenade de la Croisette is the waterfront avenue with palm trees. La Croisette is known for picturesque beaches, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, boutiques and luxury hotels. Le Suquet, the old town, provides a good view of La Croisette. The fortified tower and Chapel of St Anne house the Mus\u00e9e de la Castre. A distinctive building in Cannes is the Russian Orthodox church.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\n\n=== Villas ===\nCannes of the 19th century can still be seen in its grand villas, built to reflect the wealth and standing of their owners and inspired by anything from medieval castles to Roman villas. They are not open to the public. Lord Brougham's Italianate Villa El\u00e9onore Louise (one of the first in Cannes) was built between 1835 and 1839. Also known as the Quartier des Anglais, this is the oldest residential area in Cannes. Another landmark is the Villa Fi\u00e9sole (known today as the Villa Domergue) designed by Jean-Gabriel Domergue in the style of Fiesole, near Florence, which may be visited on appointment.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite ===\n\nIt took the Man in the Iron Mask 11 years to leave the tiny, forested St Marguerite Island. The mysterious individual was believed to be of noble blood, but his identity has never been proven. His cell can be visited in the Fort of St Marguerite, now renamed the Mus\u00e9e de la Mer (Museum of the Sea). This museum also houses discoveries from shipwrecks off the island, including Roman (1st century BC) and Saracen (10th century AD) ceramics.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Saint-Honorat ===\n\nCistercian monks are the only inhabitants of the smaller, southern St Honorat Island. Monks have inhabited the island since AD 410 and, at the height of their powers, owned Cannes, Mougins, and Vallauris. Medieval vestiges remain in the stark church, which is open to the public, and in the ruins of the 11th-century monastery on the sea shore. The monks inhabit the L\u00e9rins Abbey and divide their time between prayer and producing red and white wines.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire de Provence houses artifacts from prehistoric to present, in an 18th-century mansion. The Mus\u00e9e de la Castre has objects from the Pacific Atolls, Peruvian relics and Mayan pottery. Other venues include the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, Mus\u00e9e de la Mer, Mus\u00e9e de la Photographie and Mus\u00e9e International de la Parfumerie.\n\n\n=== Theatre and music ===\nCannes is not renowned for traditional theatre. However, small venues stage productions and host short sketches during the annual International Actors' Performance Festival. Popular theaters include the Espace Miramar and the Alexandre III.\n\n\n=== Festivals and show events ===\nThe Cannes Film Festival founded in 1946 is held annually, usually in May, at the Palais des Festivals et des Congr\u00e8s.\nThe Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity is a global event and awards show for those working in advertising and related fields, held annually in June.\nMidem, the foremost trade show for the music industry.\nMIPIM, the world's largest property-related trade show.\nCarnival on the Riviera is an annual parade through the streets to mark the 21-day period prior to Shrove Tuesday.\nThe International Festival of Games is festival of bridge, belote, backgammon, chess, draughts, tarot and more (February).\nCannes Yachting Festival is an event for boating enthusiasts in the Vieux Port (September).\nThe International Actors' Performance Festival: comedy sketches and performances by fringe artists\nThe International Luxury Travel Market brings together under one roof the top international luxury travel providers and suppliers from all around the world.[1]\nLe Festival d'Art Pyrotechnique is a magnificent annual fireworks competition held in the summer at the Bay of Cannes.\nThe Global Champions Tour showjumping league has an annual event in the ports of Cannes.\nMipcom and MIPTV, held in October and April respectively, the world's most important trade markets for the television industry.\nThe Pan-African Film Festival, held in early April and featuring films from the African diaspora.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe area around Cannes has developed into a high-tech cluster. The technopolis of Sophia Antipolis lies in the hills beyond Cannes. The Film Festival is a major event for the industry which takes place every year during the month of May. In addition, Cannes hosts other major annual events such as the MIPIM, MIPTV, MIDEM, Cannes Lions, and the NRJ Music Awards.  There is an annual television festival in the last week in September.\nThe economic environment is based on tourism, business fairs, trade and aviation. Cannes has 6,500 companies, of which 3,000 are traders, artisans and service providers. In 2006, 421 new companies were registered.\nCannes hosts the Cannes Mandelieu Space Center, headquarters of Thales Alenia Space, the first European satellite manufacturer.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nCannes is home to football side AS Cannes.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nNice C\u00f4te d'Azur AirportLocated 24 km (15 mi) from Cannes, Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport has close to 10 million passengers a year.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite (pronounced [il s\u025b\u0303t ma\u0281\u0261(\u0259)\u0281it]) is the largest of the L\u00e9rins Islands, about half a mile off shore from the French Riviera town of Cannes.  The island is approximately 3 kilometres (1.9 miles) in length (east to west) and 900 metres (0.56 miles) across.\nThe island is most famous for its fortress prison (the Fort Royal), in which the so-called Man in the Iron Mask was held in the 17th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe island is first known to have been inhabited during Roman times, when it was known by the name Lero. The island was probably renamed in medieval times by crusaders, who built a chapel to Saint Margaret of Antioch on the island. In the 14th century, probably due to the writings of Raymond F\u00e9raud, the island became associated with a fictional Sainte Marguerite, sister to Saint Honoratus, founder of the monastery on the neighbouring \u00cele Saint-Honorat. According to legend, Sainte Marguerite led a community of nuns on the island which was named after her.\nIn 1612, ownership of the island passed from the monks of Saint-Honorat to Claude de Lorraine, Duke of Chevreuse. Shortly after, construction of a fort on the island (to become the Fort Royal) began. In 1635, the island was captured by the Spanish and recaptured by the French two years later.\nTowards the end of the 17th century, the Fort Royal became home to a barracks and state prison. During the 18th century, the present-day village of Sainte-Marguerite developed, thriving on the spending power of the soldiers stationed on the island.\nThe Fort Royal was home to a number of famous prisoners until its closure in the 20th century. As well as the Man in the Iron Mask, a mysterious prisoner whose identity remains unknown, Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri (an Algerian rebel leader), Marquis Jouffroy d\u2019Abbans (inventor of the steamboat) and Marshal Bazaine (the only successful escapee from the island) have all spent time there.\n\n\n== Present ==\n\nA fifteen-minute boat ride from Cannes, the \u00cele de Sainte-Marguerite is low in profile and heavily wooded with umbrella pines and eucalyptus. Both islands (with the \u00cele Saint-Honorat) are looked after by the Office national des for\u00eats, and are a popular tourist attraction of natural interest.\nDuring the summer months, a large number of boats moor in the shallow, protected \"Plateau du Milieu\", between the islands or on the landward side of Sainte-Marguerite where there is more room for water skiing, parascending and other popular water sports.\nThe village of Sainte-Marguerite is made up of about twenty buildings. Most of these are home to fishermen, but there is also a small boatyard and one or two establishments offering refreshments to tourists. The island's hotel has been closed down since the summer of 2005.\nThe historic Fort Royal now houses a youth hostel and a Museum of the Sea, featuring items recovered from ancient Roman and Saracen shipwrecks. Visitors are also able to view a number of former prison cells (including that occupied by the Man in the Iron Mask) and a Roman cistern room.\nClose to the Fort Royal is a small cemetery for French soldiers who died there when it was used for convalescence during the Crimean War, and alongside it is a cemetery for North African soldiers killed on the Allied side during World War II.\nIt was in the news recently because the Indian businessman Vijay Mallya, owner of the Formula 1 team Force India and the Indian Premier League team Royal Challengers Bangalore, purchased \u201cLe Grand Jardin,\u201d or \u201cThe Large Garden\u201d, a unique piece of luxury real estate on the Island of Sainte-Marguerite, for between \u20ac37 million and \u20ac43 million ($53\u201361 million US).\nThe island is served all year round by a regular commercial ferry service from Cannes.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Cannes (; French: [kan]; Occitan: Canas) is a city located on the French Riviera. It is a commune located in the Alpes-Maritimes department, and host city of the annual Cannes Film Festival, Midem, and Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. The city is known for its association with the rich and famous, its luxury hotels and restaurants, and for several conferences. On 3 November 2011 it hosted the 2011 G20 summit.\n\n\n== History ==\nBy the 2nd century BC, the Ligurian Oxybii established a settlement here known as Aegitna (Ancient Greek: \u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bd\u03b1). Historians are unsure what the name means. The area was a fishing village used as a port of call between the L\u00e9rins Islands.\n\nIn 154 BC, it became the scene of violent but quick conflict between the troops of Quintus Opimius and the Oxybii.In the 10th century, the town was known as Canua. The name may derive from \"canna\", a reed. Canua was probably the site of a small Ligurian port, and later a Roman outpost on Le Suquet hill, suggested by Roman tombs discovered here. Le Suquet housed an 11th-century tower, which overlooked swamps where the city now stands. Most of the ancient activity, especially protection, was on the L\u00e9rins Islands, and the history of Cannes is closely tied to the history of the islands.\nAn attack by the Saracens in 891, who remained until the end of the 10th century, devastated the country around Canua. The insecurity of the L\u00e9rins islands forced the monks to settle on the mainland, at the Suquet. Construction of a castle in 1035 fortified the city by then known as Cannes, and at the end of the 11th century construction was started on two towers on the L\u00e9rins islands. One took a century to build.\nAround 1530, Cannes detached from the monks who had controlled the city for hundreds of years and became independent.\nDuring the 18th century, both the Spanish and British tried to gain control of the L\u00e9rins Islands but were chased away by the French. The islands were later controlled by many, such as Jean-Honor\u00e9 Alziary and the Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus. They had many different purposes: at the end of the 19th century, one served as hospital for soldiers wounded in the Crimean War.\nHenry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux bought land at the Croix des Gardes and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise. His work to improve living conditions attracted the English aristocracy, who also built winter residences.\nAt the end of the 19th century, several railways were completed, which prompted the arrival of streetcars. In Cannes, projects such as the Boulevard Carnot and the rue d'Antibes were carried out. After the closure of the Casino des Fleurs (h\u00f4tel Gallia), a luxury establishment was built for the rich winter clientele, the Casino Municipal next to the pier Albert-Edouard. This casino was demolished and replaced by the new Palace in 1979.\nIn the 20th century, new luxury hotels such as the Carlton, Majestic, Martinez, and JW Marriott Cannes were built. The city was modernised with a sports centre, a post office, and schools. There were fewer British and German tourists after the First World War, but more Americans. Winter tourism gave way to summer tourism, and the summer casino at the Palm Beach was constructed.\nThe city council had the idea of starting an international film festival shortly before World War II. The first opened on 20 September 1946, held in the Casino Municipal.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nCannes has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa) and the city enjoys 11 hours of sunshine per day during summer (July), while in winter (December to February) the weather is mild. Both seasons see a relatively low rainfall and most rain occurs during October and November, when 110 mm (4.3 in) falls.\nCannes summers are long and warm, with summer daytime temperatures regularly hitting 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), while average temperatures are about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Temperatures remain high from June to September, the busiest time of the year.\nMean temperatures drop below 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) for only three months of the year (December to February). The spring and autumn are also warm, although more suited to those who prefer slightly cooler weather.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nThe Promenade de la Croisette is the waterfront avenue with palm trees. La Croisette is known for picturesque beaches, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, boutiques and luxury hotels. Le Suquet, the old town, provides a good view of La Croisette. The fortified tower and Chapel of St Anne house the Mus\u00e9e de la Castre. A distinctive building in Cannes is the Russian Orthodox church.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\n\n=== Villas ===\nCannes of the 19th century can still be seen in its grand villas, built to reflect the wealth and standing of their owners and inspired by anything from medieval castles to Roman villas. They are not open to the public. Lord Brougham's Italianate Villa El\u00e9onore Louise (one of the first in Cannes) was built between 1835 and 1839. Also known as the Quartier des Anglais, this is the oldest residential area in Cannes. Another landmark is the Villa Fi\u00e9sole (known today as the Villa Domergue) designed by Jean-Gabriel Domergue in the style of Fiesole, near Florence, which may be visited on appointment.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite ===\n\nIt took the Man in the Iron Mask 11 years to leave the tiny, forested St Marguerite Island. The mysterious individual was believed to be of noble blood, but his identity has never been proven. His cell can be visited in the Fort of St Marguerite, now renamed the Mus\u00e9e de la Mer (Museum of the Sea). This museum also houses discoveries from shipwrecks off the island, including Roman (1st century BC) and Saracen (10th century AD) ceramics.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Saint-Honorat ===\n\nCistercian monks are the only inhabitants of the smaller, southern St Honorat Island. Monks have inhabited the island since AD 410 and, at the height of their powers, owned Cannes, Mougins, and Vallauris. Medieval vestiges remain in the stark church, which is open to the public, and in the ruins of the 11th-century monastery on the sea shore. The monks inhabit the L\u00e9rins Abbey and divide their time between prayer and producing red and white wines.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire de Provence houses artifacts from prehistoric to present, in an 18th-century mansion.

        "wiki": "Benjamin G\u00e9za Affleck-Boldt (born August 15, 1972) is an American actor and filmmaker. His accolades include two Academy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards. He began his career as a child when he starred in the PBS educational series The Voyage of the Mimi (1984, 1988). He later appeared in the independent coming-of-age comedy Dazed and Confused (1993) and various Kevin Smith films, including Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997) and Dogma (1999). Affleck gained wider recognition when he and childhood friend Matt Damon won the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for writing Good Will Hunting (1997), which they also starred in. He then established himself as a leading man in studio films, including the disaster film Armageddon (1998), the war drama Pearl Harbor (2001), and the thrillers The Sum of All Fears and Changing Lanes (both 2002).\nAfter a career downturn, during which he appeared in Daredevil and Gigli (both 2003), Affleck received a Golden Globe nomination for portraying George Reeves in the noir biopic Hollywoodland (2006). His directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone (2007), which he also co-wrote, was well received. He then directed, co-wrote and starred in the crime drama The Town (2010) and directed and starred in the political thriller Argo (2012). For the latter, Affleck won the Golden Globe and BAFTA Award for Best Director, and the Golden Globe, BAFTA, and Academy Award for Best Picture. He starred in the psychological thriller Gone Girl (2014), in the superhero films Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and Justice League (2017), and in the action thrillers The Accountant (2016) and Triple Frontier (2019). He received praise for his performance as a recovering alcoholic in the sports drama The Way Back (2020).\nAffleck is the co-founder of the Eastern Congo Initiative, a grantmaking and advocacy-based nonprofit organization. He is also a stalwart supporter of the Democratic Party. Affleck and Damon are co-owners of the production company Pearl Street Films.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBenjamin G\u00e9za Affleck-Boldt was born on August 15, 1972 in Berkeley, California. His family moved to Massachusetts when he was three, living in Falmouth, where his brother Casey was born, before settling in Cambridge. His mother, Christopher Anne \"Chris\" Boldt, was a Harvard-educated elementary school teacher. His father, Timothy Byers Affleck, was an aspiring playwright who made a living as a carpenter, auto mechanic, bookie, electrician, bartender, and janitor at Harvard. In the mid-1960s, he had been an actor and stage manager with the Theater Company of Boston. During Affleck's childhood, his father had a self-described \"severe, chronic problem with alcoholism\", and Affleck has recalled him drinking \"all day ... every day\". His father was \"very difficult\" to live with and he felt a sense of \"relief\" at the age of 11 when his parents divorced, and his father left the family home. His father continued to drink heavily and eventually became homeless, spending two years living on the streets of Cambridge. When Affleck was 16, his father entered a rehabilitation facility in Indio, California. He lived at the facility for twelve years to maintain his sobriety, and worked there as an addiction counselor.Affleck was raised in a politically active, liberal household. He and his brother, Casey, were surrounded by people who worked in the arts, regularly attended theater performances with their mother, and were encouraged to make their own home movies. David Wheeler, a family friend, later remembered Affleck as a \"very bright and intensely curious\" child. The brothers auditioned for roles in local commercials and film productions because of their mother's friendship with a Cambridge-area casting director, and Affleck first acted professionally at the age of seven. His mother saved his wages in a college trust fund, and hoped her son would ultimately become a teacher, worrying that acting was an insecure and \"frivolous\" profession. When Affleck was 13, he filmed a children's television program in Mexico. He learned to speak Spanish during a year spent travelling around the country with his mother and brother.As a Cambridge Rindge and Latin high school student, Affleck acted in theater productions and was inspired by drama teacher Gerry Speca. He became close friends with fellow student Matt Damon, whom he had known since the age of eight. Although Damon was two years older, the pair had \"identical interests\" and both wanted to pursue acting careers. They traveled to New York together for acting auditions and saved money for train and airline tickets in a joint bank account. While Affleck had high SAT scores, he was an unfocused student with poor attendance. He spent a few months studying Spanish at the University of Vermont, chosen because of its proximity to his then-girlfriend, but left after fracturing his hip while playing basketball. At 18, Affleck moved to Los Angeles, studying Middle Eastern affairs at Occidental College for a year and a half.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1981\u20131997: Child acting and Good Will Hunting ===\n\nAffleck acted professionally throughout his childhood but, in his own words, \"not in the sense that I had a mom that wanted to take me to Hollywood or a family that wanted to make money from me ... I kind of chanced into something.\" He first appeared, at the age of seven, in a local independent film called Dark Side of the Street (1981), directed by a family friend. His biggest success as a child actor was as the star of the PBS children's series The Voyage of the Mimi (1984) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988), produced for sixth-grade science classes. Affleck worked \"sporadically\" on Mimi from the age of eight to fifteen in both Massachusetts and Mexico. As a teenager, he appeared in the ABC after school special Wanted: A Perfect Man (1986), the television film Hands of a Stranger (1987), and a 1989 Burger King commercial.After high school, Affleck moved briefly to New York in search of acting work. Later, while studying at Occidental College in Los Angeles, Affleck directed student films. As an actor, he had a series of \"knock-around parts, one to the next\". He played Patrick Duffy's son in the television film Daddy (1991), made an uncredited appearance as a basketball player in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer film (1992), and had a supporting role as a prep school student in School Ties (1992). He played a high school quarterback in the NBC television series Against the Grain (1993), and a steroid-abusing high school football player in Body to Die For: The Aaron Henry Story (1994). Affleck's most notable role during this period was as a high school bully in Richard Linklater's cult classic Dazed and Confused (1993). Linklater wanted a likeable actor for the villainous role and, while Affleck was \"big and imposing,\" he was \"so smart and full of life ... I just liked him.\" Affleck later said Linklater was instrumental in demystifying the filmmaking process for him.Affleck's first starring film role was as an aimless art student in the college drama Glory Daze (1995), with Stephen Holden of The New York Times remarking that his \"affably mopey performance finds just the right balance between obnoxious and sad sack\". He then played a bully in filmmaker Kevin Smith's comedy Mallrats (1995), and became friends with Smith during the filming. Affleck had begun to worry that he would be relegated to a career of \"throwing people into their lockers\", but Smith wrote him a lead role in the romantic comedy Chasing Amy (1997). The film was Affleck's breakthrough. Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Affleck's \"wonderful ease\" playing the role, combining \"suave good looks with cool comic timing\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly described it as a \"wholesome and quick-witted\" performance. When Affleck starred as a recently returned Korean War veteran in the coming-of-age drama Going All the Way (1997), Todd McCarthy of Variety found him \"excellent\", while Janet Maslin of The New York Times noted that his \"flair for comic self-doubt made a strong impression.\"\n\nThe success of 1997's Good Will Hunting, which Affleck co-wrote and acted in, marked a turning point in his career. The screenplay originated in 1992 when Damon wrote a 40-page script for a playwriting class at Harvard University. He asked Affleck to act out the scenes with him in front of the class and, when Damon later moved into Affleck's Los Angeles apartment, they began working on the script in earnest. The film, which they wrote mainly during improvisation sessions, was set partly in their hometown of Cambridge, and drew from their own experiences. They sold the screenplay to Castle Rock in 1994 when Affleck was 22 years old. During the development process, they received notes from industry figures including Rob Reiner and William Goldman. Following a lengthy dispute with Castle Rock about a suitable director, Affleck and Damon persuaded Miramax to purchase the screenplay. The two friends moved back to Boston for a year before the film finally went into production, directed by Gus Van Sant, and co-starring Damon, Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Robin Williams. On its release, Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the \"smart and touching screenplay\", while Emanuel Levy of Variety found it \"funny, nonchalant, moving and angry\". Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote that Affleck brought \"a beautifully nuanced tenderness\" to his role as the working-class friend of Damon's mathematical prodigy character. Affleck and Damon eventually won both the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Affleck has described this period of his life as \"dreamlike\": \"It was like one of those scenes in an old movie when a newspaper comes spinning out of the black on to the screen. You know, '$100 Million Box Office! Awards!' \" He remains the youngest writer (at age 25) to ever win an Oscar for screenwriting.\n\n\n=== 1998\u20132002: Leading man status ===\n\nArmageddon, released in 1998, established Affleck as a viable leading man for Hollywood studio films. Good Will Hunting had not yet been released during the casting process and, after Affleck's screen test, director Michael Bay dismissed him as \"a geek\". He was convinced by producer Jerry Bruckheimer that Affleck would be a star, but the actor was required to lose weight, become tanned, and get his teeth capped before filming began. The film, where he starred opposite Bruce Willis as a blue-collar driller tasked by NASA with stopping an asteroid from colliding with Earth, was a box office success. Daphne Merkin of The New Yorker remarked: \"Affleck demonstrates a sexy Paul Newmanish charm and is clearly bound for stardom.\" Later in 1998, Affleck had a supporting role as an arrogant English actor in the period romantic comedy Shakespeare in Love, starring his then-girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow. Lael Loewenstein of Variety remarked that Affleck \"does some of his very best work, suggesting that comedy may be his true calling,\" while Janet Maslin of The New York Times found him \"very funny\". Shakespeare in Love won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, while the cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast. Affleck then appeared as a small-town sheriff in the supernatural horror film Phantoms. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wondered why actors like Affleck and Peter O'Toole had agreed to appear in the \"junky\" film: \"Affleck's thudding performance suggests he is reading his dialogue for the first time, directly from cue cards.\"Affleck and Damon had an on-screen reunion in Kevin Smith's religious satire Dogma (after having appeared in Smith's previous films, Mallrats and Chasing Amy), which premiered at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. Janet Maslin of The New York Times remarked that the pair, playing fallen angels, \"bring great, understandable enthusiasm to Mr. Smith's smart talk and wild imaginings\". Affleck starred opposite Sandra Bullock in the romantic comedy Forces of Nature (1999), playing a groom whose attempts to get to his wedding are complicated by his free-spirited traveling companion. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly remarked that Affleck \"has the fast-break charm you want in a screwball hero,\" while Joe Leydon of Variety praised \"his winning ability to play against his good looks in a self-effacing comic turn\". Affleck then appeared opposite Courtney Love in the little-seen ensemble comedy 200 Cigarettes (1999).Interested in a directorial career, Affleck shadowed John Frankenheimer throughout pre-production of the action thriller Reindeer Games (2000). Frankenheimer, directing his last feature film, described Affleck as having \"a very winning, likable quality about him. I've been doing this for a long time and he's really one of the nicest.\" He starred opposite Charlize Theron as a hardened criminal, with Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times enjoying the unexpected casting choice: \"Affleck often suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent ... He looks as if he has never missed a party or a night's sleep. He's game, though, and his slight dislocation works to the advantage of Reindeer Games.\" He then had a supporting role as a ruthless stockbroker in the crime drama Boiler Room (2000). A.O. Scott of The New York Times felt Affleck had \"traced over\" Alec Baldwin's performance in Glengarry Glen Ross, while Peter Rainer of New York Magazine said he \"does a series of riffs on Baldwin's aria, and each one is funnier and crueler than the next\". He then provided the voice of Joseph in the animated Joseph: King of Dreams. In his last film role of 2000, Affleck starred opposite his girlfriend Paltrow in the romantic drama Bounce. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the \"understated intensity and exquisite detail\" of his performance: \"His portrait of a young, sarcastically self-defined 'people person' who isn't half as confident as he would like to appear is close to definitive.\"Affleck reunited with director Michael Bay for the critically derided war drama Pearl Harbor (2001). A.O. Scott of The New York Times felt Affleck and Kate Beckinsale \"do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars\". However, Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote \"the blandly handsome Affleck couldn't convince that he'd ever so much as been turned down for a date, much less lost the love of his life to his best friend\". Affleck then parodied Good Will Hunting with Damon and Van Sant in Kevin Smith's Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), made a cameo in the comedy Daddy and Them (2001), and had a supporting role in the little-seen The Third Wheel (2002). He portrayed the CIA analyst Jack Ryan in the thriller The Sum of All Fears (2002). Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt he was miscast in a role previously played by both Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin: \"Although Mr. Affleck can be appealing when playing earnest young men groping toward maturity, he simply lacks the gravitas for the role.\" Affleck had an \"amazing experience\" making the thriller Changing Lanes (2002), and later cited Roger Michell as someone he learned from as a director. Robert Koehler of Variety described it as one of the actor's \"most thoroughly wrought\" performances: \"The journey into a moral fog compels him to play more inwardly and thoughtfully than he ever has before.\"Affleck became more involved with television and film production in the early 2000s. He and Damon had set up Pearl Street Films in 1998, named after the street that ran between their childhood homes. Their next production company LivePlanet, co-founded in 2000 with Sean Bailey and Chris Moore, sought to integrate the Internet into mainstream television and film production. LivePlanet's biggest success was the documentary series Project Greenlight, aired on HBO and later Bravo, which focused on first-time filmmakers being given the chance to direct a feature film. Project Greenlight was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program in 2002, 2004 and 2005. Push, Nevada (2002), created, written and produced by Affleck and Bailey, was an ABC mystery drama series that placed a viewer-participation game within the frame of the show. Caryn James of The New York Times praised the show's \"nerve, imagination and clever writing\", but Robert Bianco of USA Today described it as a \"knock-off\" of Twin Peaks. The show was cancelled by ABC after seven episodes due to low ratings. Over time, LivePlanet's focus shifted from multimedia projects to more traditional film production. Affleck and his partners signed a film production deal with Disney in 2002; it expired in 2007.\n\n\n=== 2003\u20132005: Career downturn and tabloid notoriety ===\nWhile Affleck had been a tabloid figure for much of his career, he was the subject of increased media attention in 2003 because of his relationship with Jennifer Lopez. By the end of the year, Affleck had become, in the words of GQ, the \"world's most over-exposed actor\". His newfound tabloid notoriety coincided with a series of poorly received films.\n\nThe first of these was Daredevil (2003), in which Affleck starred as the blind superhero. Affleck was a longtime comic book fan, and, in 1999, had written a foreword for Kevin Smith's Guardian Devil about his love for the character of Daredevil. The film was a commercial success, but received a mixed response from critics. Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times said Affleck was \"lost\" in the role: \"A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role ... [Only his scenes with Jon Favreau have] a playful side that allows Mr. Affleck to show his generosity as an actor.\" In 2014, Affleck described Daredevil as the only film he regretted making. He next appeared as a low-ranking mobster in the romantic comedy Gigli (2003), co-starring Lopez. The film was almost uniformly panned, with Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times remarking that \"Affleck doesn't have the chops or the charm to maneuver around (or past) bad material.\" Yet Affleck has repeatedly defended director Marty Brest since the film's release, describing him as \"one of the really great directors\". In his last film role of 2003, Affleck starred as a reverse engineer in the sci-fi thriller Paycheck (2003). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian remarked on Affleck's \"self-deprecating charm\" and wondered why he could not find better scripts. Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times found it \"almost unfair\" to critique Affleck, given that he \"had such a rough year\".Affleck's poor critical notices continued in 2004 when he starred as a bereaved husband in the romantic comedy Jersey Girl, directed by longtime collaborator Smith. Stephen Holden of The New York Times described Affleck as an actor \"whose talent has curdled as his tabloid notoriety has spread,\" while Joe Leydon of Variety found his onscreen role as a father \"affecting\". Later that year, he starred opposite James Gandolfini in the holiday comedy Surviving Christmas. Holden noted in The New York Times that the film \"found a clever way to use Ben Affleck's disagreeable qualities. The actor's shark-like grin, cocky petulance and bullying frat-boy swagger befit his character.\" At this point, the quality of scripts offered to Affleck \"was just getting worse and worse\" and he decided to take a career break. The Los Angeles Times published a piece on the downfall of Affleck's career in late 2004. The article noted that, unlike film critics and tabloid journalists, \"few industry professionals seem to be gloating over Affleck's travails\".\n\n\n=== 2006\u20132015: Emergence as a director ===\nAfter marrying actress Jennifer Garner in 2005, and welcoming their first child, Affleck began a career comeback in 2006. Following a starring role in the little-seen Man About Town and a minor role in the crime drama Smokin' Aces, Affleck won acclaim for his performance as George Reeves in the noir biopic Hollywoodland. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised \"an award-caliber performance ... This is feeling, nuanced work from an actor some of us had prematurely written off.\" Geoffrey Macnab of The Guardian said he \"beautifully\" captured \"the character's curious mix of charm, vulnerability and fatalism\". He was awarded the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. Also in 2006, he made a cameo in Smith's Clerks II.In 2007, Affleck made his feature film directorial debut with Gone Baby Gone, a crime drama set in a working-class Boston neighborhood, starring his brother Casey as a private investigator searching for a young abductee. Affleck co\u2011wrote the screenplay, based on the book by Dennis Lehane, with childhood friend Aaron Stockard, having first mentioned his intention to adapt the story in 2003. It opened to enthusiastic reviews. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times praised the film's \"sensitivity to real struggle\", while Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter described it as \"thoughtful, deeply poignant, [and] splendidly executed\".While Affleck intended to \"keep a primary emphasis on directing\" going forward in his career, he acted in three films in 2009. In the ensemble romantic comedy He's Just Not That Into You, the chemistry between Affleck and Jennifer Aniston was praised. Affleck played a congressman in the political thriller State of Play. Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe found him \"very good in the film's silliest role,\" but David Edelstein of New York Magazine remarked of Affleck: \"He might be smart and thoughtful in life [but] as an actor his wheels turn too slowly.\" He had a supporting role as a bartender in the little-seen comedy film Extract. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described his performance as \"a goofball delight\", while Manohla Dargis of The New York Times declared it \"a real performance\". In 2010, Affleck starred in The Company Men as a mid-level sales executive who is made redundant during the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. David Denby of The New Yorker declared that Affleck \"gives his best performance yet\", while Richard Corliss of Time found he \"nails Bobby's plunge from hubris to humiliation\".\n\nFollowing the modest commercial success of Gone Baby Gone, Warner Bros. developed a close working relationship with Affleck and offered him his choice of the studio's scripts. He decided to direct the crime drama The Town (2010), an adaptation of Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves. He also re-wrote the screenplay and starred in the film as a bank robber. The film became a surprise box office hit, and gained further critical acclaim for Affleck. A.O. Scott of The New York Times praised his \"skill and self-confidence as a serious director,\" while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times noted: \"Affleck has the stuff of a real director. Everything is here. It's an effective thriller, he works closely with actors, he has a feel for pacing.\" Also in 2010, Affleck and Damon's production company, Pearl Street Films, signed a first-look producing deal at Warner Bros.Affleck soon began work on his next directorial project, Argo (2012), for Warner Bros. Written by Chris Terrio and starring Affleck as a CIA operative, the film tells the story of the CIA plan to save six U.S. diplomats during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis by faking a production for a large-scale science fiction film. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said the film offered \"further proof that we were wrong about Ben Affleck\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone remarked: \"Affleck takes the next step in what looks like a major directing career ... He directs the hell out of it, nailing the quickening pace, the wayward humor, the nerve-frying suspense.\" A major critical and commercial success, Argo won the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture. The cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast. Affleck himself won the Golden Globe Award, Directors Guild of America Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Director, becoming the first director to win these awards without a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director.The following year Affleck played a romantic lead in Terrence Malick's experimental drama To the Wonder. Malick, a close friend of Affleck's godfather, had first met with the actor in the 1990s to offer advice about the plot of Good Will Hunting. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian enjoyed \"a performance of dignity and sensitivity,\" while The New Yorker 's Richard Brody described Affleck as \"a solid and muscular performer\" who \"conveys a sense of thoughtful and willful individuality\". Affleck's performance as a poker boss was considered a highlight of the poorly-reviewed thriller Runner Runner (2013). Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times remarked that it was \"one killer of a character, and Affleck plays him like a Bach concerto \u2013 every note perfectly played.\" He then pushed back production on his own directorial project to star as a husband accused of murder in David Fincher's psychological thriller Gone Girl (2014). Fincher cast him partly because he understood what it felt like to be misrepresented by tabloid media: \"What many people don't know is that he's crazy smart, but since he doesn't want that to get awkward, he downplays it. I think he learned how to skate on charm.\" David Edelstein of New York Magazine noted that Fincher's controlled style of directing had a \"remarkable\" effect on Affleck's acting: \"I never thought I'd write these words, but he carries the movie. He's terrific.\" Justin Chang of Variety found Affleck \"perfectly cast\": \"It's a tricky turn, requiring a measure of careful underplaying and emotional aloofness, and he nails it completely.\" In 2015, Affleck and Damon's Project Greenlight was resurrected by HBO for one season.\n\n\n=== 2016\u2013present: Batman role and continued directing ===\nGiven Affleck's growing reputation as a filmmaker, his decision to star as Batman in the 2016 superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was regarded by Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times as \"a somewhat bewildering choice\". Although the casting choice was met with intense fan backlash, Affleck's performance ultimately earned a positive reception. Andrew Barker of Variety found him \"a winningly cranky, charismatic presence,\" while Brian Truitt of USA Today enjoyed his \"strong\" and \"surprisingly emotional\" take on the character. Affleck reprised his role as Batman twice, making a cameo appearance in Suicide Squad (2016) and starring in Justice League (2017). Justice League drew mixed opinions from critics; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Affleck \"looks like he'd rather be almost anywhere else but here.\"\n\nIn addition to his various Batman commitments, Affleck appeared in two other films in 2016. He starred as an autistic accountant in the action thriller The Accountant (2016), which was an unexpected commercial success. Peter Debruge of Variety felt Affleck's \"boy-next-door\" demeanor \u2013 \"so normal and non-actorly that most of his performances feel like watching one of your buddies up on screen\" \u2013 was \"a terrific fit\" for the role. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wondered why Affleck, \"looking appropriately dead-eyed and miserable,\" committed himself to the film. Live by Night, which Affleck wrote, directed, co-produced, and starred in, was released in late 2016. Adapted from Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name, the Prohibition-era gangster drama received largely unenthusiastic reviews and failed to recoup its $65 million production budget. David Sims of The Atlantic described it as \"a fascinating mess of a movie\" and criticized Affleck's \"stiff, uncomfortable\" performance. He noted that one of the last action scenes \"is so wonderfully staged, its action crisp and easy to follow, that it reminds you what skill Affleck has with the camera\". In October 2016, Affleck and Damon made a one-off stage appearance for a live reading of the Good Will Hunting screenplay at New York's Skirball Theater.Amidst an alcoholism relapse, Affleck did not work in 2017. He stepped down as director and writer of The Batman, as well as left the role due to \"lack of interest in comic-book stories\" and filming of the drug-trafficking thriller Triple Frontier was postponed in order to accommodate his treatment for \"health issues\". Upon Triple Frontier's release in 2019, Rodrigo Perez of The Playlist remarked that director J.C. Chandor \"gets a lot of mileage out of the Sad Affleck narrative and perhaps both director and actor lean into the idea.\" Later in 2019, Affleck made a cameo appearance in Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, having had little contact with Kevin Smith since the making of Clerks II in 2006. Affleck played a supporting role as a diplomat in Dee Rees's political thriller The Last Thing He Wanted (2020). The Netflix movie, filmed in mid-2018, received negative reviews from critics, with Tomris Laffly of Variety describing Affleck's performance as \"oddly removed\".Affleck's starring role as a recovering alcoholic in the sports drama The Way Back (2020) was widely praised. The themes of the movie were \"close to home\" for Affleck. He relapsed during pre-production in 2018 and the movie was shot in the days after he left rehab; Affleck agreed to put his salary in escrow and was accompanied to set by a sober coach. Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair said it was hard to avoid the movie's \"meta angle\": \"Affleck handles his self-conscious task with a generous humility\u2014giving a performance built not out of histrionics or big actor moments, but instead from the messy details of a man in a plateaued distress\". David Sims of The Atlantic praised the \"subtlety\", \"vulnerability\" and \"lumbering physicality\" of his performance, describing it as \"the rawest and most natural\" work of his career. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cinemas closed in the second week of the movie's release and Warner Bros. made it available to view-on-demand earlier than scheduled.In November 2020, he will star opposite Ana de Armas in Adrian Lyne's thriller Deep Water, an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel. During the COVID-19 pandemic, production on two Affleck-related projects was postponed. Filming of the Ridley Scott-directed The Last Duel was halted; Affleck co-wrote the movie's screenplay with Matt Damon and Nicole Holofcener, and is due to play a supporting role. Production of Robert Rodriguez's action thriller Hypnotic, which was due to begin filming in April and in which Affleck plays a detective, was also postponed. Affleck has a number of potential directing projects in development, including an adaptation of King Leopold's Ghost, a World War II movie focusing on the Ghost Army, and a crime drama about the McDonald's Monopoly fraud case.\n\n\n== Humanitarian work ==\n\n\n=== Eastern Congo Initiative ===\n\nAfter travelling in the region between 2007 and early 2010, Affleck and Whitney Williams co-founded the nonprofit organization Eastern Congo Initiative in 2010. ECI acts as a grant maker for Congolese-led, community-based charities. It offers training and resources to cooperatives of Congolese farmers while leveraging partnerships with companies including Theo Chocolate and Starbucks. ECI also aims to raise public awareness and drive policy change in the United States.Affleck has written op-eds about issues facing eastern Congo for the Washington Post, Politico, the Huffington Post, Time, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. He has appeared as a discussion panelist at many events, including at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Global Philanthropy Forum, and the Clinton Global Initiative. During visits to Washington D.C., Affleck has testified before the House Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Human Rights, the House Armed Services Committee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Projects.\n\n\n=== Other charitable causes ===\nAffleck is a supporter of the A-T Children's Project. While filming Forces of Nature in 1998, Affleck befriended ten-year-old Joe Kindregan (1988\u20132015), who had the rare disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), and his family. He became actively involved in fundraising for A-T, and he and Kindregan testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health & Human Services, and Education in 2001, asking senators to support stem-cell research and to double the budget of the National Institutes of Health. In 2007, Affleck was the keynote speaker at Kindregan's high school graduation ceremony in Fairfax, Virginia. Kindregan appeared as an extra in Argo (2012). In 2013, in celebration of Kindregan's 25th birthday and \"15 years of friendship with Joe and his family,\" Affleck and Garner matched donations made to the A-T Children's Project. Affleck appeared in CinemAbility (2013), a documentary film which explores Hollywood's portrayals of people with disabilities.\n\nAs part of USO-sponsored tours, Affleck visited marines stationed in the Persian Gulf in 2003, and troops at Germany's Ramstein Air Base in 2017. He is a supporter of Paralyzed Veterans of America. He filmed public service announcements for the organization in both 2009 and 2014. He has also volunteered on behalf of Operation Gratitude.Affleck is a member of Feeding America's Entertainment Council. He made an appearance at the Greater Boston Food Bank in 2007, and at a Denver food bank in 2008. Affleck spoke at a Feeding America rally in Washington D.C. in 2009, and filmed a public service announcement for the charity in 2010. Affleck and Ellen DeGeneres launched Feeding America's Small Change Campaign in 2011. Also that year, he and Howard Graham Buffett co-wrote an article for The Huffington Post, highlighting the \"growing percentage of the food insecure population that is not eligible for federal nutrition programs\". During the COVID-19 pandemic, Affleck organised an online celebrity poker tournament to benefit the charity, made a personal donation and urged others to support \"our most vulnerable \u2013 children losing access to meals they rely on, friends and family who are facing job disruptions, the elderly, and low-income families.\"Affleck is a vocal supporter of the Los Angeles-based homelessness charity Midnight Mission, describing it as a charity that \"helps those in need with housing, training, development and recovery\". He has volunteered at and donated to the charity. He has also volunteered at Atlanta Mission.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Political views ===\nAffleck has described himself as \"moderately liberal.\" He was raised in \"a very strong union household\". In 2000, he spoke at a rally at Harvard University in support of an increased living wage for all workers on campus; his father worked as a janitor at the university. He later narrated a documentary, Occupation (2002), about a sit-in organized by the Harvard Living Wage Campaign. Affleck and Senator Ted Kennedy held a press conference on Capitol Hill in 2004, pushing for an increase in the minimum wage. He spoke at a 2007 press conference at Boston's City Hall in support of SEIU's unionization efforts for the city's low-paid hospital workers. During the Writers' Strike in 2008, Affleck voiced support for the picketers.Affleck is pro-choice. In a 2000 interview, he stated that he believes \"very strongly in a woman's right to choose\". In 2012, he supported the Draw the Line campaign, describing reproductive rights as \"fundamental\". Affleck was a longtime supporter of legalizing gay marriage, saying in 2004 that he hoped to look back on the marriage debate \"with some degree of embarrassment for how antiquated it was\". Also that year, he remarked that it was \"outrageous and offensive\" to suggest members of the transgender community were not entitled to equal rights. He appeared alongside his gay cousin in a 2005 Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays print advertising campaign.Affleck appeared at a press conference with New York Senator Chuck Schumer in 2002, in support of a proposed Anti-Nuclear Terrorism Prevention Act. In 2003, he criticized the \"questionable and aggressive\" use of the Patriot Act and the resulting \"encroachments on civil liberties\". A reporter for The Washington Post overheard Affleck denouncing the Israeli invasion of Gaza at a Washington party in 2009. Steven Clemons, a participant in the conversation, said Affleck listened \"to alternative takes ... What Affleck spoke about that night was reasoned, complex and made a lot of sense.\" Later that year, in a New York Times interview, Affleck remarked that his views were closer to those of the Israeli Labor Party than Likud.\n\nAffleck criticized the Bush tax cuts on many occasions. In 2007, he filmed a public service announcement for Divided We Fail, a nonpartisan AARP campaign seeking affordable, quality healthcare for all Americans.During the 2008 presidential campaign, Affleck expressed concern about conspiracy theories claiming Barack Obama was an Arab or a Muslim: \"This prejudice that we have allowed to fester in this campaign ... the acceptance of both of those things as a legitimate slur is really a problem.\" In 2012, he praised Senator John McCain's leadership in defending Huma Abedin against anti-Muslim attacks. Affleck engaged in a discussion about the relationship between liberal principles and Islam during a 2014 appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher. In a 2017 Guardian interview, he said: \"I strongly believe that no one should be stereotyped on the basis of their race or religion. It's one of the most fundamental tenets of liberal thought.\"Affleck is a supporter of the Second Amendment. In a 2012 interview, he said he owns several guns, both for skeet shooting and for the protection of his family.Affleck appeared alongside then-Senator Barack Obama at a 2006 rally in support of Proposition 87, which sought to reduce petroleum consumption in favor of alternative energy. He appeared in a global warming awareness video produced by the Center for American Progress Action Fund in 2007. Also that year, Affleck admitted he was not \"particularly good at being green\" while, in 2014, he named \"a 1966 Chevelle\" as his guilty pleasure. In 2016, Affleck filmed an endorsement for Rezpect Our Water, an online petition to stop construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.\n\n\n=== Democratic Party activism ===\nAffleck registered to vote as a Democrat in 1992, and has campaigned on behalf of several Democratic presidential nominees. He supported Al Gore in the final weeks of the 2000 presidential campaign, attending rallies in California, Pennsylvania, and Florida. However, Affleck was unable to vote due to a registration issue in New York, where he was residing at the time, and later joked, \"I'm going to vote twice next time, in true Boston fashion.\"\n\nAffleck was involved in the 2004 presidential campaign of John Kerry. During the Democratic National Convention in Boston, he spoke to many delegations, appeared on political discussion shows, and attended fundraising events. Affleck took part in a voter registration public service announcement, and traveled with Kerry during the opening weekend of his Believe in America Tour, making speeches at rallies in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio.Affleck campaigned for President Barack Obama. He appeared alongside the then-Senator at a 2006 rally, introducing him as \"the most galvanizing leader to come out of either party, in my opinion, in at least a decade\". He donated to Obama's presidential campaign in 2007, and hosted two fundraisers for the candidate during the 2008 Democratic Primary. Affleck urged voters to \"help make history\" in a MoveOn.org campaign, and made several appearances during the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In the week of the presidential election, he appeared on Saturday Night Live to jokingly endorse Senator John McCain. Affleck did not actively campaign for Obama's reelection in 2012, though he still supported him.Affleck supported Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign. He first met Clinton at Camp David in 1998 and, when she was a Senate candidate in 2000, he introduced her at a Cornell University rally and helped fundraise for her campaign. Affleck pointed to the First Lady's work with children, women and \"working families\". He supported Obama during the 2008 Democratic Primary, noting that Clinton had \"moved toward the center\" during the campaign.

The Center for Responsive Politics reported that he raised $149,028.During the latter stages of the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Affleck said during an interview conducted in Spanish: \"I like Bernie, I like Biden, I like Warren but the thing is that most of all; I don't like Trump.\"In 2002, Affleck donated to Dick Gephardt's Congressional campaign, and appeared in campaign literature for former classmate Marjorie Decker, running as a city councillor in Massachusetts.

In 2020, he spoke at a virtual rally in support of Whitney Williams, a candidate in the 2020 Montana gubernatorial election.In the early 2000s, Affleck often expressed an interest in running for political office one day, but since 2007, he has denied any political ambitions and spoken repeatedly about the need for campaign finance reform. In 2005, The Washington Post reported that Virginia Democrats were trying to persuade Affleck to run as a Senate candidate. His publicist dismissed the rumor. In 2012, political pundits and Democratic strategists including Bob Shrum and Tad Devine speculated that Affleck was considering running for a Massachusetts Senate seat. Affleck denied the rumor, and joked that he \"also won't be throwing my hat in the ring to run the U.N.\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Relationships and family ===\nAffleck began dating actress Gwyneth Paltrow in October 1997 after meeting at a Miramax dinner, and they later worked together on Shakespeare in Love (1998). Although they first broke up in January 1999, months later, Paltrow persuaded Affleck to co-star with her in Bounce (2000) and they soon resumed their relationship. They separated again in October 2000. In a 2015 interview, Paltrow said she and Affleck remain friends.Affleck had an 18-month relationship with singer and actress Jennifer Lopez from 2002 to 2004. They began dating in July 2002, after meeting on the set of Gigli (2003), and later worked together on the \"Jenny from the Block\" music video and Jersey Girl (2004). Their relationship received widespread media coverage. They became engaged in November 2002, but their planned wedding on September 14, 2003, was postponed with four days' notice because of \"excessive media attention\". They broke up in January 2004. Lopez later described the separation as \"my first real heartbreak\" and attributed it in part to Affleck's discomfort with the media scrutiny. In 2020, Affleck said he keeps \"in touch periodically\" with Lopez.Affleck began dating actress Jennifer Garner in mid-2004, having established a friendship on the sets of Pearl Harbor (2001) and Daredevil (2003). They were married on June 29, 2005, in a private Turks and Caicos ceremony. Victor Garber, who officiated the ceremony, and his partner, Rainer Andreesen, were the only guests. They announced their separation in June 2015, with Affleck continuing to live in a guesthouse at the family home until mid-2017. They jointly filed for divorce in April 2017 and it was finalized in October 2018. In 2020, Affleck described divorce as \"a painful experience,\" \"even if you're on the best possible terms and you agree it's the best choice.\"Affleck and Garner have three children together: daughters Violet Anne (born December 2005) and Seraphina Rose Elizabeth (born January 2009), and son Samuel Garner (born February 2012). In their divorce filings, Affleck and Garner sought joint physical and legal custody of their children. While Affleck believes paparazzi attention is \"part of the deal\" of stardom, he has spoken out against paparazzi interest in his children. He has called for legislation to require paparazzi to maintain a certain distance from children and to blur their faces in published photos.Affleck had a long-distance relationship with New York-based television producer Lindsay Shookus from mid-2017 to mid-2018; they briefly dated again in early 2019. Shookus is the head of Saturday Night Live's talent department, a show which Affleck has hosted five times since 2000.Affleck is in a relationship with Cuban actress Ana de Armas, whom he met on the set of Deep Water in the fall of 2019.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nThere is a history of addiction and mental illness in Affleck's family. Two of his grandparents were alcoholics. His paternal grandmother, addicted to both alcohol and barbiturates, committed suicide at the age of 46. His paternal uncle was an addict who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His aunt was a heroin addict. Affleck attended Al-Anon support meetings as a child due to his father's addiction issues. His brother is a recovering alcoholic.Affleck's own drinking became a concern when he was fifteen. His mother sent him to an Outward Bound wilderness camp for at-risk teenagers, having first considered a residential recovery program. Affleck became sober in his mid-twenties, stating in a 1998 interview that alcohol was \"dangerous\" for him. He received residential treatment for addiction in 2001 and maintained his sobriety for a \"couple of years\" afterwards. In subsequent years, he declined to discuss his alcoholism in detail and later described it as a period where he \"drank relatively normally\". \"I thought, 'I want to just drink like a normal person. I want to have wine at dinner.' And I was able to for about eight years.\"Over time, Affleck began to drink \"more and more\" until, eventually, he was drinking until he \"passed out on the couch\" on a nightly basis.  Affleck returned to residential treatment in 2017 and, following a publicly documented relapse and intervention, again in 2018. In late 2019, TMZ filmed him walking down a Los Angeles street in an inebriated state; he acknowledged the following day that he had a brief \"slip\" after over a year of sobriety. He later described the incident as \"embarrassing\": \"I wish it didn't happen. I really wish it wasn't on the internet for my kids to see.\"In 2020, Affleck told an interviewer that he suffers with both anxiety and depression, and has taken anti-depressants since the age of 26. He said he used alcohol to alleviate a constant feeling of \"discomfort\" and remarked that it \"took me a long time to fundamentally, deeply, without a hint of doubt, admit to myself that I am an alcoholic.\" He follows a twelve-step program.\n\n\n=== Professional gambling ===\n\nAffleck won the 2004 California State Poker Championship, taking home the first prize of $356,400 and qualifying for the 2004 World Poker Tour final tournament. He was one of many celebrities, along with Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio, who took part in Molly Bloom's high-stake poker games in the mid-2000s. In 2014, Affleck was asked to refrain from playing blackjack at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas, after a series of wins aroused suspicion that he was counting cards, which is a legal gambling strategy frowned upon by casinos. Affleck has repeatedly denied tabloid reports of a gambling addiction.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAffleck came from Protestant stock, but his family were not religious. As infants, each of his three children were baptized as members of the United Methodist Church. In 2008, he listed the Gospel of Matthew as one of the books that made a difference in his life and, in 2012, he described himself as agnostic. In 2015, Affleck began attending weekly Methodist church services in Los Angeles with his family. When asked about his faith in 2020, Affleck said it \"has been a struggle for me\": \"I don't have a sense of an anthropomorphised guy up there pushing buttons, that seems hard for me, but the twelve-step program is faith-based ... Faith has served me well in recovery as an alcoholic.\"\n\n\n=== Ancestry ===\nMuch of Affleck's ancestry is English, Irish, Scottish and German. Affleck's maternal great-great grandfather, Heinrich Boldt, who, aged 12, accidentally discovered the Curmsun Disc, emigrated from Prussia in the late 1840s.Affleck appeared on the PBS genealogy series Finding Your Roots in 2014. When told that an ancestor had been a slave owner in Georgia, Affleck responded: \"God. It gives me kind of a sagging feeling to see a biological relationship to that. But, you know, there it is, part of our history ... We tend to separate ourselves from these things by going like, 'It's just dry history, and it's all over now'.\" Leaked emails from the 2015 Sony email hacking scandal showed that, after filming, Affleck's representative emailed the documentary maker to say the actor felt \"uncomfortable\" about the segment, which was not included in the final broadcast. PBS denied censoring the show at Affleck's behest, and the show's host, professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., stated: \"We focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry\".\n\n\n=== Me Too allegations ===\nDuring the Me Too movement in 2017, Affleck was accused by two women of inappropriate behavior. Actress Hilarie Burton stated that, during an on-air appearance on TRL Uncensored in 2003, Affleck \"wraps his arm around me, and comes over and tweaks my left boob\". Affleck responded on Twitter: \"I acted inappropriately toward Ms. Burton and I sincerely apologize.\"Annamarie Tendler, a makeup artist, claimed Affleck allegedly \"grabbed my ass at a Golden Globes party in 2014 ... He tried to play it like he was politely moving me out of the way.\"In response to the Harvey Weinstein scandal, Affleck pledged to donate any future profits from his early Miramax films to charities supporting victims of sexual assault and said he had only been aware that Weinstein \"was sleazy and a bully.\" In a tweet, actress Rose McGowan responded: \"You lie.\" She said she met Affleck after being sexually assaulted by Weinstein during the Sundance Film Festival in 1997 and told him, while crying, that she had \"just come from Harvey's and he said, 'Goddamnit, I told him to stop doing that.'\" In a leaked email regarding McGowan's case, Affleck stated: \"I never saw Rose at any hotel in Sundance. She never told me nor did I ever infer that she was attacked by anyone.\" In a 2019 interview, Affleck said: \"I don't really want to get into other people's individual stories because I feel like those are their stories and they're entitled to tell as much or as little of those as they want. I believe Rose. I support her. I really like and admire her tenacity and I wish her the best.\" In 2020, McGowan clarified her comments: \"It's not like I'm raging at Ben Affleck. I never said to him, 'I was just raped.' It's just more to illustrate the point of this continual thing of everybody knowing and everybody being part of it, unwittingly or proactively.\"\n\n\n== Filmography and awards ==\n\nAffleck has appeared in more than 50 films, and won many accolades throughout his career as an actor, writer, and director. He first gained recognition as a writer when he won the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Good Will Hunting (1997), which he co-wrote with Matt Damon. As an actor, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in Hollywoodland (2006). The film Argo (2012), which he directed, co-produced, and starred in, won him the Golden Globe Award, BAFTA, and Directors Guild Award for Best Director, as well as the Golden Globe Award, BAFTA, the Producers Guild Award, and the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBen Affleck on Facebook\nBen Affleck on IMDb\nBen Affleck at AllMovie\nBen Affleck on Twitter",

        "wiki": "Alice Charlotte von Rothschild  (17 February 1847 \u2013 3 May 1922), otherwise referred to as 'Miss Alice', was a socialite and member of the Rothschild banking family of Austria. Born in Frankfurt, she was the eighth and youngest child of Anselm von Rothschild (1803\u20131874) and Charlotte Rothschild (1807\u20131859) and younger sister to the British politician, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild. She was a small child when her family moved to Vienna, where her father took over management of the family-owned S M von Rothschild bank.\n\n\n== Family life ==\nAlice von Rothschild's mother was the daughter of Nathan Mayer Rothschild of London and as a result the family would have close connections to the English branch of the Rothschild family. Her brother Ferdinand, with whom she was very close, studied at Cambridge University and married an English cousin. \n\nHer mother died when she was twelve and as a result of her busy father who travelled constantly, she spent a lonely childhood, living with various relations. Photographs of Alice as a girl and a young woman show her \"with a broad brow, firm full lips and a strong chin, not conventionally pretty, but full of character\". This sense of character is what makes Miss Alice so renowned for her 'formidable' reputation. Girouard states that it is down to two events that helped convert the young, girlish Miss Alice to her strong older self, that being first acting as hostess for her brother Ferdinand, at Leighton House and then at Waddesdon Manor - and secondly being after the death of her father in 1874, leaving her a wealthy woman. Much to the family's surprise, she was left the original Rothschild family home in Frankfurt alongside a house and estate at the Grunburg, just outside.\nWhen her brother Ferdinand began the construction in 1874 of Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire England, Alice acquired a nearby property at Eythrope for herself. There, between 1876 and 1879, she had a park and garden created and a house built near the river called Eythrope Pavilion. Although, as Alice had suffered from rheumatic fever, she had been advised not to sleep near water as dampness would aggravate her health problem meaning her house was built for solely for daytime occupation. Therefore, at nights she returned to stay at Waddesdon Manor.\n\n\n== Inheritance ==\nIn late 1898, following the death of her brother, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, Alice inherited Waddesdon Manor and his London House. During World War I she had the formal gardens at Waddesdon and Eythrope given over to the growing of vegetables for the less fortunate. The Eythrope Pavilion was still maintained but now as even more of an occasional retreat. As her health declined she spent more of her time at her magnificent ch\u00e2teau, \"Villa Victoria\", in the balmier climate of the town of Grasse in the Alpes-Maritimes d\u00e9partement in France. Her property was located about 12 miles (19 Kilometers) inland, north of the Mediterranean coast and here she created an enormous garden that employed more than one hundred gardeners. A spinster, she wanted to be near family, and her ch\u00e2teau was close to Cannes, where her cousin Laura Th\u00e9r\u00e8se von Rothschild, widow of James-Edouard de Rothschild owned the Villa Rothschild, Cannes, and only 34 miles (55 kilometers) from Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild, the seaside estate owned by another cousin, B\u00e9atrice Ephrussi de Rothschild.\nQueen Victoria vacationed in Grasse and visited Villa Victoria. According to the book The Rothschild Gardens by Miriam Rothschild, at the turn of the century, Alice Rothschild spent the equivalent of nearly half-a-million pounds (Sterling) annually on her gardens and grounds at Grasse. Imperious in nature, Alice was a strong-willed person who spoke her mind. According to a 2001 book by author Michael Nelson: \"the Queen stepped on a lawn and across a flower-bed [at Waddesdon Manor], inadvertently crushing several plants. The baroness could not contain herself and roughly told the sovereign in effect to 'Get out'. Thereafter the Queen always referred to her as 'The All-Powerful One'.\"\n\n\n== Collecting and innovating conservation ==\n\nLike most other members of the Rothschild family, Alice Rothschild was a collector of art. While she acquired paintings, sculptures and objets d'art, Alice von Rothschild also had a unique collection of smoking pipes, including French, Spanish and Italian examples from the 17th century. The collection was donated to the town of Grasse, France on her death in 1922, where her winter property was based. The ch\u00e2teau in Grasse later became the hotel \"Parc Palace\", where the famous French actor G\u00e9rard Philipe was raised. Alice von Rothschild willed Waddesdon Manor to James Armand de Rothschild. Avenue Rothschild in Grasse is named in her honor.\nAlong these same lines, Miss Alice was also an avid and careful collector for Waddesdon Manor, and added elements to Ferdinand's previous collection in order to fill the gap left when he bequested much of his renaissance artworks to the British Museum (now referred to as the Waddesdon Bequest). For instance, the helmet of the emperor Charles V is a prominent contribution of Miss Alice's to the Armoury Corridor, upstairs in the Bachelor's Wing. She regarded herself as 'the protector' of Ferdinand's inheritance and is famous for establishing \u2018Miss Alice\u2019s Rules' \u2013 guidelines for the care and preservation of the collections which even today form the foundation for those conservation rules of the National Trust.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nInternational Women's Day blog article\nWho was Alice de Rothschild? blog article\nBeautiful and fantastic: Three Rothschild women as collectors blog article\nA walk amongst the beauty of Waddesdon, Bucks Herald\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRothschilds at Waddesdon Manor by Dorothy de Rothschild.

          "Found out about this mansion just before our trip to Nice and we just had to visit. Rented a car to take us there and it was a half hour drive from Nice. Exterior of the mansion looks wonderful and it is pink after all ! Walking around the gardens, there are various themes and",

          "Amazing building and gardens from the early 1900\u2019s built by Mme. Rothschild. The gardens are spectacular and views of both Beaulieu and Villefranche bays are stunning. Highly recommended, but get there at 10:00 am when it opens to get the best visit.",
          "Fantastic setting for this villa. Gardens definitely worth a slow walk around with great purpose made view points of the bay of Villefranche sur Mer. Restaurant onsite a little bit pricey but still good. Some good items in the Villa to view, but overall it's the gardens & views",

          "Make sure you visit on a dry day as the gardens are worth seeing. The parking is a challenge especially if you have a long car. Look for spaces not designated for small cars! Those near the top are for large ones. The cost is 15 euros but we spent sometime here including lunch.",

        "wiki": "The City of Lost Children (French: La cit\u00e9 des enfants perdus) is a 1995 science fantasy film directed by Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, written by Jeunet and Gilles Adrien, and starring Ron Perlman. An international co-production of companies from France, Germany, and Spain, the film is stylistically related to the previous and subsequent Jeunet films, Delicatessen and Am\u00e9lie.The musical score was composed by Angelo Badalamenti, with costumes designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier. It was entered into the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nKrank (Daniel Emilfork), a highly intelligent but malicious being created by a vanished scientist, is unable to dream, which causes him to age prematurely. At his lair on an abandoned oil rig (which he shares with the scientist's other creations: six childish clones, a dwarf named Martha, and a brain in a vat named Irvin), he uses a dream-extracting machine to steal dreams from children. The children are kidnapped for him from a nearby port city by a cyborg cult called the Cyclops, who in exchange he supplies with mechanical eyes and ears. Among the kidnapped is Denree (Joseph Lucien), the adopted little brother of carnival strongman One (Ron Perlman).\nAfter the carnival manager is stabbed by a mugger, One is hired by a criminal gang of orphans (run by a pair of Siamese twins called \"the Octopus\") to help them steal a safe. The theft is successful, but the safe is lost in the harbor when One is distracted by seeing Denree's kidnappers. He, together with one of the orphans, a little girl called Miette (Judith Vittet), follows the Cyclops and infiltrates their headquarters, but they are captured and sentenced to execution. Meanwhile, the Octopus orders circus performer Marcello (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) to return One to them. He uses his trained fleas, which inject a poison capsule that causes mindless aggression, to turn the Cyclops guards against each other. While Marcello is rescuing One, Miette falls into the harbor and sinks, seemingly drowned, but an amnesiac diver living beneath the harbor rescues her.\nMiette leaves the diver's lair to find One and Marcello both drowning their sorrows in a bar. Upon seeing Miette alive the remorseful Marcello lets One leave with her. However the Octopus confronts them on the pier, and uses Marcello's stolen fleas to turn One against Miette. A spectacular chain of events triggered by one of Miette's tears leads to a ship crashing into the pier before One can throttle her. Marcello arrives and sets the fleas on the Octopus, allowing One and Miette to escape to continue searching for Denree.\nBack at Krank's oil rig, Irvin tricks one of the clones into releasing a plea for help in the form of a bottled dream telling the story of what is going on on the oil rig. It reaches One, Miette, and the diver, and the latter remembers that he was the scientist who made them, and that the oil rig was his laboratory before Krank and Martha attacked him and pushed him off it to take it for themselves, leaving him for dead in the water. They all converge on the rig; the diver to destroy it and the duo to rescue Denree.\nMiette is almost killed by Martha, but the diver harpoons her. She then finds Denree asleep in Krank's dream-extracting machine, and Irvin tells her that to release him she must use the machine to enter the dream herself. In the dream world, she meets Krank and makes a deal with him to replace the boy as the source of the dream; Krank fears a trap but plays along, believing himself to be in control. Miette then uses her imagination to control the dream and turn it into an infinite loop, destroying Krank's mind. One and Miette rescue all the children, while the now-deranged diver loads the rig with dynamite and straps himself to one of its legs. The diver regains his senses as everyone is rowing away and pleads with his remaining creations to come back to rescue him, but a seabird lands on the handle of the blasting machine, blowing up him and the rig.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film holds a 79% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 6.91/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Not all of its many intriguing ideas are developed, but The City of Lost Children is an engrossing, disturbing, profoundly memorable experience.\" It also holds a weighted average score of 73 on Metacritic, based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of a possible 4, writing that the film's design and visual effects deserved the highest possible praise but the story was sometimes confusing: \"I would be lying if I said I understood the plot.\"\n\n\n=== Interpretation ===\nAccording to authors Jen Webb and Tony Schirato, the dual nature of capitalism constitutes a main source of tension in the film:\n\nOn the one hand, capitalism is presented as enabling self-interest and freedom, as exemplified by the freedom to produce scientific developments (Krank), pursue religious ideas (the Cyclopses), and seek wealth (the Octopus). On the other hand, it exposes the deplorable effects of capitalism ... the exploitation of childhood (the cynical orphans), of tenderness (the Original scientist, attacked and turned out by his own beloved creations), and of innocence (the terrified children whose dreams are stolen) while suggesting that there is no place in capitalism for originality, disinterestedness, duty, self-reflective analysis, and other defining aspects of \"the human.\"\nAccording to author Donna Wilkerson-Barker, these elusive aspects of humanity are presented within the film for various characters to identify with. For example, the relationship between One and Denr\u00e9e represents, for Miette, a family of authenticity. Prepared to sacrifice her life in order to become a part of their family, Miette helps One to save Denr\u00e9e from Krank's manipulative environment. In another example, Irvin the brain plays his part in overturning the same environment in order to liberate his \"family\" of clones. In the end, two boats filled with these two different families row towards their futures: In one boat, a technologically produced family of Irvin and the clones; In the other, a rationally envisioned family containing Miette, One, and the abducted children. This leaves the audience to question precisely what the future will hold for these two differing visions of humanity.As The City of Lost Children \"proceeds in full awareness that the past to which it is committed never really existed,\" the film has been classified as an example of the steampunk genre.\n\n\n== Video game ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe City of Lost Children on IMDb\nThe City of Lost Children at Box Office Mojo\nThe City of Lost Children at Rotten Tomatoes\nThe City of Lost Children at Metacritic",

        "wiki": "L\u00e9rins Abbey (pronounced [le\u0281\u025b\u0303]) is a Cistercian monastery on the island of Saint-Honorat, one of the L\u00e9rins Islands, on the French Riviera, with an active monastic community.\nThere has been a monastic community there since the 5th century. The construction of the current monastery buildings began around 1073. Today the monks cultivate vineyards and produce wine and liqueur.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First foundation ===\nThe island, known to the Romans as Lerina, was uninhabited until Saint Honoratus, a disciple of a local hermit named Caprasius of L\u00e9rins, founded a monastery on it at some time around the year 410. According to tradition, Honoratus made his home on the island intending to live as a hermit, but found himself joined by disciples who formed a monastic community around him. They came from all parts of Roman Gaul and from Brittany. John Cassian had a high opinion of and close ties with the monastery of the L\u00e9rins.During the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries, the influence exerted by the abbey was considerable. In 426 St. Maximus was elected Abbot and remained for seven years until he was appointed the first documented leader of the Ancient Diocese of Riez. The second Abbot increased the renown of the cloister by his miracles and sanctity.\nThere is also a tradition that Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, studied here in the fifth century, and during the sixth century, Saint Quinidius was a monk at L\u00e9rins.\nThe abbey provided three bishops for the diocese of Arles: Honoratus himself, followed by Hilarius and Cesarius in the fifth and sixth centuries respectively. Faustus, also a monk of L\u00e9rins, succeeded Maximus as bishop of Riez.One of the Church's most famous authors Vincent of L\u00e9rins dwelt in this monastery in the 5th century.\nSaint Nazarius (Abbot) (Saint Nazaire), the fourteenth abbot of L\u00e9rins, probably during the reign of the Merovingian Clotaire II (584-629), successfully attacked the remnants of paganism on the southern coast of France, overthrew a sanctuary of Venus near Cannes, and founded on its site a convent for women, which was destroyed by the Saracens in the eighth century.\nIn the 630s, Saint Agricola of Avignon was a monk here before being called to become bishop of Avignon.\nOver the following centuries, monastic life on the island was interrupted on several occasions by raids, mostly attributable to Saracens. Around 732, many of the community, including the abbot, Saint Porcarius, were massacred on the island by invaders. It is said that many of the monks escaped, because Porcarius had been warned of the attack by an angel and had sent them to safety.\n\n\n=== Second foundation ===\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the monks were obliged to take an active part in defending the coasts against incursions of the Moors of Algeria, and a fortified monastery was built between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries.\nIn medieval times, the island became a very popular place of pilgrimage. This was encouraged by the writings of Raymond F\u00e9raud, a monk who composed a mythological life of Honoratus.\nThe abbey was an important strategic position in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries during the Franco-Spanish wars. In 1635 the island was captured by the Spanish and the monks were expelled. They returned from exile in Vallauris two years later, when the island was retaken by the French. The monastery continued to suffer from Spanish and Genoese attacks. The number of monks dwindled to four and, in the pre-revolutionary climate of the time, the monastery was disestablished in 1787. In the French Revolution, the island became the property of the state, and was sold to a wealthy actress, Mademoiselle de Sainval, who lived there for twenty years.\n\n\n=== Third foundation ===\nIn 1859, the island was bought by the Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus, who sought to re-establish a religious community there. Ten years later, a Cistercian community was founded, which has remained there since. The monks cultivate their own vegetables and get most of their electricity from the numerous solar panels. The annual grape harvest festival in early September is a key event in the calendar.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Carolingian monasteries\nCarolingian architecture\nCarolingian art\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

          "I've never visited anywhere like St Honorat - even St Marguerite, its neighbouring island you could almost swim too - is different. It is so calm, meditative and uplifting. The wildlife is fascinating, the colours of the sea mesmerising and every step presents new landscapes. A",

          "We 'escape' to Cannes almost every summer and the Iles really feel like the escape from our escape. Away from the 'boldness' of Cannes, the Iles are always charming, peaceful and provide a welcome break from the rapidly emptying wallets on the mainland. We love to pack a picnic",
          "a nice walk, no beach, but we went for a swim off the rocks. A few places to eat, overpriced, poor quality food",
          "The ferry ride was relaxing. It was nice to walk around the island & look at the church and the old tower. We had 3 nights in Cannes, so this was a pleasant break from the crowds. We tasted a sweet wine made there; it was like a liquor, which isn't my choice, but I'm glad we",
          "I have been to the Iles de Lerins a few times. It is a great way to get out on the water for not too much money. There are two islands, Ile St Margarite and Ile St Honorat. I prefer St Margarite. There is a wonderful museum and prison cells to explore. Apparantly the Man in",

          "Perfection! On a hot summer day, walk to the end of the croisette and buy a ticket to either St Margaret or Honorat! Both have their qualities - both can be quiet and peaceful but Honorat more so (it's the smaller of the two). Take a cooler bag of drinks, a towel and your sun",
          "Cute little island near the coast of Cannes. Nice little relaxation walk but nothing out of this world. If you have time it would be interesting otherwise you are not spoiling your south of france experience by not going",
          "For \u20ac15 and a 15min ferry ride either of the Islands are a must. We did St Marguerite one day, taking the snorkels and beach towels, and just relaxed by the waters edge. We didn't explore any more as we got there late. The last ferry is at 6pm in the Summer so make sure you go",
          "The Lerins are well worth a trip to escape the hustle and bustle of Cannes. Not that you will find yourself alone. But walking the pathways is lovely and there are plenty of little bays and coves where one can sun bathe, swim and enjoy the lovely clear water. Bring a snorkel",
          "Great little spot for historic sight seeing and a nice meal. We anchored just off the island and a water taxi took us right to the dock in front of the restaurant. After we had a great meal, we walked over to the monastery. The grounds were gorgeous and peaceful.",
          "The boat ride is lovely...and the walking trails on St Marguerite are quite nice. Buy a couple of sandwiches and perch down anywhere among the trees for an impromptu picnic. But the actual museum of the Man in the Iron mask is a let down...nothing much to see there...not even",
          "Our group went over and dined on the island. It's a boater's paradise surrounding the island, and a lovely escape to peace and quiet and nature - just a 30-minute ferry ride away from hectic Cannes. If you're in Cannes, this island and Ille Sainte-Marguerite are both worth the",
          "First of all I am not a big city person (when you live in NYC few cities feel as impressive as that one...) and overall Cannes feels a notch down compared to Nice. However, the Saint Honorat isldand (smaller of the two) is absolutely a gem! The water, the stones and most of all,",

          "There are two islands, St Honorat and St Marguerite - both around a 15-20min boat trip from Cannes. Will cost you around 15euros each. Nice isolated place compared to the Riviera, where one can have a nice walk to the fort.",
          "Visited St Honorat - a beautiful quiet place in the middle of the crowded Riviera. The whole place carries a sense of calm amid all the activity so close by, and felt really special. Out of season when the crowds subside it must be a very special place indeed",
          "A private island, home to a group of monks that have a vineyard. The buildings are beautiful old ruins and the monastery is rather spectacular. The view from the top of the old fort is breathtaking. But that's about it. It's peaceful but there isn't much to see or do. The",

          "Both islands are beutiful with each having a different feel to it. In mid November the weather was still warm and beautiful, like an English September day. Reduced service, only 4 on our boat mid morning, but enough boats to take you out for a good day trip. Take a picnic -",
          "Both islands have their merits and each is worth a visit any time of year as long as the sea is calm (which is most of the time). The ferry only takes around half an hour to forty minutes and is good value. Do look out if you are parking near the terminal as I've seen car after",
          "Please note to go inside the monastery you need to wait for a guided tour. We by mistake wandered in the back way via the vegetable garden and were told very politely that we should not have done so, but it was interesting! Ladies are not meant to wander around this monastic",

          "There are two islands, St Honorat and St Marguerite. St Honorat is the smaller of the islands - you can stroll around it in under an hour. Both are lovely - calm, tranquil, peaceful escapes. There's more extensive walking to be had on Marguerite. Both have nice coves for picnics",
          "Quite island to have a peaceful swim. Just a 15 minute ferry ride to the islands. Prices are 13 euro and 15.50 euro respectively.",
          "We love ile st Honorat, the smallest of the two islands that make \"iles de Lerins\". It is owned by monks who run a very good restaurant. You can also visit the fort and the abbaye. It is not easy for people with small children as access to the beach is not straighforward",
          "We walked from one end to the other. Found a isolated spot for a picnic and a cooling dip. The water fountains to refresh your bottle are lovely and old and work well. The wooded walks are clearly marked. Some fabulous history and clear environmentally sensitive restoration and",
          "Brilliant time, trekking, good food, history, good wine and beach (not great for swimming though) . My only negative is that if you are going for the beach, then stay in Cannes as there are sandy beaches while the islands are rocks and pebbles.",
          "I went to Sainte Marguerite...really gorgeous, nice beaches, beautiful forest trails, and a fantastic museum. It's not far from Cannes... little ferry ride and you are on an island where you can relax and enjoy the beauty of the nature, and go to the museum for some history.",
          "Some lovely quiet spots around the island for relaxing and swimming. There are not many facilities on the furthest parts away from the boat docking area. The ferry is quick 15 mins to get there and a reasonable \u20ac8 each likely the best deal you will get in Cannes",

          "Enchanting little island lost in time, be sure to bring your own map or a GPS as it's a bit easy to get lost there, unless that is your intent. The wine is only so so on Munk's Island, not entirely worth the 25 euro bottle price tag, but perhaps the margin for price. Best bring",
          "As disappointing as Cannes can be, just take the short boat ride to this island with a nice, well-preserved fort. The short sea ride is nice, the island beautiful, the fort well preserved and with interesting history as well as stunning views. The fort is a short walk from the",
          "Spent the day there - the ferry ride over it was POURING rain, and so we grabbed some (very expensive) tea in the restaurant while we waited for the rain to die down. Once the rain was gone, we saw the amazing tranquility and beauty of this island. Truly incredible. We",
          "It is a beautiful island. Beautiful scenery! Has 2 restaurants but didn't try the food cause they were closed. The Fort / prison museum was great to visit. I saw cell where the man with the iron mask was held. Beautiful view of the riviera.",
          "We had an enjoyable and energetic day on Ile Sainte Marguerite. The old fort and museum was certainly worth the trip over. The food was OK if a little expensive. I was surprised at a comment read before we went that they couldn't find the beach. It was pretty self evident",
          "This is a nice change from Cannes - Nice walks in relatively fresh air for the season.. However, the beaches are almost as busy as the ones in Cannes, and lots of rocks, so don't expect to find a \"secret spot\" for the day. Also, make sure you bring your own foodd. The",
          "The ruins of the monastery are stunning to photograph. The light coming down theough the open roof is magical. Take a 20 minute ferry ride from Cannes which gives you great views of the waterfront and the yachts that are moored near the islands. The ruins opened today at 10:30.",
          "The islands are nice if you can get out there nice and early stake out a good little spot and make sure you have all your provisions for the day. If not, you will have a hot and dusty day with few options for toilet breaks. There are only a very limited number of swimming",

          "A nice 15 minute boat ride gets you to Ile Ste Marguerite from Cannes. Boats run at regular intervals. It seems to have much to offer, but in the heat, walking was difficult, so we had to settle on seeing less. Many buildings are in disrpeair or hoarded up, which is a pity. We",
          "Visited Ste-Marguerite with my family on a beautiful sunny day and our only regret is we never bought a picnic with us as there are loads of lovely spots for a picnic (and a glass of wine maybe) We drove from Nice and parked in the port car park arriving about 10.30 and there",
          "These two islands make a nice day trip out from Cannes and both have a very different feel. Ile Sainte Marguerite is bigger and feels more wild, you can hike around the inland pathways or pick your way around the shores. If you're feeling rich you can eat at La Guerite",
          "A 20 minute boat ride to St Honorat, home to a community of contemplative monks since the 16th century. The boat departs from the quai at the very end of La Croisette. A lovely peaceful place away from the busy holiday atmosphere of Cannes. Well worth a visit to take some",

          "Two beautiful islands just ten minutes by boat from Cannes. Lovely ,unspoilt and a real unspoilt oasis. We go often in the summer and have a walk around or a picnic. Definitely one of the best things to do on the Riviera. If you are feeling fit you can always hire a canoe and",

          "We went to St.Honoret. We have been there many times in past years, but this was the first time we had taken our grandchildren. The crossing from Cannes takes about 25 minutes. The island is wonderfully peaceful and a boatfull of passengers is quickly dispersed along peaceful",
          "There are two islands but I took the excursion to Ile Sainte Margeurite from Cannes, 12.50 euros return with Cote Azur. I would not under normal circumstances visit Cannes, and you can do this trip from Nice, but it's about three times the price. The island was just amazing. It",
          "Very nice afternoon at the Ile Marguerite, Cannes. We took the boat ride of 15 minutes from Cannes to St Marguerite Island. Very nice island, good to spend with family and friends, including young children. You can actually walk around the complete island. It helps when it is a",

          "A short ferry trip from old Cannes port to St. Margueirite - 12 euros per person return. A very quiet little island withseveral different beautiful walks through the pines. in 2 hours we met about 8 people. If you want to relax from bustling Cannes - this is the place to go for",
          "Tired of the busy buzz of Cannes, Juan-les-Pins or Antibes? Looking for a tranquil cove to swim in pristine water? Take one of the excursion boats departing every hour for Saint Margerite Island. Saint Honorat, the second Lerins Island, can also be visited but there forget about",
          "The Lerins Islands are close to Cannes and you may visit them by using one of the boats in the Port (west of the Palace and Hotel de Ville). The cost of round trip to Margarieta Island is ca 22 euro, to St, Honorat island it is 28 euro return per person. It makes a great trip",
          "I love Sainte Marguerite Island and try to go as often as possible. It's great any time of year. In the summer for swimming at one of the many creeks and eating a Pan Bagnat sandwich with a glass of ros\u00e9 wine. In spring, fall or winter it's great for light hiking among the",
          "This beautiful island is located just 15 minutes (by ferry) off the coast of Cannes. Simply purchase a ticket and sail to this sunny island from the port. The island is famous for the fortress which held 'the man in the iron mask' but is best for hiking, swimming and relaxing.",

          "My mate and I were only in Cannes for a couple of days and decided to take a ferry to the larger island. We wanted to visit both but didn't have the time. The ferry is very inexpensive and we found this to be a peaceful, scenic day trip. We wandered all over the island from the",
          "Just a short boat-ride from Cannes or Juan Les Pins, well worth a visit given how crowded and noisy this area of France can be. Plenty of deserted coves for swimming and lazing around or the monastery for the more active - you can easily spend a day in the Lerins without getting",
          "I really enjoyed the two islands (on separate trips). I think the smaller is best for tourists as there is the monastery and small shop with items made by the brothers and the walk is shorter if you are fitting it in as part of a busy day sightseeing. The larger island has",

          "Easy and cheap (14 Euros pp return) to St. Honorat and it was great. The ferry was very good and perfectly on time. The restaurant, La Tonelle, was very good and we loved exploring all of the historic buildings. Well worth the trip.",
          "Les Isles are a refreshing experience and very different than all other things Canneois. One can hike, stroll, rock climb, swim and enjoy the gardens. It's particularly interesting if you read up On the Islands' history before you go. We shared the day with another family and",

          "After the usual hour getting into Cannes by road, always a nightmare, I was fed up and bad tempered, but friends had chartered a boat so once I was on that (a glorious big schooner) I was happier. I don't know what it's like getting to the islands by ferry but however you get",
          "Our hotel seemed reluctant to send us here, seeing as there are only 2 actual beaches here. But it would have been a shame to miss this beautiful spot. Its a short ferry ride over, 15 minutes from Cannes. Basically you just walk around to find a cove you like (don't go to the",

          "This is really a nice day trip, going there by boat. There are two islands, St Marguerite is the largest with nice walks and picnic sopts, plus the castle. St Honorat is IMHO more interesting, can visit the monastery and the wine-making monks.",
          "It is a very easy crossing, just 20 minutes across the bay from Cannes to the Ile Sainte Marguerite, and it is a wonderful excursion. Most of the island is covered by pinewoods and there are no cycle paths, so you can't take a bike over to the island, and you have to go",
          "The two islands are very different. One island has the old monastery with the monks still living in it and selling wine. The other island next door has a giant fort built by Vauban, where the man 'with the Iron Mask' was in prison. It also has lovely long walks and good",

          "I know the Isles de Lerins since 1987, and recently they raised prices for the ferry and split the cruise and introduced an horrendous fee for the fortress! Once there was one ferry company providing a rather cheap trip to either one island or a combination ticket for both",

        "wiki": "Cannes (; French: [kan]; Occitan: Canas) is a city located on the French Riviera. It is a commune located in the Alpes-Maritimes department, and host city of the annual Cannes Film Festival, Midem, and Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. The city is known for its association with the rich and famous, its luxury hotels and restaurants, and for several conferences. On 3 November 2011 it hosted the 2011 G20 summit.\n\n\n== History ==\nBy the 2nd century BC, the Ligurian Oxybii established a settlement here known as Aegitna (Ancient Greek: \u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bd\u03b1). Historians are unsure what the name means. The area was a fishing village used as a port of call between the L\u00e9rins Islands.\n\nIn 154 BC, it became the scene of violent but quick conflict between the troops of Quintus Opimius and the Oxybii.In the 10th century, the town was known as Canua. The name may derive from \"canna\", a reed. Canua was probably the site of a small Ligurian port, and later a Roman outpost on Le Suquet hill, suggested by Roman tombs discovered here. Le Suquet housed an 11th-century tower, which overlooked swamps where the city now stands. Most of the ancient activity, especially protection, was on the L\u00e9rins Islands, and the history of Cannes is closely tied to the history of the islands.\nAn attack by the Saracens in 891, who remained until the end of the 10th century, devastated the country around Canua. The insecurity of the L\u00e9rins islands forced the monks to settle on the mainland, at the Suquet. Construction of a castle in 1035 fortified the city by then known as Cannes, and at the end of the 11th century construction was started on two towers on the L\u00e9rins islands. One took a century to build.\nAround 1530, Cannes detached from the monks who had controlled the city for hundreds of years and became independent.\nDuring the 18th century, both the Spanish and British tried to gain control of the L\u00e9rins Islands but were chased away by the French. The islands were later controlled by many, such as Jean-Honor\u00e9 Alziary and the Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus. They had many different purposes: at the end of the 19th century, one served as hospital for soldiers wounded in the Crimean War.\nHenry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux bought land at the Croix des Gardes and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise. His work to improve living conditions attracted the English aristocracy, who also built winter residences.\nAt the end of the 19th century, several railways were completed, which prompted the arrival of streetcars. In Cannes, projects such as the Boulevard Carnot and the rue d'Antibes were carried out. After the closure of the Casino des Fleurs (h\u00f4tel Gallia), a luxury establishment was built for the rich winter clientele, the Casino Municipal next to the pier Albert-Edouard. This casino was demolished and replaced by the new Palace in 1979.\nIn the 20th century, new luxury hotels such as the Carlton, Majestic, Martinez, and JW Marriott Cannes were built. The city was modernised with a sports centre, a post office, and schools. There were fewer British and German tourists after the First World War, but more Americans. Winter tourism gave way to summer tourism, and the summer casino at the Palm Beach was constructed.\nThe city council had the idea of starting an international film festival shortly before World War II. The first opened on 20 September 1946, held in the Casino Municipal.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nCannes has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa) and the city enjoys 11 hours of sunshine per day during summer (July), while in winter (December to February) the weather is mild. Both seasons see a relatively low rainfall and most rain occurs during October and November, when 110 mm (4.3 in) falls.\nCannes summers are long and warm, with summer daytime temperatures regularly hitting 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), while average temperatures are about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Temperatures remain high from June to September, the busiest time of the year.\nMean temperatures drop below 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) for only three months of the year (December to February). The spring and autumn are also warm, although more suited to those who prefer slightly cooler weather.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nThe Promenade de la Croisette is the waterfront avenue with palm trees. La Croisette is known for picturesque beaches, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, boutiques and luxury hotels. Le Suquet, the old town, provides a good view of La Croisette. The fortified tower and Chapel of St Anne house the Mus\u00e9e de la Castre. A distinctive building in Cannes is the Russian Orthodox church.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\n\n=== Villas ===\nCannes of the 19th century can still be seen in its grand villas, built to reflect the wealth and standing of their owners and inspired by anything from medieval castles to Roman villas. They are not open to the public. Lord Brougham's Italianate Villa El\u00e9onore Louise (one of the first in Cannes) was built between 1835 and 1839. Also known as the Quartier des Anglais, this is the oldest residential area in Cannes. Another landmark is the Villa Fi\u00e9sole (known today as the Villa Domergue) designed by Jean-Gabriel Domergue in the style of Fiesole, near Florence, which may be visited on appointment.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite ===\n\nIt took the Man in the Iron Mask 11 years to leave the tiny, forested St Marguerite Island. The mysterious individual was believed to be of noble blood, but his identity has never been proven. His cell can be visited in the Fort of St Marguerite, now renamed the Mus\u00e9e de la Mer (Museum of the Sea). This museum also houses discoveries from shipwrecks off the island, including Roman (1st century BC) and Saracen (10th century AD) ceramics.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Saint-Honorat ===\n\nCistercian monks are the only inhabitants of the smaller, southern St Honorat Island. Monks have inhabited the island since AD 410 and, at the height of their powers, owned Cannes, Mougins, and Vallauris. Medieval vestiges remain in the stark church, which is open to the public, and in the ruins of the 11th-century monastery on the sea shore. The monks inhabit the L\u00e9rins Abbey and divide their time between prayer and producing red and white wines.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire de Provence houses artifacts from prehistoric to present, in an 18th-century mansion. The Mus\u00e9e de la Castre has objects from the Pacific Atolls, Peruvian relics and Mayan pottery. Other venues include the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, Mus\u00e9e de la Mer, Mus\u00e9e de la Photographie and Mus\u00e9e International de la Parfumerie.\n\n\n=== Theatre and music ===\nCannes is not renowned for traditional theatre. However, small venues stage productions and host short sketches during the annual International Actors' Performance Festival. Popular theaters include the Espace Miramar and the Alexandre III.\n\n\n=== Festivals and show events ===\nThe Cannes Film Festival founded in 1946 is held annually, usually in May, at the Palais des Festivals et des Congr\u00e8s.\nThe Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity is a global event and awards show for those working in advertising and related fields, held annually in June.\nMidem, the foremost trade show for the music industry.\nMIPIM, the world's largest property-related trade show.\nCarnival on the Riviera is an annual parade through the streets to mark the 21-day period prior to Shrove Tuesday.\nThe International Festival of Games is festival of bridge, belote, backgammon, chess, draughts, tarot and more (February).\nCannes Yachting Festival is an event for boating enthusiasts in the Vieux Port (September).\nThe International Actors' Performance Festival: comedy sketches and performances by fringe artists\nThe International Luxury Travel Market brings together under one roof the top international luxury travel providers and suppliers from all around the world.[1]\nLe Festival d'Art Pyrotechnique is a magnificent annual fireworks competition held in the summer at the Bay of Cannes.\nThe Global Champions Tour showjumping league has an annual event in the ports of Cannes.\nMipcom and MIPTV, held in October and April respectively, the world's most important trade markets for the television industry.\nThe Pan-African Film Festival, held in early April and featuring films from the African diaspora.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe area around Cannes has developed into a high-tech cluster. The technopolis of Sophia Antipolis lies in the hills beyond Cannes. The Film Festival is a major event for the industry which takes place every year during the month of May. In addition, Cannes hosts other major annual events such as the MIPIM, MIPTV, MIDEM, Cannes Lions, and the NRJ Music Awards.  There is an annual television festival in the last week in September.\nThe economic environment is based on tourism, business fairs, trade and aviation. Cannes has 6,500 companies, of which 3,000 are traders, artisans and service providers. In 2006, 421 new companies were registered.\nCannes hosts the Cannes Mandelieu Space Center, headquarters of Thales Alenia Space, the first European satellite manufacturer.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nCannes is home to football side AS Cannes.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nNice C\u00f4te d'Azur AirportLocated 24 km (15 mi) from Cannes, Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport has close to 10 million passengers a year.

          "It\u2019s an enjoyable walk along La Croisette. Lots of healthy & wealthy looking people. Some nice white sandy beach areas. Big beautiful hotels & of course the high end shops. However, much smarter to spend your money on Rue D\u2019 Antibes for 10 times more bang for your buck. It\u2019s",
          "We have been visiting Cannes for a long time and I must say not as manicured as it used to be. Needs a good makeover. Nevertheless, it is still beautiful. Great promenade for a long walk with beautiful people and views. Nice private beaches. Also has a couple of public beaches",

          "The mythical Croisette is a must when visiting Cannes. Great to start from the Palais des Festivals before reaching the Carlton Hotel. Afterwards head to Rue d'Antibes for nice shopping.",
          "If you\u2019re below 35... sack it off, go to somewhere trendier in Europe. Far too stuck up and pretentious, with horrific service. If you\u2019re gonna charge people to pay for water at a higher price per little than petrol, at least serve it quickly.",
          "Lovely part of Cannes, mixing with the rich and famous! Public beaches next to private beaches but you can pay to use them if you like. Clear waters, water sports, lovely restaurants, people, Casinos, beautiful scenery....what more do you want! Also super yachts everywhere.",

          "Beautiful epic views, but to be honest - you can see so much better in Miami Beach and much more warmer. There's nothing great about the South of France. But still gave it 5 stars.",
          "While I do not think La Croisette is a great spot to relax (at least during the festival), it is a fun place to people watch and see all the characters. Don't expect to go shopping here unless you want to pay top dollar.",
          "it was nice to leisurely stroll down the side walk of La Croisette. Personally I found Cannes itself to be a little boring. If I was into stalking movie stars at the film festival I guess it would be ok.",

          "La Croisette in Cannes is the coastal walk/road which is the icon with all the icons like the Martinez hotel or the Carlton. Great walk or jog with the ocean and the beach by your side the whole time.",

          "Can\u2019t imagine people coming to Cannes and not walking along La Croisette at some point whether to walk, look at the over the top yachts in the Marina or simply people watch. In March your walk will be interrupted by construction as repairs are completed and the beach is being",
          "One of the things that I like the most of Cannes , is this walking. Seeing the people passing , having an ice cream or Baguette ( it is a must if you are there!), and let the time pass...this is what life is about!",
          "The Croisette normally is beautiful, but now for the next few years there are a lot of constructions going around. They rebuild all the beaches and also they change everything on the Croisette. So now it\u2019s noisy and full of trucks (and of course, old people, because we are in",
          "Nice place to walk/ jog. Can sit on three beach, on the piers, on the boulevard or at one of the many restaurants on the beach. Part of it is in under construction until 2022 unfortunately.",
          "Lo & behold the magnificence of the French Plage as I wandered down the Croisette a few months ago. Go here for priceless views of nature in all its splendor clothed or otherwise. My bewitching step-Monster and I walked down the way after a few rose wines in us and had a",
          "Stayed at the JW which is located on the Croisette. The street along the Croisette is alight with expensive and well know brands like Louis Vuitton, Dolce Gabbana, Gucci, Bulgari and many more. Best sunset from the Raddisonblu, worth a visit. \u2764\ufe0f Cannes",

          "Whether its day or night the strolling on La Croisette because thats what you do on a Promenade is a treat. Having to choose better beautiful shops or inviting restaurants what a Wonderful way to spend your time.",

          "It\u2019s a sandy beach with some beachside restaurants.its about a mile long and 100 feet wide. Nice promenade too.",
          "Nice and clean beach in Cannes city center nearby Palais des Festivals. There is couple of showers also. We visited over there during October and there was plenty of free space, but I can imagine that it's pretty crowded during summertime.",
          "This is a breathtakingly beautiful location. I thoroughly enjoyed walking along the promenade and just stopped occasionally to sit in a blue chair and take in the views. As well as visiting during the day, I came here to watch the sunrise one morning. I just wanted to be there",
          "I have mixed views about the Croisette on this visit. On the one hand it has all the glamour and charm we associate it with. Especially staying over the road at the JW Marriott. However half the Croisette from the Carlton onwards (away from the centre) is under major",
          "Wow just beautiful!! Amazing shopping and restaurants!! We enjoyed the private beach club that went with our hotel. Simply an amazing place !!",
          "The sights of Cannes are very evident here. The little train ride takes a nice overview. More great restaurants here than can be visited",
          "A beautiful and elegant promenade. Very chic shops and hotels. Very elegant people in general. Well worth a visit.",
          "Great walk to see Cannes and the Old town. The Casino, the Arts Center and the Stars handprints are located there as well as the Tourist Information Center.",
          "This is the quintessential Cannes experience - beautiful water, lovely beach umbrellas and lounges for rent, expensive drinks and snacks. We truly enjoyed the beach and the service was great! The restaurant menu was limited and the waiter was unpleasant though and if we choose",
          "Good salads. But this place is super crowded and the service tends to be pushy because they need to make sure they utilize all the space.",
          "Enjoy fresh air, enjoy walking, running, working out? Enjoy scenic breathtaking views? The La Coisette offers all of the above. Walk from one end of the beach in Cannes to the other. Start from the old city pier and end up in the Captains marina. Beautiful walk along the",
          "The La Croisette is a great place to walk along. The pubic beach areas are free, but if you want a sun lounger (sun bed) and a umbrella then it will cost up to \u20ac70 for 2 people and they do not let you hire 1 sun lounger for 2 people to share. I found that if you go beyond the",

The staff in the shops were actually quite nice and friendly, although we were careful not to scream \u201chow much!!\u201d at the top",
          "Nice beach walk on the waterfront of Cannes with plentiful opportunities to stop for a refill of food or drinks or even a sitdown for a while. Like it a lot.",
          "Beautiful beaches. More of a city than I realized though, not a quaint town. A little like a zoo, even in off season and during the week days",
          "We loved walking along La Croisette almost daily.During our visit to Cannes a major regatta was taking place and consequently the area was bustling.Beautiful views,plentiful snackbars,plenty of opportunity for \"people watching\"-this prom has the lot.Lovely harbour areas at each",
          "Not sure about this. The place was being set up for something. There seemed to be construction and cranes everywhere... difficult to walk around. But got there in the end. Beachfront was pretty enough with ridiculous shops with their overpriced goods across the street",

          "Stayed in Cannes so used this beach a couple of times, the sand itself was very clean, the water was clean (ish) Our children enjoyed it",
          "This is the most overrated place. Yes it is nice but not up to the hype. Take a walk on the croisette, enjoy the greenery and beach view, do a little shopping, and that\u2019s it. The beach area is not very great.",
          "Fabulous beach, I really loved it. Even it was a little expensive but it deserves. A good place to spent time with kids, clean beach( the private ones). But the public beach especially one that was beside the festival hall was not clean. If I would go to Cannes I will visit it",
          "The whole seasode is blocked for works till end of April 2019. Loud, dirty and no view. Most of the hotels do not mention it when you book.",

          "It was raining cats and dogs while we were walking and everyone was running for shelter but that meant there weren\u2019t many people so we had a blast. It was a hot day and still raining so the rain was refreshing. It stopped after a while and the place cooled down. You will enjoy",
          "Nice shops and great hotels on one side and nice waterfront on the other side strolling is very nice with all the beauty around",
          "Beautiful weather all year long with small shops to get yourself something to eat or drink or even a desert (ice cream, crepe, etc).",
          "We visited Cannes during a cruise and were taken with the cleanliness of the place. Unfortunately the temperature was extremely high [ according to the iPhone 42 degrees!] and we retreated to the ship after a stroll as far as La Croisette",
          "We spent 4 nights in Cannes and I already can\u2019t wait to go back. We had a lovely beach club included with our hotel on La Croisette. It is a lovely place, one side you have all the beach clubs and there are lots of them and then across the road you have all the expensive shops",
          "Strolling down La Croisette is something you must do when visiting Cannes. It is lined with shops and seaside cafes. Take time to sit down the boulevard and enjoy the view of the gorgeous blue water. It's a simple pleasure, not an amusement park attraction. Enjoy the people",
          "Man-made beauty on one side (luxurious buildings) and the sea on the other, La Croisette is a place for everyone - just walk and watch people, shop (go into the interior lanes for better prices!), enjoy the views all around!",
          "This is the place to go to people watch day or night. Suffice to say the characters come out at night as they do every where. Have a ball of Glace, sit down , relax and watch..So much fun!",
          "It\u2019s two different places in the morning and evening. During the day it\u2019s the beach hitters path, full of families and slow strollers. And in the evening everyone is on the croisette sitting, standing and talking. Right next to the beach clubs and restaurants with an amazing",
          "We hear so much about Cannes, I guess you need to be there when the festival is on. Sure the streets are pretty, but the Croisette is overcrowded for nothing ! Not that much to see. We tried picnicking in the park, but were told to leave by local police. We can't sit on the",
          "You can say that it is the main actual attraction of Cannes. All the major beach bars, venues during the festival of Cannes and nice beaches are located at the Croisette. On you right hand the seaside and on your left hand all the major and famous brand stores like LV, Gucci",
          "We visited 4 of the 6 beaches and Cannes. La Croisette was not on put favourite list. We like very much the Midi Beach and Mour\u00e9 Rouge Beach near Palm Beach. Both beaches are clean and the water is clear. We love it!!!",
          "Walking along La Croisette is great fun and interesting when visiting Cannes. There\u2019s lots to see and do and an absolute must when in Cannes. The shops are fantastic with every designer brand imaginable.",
          "Terrible experience. The whole world speaks about this place. Dirty. Crowded. Unfriendly people all over the place. Shocking to see highly luxury cars standing in front of hotels and right accross the road the misery of homeless men and women battling to stay alive. Positive",
          "Staffs are very snobby. Once you get in, they force you to buy 500 Euro wine. I would definitely not commend any of my friend to come here. We may be rich, but not stupid.",
          "La Croisette is fun to walk day and night. The only thing I don't like about it is that I don't live there and can't do it every day! There is always something fun to check out, something new and great people watching. Nice to stop and hang out after dinner, very romantic",

          "Great place to view the wealthy with their designer clothes and exotic vehicles! Besides this it is also a lovely walk fro end to end taking in the breathtaking views across the bay. Plus lots of stops along the way from a gourmet meal to a coffee. Had a great week in Cannes and",

          "There are private as well as public sections on this beach. We ended up near the Intercon Carlton section, with Euro 25.00 per chair. Water is fantastic cleaned and perfect temperature. Beach boys service ( rather lousy) as they rather chase the super rich Lambo and Ferrari",
          "Wonderful place!!! All the high end stores are there just in front of the amazing beach... loved it!!",
          "Fabulous to walk, run or saunter down at all times of the day. Fireworks in summer are wonderful so look out for them. Best show I\u2019ve seen for some time. Beaches expensive to sit on in the day (\u20ac20) unless you do the public ones which are small but free. Lots of nice drinks",
          "Beautiful beach but ensure you take a picnic or your own alcohol as, you might expect, bars to sit there aren't cheap. We played cards with a drink for several hours in one of the beachside bars with plenty of water as compromise",
          "Beautiful walk from the start to the end, great places to eat, even better to shop. It is a must during a Cannes visit",
          "But there are approximately 56,000 tourists walking on it most of the day. After staying right on it for a week, I\u2019d rather have someplace quieter. Tons of vendors selling trinkets and junk. But the views of the bay were stunning. Unfortunately the throng of people and cruise",
          "Tried a couple of different beach clubs in cannes, but this one really did it for us, visiting with my family, we ended up going there for the rest of the vacation in Cannes, due to the food and the staff and prices.",
          "Nice place to walk, shop and people watch. Some expensive luxury shops which are nice. Just a nice place to take a stroll.",
          "I have seen many beaches worldwide and can say that this public beach is good. The left side separated by sea breaker is cleaner than right one. Open air shower is available here. Please take to consideration that it is not allowed to change clothes in the nearest public toilets.",
          "Walking & jugging at Croisette is very comfortable & enjoyable ! You can enjoy the Mediterranean & at the same time look at the shops & have a good coffee on your way !",
          "Well known all over the world. May be a little overrated from my point of view but kind of a \"been-there-done that\" thing as it is so well known. \"You will never walk alone\" here.......",
          "Famous for the red carpet, it\u2019s also home to the ultra luxury shopping zone, small cafes, beaches lined with umbrellas and a Christmas Market in winter. Not my favorite place on the French Riviera, but worth a walk at least once in your life.",
          "Nice place for walking, all luxury shops there , a lot of cafe shops and restaurant also available.. really was very amazing place",
          "We have visited Cannes many times. La Croisette gets better and better. It is a wonderful place to walk and enjoy the vistas, including the beautiful sandy beach on one side and the gorgeous hotels on the other. Flowers and people watching are outstanding. Bring your swim suit.",
          "Lovely beach, v picturesque and lovely sea to swim in. Recommend you get a deal with your hotel so that you have sunloungers included otherwise they\u2019re very expensive to hire. Can get busy so it\u2019s tricky to get a spot close to the water. Good bars and restos for good available",
          "La Croisette was a few minute walk from our hotel. This strip of beach front is great for shopping during the day - packed with designer shops. In the evening it is transformed into a superb site for pricey dining and socialising - enticing beachfront caf\u00e8s and hotel restaurants",
          "most of the beach taken up by private restaurants,or hotels,there are two small sections open for the public,we enjoyed the land train,which goes up and down the croisette",

          "There is no better exercise than a daily walk up and down La Croisette. It was a happy d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, after an absence of 20 years. Too many nice terasses and restaurants for 8 days, so coming back is a must.",
          "... as expected. Local families there as well though. Parking quite difficult. Shops are the usual luxury brands. I find other places far more unique",
          "Of your in Cannes or near by you should walk down the La Croisette. Its just a beautiful famous boardwalk in the French Riviera. Take your time. I would recommend a walking tour if you can. I'm sure we missed many things but did visit the famous red steps, Hotel de Ville, and",

          "A nice place to walk and see the designer shops and top hotels but that's it, as far as the street is concerned it's nothing special at all, not very pretty. The beach is ok, again nothing special. All pretty average apart from the designer shops and hotels.",

        "wiki": "Southland Tales is a 2006 science fiction comedy thriller film and the second film written and directed by Richard Kelly. The title refers to the Southland, a name used by locals to refer to Southern California and Greater Los Angeles. Set in the then-near future of 2008, as part of an alternate history, the film is a portrait of Los Angeles, and a satiric commentary on the military\u2013industrial complex and the infotainment industry. The film features an ensemble cast including Dwayne Johnson, Seann William Scott, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Mandy Moore, and Justin Timberlake. Original music was provided by Moby. The film is an international co-production of the United States, Germany and France.The film premiered May 21, 2006, at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, where it was poorly received. After significant edits, the final version premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 22, 2007.  It opened in limited release in California on November 14, 2007, and in Canada as well as nationwide in United States, in just 63 theaters, on November 16, 2007. The film opened in the United Kingdom on December 7, 2007.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOn July 4th, 2005, in a fictionalized United States alternate history reality, two towns in Texas (El Paso and Abilene) were destroyed by twin nuclear attacks, killing thousands and triggering a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions, sending America into a state of anarchy and hysteria, as well as a Third World War (a fictionalized version of what the nation may have become under the War on Terror), with the US government re-introducing the draft.  The PATRIOT Act has extended authority to a new agency known as US-IDent, which keeps constant surveillance on citizens\u2014even to the extent of censoring the Internet and requiring fingerprints to access computers and bank accounts. In response to the recent fuel shortage in the wake of global warfare, the German company Treer designs a generator of inexhaustible energy, which is propelled by the perpetual motion of ocean currents, called \"Fluid Karma\". However, its inventor Baron von Westphalen and his associates are hiding the fact that the generators alter the ocean's currents and cause the Earth to slow its rotation, and that the transmission of Fluid Karma to portable receivers (via quantum entanglement) is ripping holes in the fabric of space and time.\nIn near-future 2008, Los Angeles (referred to as \"The Southland\" by locals) is a city on the brink of chaos overshadowed by the growth of an underground neo-Marxist organization. The film follows the criss-crossed destinies of Boxer Santaros, an action film actor stricken with amnesia; Krysta Now, a psychic ex-porn star in the midst of creating a reality TV show; and twin brothers Roland and Ronald Taverner, whose destinies become intertwined with that of all mankind. The Taverner twins are revealed to be the same person by the engineers of Treer, duplicated when Roland traveled through a rift in space-time, while Boxer has become the most wanted man in the world despite his political ties and his having the fate of the future, in the form of a prophetic screenplay foretelling the end of the world, in his hands.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nDwayne Johnson as Boxer Santaros / Jericho Cane, an amnesiac action star whose life crosses paths with Krysta Now. Santaros is married to Madeline Frost Santaros.\nSeann William Scott as Private Roland Taverner / Officer Ronald Taverner, identical twin brothers, one who is a kidnapped U.P.U.2 officer in Hermosa Beach, California, the other who is working for the neo-Marxist group who have told him he kidnapped and drugged his brother.\nSarah Michelle Gellar as Krysta Now / Krysta Lynn Kapowski, an adult film star who is working on creating a reality TV show. Gellar met with Kelly and was drawn to the original ideas in his script for Southland Tales.\nMandy Moore as Madeline Frost Santaros, Boxer Santaros' wife and daughter of Senator Bobby Frost.\nJustin Timberlake as Private Pilot Abilene, an Iraq War veteran. He narrates the film and also mimes a musical number.\nMiranda Richardson as Nana Mae Frost, the ambitious antagonist of the film, Boxer's mother-in-law is the head of US-IDent.\nWallace Shawn as Baron von Westphalen, a villain who utilizes ocean waves to create a source of power. He is the great-grandson of Jenny von Westphalen.\nBai Ling as Serpentine, the Baron's sultry girlfriend who is seen quite often through the film, she serves as an ambiguous character that knows more than she lets on.\nNora Dunn as Cyndi Pinziki, a porn director and principal member of USIDeath, an organization with plans to destroy US-IDent.\nJohn Larroquette as Vaughn Smallhouse, an advisor to Senator Bobby Frost.\nKevin Smith as Simon Theory, a legless Iraq War veteran who works for Baron von Westphalen.\n\n\n== Production ==\nKelly wrote Southland Tales shortly before the September 11 attacks. The original script involved blackmail, a porn star, and two cops. After the attacks, Kelly revised the script. He said, \"[The original script] was more about making fun of Hollywood. But now it's about, I hope, creating a piece of science fiction that's about a really important problem we're facing, about civil liberties and homeland security and needing to sustain both those things and balance them.\" He described the film as a \"tapestry of ideas all related to some of the biggest issues that I think we're facing right now . . . alternative fuel or the increasing obsession with celebrity and how celebrity now intertwines with politics\". With the film's premise of a nuclear attack on Texas, Kelly wanted to take a look at how the United States would respond and survive while constructing a \"great black comedy.\"Kelly's breakthrough film, Donnie Darko, was released in the United States on October 26, 2001, the same day the PATRIOT Act was signed. Two months before Southland Tales was released, he announced the launch of Darko Entertainment.Kelly said: \"[Southland Tales] will only be a musical in a post-modern sense of the word in that it is a hybrid of several genres. There will be some dancing and singing, but it will be incorporated into the story in very logical scenarios as well as fantasy dream environments.\" Kelly said the film's biggest influences are Kiss Me Deadly, Pulp Fiction, Brazil, and Dr. Strangelove. He called it a \"strange hybrid of the sensibilities of Andy Warhol and Philip K. Dick\". The film often references religious and literary works; a policeman says, \"Flow my tears,\" in reference to a Philip K. Dick novel of that name. (\"Taverner\" is the name of the main character in the same book and suffers identity problems of his own.) Pilot Abilene (Justin Timberlake) quotes Biblical scripture from the Book of Revelation in narrating the film and allusion is made both to Robert Frost's The Road Not Taken, Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening and an altered version of T. S. Eliot's The Hollow Men.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn March 2004, Kelly and Cherry Road Films began development of Southland Tales. Filmmakers entered negotiations with actors Seann William Scott, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jason Lee, Janeane Garofalo, Tim Blake Nelson, Amy Poehler, Kevin Smith, and Ali Larter. Musician Moby was approached on composing and performing the film's score. Kelly consciously sought out actors that he felt had been pigeonholed and wanted to showcase their \"undiscovered talents.\"\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming was slated to begin in July 2004, but after a year, it had not begun. Dwayne Johnson joined the cast in April 2005, and principal photography was slated to begin August 1, 2005 in Los Angeles. Filming began on August 15, 2005, with a budget of around US$15\u201317 million.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nKelly sent the organizers of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival a rough cut of Southland Tales on DVD assuming that it would not be accepted. Much to his surprise, they loved it and wanted the film entered in competition for the Palme d'Or. He stopped editing the film and was also unable to complete all of the visual effects in time for the screening. Kelly's film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2006 with a length of 160 minutes. Kelly describes the negative reaction at Cannes as a \"very painful experience on a lot of levels\" but ultimately felt that the film \"was better off because of it\". After the film's festival release, Southland Tales was purchased by Sony Pictures.Universal Studios had originally optioned the U.S. rights, but after the Cannes screening, it was sold to Sony, although Universal still retained some international rights. Kelly sought more financing to finish visual effects for the film, and he negotiated a deal with Sony to cut down on the film's length in exchange for funds to complete the visual effects.Kelly edited the film down to the basic storylines of the characters portrayed by Scott, Gellar, and Johnson. The director also sought to keep the musical number performed by Timberlake, based on \"All These Things That I've Done\" by The Killers which he felt was the heart and soul of the film. Editorial changes were made to restructure the order of the film's scenes, including re-recording all of Timberlake's voice-over. The director also added 90 new visual effects shots to the film and removed 20 to 25 minutes of footage from his initial cut.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nSouthland Tales: Music from the Motion Picture is the original soundtrack of Richard Kelly's 2007 film Southland Tales.\n\"Wave of Mutilation\" (UK surf version) by Pixies\n\"Oh My Angel\" by Bertha Tillman\n\"Howl\" (extended version) by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club\n\"Look Back In\" by Moby\n\"Me & Bobby McGee\" by Waylon Jennings\n\"Chord Sounds\" by Moby\n\"Lucky Me\" by Roger Webb\n\"3 Steps\" by Moby\n\"Broken Hearted Savior\" by Big Head Todd and the Monsters\n\"Teen Horniness Is Not a Crime\" by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Abbey McBride and ClarKent\n\"Tiny Elephants\" by Moby\n\"Forget Myself by Elbow\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" by Rebekah Del Rio & the Section Quartet\n\"Three Days\" (live version) by Jane's Addiction\n\"Memory Gospel\" by MobyThe soundtrack for Southland Tales was released in stores and online on November 6, 2007.

Additionally, tracks from Radiohead, Louis Armstrong, Beethoven, Kris Kristofferson, and several tracks from Moby's Hotel:Ambient are likewise absent from the album. The reason for the exclusion of some of these tracks, like the song by The Killers was as a result of a dispute with the record label.The track \"Memory Gospel\" was used from time to time by the CBC Radio One program Q in the background of an opening monologue given by host Jian Ghomeshi.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nSouthland Tales was initially planned to be a nine-part \"interactive experience\", with the first six parts published in six 100-page graphic novels that would be released in a six-month period up to the film's release. The feature film comprises the final three parts of the experience. A website was also developed to intertwine with the graphic novels and the film itself. The idea of six graphic novels was later narrowed down to three. The novels were written by Kelly and illustrated by Brett Weldele. Kelly wrote them while making the film and found it very difficult as it pushed him \"to the edge of my own sanity\", as he remarked in an interview.\nPart One: Two Roads Diverge (May 25, 2006, ISBN 0-936211-75-X)\nPart Two: Fingerprints (September 15, 2006, ISBN 0-936211-76-8)\nPart Three: The Mechanicals (January 31, 2007, ISBN 0-936211-77-6)They have been collected together into one single volume:\n\nSouthland Tales: The Prequel Saga (360 pages, Graphitti Designs, ISBN 0-936211-80-6)The titles of the parts in the film are:\nPart Four: Temptation Waits\nPart Five: Memory Gospel\nPart Six: Wave of Mutilation\n\n\n=== Theatrical release ===\n\nSouthland Tales was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on November 9, 2007 in partnership with Destination Films and Samuel Goldwyn Films. The release, in just 63 venues, was pushed back five days to November 14, 2007. The film was released in the UK on December 7, 2007 exclusively to UK cinema chain Cineworld in a limited number of locations.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe Region 1 DVD was released on March 18, 2008 in North America and the Region 2 release was on March 31, 2008 in the United Kingdom. The film was released on Region 4 DVD in Australia on April 30, 2008. Special features include a 33-minute documentary USIDent TV: Surveiling the Southland and a 10-minute animated short film This Is the Way the World Ends (which was not included on the R2 and R4 editions). On March 25, 2009, the R2 DVD was released in France.\nKelly has claimed on his MySpace blog that he had very little time for the DVD as he was starting shooting on his next feature, The Box. However, he has stated several times that if Sony commissioned one (based on the sales of the current DVD), he would happily be involved in a \"Director's Cut\" DVD in the future with more special features and deleted scenes from the Cannes cut.\nOn September 8, 2008, it was announced that it would be one of the five films being released on Blu-ray on November 18, 2008. The only new special feature announced was an audio commentary by Kelly.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nSouthland Tales grossed $275,380 in limited release at the North American box office and $99,363 in Turkey and United Kingdom for a worldwide total of $374,743, against a production budget of $17 million.\n\n\n=== Cannes Film Festival ===\nAlong with two other American filmmakers (Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette and Richard Linklater's Fast Food Nation), Kelly's follow-up to Donnie Darko was in competition for the coveted Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and was screened on May 21 at the Grand Lumiere Theater.Many critics responded unfavorably to the film's long running time and sprawling nature. Roger Ebert described the Cannes screening as \"The most disastrous since, yes, The Brown Bunny.\" Salon.com critic Andrew O'Hehir called the Cannes cut \"about the biggest, ugliest mess I've ever seen.\" Jason Solomons, in The Observer (UK), said that \"Southland Tales was so bad it made me wonder if [Kelly] had ever met a human being\" and that ten minutes of the \"sprawling, plotless, post-apocalyptic farrago\" gave him the \"sinking feeling that this may be one of the worst films ever presented in [Cannes] competition.\" A handful of the American and European critics, however, were more positive. The Village Voice critic J. Hoberman, for example, called Southland Tales \"a visionary film about the end of times\" comparable in recent American film only to David Lynch's  Mulholland Drive.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nAs of June 2020, the film holds a 39% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 102 reviews with an average rating of 4.63 out of 10. The site's consensus states: \"Southland Tales, while offering an intriguing vision of the future, remains frustratingly incoherent and unpolished.\" On Metacritic, the film had a score of 44 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".Glenn Kenny, in his review for Premiere criticized the film's style, \"Kelly's camera placement and framing are at best textbook and at worst calamitously mediocre.\" In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano wrote, \"You get the sense that Kelly is too angry to really find any of it funny. It's easy to empathize with his position, not so easy to remain engrossed in a film that's occasionally inspired but ultimately manic and scattered.\" David Edelstein's review in New York magazine criticized the film's writing, \"Kelly aims high and must have shot off his own ear, which is the only way to account for the dialogue.\"On the program Ebert & Roeper, Richard Roeper and guest critic Michael Phillips gave the film a negative review. While Roeper called the film \"Two hours and twenty-four minutes of abstract crap,\" Phillips felt that \"the film has a head on its shoulders despite the fact that it can't find any direction\" but nevertheless gave the film a thumbs down.J. Hoberman defended the film, yet again, in his review for the theatrical cut. \"In its willful, self-involved eccentricity, Southland Tales is really something else. Kelly's movie may not be entirely coherent, but that's because there's so much it wants to say.\" Manohla Dargis also gave the film a positive review in The New York Times, writing, \"He doesn't make it easy to love his new film, which turns and twists and at times threatens to disappear down the rabbit hole of his obsessions. Happily, it never does, which allows you to share in his unabashed joy in filmmaking as well as in his fury about the times.\"The film remains enigmatic to many viewers and even some of its makers. In a 2011 interview, Justin Timberlake himself said, \"To me, Southland Tales is performance art. I still don't know what that movie is about [laughs].\"In a 2013 interview, Kelly said he considered this work as \"the thing that I'm most proud of, and I feel like it's sort of the misunderstood child or the banished child.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American films of 2007\n99 Francs\nA Scanner Darkly and its film adaptation\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSouthland Tales on IMDb \nShaviro, Steven (2010). \"Chapter 4.

        "wiki": "Cannes (; French: [kan]; Occitan: Canas) is a city located on the French Riviera. It is a commune located in the Alpes-Maritimes department, and host city of the annual Cannes Film Festival, Midem, and Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. The city is known for its association with the rich and famous, its luxury hotels and restaurants, and for several conferences. On 3 November 2011 it hosted the 2011 G20 summit.\n\n\n== History ==\nBy the 2nd century BC, the Ligurian Oxybii established a settlement here known as Aegitna (Ancient Greek: \u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bd\u03b1). Historians are unsure what the name means. The area was a fishing village used as a port of call between the L\u00e9rins Islands.\n\nIn 154 BC, it became the scene of violent but quick conflict between the troops of Quintus Opimius and the Oxybii.In the 10th century, the town was known as Canua. The name may derive from \"canna\", a reed. Canua was probably the site of a small Ligurian port, and later a Roman outpost on Le Suquet hill, suggested by Roman tombs discovered here. Le Suquet housed an 11th-century tower, which overlooked swamps where the city now stands. Most of the ancient activity, especially protection, was on the L\u00e9rins Islands, and the history of Cannes is closely tied to the history of the islands.\nAn attack by the Saracens in 891, who remained until the end of the 10th century, devastated the country around Canua. The insecurity of the L\u00e9rins islands forced the monks to settle on the mainland, at the Suquet. Construction of a castle in 1035 fortified the city by then known as Cannes, and at the end of the 11th century construction was started on two towers on the L\u00e9rins islands. One took a century to build.\nAround 1530, Cannes detached from the monks who had controlled the city for hundreds of years and became independent.\nDuring the 18th century, both the Spanish and British tried to gain control of the L\u00e9rins Islands but were chased away by the French. The islands were later controlled by many, such as Jean-Honor\u00e9 Alziary and the Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus. They had many different purposes: at the end of the 19th century, one served as hospital for soldiers wounded in the Crimean War.\nHenry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux bought land at the Croix des Gardes and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise. His work to improve living conditions attracted the English aristocracy, who also built winter residences.\nAt the end of the 19th century, several railways were completed, which prompted the arrival of streetcars. In Cannes, projects such as the Boulevard Carnot and the rue d'Antibes were carried out. After the closure of the Casino des Fleurs (h\u00f4tel Gallia), a luxury establishment was built for the rich winter clientele, the Casino Municipal next to the pier Albert-Edouard. This casino was demolished and replaced by the new Palace in 1979.\nIn the 20th century, new luxury hotels such as the Carlton, Majestic, Martinez, and JW Marriott Cannes were built. The city was modernised with a sports centre, a post office, and schools. There were fewer British and German tourists after the First World War, but more Americans. Winter tourism gave way to summer tourism, and the summer casino at the Palm Beach was constructed.\nThe city council had the idea of starting an international film festival shortly before World War II. The first opened on 20 September 1946, held in the Casino Municipal.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nCannes has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa) and the city enjoys 11 hours of sunshine per day during summer (July), while in winter (December to February) the weather is mild. Both seasons see a relatively low rainfall and most rain occurs during October and November, when 110 mm (4.3 in) falls.\nCannes summers are long and warm, with summer daytime temperatures regularly hitting 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), while average temperatures are about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Temperatures remain high from June to September, the busiest time of the year.\nMean temperatures drop below 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) for only three months of the year (December to February). The spring and autumn are also warm, although more suited to those who prefer slightly cooler weather.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nThe Promenade de la Croisette is the waterfront avenue with palm trees. La Croisette is known for picturesque beaches, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, boutiques and luxury hotels. Le Suquet, the old town, provides a good view of La Croisette. The fortified tower and Chapel of St Anne house the Mus\u00e9e de la Castre. A distinctive building in Cannes is the Russian Orthodox church.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\n\n=== Villas ===\nCannes of the 19th century can still be seen in its grand villas, built to reflect the wealth and standing of their owners and inspired by anything from medieval castles to Roman villas. They are not open to the public. Lord Brougham's Italianate Villa El\u00e9onore Louise (one of the first in Cannes) was built between 1835 and 1839. Also known as the Quartier des Anglais, this is the oldest residential area in Cannes. Another landmark is the Villa Fi\u00e9sole (known today as the Villa Domergue) designed by Jean-Gabriel Domergue in the style of Fiesole, near Florence, which may be visited on appointment.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite ===\n\nIt took the Man in the Iron Mask 11 years to leave the tiny, forested St Marguerite Island. The mysterious individual was believed to be of noble blood, but his identity has never been proven. His cell can be visited in the Fort of St Marguerite, now renamed the Mus\u00e9e de la Mer (Museum of the Sea). This museum also houses discoveries from shipwrecks off the island, including Roman (1st century BC) and Saracen (10th century AD) ceramics.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Saint-Honorat ===\n\nCistercian monks are the only inhabitants of the smaller, southern St Honorat Island. Monks have inhabited the island since AD 410 and, at the height of their powers, owned Cannes, Mougins, and Vallauris. Medieval vestiges remain in the stark church, which is open to the public, and in the ruins of the 11th-century monastery on the sea shore. The monks inhabit the L\u00e9rins Abbey and divide their time between prayer and producing red and white wines.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire de Provence houses artifacts from prehistoric to present, in an 18th-century mansion.

          "Easy, efficient and reliable to book with the hotel, a bit more pricey than some but the loungers are fabulous and they give you two super long towels so you can use one of them as a pillow. The lavatories include two decent shower rooms and they are spotlessly clean - this is",
          "After all the hype I was looking forward to seeing the new beach club and bar. What a disappointment now so bland and boring!",
          "I stayed at the hotel during Cannes Lion for 8 days, I was forced to change rooms toward the end. The beach is nice but for the money you can find better. The service is ok, twice during stay the beach was full yet the bed were empty. The management of the space does not",
          "Nice beach with beach restaurant. Often full so reservation is better. Renovation starts within 2 days.",
          "One of the most beautiful beaches I've seen, if you stop here have to try it, chill on the sand and get some drinks.",
          "An excellent beach by \"the croisette\" in Cannes. Probably one of the best in this tiny piece of land. Excellent place to spend a day by the sun and the beach. You'll surely have to pay the price for it and it won't be cheap but it's worth every penny of it. I liked the service",
          "My partner and I went to this beach club renting sun loungers for the day. We didn't have a booking and Martinez acted like they were moving mountains to get us in despite 80% of loungers being free and a good 20% remained free the entire day. The loungers towels and toilets",
          "During the last couple of days of the Cannes film festival on a very hot sunny Saturday, we wanted to relax after a very busy week and so tried to swim at the beach where there were fewer people...we were very disappointed that once we settled in an d were about to plunge into",

          "Due to the rest of the free beach in Cannes was full we decided to go to a private one and the one with Hotel Martinez was an excellent choice and the service was high quality, we received even little flowers when we arrived and the cabana boys were constantly giving us",

          "We stayed in Martinez for 3 night. At our 3rd day we had booking to the beach. When we came - we found that we have no any bookings, we were only in waiting list. Then, after 30 minutes speaking they found for us 6 places. Beach was very poor and dirty.",

        "wiki": "Cannes (; French: [kan]; Occitan: Canas) is a city located on the French Riviera. It is a commune located in the Alpes-Maritimes department, and host city of the annual Cannes Film Festival, Midem, and Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. The city is known for its association with the rich and famous, its luxury hotels and restaurants, and for several conferences. On 3 November 2011 it hosted the 2011 G20 summit.\n\n\n== History ==\nBy the 2nd century BC, the Ligurian Oxybii established a settlement here known as Aegitna (Ancient Greek: \u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bd\u03b1). Historians are unsure what the name means. The area was a fishing village used as a port of call between the L\u00e9rins Islands.\n\nIn 154 BC, it became the scene of violent but quick conflict between the troops of Quintus Opimius and the Oxybii.In the 10th century, the town was known as Canua. The name may derive from \"canna\", a reed. Canua was probably the site of a small Ligurian port, and later a Roman outpost on Le Suquet hill, suggested by Roman tombs discovered here. Le Suquet housed an 11th-century tower, which overlooked swamps where the city now stands. Most of the ancient activity, especially protection, was on the L\u00e9rins Islands, and the history of Cannes is closely tied to the history of the islands.\nAn attack by the Saracens in 891, who remained until the end of the 10th century, devastated the country around Canua. The insecurity of the L\u00e9rins islands forced the monks to settle on the mainland, at the Suquet. Construction of a castle in 1035 fortified the city by then known as Cannes, and at the end of the 11th century construction was started on two towers on the L\u00e9rins islands. One took a century to build.\nAround 1530, Cannes detached from the monks who had controlled the city for hundreds of years and became independent.\nDuring the 18th century, both the Spanish and British tried to gain control of the L\u00e9rins Islands but were chased away by the French. The islands were later controlled by many, such as Jean-Honor\u00e9 Alziary and the Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus. They had many different purposes: at the end of the 19th century, one served as hospital for soldiers wounded in the Crimean War.\nHenry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux bought land at the Croix des Gardes and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise. His work to improve living conditions attracted the English aristocracy, who also built winter residences.\nAt the end of the 19th century, several railways were completed, which prompted the arrival of streetcars. In Cannes, projects such as the Boulevard Carnot and the rue d'Antibes were carried out. After the closure of the Casino des Fleurs (h\u00f4tel Gallia), a luxury establishment was built for the rich winter clientele, the Casino Municipal next to the pier Albert-Edouard. This casino was demolished and replaced by the new Palace in 1979.\nIn the 20th century, new luxury hotels such as the Carlton, Majestic, Martinez, and JW Marriott Cannes were built. The city was modernised with a sports centre, a post office, and schools. There were fewer British and German tourists after the First World War, but more Americans. Winter tourism gave way to summer tourism, and the summer casino at the Palm Beach was constructed.\nThe city council had the idea of starting an international film festival shortly before World War II. The first opened on 20 September 1946, held in the Casino Municipal.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nCannes has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa) and the city enjoys 11 hours of sunshine per day during summer (July), while in winter (December to February) the weather is mild. Both seasons see a relatively low rainfall and most rain occurs during October and November, when 110 mm (4.3 in) falls.\nCannes summers are long and warm, with summer daytime temperatures regularly hitting 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), while average temperatures are about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Temperatures remain high from June to September, the busiest time of the year.\nMean temperatures drop below 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) for only three months of the year (December to February). The spring and autumn are also warm, although more suited to those who prefer slightly cooler weather.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nThe Promenade de la Croisette is the waterfront avenue with palm trees. La Croisette is known for picturesque beaches, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, boutiques and luxury hotels. Le Suquet, the old town, provides a good view of La Croisette. The fortified tower and Chapel of St Anne house the Mus\u00e9e de la Castre. A distinctive building in Cannes is the Russian Orthodox church.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\n\n=== Villas ===\nCannes of the 19th century can still be seen in its grand villas, built to reflect the wealth and standing of their owners and inspired by anything from medieval castles to Roman villas. They are not open to the public. Lord Brougham's Italianate Villa El\u00e9onore Louise (one of the first in Cannes) was built between 1835 and 1839. Also known as the Quartier des Anglais, this is the oldest residential area in Cannes. Another landmark is the Villa Fi\u00e9sole (known today as the Villa Domergue) designed by Jean-Gabriel Domergue in the style of Fiesole, near Florence, which may be visited on appointment.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite ===\n\nIt took the Man in the Iron Mask 11 years to leave the tiny, forested St Marguerite Island. The mysterious individual was believed to be of noble blood, but his identity has never been proven. His cell can be visited in the Fort of St Marguerite, now renamed the Mus\u00e9e de la Mer (Museum of the Sea). This museum also houses discoveries from shipwrecks off the island, including Roman (1st century BC) and Saracen (10th century AD) ceramics.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Saint-Honorat ===\n\nCistercian monks are the only inhabitants of the smaller, southern St Honorat Island. Monks have inhabited the island since AD 410 and, at the height of their powers, owned Cannes, Mougins, and Vallauris. Medieval vestiges remain in the stark church, which is open to the public, and in the ruins of the 11th-century monastery on the sea shore. The monks inhabit the L\u00e9rins Abbey and divide their time between prayer and producing red and white wines.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire de Provence houses artifacts from prehistoric to present, in an 18th-century mansion. The Mus\u00e9e de la Castre has objects from the Pacific Atolls, Peruvian relics and Mayan pottery. Other venues include the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, Mus\u00e9e de la Mer, Mus\u00e9e de la Photographie and Mus\u00e9e International de la Parfumerie.\n\n\n=== Theatre and music ===\nCannes is not renowned for traditional theatre. However, small venues stage productions and host short sketches during the annual International Actors' Performance Festival. Popular theaters include the Espace Miramar and the Alexandre III.\n\n\n=== Festivals and show events ===\nThe Cannes Film Festival founded in 1946 is held annually, usually in May, at the Palais des Festivals et des Congr\u00e8s.\nThe Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity is a global event and awards show for those working in advertising and related fields, held annually in June.\nMidem, the foremost trade show for the music industry.\nMIPIM, the world's largest property-related trade show.\nCarnival on the Riviera is an annual parade through the streets to mark the 21-day period prior to Shrove Tuesday.\nThe International Festival of Games is festival of bridge, belote, backgammon, chess, draughts, tarot and more (February).\nCannes Yachting Festival is an event for boating enthusiasts in the Vieux Port (September).\nThe International Actors' Performance Festival: comedy sketches and performances by fringe artists\nThe International Luxury Travel Market brings together under one roof the top international luxury travel providers and suppliers from all around the world.[1]\nLe Festival d'Art Pyrotechnique is a magnificent annual fireworks competition held in the summer at the Bay of Cannes.\nThe Global Champions Tour showjumping league has an annual event in the ports of Cannes.\nMipcom and MIPTV, held in October and April respectively, the world's most important trade markets for the television industry.\nThe Pan-African Film Festival, held in early April and featuring films from the African diaspora.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe area around Cannes has developed into a high-tech cluster. The technopolis of Sophia Antipolis lies in the hills beyond Cannes. The Film Festival is a major event for the industry which takes place every year during the month of May. In addition, Cannes hosts other major annual events such as the MIPIM, MIPTV, MIDEM, Cannes Lions, and the NRJ Music Awards.  There is an annual television festival in the last week in September.\nThe economic environment is based on tourism, business fairs, trade and aviation. Cannes has 6,500 companies, of which 3,000 are traders, artisans and service providers. In 2006, 421 new companies were registered.\nCannes hosts the Cannes Mandelieu Space Center, headquarters of Thales Alenia Space, the first European satellite manufacturer.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nCannes is home to football side AS Cannes.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nNice C\u00f4te d'Azur AirportLocated 24 km (15 mi) from Cannes, Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport has close to 10 million passengers a year.

It was designed by architects Charles Dalmas and Marcellin May\u00e8re.Part of the InterContinental chain, the Carlton is famous for hosting movie stars from around the world during the annual Film Festival. Famously, the hotel was a central location for the Alfred Hitchcock film To Catch a Thief starring Grace Kelly and Cary Grant. In 1970 it featured in the Peter Sellers/Goldie Hawn comedy There's a Girl in My Soup and exterior scenes were filmed at the entrance to the hotel and on the hotel beach. The hotel lobby scene and interior scenes were done on a film set.\nWhile staying at the Hotel Carlton during the 1955 Cannes Film Festival, Academy Award winning movie star Grace Kelly had an arranged meeting and photo shoot with Prince Rainier III of Monaco; they married in 1956.\nIn the summer of 1983 the hotel and its private beach featured prominently in the music video for the Elton John song I'm Still Standing. (The video also appears in the 2019 film Rocketman.) During the shooting of the video the Carlton was the scene of a drunken party involving John and the band Duran Duran that has since become something of a legend at the hotel. Significant damages to the rooms in John's suite resulted. Both exterior and interior shots appear in New Order's 1993 music video for the single, \"World (The Price of Love)\", and exterior shots of the front of the hotel and the jetty leading out of the beach appear in Steps\u00b4 1999 music video for their single \"Love's Got a Hold on My Heart\".\nThe Carlton's distinctive domes on both seaward corners were reputedly designed to resemble the breasts of Caroline Otero (\"La Belle Otero\") the most famous courtesan of the French Riviera during the years surrounding World War I.The Carlton's elegant seventh floor formal dining room was named La Belle Otero in her honour (this restaurant was closed and the entire seventh floor is a VIP floor comprising the hotel's finest suites).  There are a couple of restaurants: the Carlton Restaurant on the ground floor with a large outdoor terrace; and the Carlton Beach Restaurant. There is one bar: the Carlton Bar which serves as a hotel lounge (La Petite Bar, off the entrance lobby was closed in 2015).\nIn April 2011, the prestigious hotel was sold by the investment bank Morgan Stanley to the Lebanese businessman Toufic Aboukhater, who owns several other InterContinental hotels.\n\n\n== Crime ==\nThe Carlton Cannes has been the target of several high-profile jewelry robberies.\nOn 11 August 1994 three men brandishing automatic weapons entered the jewelry store in the hotel and proceeded to open fire.  The thieves made off with over $60 million in jewelry, and precious stones.  After the investigation it was determined that the thieves were firing blanks as no bullet holes were evident. The thieves have not been apprehended.On 28 July 2013 a thief stole $137 million in jewels from the hotel in a daylight robbery (see Carlton Intercontinental Hotel heist).  The jewelry was part of a temporary exhibition by mineralogist and Israeli billionaire Lev Leviev called Leviev Diamond House. No suspects have been charged with the heist.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site InterContinental Carlton Cannes\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Amazing hotel and was very lucky to be staying here for work. The room was brilliant and extremely spacious with a partial see view as well to make it even better!  The only reason for not getting 5 stars is that I thought the cooked buffet breakfast element wasn\u2019t that amazing and if you were paying for it I would be disappointed.",
          "Visited with a friend for Brunch a day after a huge storm hit Nice in November 2019. Delicious food, so many options and plenty of mimosas. The kindest of service. However we noticed how much food was left at thrown away at the end... really sad to see that. I hope they give it away when possible.",
          "I love the atmosphere here during the #CannesFilmFestival \n\nThis place is definitely a must to visit when you need a fabulous meal and drink! I love that it located right near the beach and easy access to all shopping stores and the strip. \n\nThis place is definitely wheelchair friendly and very lively at night!"

It is a traditional hotel for film stars attending the Cannes Festival.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe present hotel is the result of the merger of the parcels of the former h\u00f4tel Beau-Rivage and of two neighbouring villas. Construction began in 1923 under the leadership of architect Th\u00e9o Petit, also architect of the h\u00f4tel Normandy at Deauville. He produced an art deco design with a main fa\u00e7ade and 2 rear wings, but only the east wing and the main body were finished when the hotel opened in 1926. The rest of the central body of the building was extended in 1928 by the architects Charles Nicod and \u00c9mile Molini\u00e9, at which date the interiors were also redecorated by Maurice Debenedetti. 2 floors were added to the top of the building in 1965 and in 1990 the fa\u00e7ades were rebuilt uniformly in their original art deco style.\n\n\n== Location ==\nHotel Barri\u00e8re Le Majestic Cannes is located in the centre of the town of Cannes on the Croisette at 25 km from the a\u00e9roport de Nice via the road along the seaside, 1 km (5 mn) from the gare de Cannes, and faces the palais des Festivals on the Croisette.

        "wiki": "Pierre Bonnard (French: [b\u0254na\u0281]; 3 October 1867 \u2013 23 January 1947) was a French painter, illustrator, and printmaker, known especially for the stylized decorative qualities of his paintings and his bold use of color.  He was a founding member of the Post-Impressionist group of avant-garde painters Les Nabis, and his early work was strongly influenced by the work of Paul Gauguin, and the prints of Hokusai and other Japanese artists. He was a leading figure in the transition from impressionism to modernism. He painted landscapes, urban scenes, portraits and intimate domestic scenes, where the backgrounds, colors and painting style usually took precedence over the subject.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nPierre Bonnard was born in Fontenay-aux-Roses, Hauts-de-Seine on 3 October 1867. His mother, \u00c9lisabeth Mertzdorff, was from Alsace. His father, Eug\u00e8ne Bonnard, was from the Dauphin\u00e9, and was a senior official in the French Ministry of War.  He had a brother, Charles, and a sister, Andr\u00e9e, who in 1890 married the composer Claude Terrasse.He received his education in the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand and Lyc\u00e9e Charlemagne in Vanves.  He showed a talent for drawing and water colors, as well as caricatures.  He painted frequently in the gardens of his parent's country home at Grand-Lemps near the Cote Saint-Andr\u00e9 in the Dauphin\u00e9. He also showed a strong interest in literature.  He received his baccalaureate in the classics, and, to satisfy his father, between 1886-87 earned his license in law, and began practicing as a lawyer beginning in 1888.While he was studying law, he also attended art classes at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris. At the Acad\u00e9mie Julien he met his future friends and fellow artists, Paul S\u00e9rusier, Maurice Denis, Gabriel Ibels and Paul Ranson.In 1888 Bonnard was accepted by the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, where he met Edouard Vuillard and Ker Xavier Roussel. He also sold his first commercial work of art, a design for poster for France-Champagne, which helped him convince his family that he could make a living as an artist. He set up his first studio at on rue Lechapelais and began his career as an artist.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nFrom 1893 until her death, Bonnard lived with Marthe de M\u00e9ligny (1869\u20131942), and she was the model for many of his paintings, including many nudes.  Her birth name was Maria Boursin, but she had changed it before she met Bonnard.  They married in 1925.  In the years before their marriage, Bonnard had love affairs with two other women, who also served as models for some of his paintings, Ren\u00e9e Monchaty (the partner of the American painter Harry Lachmann) and Lucienne Dupuy de Frenelle, the wife of a doctor; it has been suggested that Bonnard may have been the father of Lucienne's second son.  Ren\u00e9e Monchaty committed suicide shortly after Bonnard and de M\u00e9ligny married.\n\n\n== Early career - the Nabis ==\nBonnard received pressure from a different direction to continue painting. While he had received his license to practice law in 1888, he failed in the examination for entering the official registry of lawyers. Art was his only option. After the summer holidays, he joined with his friends from the Academy Julien to form Les Nabis, an informal group of artists with different styles and philosophies but common artistic ambitions.  At the time, Bonnard, as he later wrote, was entirely unaware of the impressionist painters, or of Gauguin and other new painters. His friend Paul S\u00e9rusier showed him a painting on a wooden cigar box he made after visiting Paul Gauguin at Pont-Aven, using, like Gauguin,  patches of pure color. In 1890 Denis, at age twenty,  formalized the doctrine:  \"a painting was simply \"a surface plane covered with colors assembled in a certain order.\"Some of the Nabis had highly religious, philosophical or mystical approaches to their paintings,  but Bonnard remained more cheerful and un-ideological. The painter-writer Aurelien Lugn\u00e9-Poe, who shared a studio at 28 rue Pigalle with Bonnard and Vuillard, wrote later, \"Pierre Bonnard was the humorist among us; his nonchalant gaiety, and humor expressed in his productions, of which the decorative spirit always preserved a sort of satire, from which he later departed.\"In 1891 he met Toulouse-Lautrec and in December 1891 showed his work at the annual exhibition of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Ind\u00e9pendants. In the same year Bonnard also began an association with La Revue Blanche, for which he and \u00c9douard Vuillard designed frontispiece In March 1891,  his work was displayed with the work of the other Nabis at the Le Barc de Boutteville.The style of Japanese graphic arts became an important influence on Bonnard. In 1893 A major exposition of works of Utamaro and Hiroshige was held at the Durand-Rouel Gallery, and the Japanese influence, particularly the use of multiple points of view, and the use of bold geometric patterns in clothing, such as checkered blouses,  began to appear in his work. Because of his passion for Japanese art, his nickname among the Nabis became  Le Nabi le tr\u00e9s japonard.He devoted an increasing amount of attention to decorative art, designing furniture, fabrics, fans and other objects.  He continued to design posters for France-Champagne, which gained him an audience outside the art world.  In 1892 he began to produce lithographs, and painted two of his early notable works, Le Corsage a carreaux and La Partie de croquet.  He also made a series of illustrations for the music books of his brother-in-law, Claude Terrasse.\nIn 1894 he turned in a new direction and made a series of paintings of scenes of the life of Paris. In his urban scenes, the buildings and even animals were the focus of attention; faces were rarely visible.  He also made his first portrait of his future wife, Marthe, whom he married in 1925.  In 1895 he became an early participant of the movement of Art Nouveau, designing a stained glass window, called Maternity, for Tiffany.In 1895 he had his first individual exposition of paintings, posters and lithographs at the Durand-Ruel Gallery. He also illustrated a novel, Marie, by Peter Nansen, published in series by in La Revue Blanche.  The following year he participated in a group exposition of Nabis at the Amboise Vollard Gallery.  In 1899, he took part in another major exposition of works of the Nabis.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Later years (1900-1938) ==\n\nThroughout the early 20th century, as artistic styles appeared and disappeared with almost dizzying speed, Bonnard kept refining and revising his personal style, and exploring new subjects and media, but keeping the distinct characteristics of his work.  Working in his studio at 65 rue de Douai in Paris, he presented paintings at the Salon des Independents in 1900, and also made 109 lithographs for Parall\u00e8ment, a book of poems by Verlaine. He also took part in an exhibition with the other Nabis at the Bernheim Jeaune gallery.  He presented nine paintings at the Salon des Independents in 1901.  In 1905 he produced a series of nudes and of portraits, and in 1906 had a personal exposition at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery. In 1908 he illustrated a book of poetry by Octave Mirbeau, and made his first long stay in the South of France, at the home of the painter Manguin in Saint-Tropez.  in 1909, and in 1911 began a series of decorative panels, called M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, for the Russian art patron Ivan Morozov.During the years of the First World War, Bonnard concentrated on nudes and portraits, and in 1916 completed a series of large compositions, including La Pastorale, M\u00e9ditterran\u00e9e, La Paradis Terreste  and Paysage de Ville. His reputation in the French art establishment was secure; in 1918 he was selected, along with Renoir, as an honorary President of the Association of Young French Artists.In the 1920s, he produced illustrations for a book by Andre Gide (1924) and another by Claude Anet (1923).  He showed works at the Autumn Salon in 1923, and in 1924 was honored with a retrospective of sixty-eight of his works at the Galerie Druet. In 1925 he purchased a villa in Cannes.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Final years and death (1939\u20131947) ==\nIn 1938 his works and Vuillard were featured at an exposition at the Art Institute of Chicago.  The outbreak of World War II in September 1939, forced Bonnard to depart Paris for the south of France, where he remained until the end of the war.  Under the German occupation, he refused to paint an official portrait of the French collaborationist leader, Marechal Petain, but accepted a commission to paint a religious painting of Saint Francis de Sales, with the face of his friend Vuillard, who had died two years earlier.He finished his last painting, The Almond Tree in Blossom, a week before his death in his cottage on La Route de Serra Capeou near Le Cannet, on the French Riviera, in 1947. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City organized a posthumous retrospective of Bonnard's work in 1948, although originally it was meant to be a celebration of the artist's 80th birthday.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Japanism ==\n\nJapanese art played an important part in Bonnard's work.  He was able to see the works originally thanks to the Paris gallery of Siegfried Bing.  Bing brought back from Japan works by Hokusai and other Japanese print makers, and published a monthly art journal, Le Japon Artistique, between May 1888 and April 1891. which offered color illustrations of 1891.  In 1890 Bing organized an important exhibition of seven hundred prints he had brought from Japan, and made a donation of Japanese art to the Louvre.Bonnard particularly used the model of Japanese art in a series of paintings of four women in gardens, painted in 1890-91, and now in the Muse\u00e9 d'Orsay.  He used the format called kakemono,  with a narrow vertical canvas.  The female forms are reduced to silhouettes and flattened, and there is no depth to the picture.  The faces of the women are hardly shown; the patterns of the costumes and the foliage behind them dominate the paintings.The decoration of the costumes and the background practically obscure the faces.  He often pictured women in checkered blouses, a design he said he had discovered in Chinese prints.Among his most famous works the Japanese kakemono format are the four paintings of Women in the garden (1890-91).  Originally conceived as a single screen, he decided to divide it into four separate decorative panels.  Following the Japanese style, the paintings are entirely lacking depth; and the faces are turned away from the viewer.  The pictures are entirely dominated by the colors and bold patterns of the costumes and the backgrounds.  The models are his sister Andre\u00e9 and his cousin Berthe Schaedin.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Graphic arts ==\nBonnard wrote, \"Notre g\u00e9n\u00e9ration a toujours cherch\u00e9 les rapports de l'art avec la vie\" (Our generation always was searching for connections between art and life).  Bonnard and the other Nabis were particularly interested in integrating their art into popular forms, such as posters, journal covers and illustrations, and engravings in books, as well as into ordinary household decoration,  in the form of murals, painted screens, textiles, tapestries, furniture, glass and dishes.At the beginning of his career, Bonnard designed very popular posters for a French champagne firm, which won him wide public attention. He later produced many sets of engravings illustrating the works of the avant-garde authors of his time.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Method ==\n\nBonnard is known for his intense use of color, especially via areas built with small brush marks and close values.  His often complex compositions\u2014typically of sunlit interiors and gardens populated with friends and family members\u2014are both narrative and autobiographical.  Bonnard's fondness for depicting intimate scenes of everyday life, has led to him being called an \"Intimist\"; his wife Marthe was an ever-present subject over the course of several decades. She is seen seated at the kitchen table, with the remnants of a meal; or nude, as in a series of paintings where she reclines in the bathtub. He also painted several self-portraits, landscapes, street scenes, and many still lifes, which usually depicted flowers and fruit.\nBonnard did not paint from life but rather drew his subject\u2014sometimes photographing it as well\u2014and made notes on the colors. He then painted the canvas in his studio from his notes. \"I have all my subjects to hand,\" he said, \"I go back and look at them. I take notes. Then I go home. And before I start painting I reflect, I dream.\"He worked on numerous canvases simultaneously, which he tacked onto the walls of his small studio. In this way he could more freely determine the shape of a painting; \"It would bother me if my canvases were stretched onto a frame. I never know in advance what dimensions I am going to choose.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception and legacy ==\n\nClaude Roger-Marx remarked in 1893 that he \"catches fleeting poses, steals unconscious gestures, crystallises the most transient expressions\".Although Bonnard avoided public attention, his work sold well during his life. At the time of his death his reputation had already been eclipsed by subsequent avant-garde developments in the art world; reviewing a retrospective of Bonnard's work in Paris in 1947, Christian Zervos assessed the artist in terms of his relationship to Impressionism, and found him wanting. \"In Bonnard's work,\" he wrote, \"Impressionism becomes insipid and falls into decline.\" In response Henri Matisse wrote \"I maintain that Bonnard is a great artist for our time and, naturally, for posterity.\"Bonnard was described, by his own friend and historians, as a man of \"quiet temperament\" and one who was unobtrusively independent. His life was relatively free from \"the tensions and reversals of untoward circumstance.\" It has been suggested that: \"Like Daumier, whose life knew little serenity, Bonnard produced a work during his sixty years' activity that follows an even line of development.\"Bonnard has been described as \"the most thoroughly idiosyncratic of all the great twentieth-century painters\", and the unusual vantage points of his compositions rely less on traditional modes of pictorial structure than voluptuous color, poetic allusions and visual wit. Identified as a late practitioner of Impressionism in the early 20th century, he has since been recognized for his unique use of color and his complex imagery. \"It's not just the colors that radiate in a Bonnard,\" writes Roberta Smith, \"there's also the heat of mixed emotions, rubbed into smoothness, shrouded in chromatic veils and intensified by unexpected spatial conundrums and by elusive, uneasy figures.\"Two major exhibitions of Bonnard's work took place in 1998: February through May at the Tate Gallery in London, and from June through October at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.  In 2009 the exhibition \"Pierre Bonnard: The Late Interiors\" was shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Reviewing the exhibition for the magazine The New Republic, Jed Perl wrote:\n\n\"Bonnard is the most thoroughly idiosyncratic of all the great twentieth-century painters. What sustains him is not traditional ideas of pictorial structure and order, but rather some unique combination of visual taste, psychological insight, and poetic feeling. He also has a quality that might be characterized as perceptual wit\u2014an instinct for what will work in a painting. Almost invariably he recognizes the precise point where his voluptuousness may be getting out of hand, where he needs to introduce an ironic note. Bonnard's wit has everything to do with the eccentric nature of his compositions. He finds it funny to sneak a figure into a corner, or have a cat staring out at the viewer. His metaphoric caprices have a comic edge, as when he turns a figure into a pattern in the wallpaper. And when he imagines a basket of fruit as a heap of emeralds and rubies and diamonds, he does so with the panache of a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat.\"\n\nIn 2016 the Legion of Honor in San Francisco hosted an exhibit \"Pierre Bonnard: Painting Arcadia\", featuring more than 70 works that span the artist's entire career.Bonnard's record price in a public sale was for Terrasse \u00e0 Vernon, sold by Christie's in 2011 for \u20ac8,485,287 (\u00a37,014,200).In 2014 the painting La femme aux Deux Fauteuils (Woman with Two Armchairs), with an estimated value of around \u20ac600,000 (\u00a3497,000), which had been stolen in London in 1970, was discovered in Italy. The painting, together with a work by Paul Gauguin known as Fruit on a Table with a Small Dog had been bought by a Fiat employee in 1975, at a railway lost-property sale, for 45,000 lira (about \u00a332).Member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium on 2 July 1936.Bonnard features heavily in the 2005 Booker prize winning novel, The Sea by John Banville. In the novel, the protagonist and art historian Max Morden is writing a book about Bonnard and discusses the painter's life and work throughout.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Open Window by Bonnard\n\n\n== References and sources ==\nReferences\nSourcesAmory, Dita, ed.

          "Really enjoyed this well thought out modern museum housed in an old house. Lots of excellent pictures but as other reviewers have said,a disappointingly small number of Bonnards. However, reviews meant that we were expecting that. Film about his life was a fascinating glimpse",
          "But...be prepared the films are completely in French. Yes, I know, we are in France. I just suggest more people will visit if they would offer subtitles in English. I am staying in Le Cannet so it was convenient. Otherwise, without a car I would not work so hard to get there.",
          "An amazing Art Gallery with several floors showing some wonderful Art. It\u2019s definitely worth going there, especially if your are in Cannes which is only 1km away.",
          "A super-smart modernist building housing a very tasty selection of classic paintings, well laid-out and organised. Well worth the visit apart from a disappointing dearth of actual Bonnards. In a gallery bearing his name, I would expect wall-to-wall Bonnard, and this is not. It's",
          "last year i visted with friends, very interesting and the staff very kind, from cannes railway station take the bus number 1, the bus stop is just by the musem, i staded about two hours and realy enjoyed the knowledge;",
          "We were fortunate to visit the museum during the exposition of the Nahmad Collection; such a beautiful Impressionist Collection. The museum is very welcoming in its size, its collection(s), its furnishing, its staff and any other way. Absolutely worth a visit!!",
          "This is a nice gallery in Le Cannet, a welcome relief from the film festival fever in Cannes. Lovely notebooks from Bonnard.",
          "Bonnard lived in Cannes several times throughout his long life hence the museum. The museum is 4 or 5 small floors of his works. Much of it seems to be his sketches and notebooks as I suspect a lot of the bigger more popular pieces have made it to galleries with deeper pockets",
          "Pleasant and nice small museum in the house of the Nabi painter. The collection is not only of master pieces but sufficient to be worth the visit!!! The only drawback the video in French only , too long and pompous!!! What a pity...",
          "I visited the museum in July 2018 and it was not remotely busy, which was surprising, as it had a very good and rewarding exhibition on, including the large painting of Marthe bathing. Plus a number of other works which I really enjoyed seeing. I wonder which Bonnard paintings",

          "The museum is spectacular and the facilities are up to date. The staff is very friendly and I got a faculty discount despite not being from France. My only problem is that the collection is so small and the walls are too dark to display such bright works and drawings. The",
          "First of all, I am a huge fan of Bonnard and was really looking forward to see this museum, especially because of the expo saying his masterpieces... But ... As someone who knows his work very well, I can say that there were not really many of his masterpieces! Maybe 3 or 4",
          "In an interesting buildings mixing new and old architecture, close to the picturesque Cannet, you find this excellent presentation om Bonnard, his different styles, his life, and his philosophy as a painter. It is sparse which ads to the quality. The shop has ample litterature",
          "Nice museum. Clean, stylish and nice location. But I was looking forward to the overflowing colour fest, patterns, distorted perspectives and intensity of Bonnard. And it felt like we only got a teaser, with a handful of these, while a lot of the paintings where by Vuillard",
          "I've received this gem of a museum/gallery before and cannot recommend it enough! The current show highlights work by Bonnard alongside Vuillard - someone with links to my home town of Manchester where he lived and taught for a while. The current show come to Le Cannet via",

          "Just the right size! Neither too big or too small in terms of amount of work on display. I've been here several times and am never disappointed. Their policy is to constantly change the artwork on display but always link back to Bonnard - this years show is a case in point,",

          "We arrived in Cannet to look at paintings by Bonnard as we like his works very much. The museum was big and nice with five storeys. However, Bonnard was only represented in one storey and there was only about ten paintings by him. That was not very much compared to the Chagall",
          "Every time I visit Espace Bonnard there is something new on display. The last exhibition was dedicated to one of the muses of this group of artists including Bonnard who was called Misia. The Espace Bonnard is housed in a lovley old villa in an artistic area called Le Cannet.",

She was also the first wife of Pablo Picasso, one of his early artistic muses and the mother of his son, Paulo. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nOlga Khokhlova was born in the town of Nezhin, Chernigov Governorate, (Ukraine, then located in the Russian Empire). Her mother Lydia Zinchenko was of Ukrainian descent. Her father was a Russian officer. The Khokhlovs family had three sons and two daughters. Olga wanted to be a ballerina from the time she visited France and saw Madame Shroessont perform. She became a member of the Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev.\nOn May 18, 1917, Olga danced in Parade \u2013 a ballet by Sergei Diaghilev, Erik Satie and Jean Cocteau \u2013 on its opening night at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet. Pablo Picasso had designed the costumes and set for the ballet. After meeting Picasso, Olga left the group, which toured South America, and stayed in Barcelona with him. He introduced her to his family. At first his mother was alarmed by the idea that her son should marry a foreigner, so he gave her a painting of Olga as a Spanish girl (Olga Khokhlova in Mantilla). Later Olga returned with Picasso to Paris, where they began to live together on the Rue La Bo\u00e9tie.\n\n\n=== Marriage to Picasso ===\nOlga married Picasso on July 12, 1918, at the Russian Orthodox Cathedral at the Rue Daru. Jean Cocteau and Max Jacob were witnesses to the marriage. She was one of Picasso's first artistic muses.In July 1919, Pablo and Olga went to London for the performance of Le Tricorne, for which Picasso had designed costumes and sets, according to Diaghilev's wishes. The ballet was also performed at the Alhambra, in Spain, and was a great success at the Paris Opera in 1919.\nOn February 4, 1921, Olga gave birth to a boy named Paulo (Paul). From then on, Olga and Picasso's relationship deteriorated. In 1927, Picasso began an affair with a seventeen-year-old French woman, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter. In 1935, Olga learned of the affair from a friend, who also informed her that Walter was pregnant. Immediately, Olga took Paulo, moved to the South of France, and filed for divorce. Picasso refused to divide his property evenly with her, as required by French law, so Olga stayed legally married to him until her death from cancer in Cannes, France, in 1955.\n\n\n== Descendants ==\nPaulo, who died on June 5, 1975, was married to Emilienne Lotte and divorced in 1953. They had two children: Pablito (born on May 5, 1949 \u2013 committed suicide on July 2, 1973) and Marina (born on November 14, 1950). Paulo, later in life, married Christiane Pauplin. The couples' only child, Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, co-founded the Picasso Museum in Malaga along with his mother.\nIn 1990, Marina Picasso founded an orphanage in Thu Duc, Vietnam (a former military base). Named \"The Village of Youth\", it was funded by Marina\u2019s inheritance from her grandfather, Pablo Picasso. Marina\u2019s foundation has also organized the digging of wells in inland Vietnam, sends regular shipments of milk to orphanages and hospitals and grants farming subsidies and scholarships.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nRichardson, John (2007).

The artwork was collected after France\u2019s inheritance-tax law had been amended to permit Picasso\u2019s heirs to pay the taxes owed by his estate in art instead of money. As a result of that amendment, the French government formally owns paintings, sculptures, table reliefs, and ceramics as well as thousands of drawings and engravings by Picasso. In addition to the art itself, the museum houses virtually the entire collection of the artist\u2019s preliminary studies. In the ensuing years, the museum acquired more items, and by the early 21st century, it had some 5,000 artworks by Picasso.The collection is housed in the H\u00f4tel Sal\u00e9, built by the architect Jean de Bouiller between 1656 and 1659 in the Marais district of Paris. The building underwent extensive renovations prior to the museum\u2019s opening, and in 2009 it closed for a major expansion. The project was plagued by various troubles, including cost overruns and construction problems, and the museum did not reopen until 2014.The museum exhibits some 400 works, with many of Picasso\u2019s larger sculptures gracing the outdoor gardens. Items from his personal collection of works by other artists, including Paul C\u00e9zanne, Henri Rousseau, and Henri Matisse, are also displayed.\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\n ",

          "it was nice, but nothing really spoke to me",
          "Amazing place. I did my city break in January and went to France. French people are very sophisticated and  even small towns are full of art and youths.  Highly recommend for any city break",
          "Germaine Richier Exhibition on until the end of January. If you know Antibes you will know the figures along the wall of the museum. Maybe you thought they were by Picasso but they are the work of an amazing woman, a friend of Picasso who \u2026",
          "Picasso has always been my favorite artist and this museum has works I've never seen before! You can feel his presence in the building and being in Antibes helps to understand his love of the French Riviera.",
          "The Museum is nice and view from their gallery towards the panoramic view is also nice. Walk to museum is 1 km from Gare de\u2019Antibes! The entry fee was 8\u20ac/adult. The postcards and museum shop is also worth a visit. You will also experience old town near the museum and can plan for the same before/after museum visit.",
          "Not my favorite period of Picasso, but the museum is a highlight of Antibes and rich with history of Picasso's time there.  Nice outdoor space onteh sea and lovely gift shop.",
          "Pay attention, extremly strict measures that make visit impossible ! You can not enter even carrying your handbag! Toilets are closed, no cloakroom, no locker either. We gave up. Pity.",
          "There was art. It was kinda cool. Good thing to do after a night out.",
          "A really nice museum. Picasso's works are only on the last level and from his later years only, but still a nice exposition. A big plus is the accessibility, we could go to all levels using an elevator, which was very helpful for us.",
          "Truly splendid place where Picasso used to live and work upon invitation of the local mayor. Great views over the Mediterranean.",
          "Not worth the time and the old lady's at the entrance arrogant and disrespectful attitude. Will not be back.",
          "A very bright museum, where you can enjoy some of the real Picasso's drawings, paintings, sculptures and ceramics.",
          "The museum itself was really great. But the woman working in the giftshop was so rude. It almost ruined my whole visit.",
          "The castle is old and beautiful, and museum is interesting for Picasso lovers.",
          "Lots of information in several different languages, friendly staff, exhibits well-lit and dramatic, attractive outdoor statues.",
          "Nice collection of Picassos in a restored chateau . Has a nice outside patio overlooking the sea. There is a gift shop too (of course). Picasso stayed here and painted for a few years amongst other nearby towns.",
          "A wonderful museum in a remarkable location. We took a bus from Nice to Antibes and wandered through the old town to this small fortress building on the shore housing the museum. Lots of Picasso but also other abstract artists, all nicely \u2026",
          "Nice place, worth the visit just for the view and the new artists - but Picasso? Huuum. 1 in 100 works are worth it. \nThe house itself is far more interesting but then that's a matter of opinion I suppose.",
          "Small, charming museum, located in a beautiful area. A great place for those who know only the name and a few of the most popular paintings.  You can get to know the painter's biography and a sufficient collection of works of art.",
          "I was surprised when the entry cost was just 8 euros, because that doesn't seem like much for a Picasso museum. In the end though 8 euros is exactly the right price for this. There are a few Picasso paintings, but most of it was either not \u2026",
          "We visited today (Saturday) and got free entry! The top floor has all the Picasso art, but the first and second floor has a selection of other artist\u2019s work. \nThere are fantastic views from the terrace, and some gorgeous sculptures ! \nNice \u2026",
          "Excellent. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Great location, ease to get around and a great combination and selection of works. Perfect museum visit for the time conscious and culturally inclined.",
          "Wonderful selection of  by the artist and others, whose works arenon display.  Beautiful setting next to the Mediterranean.",
          "Very nice collection of Picasso's work while he stayed in Antibes, interesting photographs. I hadn't seen any of his work in real life before, and I was blown away by the wonderful  bendiness of his mind. Very cool, well worth \u20ac8 pp kids go free.",
          "Small yet beautiful museum but also the view over the sea is wonderbar",
          "A real must see in a beautiful location overlooking the beach. There are murals painted on doors and walls in the lane outside..weather was superb and cafe/bars within yards. Took my granddaughter 17 yrs who thought it was fantastic. .Mike collins",
          "I like this place. First of all, the building is an ancient building and it is nice to see from outside already. There are some of Picasso\u2019s works during his staying in Antibes which are nice to see. Even though the works here are not the \u2026",
          "Great museum, must see.",
          "For Picasso lovers! Perfect spot to discover random creativity of the artist himself and the others!",
          "I finally understand Picasso.  That's good.  Antibes is beautiful, but hot as Hades.  The museum is air conditioned (obviously), and clean restrooms.   Attendants in every room which is nice because I asked questions.  Minus one start \u2026",
          "Great works but there are some problems. There is a lot of light coming from the windows, which is reflected through the glasses protecting the paintings. The museum should be open after 6pm when there is less light, but it is not. The sunlight is also not good for the painting in the long term.",
          "A nice selection but a bit wanting. Though it shows his development through 1946, no  famous works on display. Informative for sure.",
          "It's nice and informative, but don't expect to see too much Picasso. Book 2 hours to have a in depth look at everything, otherwise you can be out of there in 30 minutes.",
          "a nice choice when you arrive in antibes and look through the view of Picasso creations. summer sunshine sea and friends or a little boring , all of these elements give the answer of these arts. By the way, madame Germaine richier surprises me, don\u2019t forget to appreciate her sculptures from the back, the power of moving and lining.",
          "Some interesting insights into picasso and his style, and interesting pieces of art, sculpture and ceramics. Would be good to have information next to the pieces so more easily relatable than on a general information board in room. Could be \u2026",
          "Picasso visited Antibes in 1946 and loved the place. I could see his captivation with the old-town wonder in the art displayed in this museum.",
          "Great place to visit. The Grimaldi castle houses not only an interesting Picasso exhibition but also displays of other great artists - when I was there they had Miro as well as other artists",
          "There are 20 odd plates , 2 sculptures and couple of paintings displayed of Picasso when he worked for about 2 months here. The first two floors of an unrelated artists . If you are here for Picasso paitings or history  you will be disappointed",
          "Lovely small museum of a house picasso once lived in.",
          "Nice museum ,one that you can get up close to view art works. I personally am not a fan of Picasso so not as enjoyable as other galleries. If you have time worth the visit BUT if limited time  , unless a real Picasso fan, you can skip.",
          "I really liked this one. A nice mix of other painters as well. Get the app, really good info!",
          "This review is for the museum itself, not Picasso's work. I don't think I'll understand his work ever. It's good, I just don't know. The museum was wonderful. Staff was helpful and nice. The layout worked pretty well and there was a lot \u2026",
          "Awfully rude staff. Blunt answers, no interest in their jobs, sat on their phones, playing games on their phones, not very welcoming. Lovely building but wouldn\u2019t recommend paying \u20ac8 for this experience",
          "We walked around the outside. Nice views, not really interested in the art inside.",
          "Beautiful building and stunning view compliment a small but terrific collection of ceramics, other pottery, sketches and paintings. About 60 in all. Plus works from other artists. Covered the Picasso in about 45 minutes.",
          "This is a serious gallery, so only worth visiting if you want to learn stuff. Take advantage of multi-entry with the ticket, and especially the adjacent archaeological museum and it's hypocaust. Get back down the hill and the military \u2026",
          "Beautiful inside and out!",
          "I really enjoyed my visit here. There's a pretty substantial amount of the great man's work and the entry fee of 8 euro seemed reasonable to me.",
          "If you are into abstract art, this place is for you. Otherwise, you can just skip going inside and paying 6 euros.",
          "Beutiful museum, not expensive tickets, great staff!\nWait was about 4min to get in, Thursday in June at 3pm\n\nI needed about 1h to see it all at my pace.\nSpace was beutiful and at grate cool temperature.\nThere is a nice store where you can get some books and souvenirs.",
          "Various arts of Picasso on display. \nAlso tells his ideas and describe the paintings/arts in a nice way. Hood terrace view from behind.",
          "The museum is housed within an ancient mansion, which belonged to the Grimaldi family in the early 17th century. In the early 18th century, the building became Antibes Town Hall. Since 1925, the place has been known as the Grimaldi Museum \u2026",
          "Extremely rude staff. You are not allowed to enter with a big backpack (which is understandable) and you cannot leave it in a storage room. You can only deposit there small items. Exhibition was quite nice but small. Overpriced",
          "The ancient Grimaldi's castle where the museum is based has been recently restored and is beautiful.",
          "I went to this Picasso museum with a certain apprehension about the artist and his work.  Finally this one made me discover the artist and made me want to interest me a little more in his work.  The building itself and the view of antibes \u2026",
          "This is absolutely worth the admission price. So many great and varied Picasso pieces. Be aware the the majority of pieces are not his and those are at the beginning of the museum. \n\nI found that stopping and taking in each aspect of the \u2026",
          "Picasso fans will love it. Extensive collection of exhibits. You must like the art of Picasso though.",
          "Not very impressed, but would still recommend the visit. Most paintings are from Picasso's collection, and only a few were painted by him. There are a few of his sculpture in the garden too, and these are very nice. The building is gorgeous \u2026",
          "Lots of art, fabulous views and sculptures overlooking the coast, reasonable entry price too",
          "Not a big fan of museums in general but it was in fact fun to see some works of Picasso in real life. It wasn't vary expensive at all so if you're interested in art it's definitely a good visit. the first floors are filled with works of other artists and the top one is dedicated to Picasso.",
          "Unfortunately there is only a shelf close to the wardrobe with exactly five porcelain vases from Pablo Picasso and therefore the whole museum carried his name! The art from the other artist is worth seeing but then again, in my humble \u2026",
          "No acces due to tourist groups.  Ery unfreindly guarf",
          "Closed for lunch when we arrived - typical French! More work by others than Picasso - rather disappointing",
          "The organisation of the museum is excellent and there is a lot to see.  I just figured out that I am probably not the biggest fan of Picasso. Hence just \"ok\"",
          "Antibes is a wonderful town. The Picasso museum is in a wonderful location with nice exhibits.",
          "Amazing artwork and an app was available to download to help give added information as you went around the museum",
          "Personally, I think it's a MUST SEE when travelling in Antibes, and even when travelling in Nice. \nThe chronological order of the paintings create a suspenseful story, that left my NOT SO FOND OF ART wife thrilled and interested in art even \u2026",
          "Absolutely beautiful....if you go to Antibes and leave without seeing this museum it's really a shame.",
          "Contains a good collection of Picasso's art and photos of him. You can see some of his sketches, sculptures and ceramics as well as his paintings.",
          "I love Picasso's drawings as well as his paintings.",
          "It is in a wonderful location right on the shore. The building is impressive. Unlike many museums in France, non-flash photography is allowed. \n\nI liked the ceramics. There were many to see. The Don Quixote plates were cool.\n\nThe \u2026",
          "The Picasso pieces are limited to the upper floor. The museum is cash only.",
          "Interesting but only a small collection. Nice view on the terrace.",
          "Surprisingly lovely little museum with some gorgeous pieces. Sparkling, sweeping views of the water.",
          "Museum to visit if you love Art",
          "The musketeer. All for one, one for all. Is fantastic",
          "I don't recommend visiting. I have evidence that the museum staff is interested in discriminating against the visitors, and the staff is in a bad attitude, loud voices, such as the market town, and do not apologize to the tourists! Influenced their reputation! Not recommended to visit!",
          "This is a very nice mus\u00e9e for Picasso lovers and everyone else. It is small and it provides a good afternoon in an spectacular setting..",
          "Beautiful art museum. Lots of interesting photos and information about Picasso particularly about his time living in Antibes including all the the art he created there. Many pieces from other artists as well. Views out the windows \u2026",
          "Loved it. Very cheap too compared to London",
          "Beautiful museum in the old castle of Antibes. Just like any other museum in France, closed on Monday also during high season in the summer.",
          "joie de vivre!\nFriendly staff and airco make this a pleasant experience - a fascinating and informative view of Picasso's Antibes life!\nThe final view from the terrace is stunning!",
          "For those visiting using the French Riviera Pass, it is required to have the same verified before the Tourism Office before being used in the Musee.  It was good that the staff allowed us to go inside because we have babies.\n\nLimited Picasso artwork.",
          "It's a wonderful museum with a plentiful artwork donated to the Antibes art authorities by the famous artist Picasso. Apart from Picasso's work, artworks from other artists are also preserved and on display for the visitors. Must visit place if you are traveling to Antibes around French Riviera.",
          "Spend an hour here and learn how Picasso developed artistically during the time he spent in the area. Some very nice paintings and sketches. Then go get an ice cream in Antibes and you\u2019ve had a great afternoon.",
          "Very nice place",
          "Amazingly inspirational, one must!!!!! \nThere is no simple Picasso, but the most beautiful insights to the world\u2019s sensual contemporary.",
          "I love anything Picasso. The museum is small but wonderfully laid out with many examples of his art.",
          "A rather small exhibition of Picasso's art. During our visit during the weekend, the entrance was free, so worth checking if it's all year round.",
          "The Picasso Museum is in the seaside Chateau Grimaldi in the old town of Antibes. I recommend to visit for acquaintance with the works of Picasso and not only.  Very interesting and beautiful place for a pleasant and cultural holiday.",
          "I would say, worth visiting, even if you don\u2019t fancy art or Picasso. Picasso\u2019s works are on the top floor, there are also expositions of other artists. Nice view on the sea from the windows.",
          "Nice day out. Lovely pieces of artwork not only by Picasso!",
          "Great museum in a beautiful location. A nice Picasso collection! It's definitely worth a visit.",
          "Only a limited number of major works by Picasso himself, some remarkable works by other artists. Interesting to see photos of Picasso's lab and how he worked. Tranquille place. Alltogether very much worth it.\nSee his work \"La joie de vivre\".",
          "It's a small but excellent museum with paintings, drawings and sculptures by Picasso. It's easy to reach from the city centre following the signs. Friendly staff. Only 6\u20ac fee. It's a must see if you're visiting Antibes.",
          "Surely an interesting museum to visit even though Picasso\u2019s most important artworks are not shown here. However, the audio listening tour is worth indeed. Recommended.",
          "Visited with three young children.  Amazing place to go, great set up with stories of Picasso\u2019s life and work in relation to the local area, a whole floor to see where he worked and great gift shop and garden with fantastic views of the \u2026",
          "Nice museum just beside the beach and near the famous market in Antibes.",
          "Worth a visit! Download the app (Mus\u00e9e Picasso Antibes) before you go. They don't have free wifi, and you'll find the castle walls limit your internet signal. The museum has a fantastic view from the terrace, and a collection of work of \u2026",
          "The museum gives you a little insight to Picassos work during his time at Antibes.",
          "My favourite in south of France.  Amazing paintings to see and discover picasso's world...",
          "Few Paintings from picasso himself, first etage is just from an uninspired artist.",
          "The other half wasn't impressed!! I'm from the arty background so i found it amazing!!! I mean not all the art work belonged to Picasso felt a little cheated!!",
          "Good collection of Picasso works. Need to be an artist to really appreciate it and I was not one of those.",
          "It was so interesting to be so close to Picasso's life. The people working there are also very professional. Thank you!",
          "Like chagall overated small museum with very few painting and an entry fee of 8euros.",
          "Wonderful place if you like Picasso, you'll be pretty dumbfounded if Constable is more your thing though.",
          "Only a few picasso works of art (paintings and sculptures). Most of them sketches. Worth your while if you're in the area and have never seen his work in real life. Otherwise, a bit too pricey (8 euro admittance).",
          "Nice museum and atmosphere. A bit close up security staff though.",
          "Some of Picasso's lesser known works in a terrific museum on the shore of the Mediterranean",
          "If you have a pram / trolley or larger luggage you cannot enter the museum. At the same time, there is no place where you can leave such things.",
          "Place and the scenic beauty is out of the world. Paintings of Picasso though not understood by less enlightened minds like us",
          "See a different side of The Man",
          "Definitely check this place out while in Antibes. We paid 6\u20ac for two people and had access to the terrace overlooking a lovely view of the ocean. The place itself is quite small but offers a lot of information about Picasso's early life and influences.",
          "Intresting experience. Lots of wonderful masterpieces. Amazing location",
          "Great collection of art from a specific time in Picasso's career",

          "Great gallery with superb Picasso collection",
          "Although the centerpieces are quite obviously works by Picasso, other artists are prominently featured on the intermediary levels. Don't miss the room containing some of Sta\u00ebl's best works!\nVery friendly and personally interested staff, for the most part.",
          "Really nice place - great paintings and location by the see - a must see while having a walk in Antibes.",
          "For the true artist in you",
          "This museum in Antibes has a quite good collection of Picasso paintings and sculptures. Very interesting exhibition including the  contemporary exhibition.Moreover the building is marvelous -and old palate where Picasso has his own atelier. Extraordinary veranda with sculptures and a wonderful view to seaside. Worth it the visit.",
          "Nice visit...enjoa collection of undigned paintingsyby Picasso along either his pottery eork and statutes in beautiful Antibes.",
          "A lot of people there visiting , very loud . Picasso paints had not his sgnature...",
          "Limited collection of Picasso pieces, but some nice sculptures and a great view of the sea.",
          "If you're expecting to see his most renown paintings, it might not be the best place to visit. But if it's ceramic, unsung plates and draft drawings, go up to the remparts, cross the nice Proven\u00e7ale plazza and spend a little moment, it's Picasso after all.",
          "Absolutely beautiful museum that is dedicated to the finest works of Pablo Picasso. Great location and beautiful surroundings. Explore the town, lots to do and see.",
          "Picasso was Spanish. I am very very offended because the traductions were in French, English and Italian. If Picasso resurrected he would close the museum.",

          "Interesting to view",
          "Pricey but good food.",

          "Some nice works displayed here but all descriptions in French.",
          "Not a Picasso fan but a museum is always interesting.  Great day and the building was beautiful.",
          "Nice exhibition on Picasso in Anyives and other artists with ties to the city. Little information available throughout the exhibits. No explanations were given at the entry as is custom. Nice terrace.",
          "Small gallery of Picasso. Most of all they have photographs of Picasso while he was working, as well from his personal life. Very well worth a visit. 6\u20ac to enter. Easy to spend an hour, and in 90 min you have seen most or all things.",
          "Great Artist...",
          "Very interesting, I learned about art history",
          "Small museum full of charm. Worth a visit. Picasso\u2019s artwork is well chosen as well as the other artists\u2019. I especially enjoyed the photographs of him, the space itself, the surrounding streets of Antibes and the majestic location on the Mediterranean Sea.",
          "Beautiful building, nice spacing and quite cheap for the amount of Art.",
          "Loved this Museum",
          "Great museum, located directly to the sea. Lovely place and a must-see if you're in C\u00f4te d'Azur.",
          "Antibes is a must visit little town. Unfortunately the Museum was closed at that time.",
          "Not a very large collection, and no major exhibits. But also not very fair from old time and cheap entry, so certainly not a wasted hour if you have time on your visit to Antibes.",
          "So many original Picaso pieces in one place!! If you are a fan this is a must visit!",
          "Could be a little bit more paintings but still well organised",
          "Great building, good choice of Picasso's ceramics, intresting terrace with several intriguing sculptures and wonderful view to the bay. As of Aug 2018, the museum does not have enough commentaries and information in English.",
          "Really interesting and not very crowded. Also a beautiful building and area to explore.",
          "A stunning spot and some powerful later Picasso works. The sculptures and gardens on the terrace are magnificent too!",
          "Essential for an understanding of his work done in the 50s on the Riviera.",
          "Fabulous museum in historic fort/palace right by the sea. You have to explore a fair bit  before you find the actual Picassos but when you do they are impressive. Plus the other art is well worth a look too. Cheap as well at \u20ac6.",
          "Affordable, well displayed, English write ups.",
          "Great museum of picasso better than the one in malaga",
          "Ok, but definitely not a Picasso museum. Most of the pieces are from other artists inspired by Picasso. The building is nice and the view is great.",
          "Great and interesting to see the late works of the Maestro",
          "A really good place, that I first came across on a free walking tour",
          "The ticketing doesn\u2019t seem so friendly. But the place is worth for \u20ac8 per person.",
          "Well worth a visit",
          "Interesting gallery for fans of the artist. It shuts at 1 so we had to rush around in less than an hour as our appointment was at 12",
          "Totally stupid museum where they have different prices than advertised online. They don't allow you to take your bag but for other people they don't bother. And the security or what it is is still behind your back checking if you are not going to steal some art or destroy it or I don't know.",

          "It was a nice break from the beach, and something cultural for the children to do. Some great Picasso pieces and museum is set in an interesting area of Antibes by the market. Must visit if in Antibes for some time.",
          "We enjoyed this on our second attempt to visit. Check the opening hours \u2013 it closes for lunch, and then hope there isn\u2019t a long queue. On our first attempt there was such a queue, which didn\u2019t seem to be moving, while pre-booked groups seemed to be getting admission easily",
          "The exhibition is housed in a beautiful building. The top floor is dedicated to Picasso, as this was his studio. The museum closes between 1pm and 2pm for lunch.",
          "This is an interesting way to in fill a bit of time if staying in Antibes. The location is lovely and the building worth seeing. The exhibition of Picasso\u2019s work is quite varied but not extensive in this museum- and only represents a small period of time during hie career. I had",
          "Enjoyed the museum despite a 15 minute wait in line. Expected less but was pleasantly surprised. It is not just Picasso, it has other artists and sculptors.",
          "Nice place to spend the time and get familiar with some pieces you've never seen as well as some very famous pieces. Beautiful estate in one of the riviera jems - city of Antibes.",
          "The museum is housed within an ancient mansion, which belonged to the Grimaldi family in the early 17th century. In the early 18th century, the building became Antibes Town Hall. Since 1925, the place has been known as the Grimaldi Museum and in 1946 came to the place Pablo",
          "Very nice ambiance plus good explanations on the Picasso\u2019s Art fashion. A so good location a Antibes sea view also near many good restaurants.. Bars.. Cafes..shops complete by beautiful people around. Highly Recommended...",
          "Not Picasso\u2019s most inspiring works, the modern artist is dull and dark but the building and setting on the harbour is eonderful",
          "From the moment we set foot in the museum, this was a big disappointment. The woman selling tickets refused my credit card and said it was cash only. I then watched her process credit card payments from her fellow citizens behind me in line. The museum itself is only one-half",
          "In a magnificent venue. Loved the outdoor sculptures the best. Gave a good commentary and has an app that you can connect to to make the most of the experience",
          "This is a smaller museum than most. What is in there is lovely. It takes about an hour to go through and really look at everything. The area surrounding it is so beattiful. The view from the back is so scenic.",
          "Picasso's Museum is a gem everyone should visit. It is beautifully located in the Old Antibes and has so much treasure. I was happy to discover it and to wander among all this powerful art. I went there with friends and they really enjoyed it. I might go back again soon. The",
          "While the building is nice, and has some interesting sculptures by Antibes artists, aside from 2-3 ceramics in a tiny corner, THERE IS NO MORE WORK BY Picasso! Not worth 8 euros.",
          "One of the best collections of Picasso I have ever seen. The museum it's easy access and have amazing views on the see. The collection is very beautiful and on my opinion presents the moments Picasso lived on the C\u00f4t\u00e9 D'Azur.",
          "Great exhibition of art work in a fabulous building inside and outside in a stunning location. Highly recommended. Note you need to leave backpacks, etc at cloakroom.",
          "Any opportunity to see any of Picasso\u2019s work, we do enjoy very much. The property was originally owned by the Grimaldi\u2019s Family it turned into a small beautiful museum right on the water. Beautiful setting. After it you can walk through the town and enjoy the Plaza.",
          "Picasso worked here for a short time. The collection is limited to [some of] the works he made here. It appears that only the 'lower quality' material was still available. Considering the trouble it takes to get into the overbusy Antibes, if you are not staying there, it's not",
          "As far as museums go, this one is on the smaller side. And it is also more of an art gallery, than a museum too. But for our \u20ac6 entry fee I felt it was well worth the visit. I would even suggest going a little out of your way to do so. I personally found it inspiring so see",
          "We've seen many art exhibits featuring Picasso's art. This museum is situated right on the Mediterranean, so the views are gorgeous. The exhibits themselves are okay and give you a feel for his Cubist period. There are also displays of his ceramics.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Museum in our short time in Antibes. Tastefully put together, it attempted to give an overview of the man himself in the time he lived in Antibes and examples of his work, supplemented by commentary on his mindset and methodology. An",
          "What a divine location to be inspired - on the edge of the sea! I visited on a very hot day and the coolness inside was a relief. I don\u2019t know much about art but Picasso\u2019s is certainly outside the box. At first I shook my head in disbelief but after a while I felt like he had",
          "Fantastic gallery; artwork well displayed. Picasso and other artists. A definite must in the very centre of such a lively and fun town. Feels very intimate and like a private tour. Would definitely recommend.",
          "We visited today (Saturday) and got free entry! The top floor has all the Picasso art, but the first and second floor has a selection of other artist\u2019s work. There are fantastic views from the terrace! Nice small collection, in a convenient location- just a 2 min walk from the",
          "Bullcrap. 6\u20ac for children art. Maybe in some of the paintings you could find a meaning, but most of them are just touch of a paint and nothing else. Nothing to look at.",
          "An historic location at the water's edge. Selection of Picasso paintings, drawings and ceramics. Excellent view from the terrace. In an interesting part of old Antibes.",
          "Well, of course you have to be an art lover to enjoy this museum and a fondness for Picasso will be helpful! But it's not only the Great Man himself - there are many artists exhibited here and absolutely well worth the Euro 6 (for adults). If you don't like (fairly to",
          "Well worth a visit. Nice layout and some good originals. Nice views from inside. Pleasant escape from heat. Informative.",
          "The only reason there are 4 rather than 5 stars is that around half the work in the museum is work done by artists who were influenced by Picasso not Picasso himself. However it\u2019s understandable that a museum of this size and in this area wouldn\u2019t have the endowment budget to",
          "This is not like an exhibit in a museum. Most of the Picasso exhibits in most of the museums that I have visited have a couple of Picassos and advertise like crazy! This is just a simple place where he used to work, primarily on sculpture, at least that\u2019s what is on display. One",
          "This Pablo Picasso\u2019s museum is located in an old castle overlooking the sea which makes this landmark very beautiful. The collection of art is impressive considering that this is Antibes. The museum is very well kept, clean, spacious, light... Well worth visiting.",
          "Castle is very nice, also modern art picture exhibition is good instaled, I only do not understand this type of art you cannot see anything on some pictures. If you\u00b4re fan of modern art you should go there. It is located on beautiful rock coast and just few minutes walk from the",
          "A small but interesting museum. Well laid out. English speaking Guide avaiable. The videobon the All for one painting was insightful.",
          "If you love Picasso you have to go to this museum. The building is really interesting and there are some great pieces in there. I was a little surprised that there was a lot of art by other artists - i probably would have like to see a bit more Picasso art. I also think it",
          "Picasso museum is located in Chateau Grimaldi in Antibes, the place and the art are a very unique match. Picasso worked here in 1946. in 1966 the palace got his new name and Picasso as a gratitude to the city of Antibes and the museum gave them 23 paintings and 44 drawings,",
          "If you like the Picasso they have some great sculptures here of his works worth seeing. They do have some other artist but the second floor is dedicated to him because he used to live there. You can spend a couple hours here in museum if that\u2019s your thing. I recommend this as a",
          "This museum shows a segment of Picasso's later life when he lived for a little over a year in the area. You'll be amazed at the number of drawings and works that are here. Quantity and diversity is what you find with paintings to plates. That's right. He decorated more than just",
          "As much as i enjoy Picasso this was not what i expected- it was so much better. Most of this work was from the part of his life he spent in Antibes. The building was beautiful, and the work was largely pieces i have never seen.",
          "Not all of the museum contains works of Picasso \u2013 the earlier galleries are full of more contemporary work by other artists influenced by him. Eventually, however, this museum tells the story of the time that Picasso based himself in Antibes and was influenced by the light and",
          "If you are interested in art and like Pablo Picasso then you must visit this fine museum if you are in Antibes. You come close to the art and it is a solid collection of Picasso works. Hear there are also some other artists' works to view, but it is primarily a Picasso museum.",
          "We went here to make use of an afternoon and cool down a bit from the scorching heat. \u20ac8 entry for adults. I think we were unlucky because there were a couple of loud groups in the museum at the same time as us which we didn\u2019t like. Also some instagrammers just posing in front",
          "Looks like a small stone-made castle with a beautiful view and statues. The working hours) should be noted n advance (they close for lunch) I was surprised when i saw Jacque Prevert drawings",
          "Nice modern museum in an old small castle. Very clean and well layed out. Not too busy when we went at 4pm. Picasso paintings are interesting and the photos of him working in his studio in the building. A must when in Antibes",
          "The Chateau Grimaldi is fun to see and go back in time to when Picasso had a studio there. The ocean is the perfect backdrop. We generally do museums pretty quickly so the kids enjoy it without it being too drawn out. This was a great experience for them and hopefully by making",
          "Some interesting Picasso displays with some amazing examples of his work and a lot of sketches from this period of his life which may be of less interest depending on your artistic interest. The main thing here is the balcony with some great sculptures but mainly jaw-dropping",
          "I\u2019m a huge Picasso admirer so I was not about to miss this. The Picasso work focuses almost exclusively on his time in Antibes so don\u2019t expect an encyclopedic survey so much as a niche display of his work. Complimentary collections from other artists occupy the first floors.",
          "Musee Picasso located in Chateau Grimaldi within the Old Town could easily be found. Enty fee to the museum was necessary and advance booking for time-slot assigned would be useful. Apart from the art pieces displayed inside, there was a nice open-air terrace with sculptures",
          "We visited this historic Grimaldi castle/museum to see the works by Picasso but we were also delighted to see several other very interesting artists represented. The sculpture terrace was stunning with beautiful pieces against the backdrop of the sea. Well worth a visit!",
          "This Picasso Museum is housed in the Chateau Grimaldi where the artist lived in 1946. There are over 50 drawings and paintings on show in his studio here. There is a small entrance fee.",
          "Set in the Chateau Grimaldi in the heart of Antibes, this museum tells the story of Picasso's time in Antibes during the 1940s and shows how he developed his styles in painting and sculpture. Takes about 2 hours to go round, a lot to take in, but this is a must if you are a fan",
          "This museum brings together wonderful works of art as well as an enchanting building with breath taking views! An experience not to miss while on the French Riviera!",
          "I am a Picasso fan. His art whilst produced there was a good representation of his work. I enjoyed the exhibition. Plus it was very hot outside so an air conditioned few hour out of the sun was very welcomed. Lovely terrace with sculptures over looking the Med and scenery.",
          "Situated in the center of Antibes, this museum is easy to get to and takes a couple of hours to get around. Here you can view lots of art from artists with a similar style to Picasso and also there is a lot of work from Picasso himself. On display there are many photographs of",
          "The museum is well set up to display the pieces of art - recommend a card for 10 euros that we got from the tourist information office as it gives you access to the forte carr\u00e9 and the museums in the area. The displays were well set up and in all honesty likely deserving a",
          "My wife and I visited Musee Picasso in Antibes. This museum is located at a very nice location. And has about 30 Picasso art pieces. Good to visit.",
          "Situated in castle with courtyard. Something of a walk but interesting exhibits particularly the pottery and ceramics. A worthwhile visit.",
          "This museum contains a collection of Picasso paintings donated largely by Picasso himself. The work is mostly contemporary to the time they were donated, many having been painted there. For me, not many paintings really stood out as exceptional, which does not mean that there",
          "Some reviewers provided more information about the reviewer than the museum. If you do not understand or appreciate modern art, why go in the first place? Go to the beach or go shopping. This is an excellent museum displaying a large number of interesting Picasso drawings,",
          "It was interesting to see how world famous works were born. The place where the museum were nice, old castle or something. It costs 8e/person.",
          "Only one section of the museum is dedicated to Picasso's art, but it was worth spending time viewing the art of the other artist as well. The ceramic display was awesome! I loved the photos on display which was taken during Picasso's time in Antibes. There's also a sculptor",
          "An interesting museum and worth a look. To be honest most of Picasso\u2019s work is very bizarre and not really worthy of displaying.",
          "An absolute MUST is you are in Antibes. Despite seeing many Picasso exhibitions this one was really good, informative and well laid out. A beautiful setting for a very good exhibition.",
          "It\u2019s difficult to pass up an opportunity so we visited the \u2018Picasso\u2019 museum despite the review that advised spending our money elsewhere on two coffees and patisseries. We should have heeded this advice and spent our 8 euros a head on a more memorable activity. Unless you are a",
          "Okay, so we forgot how important May 1 is in France. Our mistake, but we made it on May 2 and did love the space, location and look into Picasso's time in Antibes. It was worth our time. Don't forget to visit the nearby farmers' market.",
          "...in a most impressive setting. I thoroughly enjoyed my walk through this gorgeous building, seeing the magnificence of Picasso. I especially enjoyed the photos of him in his studio at work. It provided a real personal edge to the experience.",
          "This is not the museum housing the greatest works of the master. It merely displays all the works he did during his stay in the same building for over a year. For art lover this will be a good place to understand how Picasso visualised his paintings since all works of art, even",
          "As soon as I saw the 16th-century stone castle, where this museum is located, I understood why Picasso was drawn to paint here for about six months in 1946. The structure stands on a hill, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. And the water and light, along with Greek mythology,",
          "The Musee is very well laid out over a few floors. There are interesting sculptures and artworks and not just Picasso's. Its certainly worth a visit to see original Picasso's even if you don't consider yourself an art lover.",
          "I must agree with another recent reviewer about the front of house attitude making the visit disappointing - not just me then. After paying \u20ac8 it is a shock to find out you can\u2019t use the lift - it is by code only and no-one in the shop seemed interested in helping. Then half way",
          "Shows the genius and creativity of an artist at the height of his powers In addition works from the collection of his contemporaries adds to the overall appreciation Don\u2019t forget the outside sculptures A few hours well spent",

          "Sadly they speak poorly English and hade very little to read in English. The wives from the terrace is nice-but they didn't have any cafe wish would make it more attractive",
          "My son and I had planned a trip and when we arrived it had just opened and was raining outside. Good timing! 8 Euros entry fee and the visit took nearly an hour. A massive collection, the highlight of which were, for me, the black and white photos of the artist at work in 1946.",
          "I arrived here just as it was about to shut for lunch, but returned at 2pm. The museum is situated in an old castle with fabulous huge rooms, and carved stone door frames. The building is a star in its own right, situated right by the sea, in a quiet part of old Antibes. There",

          "Awesome location in the old heart of Antibes. The view is magnificent, so is the building itself. For a very low price of \u20ac8,- you can enter the small museum to visit some of the great pieces of Picasso himself. Vases, paintings and other work are there to find. If you want to",
          "The museum is very nice and definitely worth a visit. Though Picasso stayed for a short while it had a lot of his history and how he did his paintings. There are several paintings of his. Some very nice and famous",

          "It was amazing to see the multimedium of artwork that Picasso created! I especially loved the sculpture that was made of only guitars. We also had fun in trying to figure out some of his artwork and the meaning behind each one. The building itself was most interesting; we",
          "The receptionist seemed totally disinterested in us and just about managed to process our credit card as though the effort was too much. We were not offered the option of an audio tour which might have enhanced our experience. Altogether it was an underwhelming visit",
          "A beautifully restored old building and Picasso works of period 1920 - 1946. Some of the paintings like \"Baigneuses regardant un avion\" I simply can't forget. Nice courtyard and a wonderful terrace with Picasso's artwork and amazing views.",
          "Entry is 8 euros (if you don't get a concession) and there are none of Picasso's more famous works here. This exhibition concentrates on the works he created while living in Antibes around 1946. There are also a series of photos taken in during this period. There are works by",
          "Well laid out in a fabulous building in Antibes overlooking the Mediterranean sea towards Nice. Entry fee in February was only 8 \u20ac for an adult. Well worth a visit. It does not contain his most famous works.",
          "A beautifully restored, ancient, stone building located a top the Vieux Ville Antibes. The sun shines off the vanilla coloured stone building, set in a courtyard area, adjacent to the Church of the Immaculate Conception where the old bells toll. The museum is set out in a 'one",
          "This is worthy if you wanna have a view from the coast. The collection is not representative of Picasso's most famous works, and there is not much information about what it is being exhibited. Unless you're a really a scholar of the area, I would not recommended this place.",

          "unfortunatly is was very crowded, so that we could not see in details.His master pieces are very interesting.",
          "The building soars above the coastal pathway. The work is displayed in lovely spaces. It is probably that I\u2019ve become overdosed on Picasso\u2019s prolific work having seen so much in so many exhibitions this one failed to ignite my interest but my friends did enjoy it. ",

          "we visited this museum and really enjoyed it. There was so much information about Picasso's life and his techniques it was especially interesting to me as an artist. This is very different from other museums I have been to. The only thing I would suggest is that you leave",
          "Having read some of the reviews of this museum I wasn\u2019t expecting a great deal. However I was amazed at the wealth of paintings, ceramics and drawings on display. The information boards also gave good insights into Picasso\u2019s life in the South of France. I also loved the",

          "We enjoyed our experience at the Musee Picasso, both inside and out. The views and statuary on the terrace are wonderful. The museum had just been renovated and the rooms were well lit and spacious. The crowds were manageable at 10:30 in the morning, so we didn't feel rushed",

          "This was a fabulous experience, featuring a number of artists with Picasso work occupying the top floor. Very easy to walk around and appreciate even if you're not an art lover. Also, make sure you look out of the many windows as the views are spectacular. We visited with our 2",

          "This chateau which was actually once a home for the Grimaldi family is set atop a hill over looking the sea. Picasso once had a work space here during the time he lived nearby with Francoise Gilot. Some of the works he created during that period are on view here. The musee",
          "Air con helped, beautiful terrace, great views. Great Picasso paintings and good descriptions for non arty folks. Kids went free. Great though husband a bit bored.",
          "The collection is not all that impressive, although there are a few noteworthy pieces. I loved, however, the old chateau and the beautiful views of the sea, including the terrace with the sculpture. It is worth a short visit, for sure.",
          "This is a former home of Picasso\u2019s with very little art included - most of it is pre- any actual nice works. There are perhaps 3 nice works. The best thing about the place is the view of the water, not worth 8 euros at all- maybe 2? But it should just be tagged as Picasso\u2019s",
          "My wife and I visited the Picasso Museum in Antibes in July 2018. We went first thing in the morning at about 10 am and there was already a line. The museum has three floors. Besides Picasso's paintings and atelier, I was greatly impressed by a series of ceramic plates that",
          "The view from the museum is amazing. You have to pay 8\u20ac so as to visit the museum but it worth it! You can, not only find, Picasso\u2019s works of art but other\u2019s famous artists too!",
          "Not as much Picasso as expected, but still well worth the visit. Located beautifully at the seaside and worked well for smaller kids too as was not too extensive. A must stop when in Antibes and close to the old town so easy to access when there.",
          "Wonderful collection of Picasso and other great artists who lived in Antibes. Visit the old town of Antibes and drop by the museum to go back in time and experience Picasso\u2019s Atelier.",
          "Since Picasso worked in this building, there is a special atmosphere. The site is wonderful and located perfectly. And for sure the pieces of art are magnificent. A must see.",
          "Honestly, after visiting the Paris museum this can be somewhat of a let down. However, if you take it for what it\u2019s worth it\u2019s still a cool place to visit in the area. It used to be where Picasso would work and there are a Few of his works. If you are very into the art, you may",
          "Ok experience but not the most exiting works. Would like to have titles translated to english. 1 hour visit",
          "The service was bad - they do not have lockers but insist you leave your little bag with documents and cash - my group continued , I had to leave !!",
          "Great museum to discover Picasso's blue period and ceramic works. One of the must-sees in Antibes. 1 hour visit is enough",
          "It seemed like half of the museum was under construction while we were there, and the bathroom line was 45 minutes long. I wish there'd been more of a structure to what was on display. I didn't feel like I learned anything.",
          "We where in Antibes for a wedding and we walked over from the Belle Rives to see the museum. While it did not have some of the great Picasso works there was plenty to see as well as great photographs of Pablo in various stages of his life doing what he loved. Highly recommend",
          "Picasso left some amazing artworks here in Antibes, and it's worth visiting If you're a fan! It is also where Picasso loved to live and this is considered to be his 'antibes' period. His studio is on the top floor , and the museum is filled with photographs too",
          "A lovely little museum encompassing six months of Picasso's life in 1946 when he was invited to live at the then mus\u00e9e Garimaldi. What sets this collection apart is that you can 'watch' the progression of a theme over several days or a month with sketches, paints, etchings &",
          "Excellent visit, none of Picasso's finest works but you are able to get very close to these works and look at the details. Nice view overlooking the bay too. Only issue was a lack of toilets.",
          "This is not an extensive Picasso collection, but is interesting and worth the walk out to the castle that was donated to house some of Picasso's work. The original collection was supplemented by other donations by his daughter among others.",
          "Surely an interesting museum to visit even though Picasso\u2019s most important artworks are not shown here. However, the audio listening tour is indeed worth. Recommended.",
          "The building was beautiful the view from the terrace was excellent and very atmospheric. There where very interesting statues and everything was displayed in a spacious and tasteful way. We were charged 3 Euros for entry, which was good value.",
          "From pencil drawings to portraits, to paintings to pottery, the collection was superb. We visited on a quiet weekday morning and savored the uncrowded rooms that allowed us to view what we wished at a leisurely pace. All of the Picassos were a treat for the eyes, but perhaps",
          "The museum is currently being renovated, and there is an entire floor closed. But there is a very special price of 3Euros So this is of course more than worth a visit. Short 30 min visit, not Picasso\u2019s best work but being in the space where he created is special. I really",
          "The setting and the castle are stunning. We were disappointed that we could not visit one floor due to restoration works. The price of entry was reduced to reflect this. Lots of interesting Picasso drawings, pottery and paintings.",
          "We were a little disappointed as the museum has only some works of Picasso that he did while he lived in Antibes. It was interesting and pleasant.",
          "On a rainy day in Antibes we decided to visit the museum. As there are currently works in the museum there is a reduced entry fee of \u20ac3 per person. You can see some ceramics, sculptures and paintings by Picasso and there are some beautiful views over the sea. If you are a lover",
          "Lovely building, many pictures and paintings I had not seen before. It was interesting. Well worth the 3\u20ac.",
          "This is a small museum focused on Picasso's work in Antibes and Vallauris so has a good sampling of is late 40's work. Other artists are also displayed Nicolas de Stael (exhibit closed out at the time of our visit) and Hans Hartung. Well worth the tour. Plan on 2 hours. Park",
          "For anyone a fan of Picasso or abstract art. Some really fun pieces here. Also he uses this lovely location as a studio for a time, the place is so beautiful. At the time of writing this, the 1st floor was all closed for renovation. The museum only charges \u20ac3 if there is",
          "I have never been that much of a Picasso fan. That is, until I visited this museum! It contains a wonderful selection of his works, and the fact that many of them were either created at or inspired by this very location just adds another special dimension to them, as does",
          "If you had never heard of Picasso, you would not start with this museum. It displays a post war period when materials were hard to access and paint quality severely lacking. Having said that, his output was prolific and his experimentation knew no bounds. The museum could do",
          "This museum is in an interesting building. There are some of Picasso's works here as well as many other works of other artists. For me, I am not a fan of this season of Picasso's works, but I know some are. Nevertheless, this was interesting to me. I also liked the view",
          "Picasso occupied a studio in this Grimaldi castle on the waterfront of old Antibes for half a year in 1946. He donated all the works to the new museum and the curators added a number of other artists to the collection including Nicolas de St\u00e4el. Some contemporary artists are",
          "Spent a pleasant hour at the Musee Picasso which has a very pretty outdoor space. We knew going in that there are very few works by Picasso displayed here so we weren't disappointed, but nothing about the experience was particularly memorable.",
          "I am a fan of Picasso and from what I know about his works and his life I can tell you I was a bit dissapointed by this museum and I am nearly certain that HE would be either. An artist like Picasso deserves much more. You could dedicate one room to his interesting life story",
          "Lovely little museum in a lovely building. You'll get six months of Picasso's work from 1946. This was left after his stay in this castle under the promise it never would leave the premises. But you will get more. Work from several other artists, many influenced by Picasso. We",
          "Rainy day so went here. Half price entry due to refurb work. We\u2019re not great art lovers but we were disappointed with museums small size and relatively little about Picasso. Took us about 25 minutes to go around.",
          "We expected a broader display of Picasso but were disappointed. The museum has quite a number of works by Picasso followers (most of whom were unknown to us). The actual Picasso paintings are mostly from his later years. There are also quite a number of his ceramics. However,",
          "Located in the old town of Antibes, and in the Grimaldi (think longest royal lineage in Europe) castle, this Picasso museum displays not only Picasso, but other works by Stael, Hartung, and Anna-Eva Bergman. Picasso work here for several years after WW II and many of the works",
          "We really enjoy this al though it was not extensive and many other artists work were also on display. It appears Picasso only spent 3 months in Antibes in 1946. It was clearly a working holiday as he produced 70 painting in that period. Clearly was a fast worker. Therefore most",
          "Nice museum, not so big. Tickets are cheap. The terrace offers a very beautiful view over the sea of Antibes!",
          "Let me be upfront: I really enjoyed this place. But I am an art geek, and I love seeing these early works by Picasso to sort of get an idea of his ground-floor approach to art. I only give it three stars instead of 4, because I realize some people maybe going in expecting to see",
          "We did enjoy the visit. I think crocodile Dundee said it best when he saw a Picasso painting. \u201cI have never been that drunk\u201d. Gotta love culture.",
          "If you like Picasso you will love the experience, if you don\u2019t you will be amused by some of the \u2018art\u2019 work. Either way the entrance fee is not extortionate and you get some great views from inside the building. Make sure you go out onto the terrace where there are sculptures to",
          "Picasso Museum is worth a visit when in the old town as it is only 6E entry and good to see some original works.",
          "Traveling around the world with 1 bag... they refused my entry and there is no option to store a bag. Train station will not store. They closed at 1 . Wasted day coming all f the way here. My st not be very popular f they can\u2019t handle a bag. Unfriendly too!,",
          "Compared to the Picasso Museum in Paris, this is small. Nonetheless, it is intimate and interesting historically in the development of Picasso's career. There were also some displays of some local artists of note which we enjoyed.",
          "We spent a pleasant hour wandering through this museum. We especially enjoyed the photos of Picasso working.",
          "When you arrive in Antibes from the railway station it seems an unexceptional place, but you need to get down to the old port asap. There you will find the market, the charming narrow streets and the Picasso Museum. Its located in a beautifully restored building, with great",
          "Very nice museum, doesn\u2019t take more than an hour to go through the whole thing. Not completely Picasso paintings, but the other artists are good.",
          "Pleasant small museum on the seafront, with some interesting art. If you were looking for Picasso you will be disappointed, we only saw a few ceramics of his.",
          "This is not a large museum but it is worth a stop. The Picasso pieces are nice and the back deck offers a beautiful view.",
          "this museum does not take long to go around (unless you're a real enthusiast), and there are occasional good views from inside; if you're a Picasso fan then obviously it's a must, but if you're not, or not sure (that's me), it's still very engaging because of the colour and the",
          "The views alone, even if you\u2019re not a big art lover, are worth the admission prices. The ch\u00e2teau was a residence for Bishops in the Middles Ages, and then became the home of the Grimaldis in 1385. Picasso\u2019s was offered the second floor to use as a studio in 1945; he only spent a",
          "very nice collection of Picasso works, mainly from his time in this area, if you are in the area and want to see Picasso works, you should go. Be aware parking is limited in this area and you should study the parking situation before coming. Although you can drop off at the",
          "an intimate museum with a fabulous collection of Picasso's work. Location itself is beautiful. Well worth the visit.",
          "This was a fascinating museum, with not only the work of Picasso but photographs of him as he was creating art within the very building. It was humbling to read about the life and works of other artists, also on display in the museum and how despite adversity they continued to",
          "First a pronouncement....if you visit Nice and don't bother to hop the train to Antibes, you will miss an extremely nice day. We walked to the station, it's 30 minutes there, and 9.2\u20ac pp round trip. We started by walking along the harbor for the view of the boats and the ocean",
          "In a big palace on the see front of antibes, a stop which Picasso lovers cannot miss. The collection of ceramics dishes is really magic",
          "The Picasso Museum in Antibes is located in a beautiful setting along the shore of the Mediterranean. The museum itself, a restored castle-like structure, is also attractive but it doesn\u2019t have much in the way of Picasso\u2019s works. There are many photographs of Picasso as he",
          "Not so rich collection like in Spain, but since it is exhibited in the house in which Picasso spent some of his time, it is well wort seeing both the house and the exhibition of his works. There is a nice gift shop and I would advise buying some replicas as souvenirs.",
          "We are from Australia. Sue very much enjoyed her time at Musee Picasso. He was obviously a very talented man - you will enjoy it here",
          "The museum is a wonderful building with fantastic view of the Mediterranean Sea, do spend some time in the Terrace, especially when it's a beautiful day! The museum collection is rather small, range from the early work of Picasso to his modern works, might be enough for an intro",
          "If you are visiting here to add culture to your life, or to see some Picasso Masterpiece, then you should carry on walking right past the front door - there are some local bars with house wines which have more culture than you will find in this museum and they will stay longer",
          "Sorry folks, but this was a really disappointing experience. I think maybe I visited when there was a special event on, but was sad that there were no Picasso paintings. I guess they are all on loan around the world. The exhibition consisted of room after room of photos of",
          "fabulous setting and the best any picasso lover could ask for, bvery friendly and well kept. Im no art lover but it was very good",
          "Finally got round to visiting this museum 10 years after our first visit to Antibes. There is a handful of impressive paintings by Picasso but the majority of works are drawings and ceramics. Many of the drawings look like preliminary sketches for other works and one gets the",
          "We visited the Musee Picasso in Paris and almost missed this one. We so glad we stopped. There may be easier access through town and parking, but we didn't find it. That was the only downside.",
          "This was a lovely gallery with some interesting paintings/pictures/drawings in it. It was only 3 euros entry as it was the end of the season and not all the areas were open. It also has a fabulous terrace with a stunning view!",
          "If anyone has difficulty with steps, avoid. Main entrance in basement with no lift down. Seating inside low and soft, again creates difficulty getting up for people with mobility issues. There is a rear entrance to the villa for disability by using an intercom to request",
          "The museum shows some works of art from Picasso that were unknown to me before, that being said it does not offer a great insight to the painters life in Antibes nor does it posses a great collection. The views from the place are great.",
          "It is more about life of Picasso, for me ok, but for lover of his painting not so much to see, more of different painters..nice view from the balcony in the first floor. We had trouble with French rivi\u00e9ra pass, only in this city (not in Nice, Monaco, Marineland in Biot) you need",
          "Museum is more about Picasso the man than his paintings. Interesting but underwhelming. Full of photos of Picasso showing some of his interests and places he lived",
          "The bottom couple of floors are mainly photos, all interesting, and some art by contemporaries of Picasso, particularly, Nicolas De Stael, which is very good. However as Picasso said, if you want to see the Picassos of Antibes, you have to come to Antibes, and they are",
          "This is a must if visiting Antibes. Although all tbe artwork on show is not Picasso's work, the range is excellent. The Photo galleries alone are worth a visit.",
          "The Museum is good, but I think Chagall Museum (Nice) is more enjoyable. We spent more time experiencing the town and this was better.",
          "I read a few reviews of the Musee before going and had somewhat lowered my expectations for it. However, I found it fascinating and enjoyable. It focusses on the period of his life from 1946 onwards so doesn't provide a full picture of the man or his art, but what is there",
          "Fort like stone building. Entry is a reasonable 6 euros. Nice terrace with beautiful views to the sea. 3 floors of art work. Most of it is black and white pictures if Picasso. His works area good variety. Worth a visit.",
          "Surprised by this museum. A nice experience to see all these photos of Pablo Picasso. Worth a visit!",
          "I thought I'd see more of the great mans' work but instead saw a lot of rather boring and repetitive black and white photographs with minimal description as to why we were looking at them. A very pretentious general introduction was so impenetrable i nearly gave up at the",
          "As our rental apartment was barely three blocks from this museum, there was no excuse not to go. It is a pleasant way to spend an hour or so in this old originally fortress, later a home that Picasso rented briefly in Antibes. Overlooking the Mediterranean, the building is a",
          "I was an art history student and was happy to learn more about great artists. This museum has a lot of black and white photos of Picasso which help to understand his life. There are more photographs of his life than his work but this make it interesting to understand how he",
          "Lovely museum. Really enjoyed seeing both Picasso's art pieces as well as photos of himself. Was air conditioned. Please note you cannot carry large bags through the museum and you must leave in a cloak room.",
          "Nice destination in Antibes. Enjoyed a walk around the marina on the way and lunch after in the square nearby.",
          "The museum has recently made some changes since our last visit 5 years ago. There was a quaint datedness to the exhibits. They had preserved Picasso's salon. Today the space is designed for a modern exhibition. As well as Picasso's work there was a extensive photography",
          "I left my husband and kids after lunch to go to Musee Picasso alone and I'm glad I did. It features more photography of Picasso than his works, which I really enjoyed but I'm not sure my children would have. It doesn't take all that long to meander through and the price seemed",
          "This is one of 3 Picasso museums I've visited--also Paris & Barcelona. (I think my favorite was the one in Barcelona because it had some very early Picasso works.) This museum had more of his later works. It also had many examples of Picasso ceramics which he created in the",
          "Definitely worth a visit! The museum includes lots of picasso works - paintings, sculptures and ceramics - along with photographs of him throughout his life. There are other artists' works on display which are also very interesting. The museum is situated on top of a hill by the",
          "More photos of the MAN, than works by him...in itself a great experience...particularly good ceramics...other artists very interesting....worth the visit.",
          "Stunning architecture, beautifully situated in Antibes. We visited late afternoon, wasn't very busy so we had a lot of time to ourselves to look carefully at the works. Not many Picasso works however it is a MUST SEE in Antibes. We thouroughly recommend going in the late",
          "In the fortification of Chateau Grimaldi, it is where Picasso worked for the period 1945-48 and produced many of his works involving Faunes, Nymphs, Minotaurs and other mythical characters. The place is teaming with lovely works from the period including many B&W pictures of him",
          "Brilliant. Not just for Picasso but for the Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl paintings. Truly great and breathtaking. The Concert is an incredible work of art. A must do.",
          "Somewhat sparse in its collection of artwork by Picasso himself but it is a beautiful building with stunning views. I also really liked the exhibit of photos of Picasso. For \u20ac6 entry it's definitely worth a visit.",
          "In this museum, you can admire beautiful painting of Picasso in a splendid place, discover the life of the master when he lived in Antibes. Don't hesitate to visit this museum!",
          "Interesting place, I am not a fan of Picasso, but Antibes does a good job displaying his art. Plus some pictures of him and his family. The view from the terrace is very pretty.",
          "This was our second time in the museum, the first one being already in 1999. It was small enough for a family visit, the kids loved it too. Enjoyed the special photograph exhibition about Picasso",
          "Limited collection, but the space is very cool (castle like) and rich with history. Nice place to get out of the sun in Antibes and tickets are appropriately priced for a smaller museum. Worth a stop.",
          "Very interesting insight into Picasso's time in Antibes. Many photos of him and his friends and family was the highlight. Not really that many paintings as they are spread out around the world but some ceramics and sketches as well.",
          "There are many paintings, ceramics but also lots of photos of Picasso in different moments of his French life.",
          "Picasso had a studio for awhile in this building. There are paintings, photos and ceramics of Picasso in the museum.",
          "My favorite part of the museum was the photo gallery, displaying dozens of photos of Picasso taken over the course of his life. They showed a great glimpse into his life. The museum itself was nice to visit, but could have done with a few more signs detailing where to find the",

          "The position of the Mus\u00e9e Picasso is absolutely stunning, such an amazing view. There aren't a lot of paintings by Picasso, but I believe those that are there he painted while using a part of the castle as a workshop, so they are very sea oriented. I love the plate collection as",
          "At a mere \u20ac6 per adult whether you like art or not, you really should spend at least an hour here to admire this Master's work, get to know the man behind so many works that continue to inspire today and take in the amazing views around the museum grounds. It's an absolute",

          "Beautiful museum close to the center, I spent there only a half an hour but I have seen amazing artworks.",
          "Paintings, drawings and sculptures by Picasso plus photos of Picasso's life. All well presented in an old castle by the sea. Plus the inevitable shop!",
          "Beautiful surrendings and interesting to see the Picasso studio. Don't miss a walk outside along the wall and see the sculptures along the museum.",
          "Nice museum, collection of Picasso art is limited however pictures of the artist were very interesting and the museum itself with its history is worth the visit. Entrance fee of 6\u20ac is very reasonable and during our visit at approx noon only a limited number of guests were",
          "A good place to visit with great staff. Picasso is all the top floor and interesting to see and get a better understanding of. The Ceramics and the outside sculptures were the star of the show for me. Look at the other artists though as there are some great pieces here. Also the",

          "3 levels predominately given to a photographic exhibit of Picasso's later life. Would have been better if they had more Picasso paintings in the museum, was only a few paintings actually painted by Picasso",
          "A pleasant Sunday afternoon. We enjoyed the ambience of the museum and the views are amazing from the terrace. Seeing some of Picasso's works and lots of photos was worth the entrance fee. Pleased we went.",
          "There were exhibitions of Picasso's master pieces and other artists works. The most interesting collection was the photograps of Picasso and his family.",
          "Visited this museum with a family of two adults and two children. Nice overview of Picassos work and history. Not expensive.",

          "For only 6 euros you can visit this museum. There are many wonderful photographs of Picasso, whilst working and with his family, there are plenty of paintings and sketches of his and also many other talented artists. Tastefully presented and in a wonderful old building",
          "Firstly may I say that the town of Antibes is very picturesque and we enjoyed our morning there leisurely walking around this quaint town. Okay, what lessons am I referring too: 1. We caught the train from Nice to Antibes, what a challenge as the service staff at he train",
          "If you want to see his most famous works you would be disappointed, but if you want to get an insight into his workings and his life the museum is fascinating. There are many photographs of him at work, many of his ceramic pieces as well as some of his paintings and the",

          "If you are a Picasso fan or not you will love this Musee. Its location over looking the Sea is beautiful and its collection is very good. This is well worth the visit and the walk around it gives you a real feeling of Antibes.",
          "We visited this museum as well as the Picasso Museum in Vallauris (10mn, nearby). Interesting to compare. The Antibes museum in the Grimaldi Castle maybe has more works of Picasso, but very different, I think the two museums are complementary. In Antibes Picasso stayed as an",
          "Ask 10 people what they think about art, especially modern art, and you will get 11 opinions at least. Very enjoyable and manageable exhibit of Picasso and a few other modern artists. Well laid out and not crowded when we attended. Antibes is also a lovely place to visit. The",
          "We read a review by a guy on this website prior to going. The museum didn't appeal to him. That happens in art every day. But, this is Picasso. If you care about fine art, beautiful lines and how environment can affect even one of the best artist's who ever lived, go and",
          "If you want to see Picassos, many Picassos, famous Picassos, big Picassos go to the Picasso museum in Paris or to the MOMA or to any decent museum in the world. On the other hand, if you want a walk by a beautiful sea, visit a lovely building with some interesting works of art",
          "Very disappointing!! Don't expect any well known pieces. It's interesting but would not spend my last ten euro on a visit.",
          "An Amazing place, Art everywhere whether it\u00b4s your taste or not, views out to the sea, a contemplative terrace.",
          "In a charming environment, of the Chateau Grimaldi, we found this museum, dedicated to Picasso and his work. Not a lot of explanation in English, so it is not as enjoyable if you do not speak and read French. A lot of photographs of Picasso, too many in my opinion. But also some",
          "Having some time before checking into our hotel, we walked along the beautiful beach to visit the museum. Nice collection of artwork, big and small, including pottery. Especially enjoyed the photography exhibit, providing an excellent perspective on the man- Picasso's personal",
          "Recently visited the Picasso museum following perusing the boats in the harbour. I am not an art expert or even really an art lover but found this museum really interesting. It portrays photographs of Picasso's work, home life and dogs. The images really capture his essence,",
          "It's only small collection and not a full representation of all Picasso's work. Nice building and excellent views but not good value.",
          "This is not a large museum, but for those who know and appreciate Picasso, come here to enjoy learning more about his great artists time on the French Riviera. This museum provides an informal setting for showcasing some of his work, some by those close to him and is in a",
          "It's not the largest museum, but then it's not too expensive either. The photo exhibit was much more interesting than I was expecting.",
          "This museum is placed in a very nice building with great surroundings. But, the museum itself, well - the Picasso part is on the top and from I can understand from those who have been to the Picasso museum in Barcelona , go there if you can and skip this one. For me, it didn't",
          "Beautiful location and very well presented. Don't miss it and is very reasonably priced . Children only 3 euros! It is a must if you are in Antibes !",
          "So good to see an old building (old Grimaldi castle, still some coats of arms over doorways) taken care of, and beautifully restored. Most of the artwork on display, the day I was there, was from the few months Picasso was living in the castle in 1946. Really like some of the",
          "Of course you see Picasso and you expecting nice picasso paintings, they are there but of course only the second or third level pieces. I would not go there again for 6 euro, but if there are real Picasso fans it is the place to be.",
          "We were amazed to be charged just 3 euros to view such a fine collection. You work your way up the floors viewing art works from other modern artists until you reach the highlights produced by the great man himself. Many are enormous. The display of his ceramics is outstanding.",
          "This museum has lots of art of Picasso; paintings, drawings, sculpture and even plates he painted. Chateau Grimaldi, where Picasso lived for a short period and which houses the museum, itself is beautiful, but what thrilled me most was the human side of this famous person",
          "It is not only Picasso that you see there. Pierre Soulages, Hans Hartung and Anna Eva Bergman, Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl and some more. It is a very good museum that is not too big (just perfect!) so that you can just wander through the nice castle and rest as long as you want. They",
          "Although this museum contains only a relatively small collection of Picasso's art, the core of which is composed of works Picasso produced during a six-month period when he lived at the Chateau Grimaldi, it is worth visiting while in Antibes. One of the most interesting exhibits",
          "As a casual art fan, this wasn't my cup of tea. Not too many paintings spoke to me - although his \"Joie de Vivre\" was enchanting. The location, however, was fantastic. Right on the seawall.",
          "This museum has a fantastic sitting overlooking the harbor in our team, a beautiful outdoor garden with some sculptures and an amazing building. We just did not feel that they were enough Picassos in the exhibit, it seemed that Only about one fourth of the paintings and",
          "This is a must do when visiting here. Start at the top floor and work down. The top floor features hundreds of Picasso works, that can only be called unusual. They feature works on board, pencils and crayon on paper as well as ceramics. The other artists on exhibit are also",
          "Fabulous building and a real insight into how Picasso worked but not many of his pieces. Enjoyable nonetheless. Price should have been \u20ac6 each but due to this odd rule, it was free! I would have been happy to pay it though.",
          "Wonderful small museum with quite a few Picasso paintings and most interesting pottery works. Nicely organized and good for no more than an hour when visiting the charming town of Antibes.",
          "It's nice to visit this place but don't expect lots of famous Picasso paintings. Still interesting collection. There are other painters such as Nicolas De Stael. There is a beautiful view in the sea from the balcony. The place is equipped for the wheel chair.",
          "Good museum, bit a hike to get to. Ticket cost is about 6 euros. It's show small amount of Picasso works and gives interesting background on the way Picasso painted.",
          "The Musee Picasso is as important for the building, formerly the Ch\u00e2teau Grimaldi. Picasso lived and painted here six months and a number of his works rest here, including the Goat and Joie de Vivre.",
          "Picasso only stayed here a few months, and there few actual Picasso works on show, and they don't really add to the legend. The photographs are interesting enough, as are the other artist works on display, and the museum is worth a visit if you are already in Antibes and you are",
          "I had just visited this randomly which had entry fee of 6\u20ac each.. dint find it worth since we were not fond of Picasso.. but the location and the way they hav made is good.. nice walk to the museum the u can roam around to other cool places around",
          "I'm not a big Picasso fan, but found the home pleasing to walk through. Probably a home run if you care about Picasso, but I found the works on display a bit dull and uninspired.",
          "I visited the museum yesterday. It is in an interesting old building on the water where Picasso painted many of the works in the museum. While I don't always fully appreciate Picasso, this is a good place to see his art in a place he painted with beautiful views of the water.",
          "This was rather intriguing to see where Picasso worked and lived and to see such a collection of his work.",
          "The collection is housed right on the sea front in a beautiful small castle. The first floors are taken up with artists whose works are reminiscent of Picasso, only the top floor has work from the man himself. There are paintings, sketches and sculpture. But most interesting to",
          "Visiting the Picasso Musee was the highlight of a wonderful day in Antibes! We were lucky to have a glorious October day, which does add to the experience since there is a beautiful terrace where you can stand and enjoy the magnificent view of sea and mountains! The building",

          "A lot of the art work is in the style of Picasso, but not actually by Picasso, which confused us at first, though there were many original pieces on display. It was educational for my children, but we all walked away wondering how on earth Picasso became famous, as much of the",
          "Great setting for a Picasso Museum. There are a few lovely Picassos, especially like the outdoor sculptures.",
          "Great value at only 6Euro but, like the majority of visitors, we made straight for the top floor, where they keep their Picasso exhibits. It's mostly stuff from the aertists time spent in Antibes just after the Second World War but it's great to see that part of his life and the",
          "Some interesting Picasso art- even some spectacular pieces - from his months working in Antibes in 1946. Other artists presented cannot compare. Recommended.",
          "This is a well done, small museum of Picasso's work, both while he lived here and smatterings of other periods. The museum is well done, but the star is the castle that houses the museum. The views across the harbor, the architectural details, and the remaining remnants of",
          "The museum is in Antibes Old Town and boasts magnificent views of the Mediterranean from every window. I visited Musee Picasso at the Chateau Grimaldi on Sunday afternoon and had the 2nd floor which is dedicated to Picasso to myself. Lots of drawings and two rooms filled with",
          "The Picasso museum in Antibes is a must see. While not the most extensive collection of Picasso art it reflects a time in the artist life of development and evolution. The story is quite intriguing. They also have modern art from a few contemporaries. The building is beautiful.",
          "This was certainly worthwhile retracing our steps to get to the museum. Great exhibition of his works and to be able to get a feel for the area and his home where he worked from. Make time to visit there.",
          "Musee Picasso is at the Chateau Grimaldi in Vieux Antibes, the old part of Antibes. Spectacular museum - the setting is beyond compare, and the collection is excellent. Wonderful to wander around where Picasso lived and painted. No wonder he was so happy here. Sublime views.",

          "I'm no art expert however this was worth the visit not on,y to see the paintings but to throw some light on Picasso himself. Great views from the outer terrace.",
          "Worth seeing because Picasso worked here and Antibes is still a lovely place to spend time in. But the Picasso works on display (2nd floor) were made shortly after the Second World War so materials were scarce and his colour palette sober. (Interesting to see him using",
          "Worth seeing this lovely building that Picasso lived in during his years in Antibes it now houses some of his collection. Beautiful view out to the sea",
          "Located in the centre of town, with an amazing view of the ocean, there's a lot to see besides the interesting pieces by Picasso.",
          "This museum holds a number of works by Picasso which are quite amazing. The museum is located in the centre of the city and has some spectacular views of the ocean. It does get packed so if you can, buy your tickets beforehand if you don't want to spend time queuing in the heat.",
          "The museum itself is not worth going out of your way for..but just the city is worth visiting for a few hours... great scenic views and quaint little streets to stroll anout",
          "My reactions to works of Picasso were changed dramatically as a result of visiting this museum in Antibes. His progression of work from earlier times to later works was exciting. I had not seen his early work and it was engaging. Simpler drawings & sketches gave dimension to",
          "A must if you go to Antibes. Loved the views from the terrace and great for photo taking. There are many works by other arts in the museum so start at the top floor if you want to get to the Picasso works. Loved learning about his life and lovers.",
          "The museum is very interesting and has an amazing view! After a visit you can take a walk around and enjoy this lovely city! I felt in love with Antibes!!",
          "We came to this museum as big admirers of Picasso's work, filled with hesitation to see what has he produced during his stay in Provence, We were surprised to see, that this museum holds not too many works of Picasso, most created in several months during hist stay at the",
          "Beautiful tribute to the life and works of Picasso...... Only realised we weren't allowed to take pictures after I'd taken loads !!!........interesting to hear from the video playing that each picture had hidden messages with symbolic represensation ...made it easier to start",
          "It was good to see. I mean, where else will you see so many of Pablo's works in one place? There were no audio guides so there was little context for the art we were viewing. The staff was put out. I left feeling a bit underwhelmed. I love art history and was disappointed",
          "I have to admit although a fan of Art I am far from a fan of Picasso I think he is awful, BUT my girlfriend wanted to go and look round and because my family have had a place in Antibes for 20 years. So we went along and I have to say and my girlfriend agreed it was full of",

          "Picasso spent a few months here, using it as a studio, so the town, with some help from a few donors, made it into a museum. No major pieces and the work that is there is just OK. About the best work is the series of ceramic platters that Picasso did in Vallauris, and the",
          "Amazing location right at cliffs edge, beautiful restored old building. Perfect lighting. Had small groupings of various contemporary French artists to fill out both the space and limited Picasso pieces. Much of Picasso related were sketches and photos. He was near Vallaruis",
          "I found this museum by chance while i was walking around the Antibes town centre. The museum is located on top of hill so it has nice views. Some of paintings are Piccaso's but some of them are other painters'. If you like arts and paintings, worthwhile to visit. The enterance",
          "Not as much about Picasso as you'd think but there were a lot of other nice pieces. The views of the sea are great - overlooks the bay towards the Cap D'Antibes.",
          "Nice , but small museum. Besides the works of Picasso there are things other contemporary artists . Inside is forbidden to take photographs .",
          "This museum is nice to visit when walking through the town. Picasso lived in Antibes and worked from this castle (that was previously owned by the Grimaldi's). We parked the car in the harbour, whoch is only a 5 minute walk",
          "The location is amazing, as if all of a sudden you realize another world. The collection is also very interesting.",
          "hadn't read up on what i was about to see here and was blown away - a fine selection of Picasso art - and many pieces new to me - have been to Picasso Museum in Cerat and seen all his ceramics - or so i though, so many here too - a great room of photos of the man at work too -",
          "Very little Picasso, with two floors of other Antibes resident artists. Cool and spacious, but when another visitor used a camera, honestly the room security man shouted \" I told you once, so I have to tell you in Japanese and Chinese as well, no photographs\" which embarrassed",
          "Beautiful building, well adapted as a gallery. Rooms add to experience . Staff were lovely apart from the unfriendly man at reception.",

          "Weather made this visit a potential winner for the afternoon, however for the location and building the exhibits were not truly amazing. But learnt a bit and broadened the mind a little so no bad thing, not to busy as appears August stampede has calmed down, but not going have",
          "Good selection of interesting pieces of art. Well laid out and easy to access. Very pleasant to wander around in the cool air when it is scorching outside.",
          "The museum building is very atmospheric, situated on the sea front, and a perfect setting for the art work displayed. We visited with our 14year old daughter and all enjoyed the experience.",
          "Not a bad thing to say about this museum. Stunning artwork of course and in a very special site in the charming old town of Antibes. The outside space overlooking the sea is breathtaking. Bronzes punctuate the wall above the sea. Worth a detour.",
          "Small museum, but still good. We went on a Wednesday evening when it was open late (NB trip advisor has the late nights wrong - it's Wednesday and Friday). Great views from the terrace.",
          "Magnificent pictures of the man at work and the most beautiful panorama of Antibes seaside Insights of the master of contemporary art",
          "The museum sits over looking the Mediterranean coast in a stunning location. The building it's self has been kept to a very high standard and is air conditioned. There were several artist displaying their work in the museum and not just work done by Picasso when he was in",
          "Set in what was Castle Grimaldi, the museum offers work by a selection of artists as well as a range of work by Picasso and an insight into his life and inspiration. The setting is superb, an impressive building looking out onto the sea with amazing views from many windows.",
          "I had read mixed reviews on here but decided to see for myself.we visited on a Saturday afternoon.It was busy and we had to wait 20 mins in blaring heat to get in.there was no shade.when we did get in the ground floor and top floors were closed. I thought it was a really",
          "It has a break at lunch. And is closing at 6. For the rest of it is a great museum. From the outdoord to everithing inside",
          "This museum could not be better located. The collection is housed in an extraordinary castle in the center of Antibes with gorgeous views over the bay. But the collection is only from the period that Picasso worked in the area, so it is a limited range of his work and is not",
          "The works of one of the world\u2019s greatest artists deserve a beautiful setting and the architecture of the Picasso Museum certainly lives up to this ideal. Upon entering the museum, you will notice crisp white walls that give brightness and that serve to highlight Picasso\u2019s",
          "Not the biggest museeum, but just about the right size you want to visit during the heat in summer Antibes. Intresting, and also works by other artist. Realy worth a visit if you are in the erea.",
          "There are some interesting works of art inside this museum. It's very casual and a nice walk through if you are nearby. Quite the juxtaposition of modern art in a relatively ancient building. The market is nearby and therefore it's a convenient visit.",
          "A must when you visit Antibes. Fun and wonderful exibition. Helpful and friendly staff, who speak english.",
          "Not even a third of the art is Picasso's. I do not understand the concept of this collection. Its just a meqgre collection in a phantastic building. All in all it has been a great experience. Less because of Picasso, but because of the rest.",
          "Picasso's works has been in the museums all over the world but this place emphasis' his other collections, drawings and mostly sketches. Nice location of the building.",
          "interesting collection and one which is on original mural done on the wall directly . It is fascinating to see the different style of art the Picasso painted over the years. The terrace is garnished of art from various sculptors and one is by Miro .",
          "For us the best part was the excellent account on video (with English subtitles) on the first floor of the Picasso Museum of David Douglas Duncan the photographer who spent time in the late 1950s photographing Picasso and Jacqueline. We often go to museums and art galleries",

          "Visited with husband and who uses a wheelchair, entered lift up to exhibition it didn't work and left us trapped inside in 35 degree heat. We shouted no one heard us luckily a couple of fellow visitors found us and and phoned for help. We were freed without an apology. When we",
          "Great location. The exibits are not his most popular works, but still very nice tour. It is nice for a couple of hors activity away from the beach.",
          "A nice museum in a beautiful setting, a little smaller than I expected. Nonetheless real character to the building and in a stunning location. Worth a couple of hours out of the sun.",
          "We stayed here for about one hour and it was enough. Their wasn't so many paintings that Picasso had made and overall it was kinda small. Great view from the balcony though!",
          "As there is not that much things to do in Antibes this is a good choice to spend some time and understand picasso. Very nicely organised museum with full of amazing pieces of art..",
          "Very interesting place to visit, and lots of art to see. The only downside is that they are very anti photography so if you want memento of your visit you will have to buy from the gift shop.",
          "A great insight into Picasso's life in the south of France, in a very special building overlooking the walled city and the sea",
          "well worth it to get an insight into an amazing artist. A must do when in Antibes. So easy to get to and housed in a beautifully restored building. Dont miss it! ",
          "Im not sure I'd go just for this museum but Antibes is a lovely town and we went there on market day so seeing the museum a bonus. You can see it in an hour and while collection not vast, its still enjoyable and you see things Picasso created beyond just paintings. As noted, its",
          "The muse Picasso , is located in old Antibes , it was an enjoyable visit , this place could be better if they maintain it in a better way",
          "I'm not an art guy, but this held my interest for the 1.5 hours we walked around. Building is cool, views are great, and it's always fun to learn a bit of art history. Antibes was one of my fav stops in this region.",
          "This place will be a disappointment if you are a Picasso fan, as there are only a view average pieces on display with the biggest collection being in Paris, but the views of the Mediterranean are sublime and the Grimaldi palace is architecturally very interesting. Worth a visit",
          "Yes this museum is small, but the building and view itself is worth the stop. Art is very accessible and docents are helpful. The sculptures on the property are inspiring. For the price of a beer this is a real bargain!",
          "My friend and I popped in here before going to the beach and while there were a handful of pieces that we loved, there's a lot of dross in here. It's only 6\u20ac, so worth visiting if you're at a loose end, but I wouldn't call it unmissable.",
          "Not being a Picasso fan I can't really comment with any great authority. It's a quaint museum built into the old castle. There are some non-Picasso visiting exhibitions as well as a few originals and some scribbles from the man himself. I was more impressed with the visiting",
          "Art from both the man himself and some of his disiples. 6\u20ac entrance fee. A bit boring. Some of his work was presented as development on several scetches. That was interesting.",
          "Half price admission for students (\u20ac4 I think). There is a large permanent collection of the work Picasso did in Antibes. It's not his most famous work and I wasn't a huge fan. Lots of plates with smiley faces on them, fishes drawn with crayon, etc. Very \"playful\", but it really",
          "A must to visit, located in the heart of Vieille Antibes, visit in the morning to be able to enjoy the church, the local fruit and vegetable market and mingle in the narrow streets of the old town. An excellent fromagier just in the narrow street perpendicular to the market",
          "Sadly, a lot of the work was out of bounds due to the redecoration of the chateau, but to be fair we were only charged half price entry. The work was mainly from post war to 1946 (where he lived in the chateau for 6 months) slightly later than my interests but was still very",
          "To see Picasso's work in the location where it was painted and with picrures of him at work puts the particular works in context. A rarity. Definitely not to be missed when visiting Antibes. The sculptures were also interesting both inside and outside the museum.",
          "Some great paintings from one period of Picasso's life , well worth seeing along with his ceramics. Resonable collection of some extra artwork as well.",
          "I was not very happy with this museum. The first floor houses the museum shops. The second floor houses an changing exhibit of another artist. The top floor houses the Picasso works which is two rooms. The first room is a series of dozens of pottery plates and a one big Picasso",
          "This museum features two other artists in addition to Picasso. There are two walls of platters which are very interesting. Lots of sketches and photos chronicalling his work but not as many major pieces as I expected to see.",
          "A nice walk through a well curated museum housing some nice art work and a wall of ceramic plates by the master. The balcony has nice views of the bay in Antibes.",
          "Wondering through the quaint town, strolling along the marina and back up the hill on top of the sea wall you can't miss the on this list of things to do in Antibes, the Picasso museum. Not the most impressive collection but the building itself and the views from the terrace",
          "We walked up the hill to the entrance and joined the line just before the lunch closure was finishing. Maybe 20 people in front of us. The cost is downright cheap, and was worth every penny. Obviously was great to see so much by Picasso in such an intimate setting, but the",
          "The Chateau Grimaldi is built upon the foundations of the ancient Greek town of Antipolis. In 1608 it became a stronghold of the Grimaldi family. In 1946 for 6 months it became the home of Picasso, Picasso donated some of his works to the museum notably his painting \"The Goat\"",
          "This place has so much potential but it is unrealised. Picasso actually lived in Antibes but there is no real background given to his life here and the Picasso works on show were disappointing.",
          "Picasso collection quite small but included showcases of his atellier. The first three floors were dedicated to a visiting colection of works by Pierre Salouge - odd to my taste. Painted with a paint brush - huge slashes of black and brown on canvas - very monotonous.",
          "The grounds of the museum are pretty cool and it has a nice view of the harbour outside. There are three \"small\" floors to the museum. Truthfully the other two floors, other than the Picasso floor, are underwhelming. But the Picasso floor (the third floor), is really cool. I",
          "I am not a Picasso lover, at least not at this stage of his art. He went to Antibes with his 25 year old mistress who was pregnant with his child. He was 65. This was really irrelevant to the quality of his art work. It appears to be very childlike, and almost unfinished in",
          "My wife loved the museum. Let's say I loved the location of the museum over looking the water the best. Unfortunately there weren't headsets that might have given some insight into the painting. Situated just outside the old town , there in public parking available underground",
          "Not exactly an art lover myself, I went with very low expectations to a gallery of an artist known for being pretty rubbish at art! I kind of saw what I expected. For \u20ac6 each we walked around in wonderment at the child-like paintings by Picasso and some other cubist painters.",
          "There is a good collection of Picasso's work here; there is also for from other artists too. The views from the terrace are stunning and there is more art outside. It was great to make the acquaintance of Picasscat who obviously lives there too! Good bookshop, clean bathrooms,",
          "We visited the museum shortly after we had arrived as it was only a couple of doors down from where we are staying. If you are a serious Picasso fan, then this may be enjoyable.. Picasso was prolific and we both felt that this museum effectively had some of the dregs of his",
          "Very fine exhibition of one of Picassos fruitful periods . he lived there for many years and donated a lot of his paintings / drawings and sculptures . to top it off the Museum is situated in an interesting castle at the sea with tremendous fews",
          "Mus\u00e9e Grimaldi is, first of all, an increbile place, ancient and imponent, it certainly has a great atmosphere. The museum itself is pretty cool, lots of works by one of the world's greatest. Prices are very reasonable, and the view from the balcony is astonishing. Totally worth",
          "Fantastic building, setting and art! Great price too at only 6 euros pp. would visit again and recommend, well worth a visit.",
          "This museum is set up on a cliffside with the most breathtaking views. Then you go into the museum and the building is gorgeous. The Picasso works themselves are limited and more from his early works. I loved it but it is not the place to see typical Picasso.",
          "This museum is worth visiting for it's beautiful garden and setting as much as the excellent collection of Picasso's ceramics and lesser number of drawings and paintings.",
          "They exhibition every scrap of Picasso they could find, but none of it is a highlight. Poor explanations. Expensive for what you get. Not much to see. Photographs are not allowed.",
          "My daughters and myself were looking forward to this. Lighting and display of the photography was poor. Too difficult to see. The collection is not exciting to me. The building is more interesting. Beautiful and on the water in ancient Antibes. It was a stones throw from where",
          "This museum is as impressive for the artwork inside, as the views of the Mediterranean Sea from the outside. The castle is amazing to look at inside and out. It is interesting to see the sketches of Picasso and his lesser known works. And you can do it all in less than 1 hour.",
          "this is such a lovely place, really clean, nicely done in a nice architectural building. the collection in the museum is amazing",
          "The Picasso museum is a lovely little museum. It does not take long at all to go through it, and if you are walking around in Antibes- it is definitely worth a visit! The walk around the museum is also beautiful and a true must when in the gem that is Antibes. A true beauty spot.",
          "Wonderful little museum with a very nice collection worth visiting. Beautiful setting. Has a permanent collection as well as traveling exhibits of other artists.",
          "First, Antibes is a gem of a sea side village, a break from the hustle and bustle of Nice. A short ride via train, an easy stroll to the port, a beautiful walk along the coast to the museum, and you are there. Of particular note is Picasso's \"Joie de Vivre\", but equally",
          "My husband and I are admirers of the great Spanish artist Pablo Picasso and never lose an opportunity to see his artworks. This museum has an interesting peculiarity: its focus is on artworks Picasso produced during the period he lived in Antibes and used this superb setting",
          "First of all I must say that the staff were universally pleasant! We visited at 5pm. There was a sign clearly stating that they could not accept cards for payments of 6\u20ac. The place was quite busy and everyone seemed happy. Different staff? Staff had training? Whatever the",
          "If you don't have much time, start at the top floor - that's where the Picassos are. We enjoyed this - there were pictures of sealife, his little owl, sea urchin. There was also a room of dozens of plates that Picasso painted. Limited collection, but different than other",
          "This was a great little find in Antibes.A few euros to enter and something to admire from everyone .A great guitar display and great views of the beautiful coast",
          "Not just Picasso. The building was interesting but other artists featured were not so nice. A lot of the Picasso collection was sketches so don't go expecting loads of famous paintings. He was actually only there for two months inn1946.",
          "Well, the museum does not offer the best paintings of Pablo Picasso, even he lived here. There is only one popular painting, and the others are sketches and photos od Pablo. But anyway, for the good view, you can enjoy everything.",
          "Imagine an antique fortress nested in the old village of Antibes. Take the access ramp, and enter the intimate Mus\u00e9e Picasso. It offers that perfect mix of historic beauty with modern art, the one resonating, echoing and enhancing the other. Because the city and the area have so",
          "The only thing who makes this museum interesting is their views. Sometimes is hard to understand why public money goes to unrelevant museums, wasting money and wasting time.",
          "In spite of some Picasso works ,the exhibition of Nicolas de St\u00e4el was closed and of course they did not inform you previously nor by internet (there is not website of the museum) nor in the entrance. very unpleasant receptionist attending the people who want to visit the",
          "I have been to about 10 different Picasso museums in many countries and this one is pretty average but for \u20ac6, this one is very reasonably priced. Good selection of paintings and some photographs by the artist as well. There are other artist displays but they are more",
          "Pouring with rain, had to que outside getting wet. Only one man serving. Lots of school children walking around. One gentleman working there was very informative and knowledgable .",
          "Worth a visit if you're a Picasso fan - but quite small. Many of the famous Picassos seem to be in London or New York but there are some interesting pieces here and some fabulous black and white photographs. Reasonable value at \u20ac6 - really great building with good views.",
          "The museum is within a beautifully renovated chateau. There are many interesting Picasso pieces plus works from some other more modern painters. Unfortunately the room with Picasso plates was closed for renovations. The outside terrace is a highlight given the view and",
          "This review should be taken with a grain of salt, because we confess immediately to not being big Picasso fans! But we like to take the opportunities we are given to broaden our horizons and perhaps learn a new appreciation forsuch a famous artist. Indeed my husband and I each",
          "Interesting display of his works plus commentary and photographs of his life in Antibez. Several other artists were represented too. It kept us busy for about an hour which would have been longer had it been sunny when we would have lingered on the wonderful terrace. A pleasing",
          "There are not a lot of \"cultural things\" to do in Antibes and it's one of them. I don't think it's worth coming solely for that as it's quite a small museum but if you happen to be around, you should pay a visit (and walk around the old town). When we visited they were updating",
          "This museum sits in the Grimaldi castle in the old town of Antibes. It is a wonderful location and well worth the visit if you are coming to the old town. However if you are coming solely to see the museum I would not recommend it as it has a limited number of paintings overall",
          "Loved our morning here, perfect intro in to Picasso time in Antibes. Beautiful gift shop and terrace... Maybe a cafe would finish of the experience",
          "The new Picasso museum deserves to be visited. Nice building, from the ground up to the third floor where the woodwork can be seen. Art collection well enhanced. Two hours there, time has flown... We strongly recommend the visit.",
          "Would highly recommend this museum. Many works and changing displays. Affordable entry charges for young and old. Expand your mind a little in a beautiful building.",
          "The building and the balcony were my favorite parts of the museum. They are beautifully located on the coast and the terrace has some fantastic sculptures. In the winter, the museum is free as the 2nd floor is closed. Half of the museum was not Picasso paintings (but still",
          "A great way to learn about the progression of Picasso's art and that of one of his contemporaries. It piqued my interest to learn more. The museum is in the former Grimaldi castle, right on the oceanfront in Le Vieux Antibes. I would have like to take some photographs (without",
          "The museum is in the delightful old town of Antibes with a wonderful setting overlooking the sea.The grounds have a selection of interesting sculptures,including a Miro.There was an exhibition of paintings by Le Corbusier which made an interesting contrast to the",
          "I love this museum because I love the works of Picasso. The place is small enough to see his works in details and to spend few hours doing so. I also love the view from its terrace.",
          "We visited the French Riviera in Dec 2015 along with my family and spent a good portion of the day at Antibes - As part of Antibes, the Picasso museum was well worth the time. We started the walk around Anitbes and visited many sites including the Picasso museum. The Museum",
          "This is now my favorite of all art museums, nudging the Getty Malibu. It is a small collection, easy to see in a few hours. Admission is cheap. We visited in January, arriving just as they opened. Almost no crowd at all save a group of school kids",
          "Musee picasso is difrent from others museum. Afer new stasr is worth to visit. Buy some things in a shop. Don t miss a good choice of book about painters.",
          "Building amazing as are views. Collection is mostly work done while staying nearby, so not so exciting as other museums with his collections. Was not a first rate collection of Picassos.",
          "Apparently the most significant artist of last century, a visit to this museum will allow you to draw your own informed conclusions. Stuffed with Picasso and his contemporaries, the opportunity to confirm a bias can never be more opportune. Whether your taste supports the",
          "Although no photography is permitted inside the museum, this is a rare gem right on the Mediterranean. The extensive collection comprises paintings, sculpture, platters, freeform objects, drawings etc. - yes, all Pablo Picasso. It is a family friendly, two or three story",
          "Great find. Lots of paintings, pictures and drawings of Corbusier and Picasso. You can see the genius from beginning to finished product.",
          "This was the first time I had the opportunity to see Picasso's work. It was quite fascinating to see the places where he worked and created his art. The museum is quite small but you will easily spend there one hour or even more if you spend a bit more time focusing on the works",
          "I have visited many museums on 3 continents, but none of them carry the characters of this museum. Picaso himself worked not so far away from the place it is now the museum and one can actually visit his work area as well. I am not a big fan of Picaso or modern art for that",
          "Nice and small museum. You'll be in and out within an hour, but still worth it. The combination with the Le Corbusier drawings was awesome! Couple of noteworthy paintings and a bit of ceramics. The location is spectacular and the views are stunning. Loved to have visited this",
          "This museum offers the experience of seeing exclusive work by the Master, but also the incredible and unique location by the sea. On the balcony, you may see the sea and relax, and appreciate for a moment, what Picasso himself could feel while creating. The architecture is",
          "If it was good enough for Picasso to live in in 1946, rest assured that this wonderful castle contributes to why you must go to Antibes. Apparently, his rediscovery of colors after the nightmare darkness of WWII was aided by being in this lovely setting. The sculptures and",
          "Picasso's art covered so much for so many years that each museum has it's own story to tell and it's own way of showing his art and connection to the place. The story of his residence here after the war and what he donated is extremely interesting. if you have a chance go and",
          "We stayed in Antibes for two weeks this summer in the old town, just some hundred meter from this great museum. It is worth visiting. Picasso lived here for some important years of his life. You get the story here. And at beautiful sight of the town and the sea.",
          "My husband and I visited Antibes and the Musee Picasso on a gorgeous sunny September day. The setting, in a old castle on a hill overlooking the Mediterranean, was jaw-dropping gorgeous. We especially enjoyed the outdoor sculpture garden overlooking the sea (a number of",
          "Facing the ocean, we got unmatched ocean view from this museum, and there are some art works by Picasso in the backyard facing the ocean, it is beautiful!",
          "Personally I consider Picasso to be one of the most successful con artists of the 20th, or any other century, feeling that most of his stuff could have been done by our cat. However my wife wanted to go and, fortunately, the admission was free on the day we went. If you like",
          "Got taken here as a child and have been back a few times. One of the best Picasso museums in a stunning location with beautiful outdoor area and some of the best views. I must see, but don,t go on a Monday!",
          "great museum great view, great \u00e9poque of the arts, will go each year again and again, just difficult to reach by car and to park, otherwise a jewel",
          "Dropped in at this museum on my way back from Cannes to Nice. The museum has many exhibits of Picasso's works-his pictures taken in his atatelier after 1946, paintings, drowings, pottery he painted. From the exhibits, I could feel how he loved this small seaside town and his",
          "The Picasso Museum is not just a museum showcasing Picassos work, but it is a museum that explains Picasso's story through the eyes of a photographer. Very worthwhile! It is located in a beautiful section of Antibe, right on the Mediteranean. The museum contains Picassos",
          "The Picasso museum was a good stop on a rainy day, but the collection is limited in scope and quality. On the other hand, the fee is low, so I guess this is a case of you get what you pay for!",
          "What a treat to see so many different mediums that Picasso used. Seeing paintings on such a large scale and the amount of pottery on display is worth every minute spent in this remarkable museum. Make sure to find your way to the outdoor garden area. Beautiful views from there.",
          "Housed in the old Grimaldi Castle, this museum offers a collection of work during a period when Picasso had escaped the war years in Paris with its grim, iron-grey-German-uniform colour into a burgeoning polychrome that reaches its apogee in ceramics and the joyous dance in \"La",
          "We were staying near this museum in Antibes so naturally we heard about it and had to go. We first visited the museum on a rainy Monday however when we got there we found a sign saying it was open everyday except Monday, this was our fault for not researching it more. At the",
          "Excellent collection of Picasso's work housed in an interesting building with terrific views out to sea. Close to the centre of Antibes so can be combined with a visit to the market or old town, or an amble amongst the expensive yachts moored in the nearby marina.",
          "I did not venture in to the museum so cannot comment on this. However, the buildings themselves are wonderful and make great photos",
          "If you visit the old town of Antibes and you like Picasso, do not miss this small Museum. Most of the works are from a short period in 1946. The building itself is very impressive and the sights of the sea are very beautiful.",
          "Free at festival weekends. Shut for lunch so time your visit and busy at afternoon opening time (2pm) so may be better to visit a bit later. Well organised museum with many photos of Picasso plus various art works.",
          "As per title, I went back 3 times, every time finding something more to see, a new piece, a new exhibition. Though Picasso is not my favorite painter, I still appreciate his creativity and the museum portrays it really well in this wonderful building in the heart of old Antibes.",
          "The museum is dedicated to the master, his muse Jacqueline, and their life together. Besides Picasso paintings, I was surprised to see the amazing handmade and painted ceramics in all its beauty and variety. Note that the museum has a siesta break between 12 PM and 2 PM.",
          "A remarkable find! This museum was, for me, so inspiring. The setting is incredible and the opportunity to see art of this nature is life-changing.",
          "The Picasso Museum sits in what once was Chateau Grimaldi. The Grimaldi family, the Monaco bloodline, lived in this medieval castle until the revolution. Picasso lived here six months in 1946 and got a museum out of the deal! His creativity was intensely energetic during",
          "Located in a rather ordinary looking building, this museum is purely a showcase of Picasso's works. Some of the works were lovely but some left me wondering how in the world some people could rank him as great. Some of his art were obviously juvenile - so \"simplistic\" that",
          "Beautiful building where Picasso had his studio, and is now a showplace for many photos & collected works. Amazing view out the window of the sea.",
          "A beautiful Musee in a wonderful setting in the heart of Antibes old town. A disappointing selection of Picasso's work on show at the moment, some must be on loan since I've been here before and seen more, I especially remember there being many more of his ceramics. Interesting",
          "It is worth visiting the museum just for the building and the view from the terrace. The exhibition itself is very interesting and it gives a nice perspective of Picasso's work whilst he was living in Antibes",
          "if you like \"art\" to just like art it will be great i suppose . visited the museum and found it boring . a 7 year ol could have done the drawings . total waste of time .",
          "A must see the Musee Picasso - But be ware its shut _ yes I know its was 2015 when we visited - Its shut for lunch!! On the day we went it was a friday it was late opening but its certainly worth the visit - as it represents so much of the French way of life. On our visit there",
          "Impressive building, nice views from terrace, but for the rest a total disappointment. Only one floor of the two with Picasso works, unchanged for years. No use of modern multimedia. And why is it forbidden to take pictures (no flash of course)? Even 16th century paintings of",
          "It was great to see the exhibition in the place where Picasso created his finest works. Unfortunately most of the information cards next to his works are of small print but with English translation.",
          "This is a small and beautifully located museum on the rocks overlooking the Med where Picasso once summered. The collection is small but very impressive. I had visited here many years ago and had fond memories and my return did not disappoint. For Picasso lovers, this is a",
          "Even if you are not a big fan of Picasso this museum is such a great value as the building itself is magnificent standing on a hillside by beautiful Cote d'azur. Not the biggest collection but paintings and ceramics are powerful, whimsical and so Picasso.",
          "The Picasso Museum is a great place to see a great many of the artists lesser know pictures. The museum contains many of his sketches and pottery items, which do not appear in other exhibitions. Well with a visit, when you are in Antibes.",
          "A great small museum in the grimaldi fort . Pictures and ceramics works of Picasso made here in 1946 . Only 3 euros for seniors , great view overlooking the see . Don't miss !",
          "I'm not a huge Picasso fan, but I'm glad I went. There were some spectacular paintings that I'm glad I had the opportunity to see. The photographs of Picasso were also quite insightful into his life. Then there were some drawings which appeared to be made with pencil or black",
          "We went and we saw. But I cannot say I understood any of it. I was happy to have gone, however, as I have a better understanding of this master. There are a lot of his sketches and other works, as well as a lot of pictures of the man (what the pictures had to do with his",
          "A beautiful castle with amazing view has inspired Picasso to paint some of his paintings there. You can also see photos of him and be well enough information about his stay in Antibes.",
          "It's rather small and so felt a bit overpriced given that there's not that many Picasso's works there. Still a good place to visit. Nice views from the veranda.",
          "I've been visiting the Musee Picasso and I really liked it. I've seen work done by lots of very good artists as well as the some of the master pieces of Picasso. It's like be a part of the history when you go there. really recommend",
          "Definitely worth visiting if you're in the area and are into art but not worth a special trip. Picasso lived here for a while and the upper floor has some of his work but most interesting is an exhibition of photographs of Picasso at work and at home. But its a small",
          "Went to Antibes from Cannes for the afternoon on the wonderful Cotes d'Azur bus service - a bargain at 1.50 euros. Wandered round the charming old town and then was delighted to find that the excellent Musee Picasso was free entry. I particularly liked the collection of ceramics.",
          "Not a big Picasso fan. The building is lovely though, and has superb views of the sea. A short walk in the Old City, near the Ancient Greek museum, and lots of rests around.",
          "Interesting small museum showing a lot of pictures and only the paintings of the period Picasso painted there. One should not compare this museum to the one in Barcelona or Paris....",
          "A must if you are in Antibes. The ramparts are beautiful as are the views across the bay. Don't miss le Marche Proven can open everyday. X",
          "Difficult to find through the market but on the sea front, most amazing situation overlooking the Cote D'AZURE. sculptures by other artists mix with his paintings, drawings and thought processes in a superb environment.",
          "A splendid museum. A whole bunch of Picasso's in one place in an awesome setting. I'm not qualified to comment on Picasso other than to say the paintings are emblematic of his stay in Antibes and that is why you must go to this museum if you are there.",
          "This is a great little museum with a nice grouping of Picasso's and a few others' works. The setting is marvelous and the building is lovely. You can do it easily in an hour or two. Be sure to enjoy the sculptures outside. Recommended.",
          "Musee Picasso is located in the old city in Antibes on a high promontory that has a fabulous sea view, no doubt an inspiration to Picasso when he lived and worked there in 1946-47 time period. This is where his famous painting, Joie de Vivre, is displayed. Also, his famous",
          "Probably wasted on a philistine such as me, but meaningful to the cognoscenti. I love much of Picasso's art but I'd rather buy a book.",
          "A really nice museum, there is a big focus on Picasso's personality as he is presented by photos from an american photographer. Beautiful photos and really wonderful works of Picasso. You really kind of get to understand him after the visit haha. I totally recommend it!",
          "Really enjoyed the feel of the place. The film gave a good understanding of how Picasso worked and lived when he was in the south of France. A good variety of his work is on display. Situated in the old town in small winding streets. We parked at a nearby large parking",
          "We know better on Picasso's intimate life, his wife Jacqueline and artistic itinerary through pictures by David Duncan, his personal photographer, and numerous concise commentaries commentaries in the large and beautiful setting of Palais Grimaldi in the old town"

        "wiki": "Antibes (, also US: , French: [\u0251\u0303tib] (listen); Proven\u00e7al: Ant\u00edbol) is a coastal city in the Alpes-Maritimes department of southeastern France, on the C\u00f4te d'Azur between Cannes and Nice.\nThe town of Juan-les-Pins is in the commune of Antibes and the Sophia Antipolis technology park is northwest of it.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nTraces of occupation dating back to the early Iron Age have been found in the areas of the castle and cathedral. Remains beneath the Holy Spirit Chapel show there was an indigenous community with ties with Mediterranean populations, including the Etruscans, as evidenced by the presence of numerous underwater amphorae and wrecks off Antibes. However, most trade was with the Greek world, via the Phocaeans of Marseille.\n\n\n=== Colony of Marseille ===\nAntibes was founded by Phocaeans from Massilia. \nAs a Greek colony (and later Roman) settlement, it was named Antipolis (Greek: \u1f08\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, Ant\u00edpolis, lit. \"Cross-City\") from its position close to Nice (anc. \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1 - Nikaia).\nCurrent research suggests that Antipolis was founded relatively late (4th century BC), to benefit from the protection of Marseille with its trade routes along the coast and strongholds like Olbia at Hy\u00e8res, and trading posts such as Antipolis itself and later Nikaia; it is mentioned by Strabo.The exact location of the Greek city is not well known. Given Greek colonial practices, it is likely that it was set at the foot of the rock of Antibes, in today's old city. Traces of occupation in the Hellenistic period have been identified around the castle and the church (former cathedral). The goods unearthed during these excavations show the dominance of imported products of the Marseilles region, associated with Campanian and indigenous ceramics.\nEarly in the second century BC the Ligurian Deceates and Oxybiens tribes launched repeated attacks against Nikaia and Antipolis. The Greeks of Marseille appealed to Rome as they had already done a few years earlier against the federation of Salyens. In 154 BC the consul Quintus Opimius defeated the D\u00e9c\u00e9ates and Oxybiens and took Aegythna from the D\u00e9c\u00e9ates.\n\n\n=== Roman Antipolis ===\nRome gradually increased its hold over the Mediterranean coast. In 43 BC, Antipolis was officially incorporated in the propraetorial (senatorial from 27 BC) province of Narbonesian Gaul, in which it remained for the next 500 years. Antipolis grew into the largest town in the region and a main entry point into Gaul. Roman artifacts such as aqueducts, fortified walls, and amphor\u00e6 can still be seen today.\n\n\n==== Aqueducts ====\n\nThe city was supplied with water by two aqueducts.\nThe Fontvieille aqueduct rises in Biot, and eventually joins the coast below the RN7 and the railway track at the Fort Carr\u00e9. It was rediscovered and restored in the 18th century by the Chevalier d'Aguillon to supply the modern city.\nThe aqueduct called the Bouillide or Clausonnes rises near the town of Valbonne. Monumental remains of aqueduct bridges are located in the neighbourhood of Fugaret, in the forest of Valmasque and near the town of Vallauris.\n\n\n==== Theatre and amphitheatre ====\nLike most Roman towns, Antipolis possessed buildings for shows and entertainment. A Roman theatre is attested by the tombstone of the child \"Septentrion\". The inscription says \"he danced and was popular on the stage of the theatre\". The theatre was located, like the amphitheatre, between Rue de la R\u00e9publique and Rue de Fersen, near the Porte Royale. The back wall is positioned substantially next to Rue Fourmill\u00e8re. A radial wall was found on the right side of the bus station. A plan of the theatre made in the 16th century is in the Marciana National Library of Venice.\nThe remains of the amphitheatre were still visible at the end of the 17th century during the restructuring of the fortifications of the city. A concentric oval was still visible in many plans of the seventeenth century and in a map of Antibes from the early nineteenth century. These remains are now covered by the Fersen middle school.\n\n\n==== Town houses or villas ====\nExcavations in the old town have discovered well-preserved houses showing some luxury. Among them, the most monumental are those in the rectory garden of rue Clemenceau. These show a comparable level to that of the Gallo-Roman domus such as those of Saint-Romain-en-Gal. Large parts of the floor mosaic are organised around a courtyard with a marble fountain. The building dates from the late third century, although parts date from the end of the Hellenistic era or the end of the Roman Republic. Another house paved with porphyry and green stone was excavated between rue des Palmiers and the rue de la Blancherie. The finds at the Antibes Museum of Archaeology suggests the main occupation between the 2nd and 4th century. Finds from the end of the Hellenistic era and the end of the Roman Republic is present on both sites.\n\n\n=== Antipolis in late antiquity ===\nAntipolis became the seat of a bishopric in the 5th century. After the disintegration of the Western Roman Empire, various barbarian tribes seized Antibes. This resulted in destruction and a long period of instability. In the 10th century Antibes found a protector in Seigneur Rodoart, who built extensive fortified walls around the town and a castle in which to live. For the next 200 years, the town experienced a period of renewal. Prosperity was short-lived, for the whole region fell into disarray for several centuries. The inhabitants of Antibes stayed behind their strong city walls as a succession of wars and epidemics ravaged the countryside. In 1244, Antibes's bishop moved his see to Grasse. By the end of the 15th century, the region was under the protection and control of King Louis XI of France. Relative stability returned, but the small port of Antibes fell into obscurity.\n\n\n== Modern era ==\n\nFrom around the middle of the 19th century the Antibes area regained its popularity, as wealthy people from around Europe discovered its natural environment and built luxurious homes there. It was transferred from its former department of Var to the new one of Alpes Maritimes in 1860. The harbor was again used for a \"considerable\" fishing industry and the area exported dried fruit, salt fish, and oil.By the First World War, it had been connected by rail with Nice and most of its fortifications had been demolished to make way for new residential districts. In 1926, the old Ch\u00e2teau Grimaldi in Antibes was bought by the local municipality and later restored for use as a museum. Pablo Picasso came to the town in 1946, having visited his friend and fellow painter Gerald Murphy and his wife Sara there in 1923, and was invited to stay in the castle. During his six-month stay, Picasso painted and drew, as well as crafting ceramics and tapestries. When he departed, Picasso left a number of his works to the municipality. The castle has since become the Picasso Museum.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Conservation ===\nOn 25 May 1999, the town was the first in the d\u00e9partment to sign the State Environment Charter, which pledges to actively conserve the natural environment.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nSport is an important part of the local culture; the town hosts the National Training Centre for basketball. The Jean Bunoz Sports Hall hosted several games of the FIBA EuroBasket 1999. The city is home to Olympique Antibes, a professional basketball team of France's top division LNB Pro A, which plays its home games at the Azur Arena Antibes.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThere is a jazz festival, Jazz \u00e0 Juan, in July.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Presidential Elections 2nd Round ===\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\n\nThere are 48 beaches along the 25 km (16 miles) of coastline that surround Antibes and Juan les Pins.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nArchaeology Museum\nThis museum sits atop the Promenade Amiral de Grasse in the old Bastion St Andre, a 17th-century fortress. The museum's collection focuses on the classical history of Antibes. Many artifacts, sculptures and amphorae found in local digs and shipwrecks from the harbour are displayed here.\nNaval Museum of Napoleon\nHoused in a 17th-century stone fort and tower, this museum presents a collection of Napoleonic memorabilia, paintings and naval models. Several wall paintings show historic moments in Napoleon's reign and there are also pieces of his clothing including one of the hats he wore.\nPicasso Museum\nThis museum houses one of the world's greatest Picasso collections: 24 paintings, 44 drawings, 32 lithographs, 11 oils on paper, 80 pieces of ceramics, two sculptures and five tapestries.\nLa Tour Museum\nThis small museum in the centre of town brings the contemporary history of Antibes to life through its exhibit of costumes, tools, photographs and other objects used by the local people.\nAbsinthe Museum\nThe Absinthe Museum is located in a basement in the Roman foundations of Old Antibes. It is dedicated to the manufacture and appreciation of this green liqueur.\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\nThe Exflora Park\nThe Exflora Park is a five-hectare (12 acres) garden open to the public. Next to the large olive grove, there are different styles of Mediterranean gardens, from ancient Rome to the exuberant Riviera of the 19th century. Fountains and ponds stretch along the terrace, making a waterway 500 metres (1,600 ft) long. Antibes is renowned for rose production, and rose bushes line the path leading to the sea. The exotic garden and palm grove is reminiscent of the belle \u00e9poque, when English gardeners succeeded in planting flowers that bloom in winter, the season when the aristocracy visited the C\u00f4te d'Azur.\nA little further on is the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Verdure, inspired by Italian gardens, and a panoramic viewpoint with a view of the sea and the Iles des Lerins. In the style of Proven\u00e7al gardens of the 18th century, there is a maze with sculpted hedges. Further on, Islamic gardens are featured, with an orange grove where the ground is patterned with terracotta irrigation pipes similar to those in the celebrated Seville Cathedral in Spain. The vegetable gardens and orchards in the Arsat are planted in hollows as in Morocco to protect them from the sun and maximise shadow and humidity. A representation of a Moroccan house pays homage to the painter Majorelle, creator of the blue garden in Marrakesh. In another area, the winter garden contains plants that flower in winter, such as mimosa and camellias.\nThe Eilenroc Gardens\nVilla Eilenroc was built on a rock in the middle of a virtual desert. The area was transformed into a garden through the patience and talent of Jacques Greber, landscape architect and consultant to the Great Exhibition in New York City in 1939. He was commissioned by Mr Beaumont to create this park of 11 hectares (27 acres).\nThe gardens lie thirty metres above the sea with a view across the bay of the Cap. Planted with traditional Mediterranean species such as marine and parasol pines, Alep and Canary pines, cypress, oaks, olive trees, arbutus, lavender, thyme, rosemary, eucalyptus, ficus etc., as well as three kilometres (1.9 miles) of pittosporum hedges, a whole part of the park has been created with plants found in the Antibes area in 1920.\nThuret Park\nIn 1857, Gustave Thuret discovered the Cap d'Antibes and bought five hectares (12 acres) of land where he built a villa and began the creation of a park. Bequeathed to the state by his heirs, the Jardin botanique de la Villa Thuret is now managed by the INRA (National Institute of Agronomic Research). The collection of trees and exotic plants, and the rich earth, provide many opportunities for learning, and the cross-fertilisation of plant species that grow on the Mediterranean coast.\nMarineland\nIn 1970, Roland de la Poype created this animal exhibition park in Antibes. First, it was a small oceanarium with a few pools and animals, but now it is one of the biggest in the world and receives more than 1,200,000 visitors per year. It is the only French sea park featuring two cetacean species: killer whales and dolphins.\n\n\n=== Garoupe Lighthouse ===\n\nThe old lighthouse of Antibes provides views from its lofty hilltop. To get here, you must walk about one kilometre up the Chemin de Calvaire from the Plage de la Salis. It makes for a nice half-day stroll.\n\n\n=== Church of the Immaculate Conception ===\n\nThe central church in Antibes was first built in the 11th century with stones used from earlier Roman structures. Its current fa\u00e7ade was constructed in the 18th century and blends Latin classical symmetry and religious fantasy. The interior houses some impressive pieces such as a Baroque altarpiece and life-sized wooden carving of Christ's death from 1447.\n\n\n=== H\u00f4tel du Cap-Eden Roc ===\nThis villa, set in \"a forest\" at the tip of the Cap d'Antibes peninsula, re-creates a nineteenth-century ch\u00e2teau. Since 1870 the glamorous white-walled Hotel du Cap on the French Riviera has been one of the most storied and luxurious resorts in the world. Guests who flocked there included Marlene Dietrich, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Winston Churchill. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton conducted an affair and honeymooned there.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\n\nThere are many yachting harbours which provide moorings for a range of ships ranging from fishing vessels to full sized yachts.\n\nPort Vauban: The largest yachting harbour in Europe, with more than 2,000 moorings, can accommodate craft of more than 100 metres. This old port was the heart of the ancient Greek city of Antipolis and has a long and colourful history which includes Ligurians, Romans and Crusaders on their way to the Holy Land. Today, it is the largest marina in Europe, serving both local fishing boats and luxury yachts.\nPort Galice: 542 moorings\nPort de la Salis: 233 moorings\nPort du Cro\u00fbton: 390 moorings\nPort de l'Olivette: Situated in the sheltered cove of the same name, this is a harbour for sailors and their wooden fishing boats who enjoy the old marine, provencal traditions.\n\n\n=== Theatre and music ===\nThe Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antibea, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Heures Bleues and Caf\u00e9 Th\u00e9\u00e2tre la Sc\u00e8ne sur Mer all offer a variety of performances from orchestra music to dramatic plays. Music of all types, from live jazz to DJs spinning techno, can be found in the bars and nightclubs and there are a number of festivals and special outdoor concerts during the summer. Jazz is still the speciality around here, and the Juan les Pins Jazz Festival is one of the best in the world.M83 (an electronic band) hails from Antibes.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nAntibes and Juan les Pins host a number of festivals, mainly during the summer months. There's not much in the way of traditional cultural festivals in Antibes; most of the festivals focus on music and contemporary activities.\n\nJazz \u00e0 Juan remains one of the top jazz festivals in the world. Since its inception in 1960, it has attracted many Jazz artists each year to play outdoors. (July).\nAntibes Yacht Show\nThe Antique Show of Antibes attracts thousands of collectors for two weeks in April. It's one of the largest shows of its kind in France (April).\nVoiles d'Antibes is one of the world's biggest gatherings of old teak and brass sailing vessels. They converge on the port for one of the most regal regattas in the Mediterranean (June).\nThe Festival of Saint Peter is the annual celebration of the patron saint of fishermen. A colourful procession through the town is followed by all the local fishermen adorning their boats and floating along the coast (June).\nThe Festival of Sacred Music takes place in Antibes Cathedral, which has renowned acoustics. Sacred music is the theme of this popular festival, which attracts huge crowds each year (January).\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAntibes enjoys a Mediterranean climate.\n\n\n== Shopping ==\nMarch\u00e9 Proven\u00e7al\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe Gare d'Antibes is the railway station serving the town, offering connections to Nice, Cannes, Marseille, Grasse, St Raphael, Les Arcs, Milan, Ventimiliga, Paris and several other destinations. This railway station is in the centre of town. There is another railway station, Juan les Pins. The nearest airport is Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport and Cannes Airport.\n\n\n== Personalities ==\nMike Cumberlege, Royal Navy officer\nIgnazio Dracopoli, Anglo\u2013French cartographer and explorer\nFlocke and Rasputin (aka Flocon et Rasputine), polar bears living at Marineland\nGraham Greene lived in a small apartment in Antibes in his later years\nGloria Guinness then Princess Fakhry married Thomas \"Loel\" Guinness in April 1951\nNikos Kazantzakis, writer of the novel Zorba the Greek, owned a villa in Old Town\nM83, electronic artist\nRuth Madoff (born 1941), wife of Bernie Madoff\nGerald and Sara Murphy, wealthy Americans credited with establishing the French Riviera as a summer resort\nGuillaume Musso, writer\nPablo Picasso, painter\nGabriel Guevrekian, architect\nHalima Soussi, basketball player\nNicolas de Sta\u00ebl, painter\nLuc-Arthur Vebobe, basketball player\nDuke of Windsor, Aristotle Onassis and Stavros Niarchos, at different times, lived in Ch\u00e2teau de la Cro\u00eb\nNikola I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 (1841-1921), died in Antibes\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nAntibes is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the Alpes-Maritimes department\nRoute Napol\u00e9on\nStade du Fort Carr\u00e9\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n Baynes, T.

        "wiki": "The MACM, the Mougins Museum of Classical Art (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Classique de Mougins) is an art museum located in the village of Mougins, in the Alpes-Maritimes region of France. It is 30 minutes from Nice airport and 15 minutes from the centre of Cannes.\nThe MACM opened to the public in June 2011. The museum has won several international awards and has loaned dozens of objects to other museums and university exhibitions all over the world.\nThe museum\u2019s large and diverse collection of antiquities includes Roman, Greek and Egyptian sculpture, vases, coins, and jewellery, and the world\u2019s largest private collection of ancient arms and armour .\nThe ancient artworks are interspersed with paintings, drawings, and sculptures by artists such as Henri Matisse, Marc Chagall, Raoul Dufy, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Auguste Rodin, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Andy Warhol, Marc Quinn, Antony Gormley, and Damien Hirst, and others. The collection also includes works by artists who spent time in Mougins, such as Francis Picabia, Jean Cocteau, Man Ray, and Pablo Picasso (who spent the final 12 years of his life in Mougins village).\nThe founder of the museum is Christian Levett, a British investment manager with an interest in history and art. A collector since childhood, in 2009 he formed the museum to place his antiquity and classical art collection on public display. The Mus\u00e9e de Mougins was created by remodelling a 600m2 medieval edifice to house his collection. The building itself used to be the village prison in medieval times, it was then turned into a mill before becoming a private residence in the 1950s.  The interior was entirely renovated to display the collection while the fa\u00e7ade remains in its original style.\nThe museum\u2019s director is Leisa Paoli.\n\n\n== Concept ==\nAlthough the majority of objects on display are antiquities, the museum embraces a concept of displaying ancient, neo-classical, modern and contemporary art side by side to show the pervasive and lasting influence of the ancient world. Thus works by Sir Peter Paul Rubens, Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Damien Hirst and others are included in the museum alongside their ancient inspirations.\nThis dialogue and fusion between ancient and modern is particularly clear in the museum where, for example, depictions of the Greek Goddess Aphrodite by Warhol, Dal\u00ed and Yves Klein accompany 1st and 2nd Century AD depictions of the Goddess, in marble and in bronze.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounder, Christian Levett, a philanthropist in the field, sponsored multiple exhibitions at The British Museum, Royal Academy, National Gallery, Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. He has funded archaeological works in the UK, Spain, Italy and Egypt and sponsored academic scholarships at Wolfson College and The Ruskin School of Art in Oxford. He has aided curatorial funding at The Ashmolean, The British Museum, and The British School at Rome.\nAs well as this, he has funded renovation works at The Charterhouse Museum London, Charterhouse School Surrey, The National Gallery and the chapel Notre Dame de Vie in Mougins, and has sponsored conferences at King\u2019s College London, Senate House UCL and at The Mougins Museum. He is a member of the Arms and Armour Committee at The Metropolitan Museum of New York and member of The Board of Visitors at The Ashmolean Museum Oxford and is a past board member of The Hadrian\u2019s Wall Trust. Levett is also an Honorary Fellow of The Ashmolean Museum, an honorary fellow of Wolfson College Oxford and a member of the Oxford University Chancellors Court of Benefactors.\nOn 29 October 2019 Levett consigned for sale at Christie's a marble statue of the Emperor Hadrian from his collection, known as the Cobham Hall Hadrian, to benefit the Museum.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe MACM is spread over four floors chronologically from the crypt to the second floor as follows: The Egyptian Gallery, in the crypt, depicts the theme of the afterlife with funerary masks, numerous other ancient artefacts and a sarcophagus, punctuated with works from Chagall, Calder, Rubens and Cocteau. The People and Personalities Gallery on the ground floor presents busts and statues of historical figures from ancient Greece and Rome, their influence highlighted by sculptures of Sosno, Arman, Quinn and Hirst. The Gods and Goddesses Gallery, on the first floor, displays Greek and Roman bronze and marble statues, heads and busts, pottery, glass and silverware, an extensive collection of coins and an antique jewellery display case. Works by neo-classical and modern artists such as Renoir, Rodin, Klein, Warhol, Picasso, Modigliani, Braque and Dal\u00ed are also exhibited in the museum. The Armoury, on the second floor, displays the largest private collection of Greek and Roman arms and armour in the world.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Publications ==\nThe MACM has produced several publications, including:\n\nMougins Museum of Classical Art, 2011, edited by M. Merrony\nLa Collection Famille Levett, 2012, edited by M. Merrony and translated by C. Dauphin\nAnimals in the Ancient World, 2014, C. Dauphin\nPompeii in Pictures, 2015, K. Sch\u00f6rle\nLes Animaux dans le Monde Antique, 2016, C. Dauphin\nDufy Dessine le Sud, 2019, F. Guillon Laffaille\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThe permanent collection at the MACM is constantly evolving. New pieces are acquired with a view to sustaining and developing the museum\u2019s concept of the fusion of ancient and modern art and the influence that Antiquity has had on subsequent artistic creation.\nThe Museum has also hosted and been otherwise involved in many temporary exhibitions:\n\n\n== Exhibitions at the MACM ==\nDoric, Sean Scully. 12 July - 29 September 2013\nVessels, Gary Komarin. 1 May \u2013 29 June 2014\nLayers of Time, Alexander Mihaylovich. 10 April - 14 June 2015\nPompeii in pictures, Giorgio Sommer. 19 June \u2013 2 August 2015\nAnimal, The Levett Bestiary collection.

        "wiki": "Les Femmes d'Alger (\"Women of Algiers\") is a series of 15 paintings and numerous drawings by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. The series, created in 1954\u20131955, was inspired by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix's 1834 painting The Women of Algiers in their Apartment (French: Femmes d'Alger dans leur appartement). The series is one of several painted by Picasso in tribute to artists that he admired.The entire series of Les Femmes d'Alger was bought by Victor and Sally Ganz from the Galerie Louise Leiris in Paris for $212,500 in June 1956 (equivalent to $2 million in 2019). Ten paintings from the series were later sold by the Ganz's to the Saidenberg Gallery, with the couple keeping versions \"C\", \"H\", \"K\", \"M\" and \"O\".Many of the individual paintings in the series are now in prominent public and private collections.\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nIn December 1954, Picasso began to paint a series of free variations on Delacroix's The Women of Algiers in their Apartment (Les Femmes d'Alger). He began his first version (cat. 19) six weeks after learning of the death of his lifelong friend and rival Henri Matisse\u2014and so, for Picasso, the \"oriental\" subject of this series of paintings held strong associations with Matisse as well as with Delacroix. Matisse had been famous for his images of languid, voluptuous women known as odalisques\u2014the French form of the Turkish word for women in a harem. \"When Matisse died he left his odalisques to me as a legacy,\" joked Picasso. Many of Picasso's portrayals of Jacqueline circa 1955\u201356 represent her in this guise (cat. 9).The consequences of Picasso's Femmes d'Alger series were far-reaching: \"I thought so much about Les Femmes d'Alger that I bought La Californie,\" Picasso explained to his biographer Pierre Daix. La Californie is a Belle \u00c9poque villa situated in the foothills of Cannes in the South of France, where Picasso spent his last decades. Picasso bought it in 1955, and it was here that he painted the Nude in a Rocking-Chair (cat. 16). The light-filled interiors, the views over the Mediterranean and the exotic garden evoked a feeling of spaciousness and ease which corresponded to Picasso's idea of the Orient.The art historian and collector Douglas Cooper was perhaps the first to realise that the paintings done at La Californie marked a return to Picasso's peak form. In April 1956, he wrote to the curator Alfred H. Barr Jr.:\n\nI recently spent the day with Picasso and went through most of what he has done since last July. I have been greatly impressed...A whole series of interiors of La Californie deriving half from Delacroix half from Matisse\u2014great emphasis on ornament, arabesque, simplification...In short, as you are planning to come to Europe, this is a word to tell you that you must see all this in the studio: it is to my mind much better than anything since 1946.\n\n\n== List of notable works ==\n\n\n=== \"Version C\" ===\n\"Version C\" was sold in 1988 following Victor Ganz's death.\n\n\n=== \"Version F' ===\n\"Version F\" was completed on 17 February 1955, and later sold to Daniel and Eleanore Saidenberg of the Saidenberg Gallery in 1957.

          "Enjoyed the ambiance and the relaxed atmosphere, taking time to study some of Pcasso's greatest works, some lesser known pieces too... I was unaware that he was also into ceramics. My daighters, my wife and I now own some limited edition prints which we will treasure as they",
          "Very interesting exhibit from his life in antibes. The Palace itself gives it a nice atmosphere. By chance it was also free, thanks to the mayor!",
          "I don't like art so it was boring and not worth the fifteen euro. I think it is a bit over hyped, but if you love art you will enjoy.",
          "Maybe there are just too many Picasso museums around? The one in Antibes does not impress with a variety of items or with an insight into the broad production of the icon artist. But, by all means, do spend an hour there, and don't forget to visit the terrasse!",
          "I have followed Picasso for over fifty years and his cubist paintings, ceramics and sculpture. This wonderful exhibition was special, because you can feel his emotional attachment to the Cote De Azure.",
          "Enjoyed the museum despite a 15 minute wait in line. Expected less but was pleasantly surprised. It is not just Picasso, it has other artists and sculptors.",
          "Nice place to spend the time and get familiar with some pieces you've never seen as well as some very famous pieces. Beautiful estate in one of the riviera jems - city of Antibes.",
          "The museum is housed within an ancient mansion, which belonged to the Grimaldi family in the early 17th century. In the early 18th century, the building became Antibes Town Hall. Since 1925, the place has been known as the Grimaldi Museum and in 1946 came to the place Pablo",
          "Very nice ambiance plus good explanations on the Picasso\u2019s Art fashion. A so good location a Antibes sea view also near many good restaurants.. Bars.. Cafes..shops complete by beautiful people around. Highly Recommended...",
          "Not Picasso\u2019s most inspiring works, the modern artist is dull and dark but the building and setting on the harbour is eonderful",
          "From the moment we set foot in the museum, this was a big disappointment. The woman selling tickets refused my credit card and said it was cash only. I then watched her process credit card payments from her fellow citizens behind me in line. The museum itself is only one-half",
          "In a magnificent venue. Loved the outdoor sculptures the best. Gave a good commentary and has an app that you can connect to to make the most of the experience",
          "This is a smaller museum than most. What is in there is lovely. It takes about an hour to go through and really look at everything. The area surrounding it is so beattiful. The view from the back is so scenic.",
          "Picasso's Museum is a gem everyone should visit. It is beautifully located in the Old Antibes and has so much treasure. I was happy to discover it and to wander among all this powerful art. I went there with friends and they really enjoyed it. I might go back again soon. The",
          "While the building is nice, and has some interesting sculptures by Antibes artists, aside from 2-3 ceramics in a tiny corner, THERE IS NO MORE WORK BY Picasso! Not worth 8 euros.",
          "We've seen many art exhibits featuring Picasso's art. This museum is situated right on the Mediterranean, so the views are gorgeous. The exhibits themselves are okay and give you a feel for his Cubist period. There are also displays of his ceramics.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Museum in our short time in Antibes. Tastefully put together, it attempted to give an overview of the man himself in the time he lived in Antibes and examples of his work, supplemented by commentary on his mindset and methodology. An",
          "What a divine location to be inspired - on the edge of the sea! I visited on a very hot day and the coolness inside was a relief. I don\u2019t know much about art but Picasso\u2019s is certainly outside the box. At first I shook my head in disbelief but after a while I felt like he had",
          "Fantastic gallery; artwork well displayed. Picasso and other artists. A definite must in the very centre of such a lively and fun town. Feels very intimate and like a private tour. Would definitely recommend.",
          "We visited today (Saturday) and got free entry! The top floor has all the Picasso art, but the first and second floor has a selection of other artist\u2019s work. There are fantastic views from the terrace! Nice small collection, in a convenient location- just a 2 min walk from the",
          "If you are visiting here to add culture to your life, or to see some Picasso Masterpiece, then you should carry on walking right past the front door - there are some local bars with house wines which have more culture than you will find in this museum and they will stay longer",
          "Sorry folks, but this was a really disappointing experience. I think maybe I visited when there was a special event on, but was sad that there were no Picasso paintings. I guess they are all on loan around the world. The exhibition consisted of room after room of photos of",
          "fabulous setting and the best any picasso lover could ask for, bvery friendly and well kept. Im no art lover but it was very good",
          "Finally got round to visiting this museum 10 years after our first visit to Antibes. There is a handful of impressive paintings by Picasso but the majority of works are drawings and ceramics. Many of the drawings look like preliminary sketches for other works and one gets the",
          "We visited the Musee Picasso in Paris and almost missed this one. We so glad we stopped. There may be easier access through town and parking, but we didn't find it. That was the only downside.",
          "This was a lovely gallery with some interesting paintings/pictures/drawings in it. It was only 3 euros entry as it was the end of the season and not all the areas were open. It also has a fabulous terrace with a stunning view!",
          "If anyone has difficulty with steps, avoid. Main entrance in basement with no lift down. Seating inside low and soft, again creates difficulty getting up for people with mobility issues. There is a rear entrance to the villa for disability by using an intercom to request",
          "The museum shows some works of art from Picasso that were unknown to me before, that being said it does not offer a great insight to the painters life in Antibes nor does it posses a great collection. The views from the place are great.",
          "It is more about life of Picasso, for me ok, but for lover of his painting not so much to see, more of different painters..nice view from the balcony in the first floor. We had trouble with French rivi\u00e9ra pass, only in this city (not in Nice, Monaco, Marineland in Biot) you need",
          "Museum is more about Picasso the man than his paintings. Interesting but underwhelming. Full of photos of Picasso showing some of his interests and places he lived",
          "The bottom couple of floors are mainly photos, all interesting, and some art by contemporaries of Picasso, particularly, Nicolas De Stael, which is very good. However as Picasso said, if you want to see the Picassos of Antibes, you have to come to Antibes, and they are",
          "This is a must if visiting Antibes. Although all tbe artwork on show is not Picasso's work, the range is excellent. The Photo galleries alone are worth a visit.",
          "The Museum is good, but I think Chagall Museum (Nice) is more enjoyable. We spent more time experiencing the town and this was better.",
          "I read a few reviews of the Musee before going and had somewhat lowered my expectations for it. However, I found it fascinating and enjoyable. It focusses on the period of his life from 1946 onwards so doesn't provide a full picture of the man or his art, but what is there",
          "Fort like stone building. Entry is a reasonable 6 euros. Nice terrace with beautiful views to the sea. 3 floors of art work. Most of it is black and white pictures if Picasso. His works area good variety. Worth a visit.",
          "Surprised by this museum. A nice experience to see all these photos of Pablo Picasso. Worth a visit!",
          "I thought I'd see more of the great mans' work but instead saw a lot of rather boring and repetitive black and white photographs with minimal description as to why we were looking at them. A very pretentious general introduction was so impenetrable i nearly gave up at the",
          "As our rental apartment was barely three blocks from this museum, there was no excuse not to go. It is a pleasant way to spend an hour or so in this old originally fortress, later a home that Picasso rented briefly in Antibes. Overlooking the Mediterranean, the building is a",
          "I was an art history student and was happy to learn more about great artists. This museum has a lot of black and white photos of Picasso which help to understand his life. There are more photographs of his life than his work but this make it interesting to understand how he",
          "Lovely museum. Really enjoyed seeing both Picasso's art pieces as well as photos of himself. Was air conditioned. Please note you cannot carry large bags through the museum and you must leave in a cloak room.",
          "More photos of the MAN, than works by him...in itself a great experience...particularly good ceramics...other artists very interesting....worth the visit.",
          "Stunning architecture, beautifully situated in Antibes. We visited late afternoon, wasn't very busy so we had a lot of time to ourselves to look carefully at the works. Not many Picasso works however it is a MUST SEE in Antibes. We thouroughly recommend going in the late",
          "In the fortification of Chateau Grimaldi, it is where Picasso worked for the period 1945-48 and produced many of his works involving Faunes, Nymphs, Minotaurs and other mythical characters. The place is teaming with lovely works from the period including many B&W pictures of him",
          "Brilliant. Not just for Picasso but for the Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl paintings. Truly great and breathtaking. The Concert is an incredible work of art. A must do.",
          "Somewhat sparse in its collection of artwork by Picasso himself but it is a beautiful building with stunning views. I also really liked the exhibit of photos of Picasso. For \u20ac6 entry it's definitely worth a visit.",
          "In this museum, you can admire beautiful painting of Picasso in a splendid place, discover the life of the master when he lived in Antibes. Don't hesitate to visit this museum!",
          "Interesting place, I am not a fan of Picasso, but Antibes does a good job displaying his art. Plus some pictures of him and his family. The view from the terrace is very pretty.",
          "This was our second time in the museum, the first one being already in 1999. It was small enough for a family visit, the kids loved it too. Enjoyed the special photograph exhibition about Picasso",
          "Limited collection, but the space is very cool (castle like) and rich with history. Nice place to get out of the sun in Antibes and tickets are appropriately priced for a smaller museum. Worth a stop.",
          "Very interesting insight into Picasso's time in Antibes. Many photos of him and his friends and family was the highlight. Not really that many paintings as they are spread out around the world but some ceramics and sketches as well.",
          "There are many paintings, ceramics but also lots of photos of Picasso in different moments of his French life.",
          "Picasso had a studio for awhile in this building. There are paintings, photos and ceramics of Picasso in the museum.",
          "My favorite part of the museum was the photo gallery, displaying dozens of photos of Picasso taken over the course of his life. They showed a great glimpse into his life. The museum itself was nice to visit, but could have done with a few more signs detailing where to find the",
          "This museum is situated in a beautiful location overlooking the water. The museum consists mostly of photos of Picasso-- limited examples of his original art work. Interesting to visit when you have had enough beach time.",
          "The position of the Mus\u00e9e Picasso is absolutely stunning, such an amazing view. There aren't a lot of paintings by Picasso, but I believe those that are there he painted while using a part of the castle as a workshop, so they are very sea oriented. I love the plate collection as",
          "At a mere \u20ac6 per adult whether you like art or not, you really should spend at least an hour here to admire this Master's work, get to know the man behind so many works that continue to inspire today and take in the amazing views around the museum grounds. It's an absolute",
          "Really worth touring. Easy in town location. Wonderful exhibits with a comprehensive showing of his works.",
          "Beautiful museum close to the center, I spent there only a half an hour but I have seen amazing artworks.",
          "Paintings, drawings and sculptures by Picasso plus photos of Picasso's life. All well presented in an old castle by the sea. Plus the inevitable shop!",
          "Beautiful surrendings and interesting to see the Picasso studio. Don't miss a walk outside along the wall and see the sculptures along the museum.",
          "Nice museum, collection of Picasso art is limited however pictures of the artist were very interesting and the museum itself with its history is worth the visit. Entrance fee of 6\u20ac is very reasonable and during our visit at approx noon only a limited number of guests were",
          "A good place to visit with great staff. Picasso is all the top floor and interesting to see and get a better understanding of. The Ceramics and the outside sculptures were the star of the show for me. Look at the other artists though as there are some great pieces here. Also the",
          "The Chateau is a great place to visit in itself. Seeing photographs of Picasso with family and friends made us imagine his lifestyle. Would have hoped to see more paintings from the artist as you will find mainly photographs, some drawings and poteries and a couple of",
          "3 levels predominately given to a photographic exhibit of Picasso's later life. Would have been better if they had more Picasso paintings in the museum, was only a few paintings actually painted by Picasso",
          "A pleasant Sunday afternoon. We enjoyed the ambience of the museum and the views are amazing from the terrace. Seeing some of Picasso's works and lots of photos was worth the entrance fee. Pleased we went.",
          "There were exhibitions of Picasso's master pieces and other artists works. The most interesting collection was the photograps of Picasso and his family.",
          "Visited this museum with a family of two adults and two children. Nice overview of Picassos work and history. Not expensive.",
          "A beautiful little museum that gives you a wonderful insight into Picasso's work. Would recommend if you are in the area.",
          "If you're in the area I would recommend visiting the museum...a lot of Picasso's works are available to see up close, the cost is minimal and the area in general is really nice!",
          "The museum had an interesting collection of Picasso paintings as well as photos of his life, loves and family. Some other modern artists were displayed, also good. The external sculpture garden overlooking the ocean was lovely and very relaxing. The building itself, a Grimaldi",
          "Not a huge fan of art but decided to check out this museum. On a half day trip started out from the old town and reached the museum. The road behind the museum is extremely scenic and a short walk would lead you to the musee d archeologie. This is one of the most scenic and",
          "Perfect little museum. One hour visit. Beautiful scenery all around. You can learn a lot about Picasso's art and life especially the after WW2 period. I love his fauns, satyres and centaures! The Art is not only Picasso's . One of my favorite piece is The Concert by Nicolas de",
          "One just has to visit this musewum if in Antibes - thats how you learn what you did not know about Picasso. Yes, it was interesting, it was nicely buildt up - and even I, not too interested in modern art - liked it.",
          "Antibes is a lovely old town and the Grimaldi Palace is a nice setting for the Picasso museum. There are quite a few works from other selected artists and there is a huge photographic history of Picasso at work and at leisure. There are, however, only a limited stock of his",
          "If you are a Picasso fan or not you will love this Musee. Its location over looking the Sea is beautiful and its collection is very good. This is well worth the visit and the walk around it gives you a real feeling of Antibes.",
          "We visited this museum as well as the Picasso Museum in Vallauris (10mn, nearby). Interesting to compare. The Antibes museum in the Grimaldi Castle maybe has more works of Picasso, but very different, I think the two museums are complementary. In Antibes Picasso stayed as an",
          "In a charming environment, of the Chateau Grimaldi, we found this museum, dedicated to Picasso and his work. Not a lot of explanation in English, so it is not as enjoyable if you do not speak and read French. A lot of photographs of Picasso, too many in my opinion. But also some",
          "Having some time before checking into our hotel, we walked along the beautiful beach to visit the museum. Nice collection of artwork, big and small, including pottery. Especially enjoyed the photography exhibit, providing an excellent perspective on the man- Picasso's personal",
          "Recently visited the Picasso museum following perusing the boats in the harbour. I am not an art expert or even really an art lover but found this museum really interesting. It portrays photographs of Picasso's work, home life and dogs. The images really capture his essence,",
          "It's only small collection and not a full representation of all Picasso's work. Nice building and excellent views but not good value.",
          "This is not a large museum, but for those who know and appreciate Picasso, come here to enjoy learning more about his great artists time on the French Riviera. This museum provides an informal setting for showcasing some of his work, some by those close to him and is in a",
          "It's not the largest museum, but then it's not too expensive either. The photo exhibit was much more interesting than I was expecting.",
          "This museum is placed in a very nice building with great surroundings. But, the museum itself, well - the Picasso part is on the top and from I can understand from those who have been to the Picasso museum in Barcelona , go there if you can and skip this one. For me, it didn't",
          "Beautiful location and very well presented. Don't miss it and is very reasonably priced . Children only 3 euros! It is a must if you are in Antibes !",
          "So good to see an old building (old Grimaldi castle, still some coats of arms over doorways) taken care of, and beautifully restored. Most of the artwork on display, the day I was there, was from the few months Picasso was living in the castle in 1946. Really like some of the",
          "Of course you see Picasso and you expecting nice picasso paintings, they are there but of course only the second or third level pieces. I would not go there again for 6 euro, but if there are real Picasso fans it is the place to be.",
          "This museum has a fantastic sitting overlooking the harbor in our team, a beautiful outdoor garden with some sculptures and an amazing building. We just did not feel that they were enough Picassos in the exhibit, it seemed that Only about one fourth of the paintings and",
          "This is a must do when visiting here. Start at the top floor and work down. The top floor features hundreds of Picasso works, that can only be called unusual. They feature works on board, pencils and crayon on paper as well as ceramics. The other artists on exhibit are also",
          "Fabulous building and a real insight into how Picasso worked but not many of his pieces. Enjoyable nonetheless. Price should have been \u20ac6 each but due to this odd rule, it was free! I would have been happy to pay it though.",
          "Wonderful small museum with quite a few Picasso paintings and most interesting pottery works. Nicely organized and good for no more than an hour when visiting the charming town of Antibes.",
          "It's nice to visit this place but don't expect lots of famous Picasso paintings. Still interesting collection. There are other painters such as Nicolas De Stael. There is a beautiful view in the sea from the balcony. The place is equipped for the wheel chair.",
          "Good museum, bit a hike to get to. Ticket cost is about 6 euros. It's show small amount of Picasso works and gives interesting background on the way Picasso painted.",
          "The Musee Picasso is as important for the building, formerly the Ch\u00e2teau Grimaldi. Picasso lived and painted here six months and a number of his works rest here, including the Goat and Joie de Vivre.",
          "Picasso only stayed here a few months, and there few actual Picasso works on show, and they don't really add to the legend. The photographs are interesting enough, as are the other artist works on display, and the museum is worth a visit if you are already in Antibes and you are",
          "I had just visited this randomly which had entry fee of 6\u20ac each.. dint find it worth since we were not fond of Picasso.. but the location and the way they hav made is good.. nice walk to the museum the u can roam around to other cool places around",
          "I'm not a big Picasso fan, but found the home pleasing to walk through. Probably a home run if you care about Picasso, but I found the works on display a bit dull and uninspired.",
          "A lot of the art work is in the style of Picasso, but not actually by Picasso, which confused us at first, though there were many original pieces on display. It was educational for my children, but we all walked away wondering how on earth Picasso became famous, as much of the",
          "Great setting for a Picasso Museum. There are a few lovely Picassos, especially like the outdoor sculptures.",
          "Great value at only 6Euro but, like the majority of visitors, we made straight for the top floor, where they keep their Picasso exhibits. It's mostly stuff from the aertists time spent in Antibes just after the Second World War but it's great to see that part of his life and the",
          "Some interesting Picasso art- even some spectacular pieces - from his months working in Antibes in 1946. Other artists presented cannot compare. Recommended.",
          "This is a well done, small museum of Picasso's work, both while he lived here and smatterings of other periods. The museum is well done, but the star is the castle that houses the museum. The views across the harbor, the architectural details, and the remaining remnants of",
          "The museum is in Antibes Old Town and boasts magnificent views of the Mediterranean from every window. I visited Musee Picasso at the Chateau Grimaldi on Sunday afternoon and had the 2nd floor which is dedicated to Picasso to myself. Lots of drawings and two rooms filled with",
          "The Picasso museum in Antibes is a must see. While not the most extensive collection of Picasso art it reflects a time in the artist life of development and evolution. The story is quite intriguing. They also have modern art from a few contemporaries. The building is beautiful.",
          "This was certainly worthwhile retracing our steps to get to the museum. Great exhibition of his works and to be able to get a feel for the area and his home where he worked from. Make time to visit there.",
          "Musee Picasso is at the Chateau Grimaldi in Vieux Antibes, the old part of Antibes. Spectacular museum - the setting is beyond compare, and the collection is excellent. Wonderful to wander around where Picasso lived and painted. No wonder he was so happy here. Sublime views.",
          "The Picasso Museum occupies the Chateau Grimaldi, on a cliff top overlooking the sea in the middle of \u201cold\u201d Antibes. The building is cool and spacious inside with works by Picasso on display \u2013 it says that he worked there for a few months just after WW2 \u2013 and by various other",
          "I'm no art expert however this was worth the visit not on,y to see the paintings but to throw some light on Picasso himself. Great views from the outer terrace.",
          "Worth seeing because Picasso worked here and Antibes is still a lovely place to spend time in. But the Picasso works on display (2nd floor) were made shortly after the Second World War so materials were scarce and his colour palette sober. (Interesting to see him using",
          "Worth seeing this lovely building that Picasso lived in during his years in Antibes it now houses some of his collection. Beautiful view out to the sea",
          "Located in the centre of town, with an amazing view of the ocean, there's a lot to see besides the interesting pieces by Picasso.",
          "This museum holds a number of works by Picasso which are quite amazing. The museum is located in the centre of the city and has some spectacular views of the ocean. It does get packed so if you can, buy your tickets beforehand if you don't want to spend time queuing in the heat.",
          "The museum itself is not worth going out of your way for..but just the city is worth visiting for a few hours... great scenic views and quaint little streets to stroll anout",
          "My reactions to works of Picasso were changed dramatically as a result of visiting this museum in Antibes. His progression of work from earlier times to later works was exciting. I had not seen his early work and it was engaging. Simpler drawings & sketches gave dimension to",
          "A must if you go to Antibes. Loved the views from the terrace and great for photo taking. There are many works by other arts in the museum so start at the top floor if you want to get to the Picasso works. Loved learning about his life and lovers.",
          "The museum is very interesting and has an amazing view! After a visit you can take a walk around and enjoy this lovely city! I felt in love with Antibes!!",
          "We came to this museum as big admirers of Picasso's work, filled with hesitation to see what has he produced during his stay in Provence, We were surprised to see, that this museum holds not too many works of Picasso, most created in several months during hist stay at the",
          "Beautiful tribute to the life and works of Picasso...... Only realised we weren't allowed to take pictures after I'd taken loads !!!........interesting to hear from the video playing that each picture had hidden messages with symbolic represensation ...made it easier to start",
          "It was good to see. I mean, where else will you see so many of Pablo's works in one place? There were no audio guides so there was little context for the art we were viewing. The staff was put out. I left feeling a bit underwhelmed. I love art history and was disappointed",
          "I have to admit although a fan of Art I am far from a fan of Picasso I think he is awful, BUT my girlfriend wanted to go and look round and because my family have had a place in Antibes for 20 years. So we went along and I have to say and my girlfriend agreed it was full of",
          "Only 6\u20ac each , you can leave your back pack for free with a minder, No photos allowed, I was surprised at the people taking photos After being told not too. Lovely display if other artists, quite dark work, great sketch selection of Picasso and some of his plates and pots. He",
          "Before I visited the Picasso museum I did not really appreciate Picasso's work . I left feeling I understood it more. The location, by the sea adds atmosphere.",
          "Picasso spent a few months here, using it as a studio, so the town, with some help from a few donors, made it into a museum. No major pieces and the work that is there is just OK. About the best work is the series of ceramic platters that Picasso did in Vallauris, and the",
          "Amazing location right at cliffs edge, beautiful restored old building. Perfect lighting. Had small groupings of various contemporary French artists to fill out both the space and limited Picasso pieces. Much of Picasso related were sketches and photos. He was near Vallaruis",
          "I found this museum by chance while i was walking around the Antibes town centre. The museum is located on top of hill so it has nice views. Some of paintings are Piccaso's but some of them are other painters'. If you like arts and paintings, worthwhile to visit. The enterance",
          "Not as much about Picasso as you'd think but there were a lot of other nice pieces. The views of the sea are great - overlooks the bay towards the Cap D'Antibes.",
          "Nice , but small museum. Besides the works of Picasso there are things other contemporary artists . Inside is forbidden to take photographs .",
          "This museum is nice to visit when walking through the town. Picasso lived in Antibes and worked from this castle (that was previously owned by the Grimaldi's). We parked the car in the harbour, whoch is only a 5 minute walk",
          "The location is amazing, as if all of a sudden you realize another world. The collection is also very interesting.",
          "hadn't read up on what i was about to see here and was blown away - a fine selection of Picasso art - and many pieces new to me - have been to Picasso Museum in Cerat and seen all his ceramics - or so i though, so many here too - a great room of photos of the man at work too -",
          "Very little Picasso, with two floors of other Antibes resident artists. Cool and spacious, but when another visitor used a camera, honestly the room security man shouted \" I told you once, so I have to tell you in Japanese and Chinese as well, no photographs\" which embarrassed",
          "Beautiful building, well adapted as a gallery. Rooms add to experience . Staff were lovely apart from the unfriendly man at reception.",
          "Excellent display of works with good story boards to accompany them. Reasonable \u20ac6 entry fee. Good for rainy day.",
          "Weather made this visit a potential winner for the afternoon, however for the location and building the exhibits were not truly amazing. But learnt a bit and broadened the mind a little so no bad thing, not to busy as appears August stampede has calmed down, but not going have",
          "Good selection of interesting pieces of art. Well laid out and easy to access. Very pleasant to wander around in the cool air when it is scorching outside.",
          "The museum building is very atmospheric, situated on the sea front, and a perfect setting for the art work displayed. We visited with our 14year old daughter and all enjoyed the experience.",
          "Not a bad thing to say about this museum. Stunning artwork of course and in a very special site in the charming old town of Antibes. The outside space overlooking the sea is breathtaking. Bronzes punctuate the wall above the sea. Worth a detour.",
          "Small museum, but still good. We went on a Wednesday evening when it was open late (NB trip advisor has the late nights wrong - it's Wednesday and Friday). Great views from the terrace.",
          "Magnificent pictures of the man at work and the most beautiful panorama of Antibes seaside Insights of the master of contemporary art",
          "The museum sits over looking the Mediterranean coast in a stunning location. The building it's self has been kept to a very high standard and is air conditioned. There were several artist displaying their work in the museum and not just work done by Picasso when he was in",
          "Set in what was Castle Grimaldi, the museum offers work by a selection of artists as well as a range of work by Picasso and an insight into his life and inspiration. The setting is superb, an impressive building looking out onto the sea with amazing views from many windows.",
          "I had read mixed reviews on here but decided to see for myself.we visited on a Saturday afternoon.It was busy and we had to wait 20 mins in blaring heat to get in.there was no shade.when we did get in the ground floor and top floors were closed. I thought it was a really",
          "It has a break at lunch. And is closing at 6. For the rest of it is a great museum. From the outdoord to everithing inside",
          "This museum could not be better located. The collection is housed in an extraordinary castle in the center of Antibes with gorgeous views over the bay. But the collection is only from the period that Picasso worked in the area, so it is a limited range of his work and is not",
          "The works of one of the world\u2019s greatest artists deserve a beautiful setting and the architecture of the Picasso Museum certainly lives up to this ideal. Upon entering the museum, you will notice crisp white walls that give brightness and that serve to highlight Picasso\u2019s",
          "Not the biggest museeum, but just about the right size you want to visit during the heat in summer Antibes. Intresting, and also works by other artist. Realy worth a visit if you are in the erea.",
          "There are some interesting works of art inside this museum. It's very casual and a nice walk through if you are nearby. Quite the juxtaposition of modern art in a relatively ancient building. The market is nearby and therefore it's a convenient visit.",
          "A must when you visit Antibes. Fun and wonderful exibition. Helpful and friendly staff, who speak english.",
          "Not even a third of the art is Picasso's. I do not understand the concept of this collection. Its just a meqgre collection in a phantastic building. All in all it has been a great experience. Less because of Picasso, but because of the rest.",
          "Picasso's works has been in the museums all over the world but this place emphasis' his other collections, drawings and mostly sketches. Nice location of the building.",
          "interesting collection and one which is on original mural done on the wall directly . It is fascinating to see the different style of art the Picasso painted over the years. The terrace is garnished of art from various sculptors and one is by Miro .",
          "For us the best part was the excellent account on video (with English subtitles) on the first floor of the Picasso Museum of David Douglas Duncan the photographer who spent time in the late 1950s photographing Picasso and Jacqueline. We often go to museums and art galleries",
          "The location is breathtaking. The exhibits are amazing. The grounds outside are picturesque. This is a beautiful place to visit with family or friends.",
          "Visited with husband and who uses a wheelchair, entered lift up to exhibition it didn't work and left us trapped inside in 35 degree heat. We shouted no one heard us luckily a couple of fellow visitors found us and and phoned for help. We were freed without an apology. When we",
          "Great location. The exibits are not his most popular works, but still very nice tour. It is nice for a couple of hors activity away from the beach.",
          "A nice museum in a beautiful setting, a little smaller than I expected. Nonetheless real character to the building and in a stunning location. Worth a couple of hours out of the sun.",
          "We stayed here for about one hour and it was enough. Their wasn't so many paintings that Picasso had made and overall it was kinda small. Great view from the balcony though!",
          "The muse Picasso , is located in old Antibes , it was an enjoyable visit , this place could be better if they maintain it in a better way",
          "I'm not an art guy, but this held my interest for the 1.5 hours we walked around. Building is cool, views are great, and it's always fun to learn a bit of art history. Antibes was one of my fav stops in this region.",
          "This place will be a disappointment if you are a Picasso fan, as there are only a view average pieces on display with the biggest collection being in Paris, but the views of the Mediterranean are sublime and the Grimaldi palace is architecturally very interesting. Worth a visit",
          "Yes this museum is small, but the building and view itself is worth the stop. Art is very accessible and docents are helpful. The sculptures on the property are inspiring. For the price of a beer this is a real bargain!",
          "My friend and I popped in here before going to the beach and while there were a handful of pieces that we loved, there's a lot of dross in here. It's only 6\u20ac, so worth visiting if you're at a loose end, but I wouldn't call it unmissable.",
          "To see Picasso's work in the location where it was painted and with picrures of him at work puts the particular works in context. A rarity. Definitely not to be missed when visiting Antibes. The sculptures were also interesting both inside and outside the museum.",
          "Some great paintings from one period of Picasso's life , well worth seeing along with his ceramics. Resonable collection of some extra artwork as well.",
          "I was not very happy with this museum. The first floor houses the museum shops. The second floor houses an changing exhibit of another artist. The top floor houses the Picasso works which is two rooms. The first room is a series of dozens of pottery plates and a one big Picasso",
          "This museum features two other artists in addition to Picasso. There are two walls of platters which are very interesting. Lots of sketches and photos chronicalling his work but not as many major pieces as I expected to see.",
          "A nice walk through a well curated museum housing some nice art work and a wall of ceramic plates by the master. The balcony has nice views of the bay in Antibes.",
          "Wondering through the quaint town, strolling along the marina and back up the hill on top of the sea wall you can't miss the on this list of things to do in Antibes, the Picasso museum. Not the most impressive collection but the building itself and the views from the terrace",
          "We walked up the hill to the entrance and joined the line just before the lunch closure was finishing. Maybe 20 people in front of us. The cost is downright cheap, and was worth every penny. Obviously was great to see so much by Picasso in such an intimate setting, but the",
          "The Chateau Grimaldi is built upon the foundations of the ancient Greek town of Antipolis. In 1608 it became a stronghold of the Grimaldi family. In 1946 for 6 months it became the home of Picasso, Picasso donated some of his works to the museum notably his painting \"The Goat\"",
          "This place has so much potential but it is unrealised. Picasso actually lived in Antibes but there is no real background given to his life here and the Picasso works on show were disappointing.",
          "Picasso collection quite small but included showcases of his atellier. The first three floors were dedicated to a visiting colection of works by Pierre Salouge - odd to my taste. Painted with a paint brush - huge slashes of black and brown on canvas - very monotonous.",
          "The grounds of the museum are pretty cool and it has a nice view of the harbour outside. There are three \"small\" floors to the museum. Truthfully the other two floors, other than the Picasso floor, are underwhelming. But the Picasso floor (the third floor), is really cool. I",
          "I am not a Picasso lover, at least not at this stage of his art. He went to Antibes with his 25 year old mistress who was pregnant with his child. He was 65. This was really irrelevant to the quality of his art work. It appears to be very childlike, and almost unfinished in",
          "My wife loved the museum. Let's say I loved the location of the museum over looking the water the best. Unfortunately there weren't headsets that might have given some insight into the painting. Situated just outside the old town , there in public parking available underground",
          "Not exactly an art lover myself, I went with very low expectations to a gallery of an artist known for being pretty rubbish at art! I kind of saw what I expected. For \u20ac6 each we walked around in wonderment at the child-like paintings by Picasso and some other cubist painters.",
          "There is a good collection of Picasso's work here; there is also for from other artists too. The views from the terrace are stunning and there is more art outside. It was great to make the acquaintance of Picasscat who obviously lives there too! Good bookshop, clean bathrooms,",
          "We visited the museum shortly after we had arrived as it was only a couple of doors down from where we are staying. If you are a serious Picasso fan, then this may be enjoyable.. Picasso was prolific and we both felt that this museum effectively had some of the dregs of his",
          "Very fine exhibition of one of Picassos fruitful periods . he lived there for many years and donated a lot of his paintings / drawings and sculptures . to top it off the Museum is situated in an interesting castle at the sea with tremendous fews",
          "Mus\u00e9e Grimaldi is, first of all, an increbile place, ancient and imponent, it certainly has a great atmosphere. The museum itself is pretty cool, lots of works by one of the world's greatest. Prices are very reasonable, and the view from the balcony is astonishing. Totally worth",
          "Fantastic building, setting and art! Great price too at only 6 euros pp. would visit again and recommend, well worth a visit.",
          "This museum is set up on a cliffside with the most breathtaking views. Then you go into the museum and the building is gorgeous. The Picasso works themselves are limited and more from his early works. I loved it but it is not the place to see typical Picasso.",
          "This museum is worth visiting for it's beautiful garden and setting as much as the excellent collection of Picasso's ceramics and lesser number of drawings and paintings.",
          "They exhibition every scrap of Picasso they could find, but none of it is a highlight. Poor explanations. Expensive for what you get. Not much to see. Photographs are not allowed.",
          "My daughters and myself were looking forward to this. Lighting and display of the photography was poor. Too difficult to see. The collection is not exciting to me. The building is more interesting. Beautiful and on the water in ancient Antibes. It was a stones throw from where",
          "This museum is as impressive for the artwork inside, as the views of the Mediterranean Sea from the outside. The castle is amazing to look at inside and out. It is interesting to see the sketches of Picasso and his lesser known works. And you can do it all in less than 1 hour.",
          "this is such a lovely place, really clean, nicely done in a nice architectural building. the collection in the museum is amazing",
          "The Picasso museum is a lovely little museum. It does not take long at all to go through it, and if you are walking around in Antibes- it is definitely worth a visit! The walk around the museum is also beautiful and a true must when in the gem that is Antibes. A true beauty spot.",
          "Wonderful little museum with a very nice collection worth visiting. Beautiful setting. Has a permanent collection as well as traveling exhibits of other artists.",
          "First, Antibes is a gem of a sea side village, a break from the hustle and bustle of Nice. A short ride via train, an easy stroll to the port, a beautiful walk along the coast to the museum, and you are there. Of particular note is Picasso's \"Joie de Vivre\", but equally",
          "My husband and I are admirers of the great Spanish artist Pablo Picasso and never lose an opportunity to see his artworks. This museum has an interesting peculiarity: its focus is on artworks Picasso produced during the period he lived in Antibes and used this superb setting",
          "First of all I must say that the staff were universally pleasant! We visited at 5pm. There was a sign clearly stating that they could not accept cards for payments of 6\u20ac. The place was quite busy and everyone seemed happy. Different staff? Staff had training? Whatever the",
          "If you don't have much time, start at the top floor - that's where the Picassos are. We enjoyed this - there were pictures of sealife, his little owl, sea urchin. There was also a room of dozens of plates that Picasso painted. Limited collection, but different than other",
          "This was a great little find in Antibes.A few euros to enter and something to admire from everyone .A great guitar display and great views of the beautiful coast",
          "Not just Picasso. The building was interesting but other artists featured were not so nice. A lot of the Picasso collection was sketches so don't go expecting loads of famous paintings. He was actually only there for two months inn1946.",
          "Well, the museum does not offer the best paintings of Pablo Picasso, even he lived here. There is only one popular painting, and the others are sketches and photos od Pablo. But anyway, for the good view, you can enjoy everything.",
          "Imagine an antique fortress nested in the old village of Antibes. Take the access ramp, and enter the intimate Mus\u00e9e Picasso. It offers that perfect mix of historic beauty with modern art, the one resonating, echoing and enhancing the other. Because the city and the area have so",
          "The only thing who makes this museum interesting is their views. Sometimes is hard to understand why public money goes to unrelevant museums, wasting money and wasting time.",
          "In spite of some Picasso works ,the exhibition of Nicolas de St\u00e4el was closed and of course they did not inform you previously nor by internet (there is not website of the museum) nor in the entrance. very unpleasant receptionist attending the people who want to visit the",
          "I have been to about 10 different Picasso museums in many countries and this one is pretty average but for \u20ac6, this one is very reasonably priced. Good selection of paintings and some photographs by the artist as well. There are other artist displays but they are more",
          "Pouring with rain, had to que outside getting wet. Only one man serving. Lots of school children walking around. One gentleman working there was very informative and knowledgable .",
          "Worth a visit if you're a Picasso fan - but quite small. Many of the famous Picassos seem to be in London or New York but there are some interesting pieces here and some fabulous black and white photographs. Reasonable value at \u20ac6 - really great building with good views.",
          "The museum is within a beautifully renovated chateau. There are many interesting Picasso pieces plus works from some other more modern painters. Unfortunately the room with Picasso plates was closed for renovations. The outside terrace is a highlight given the view and",
          "This review should be taken with a grain of salt, because we confess immediately to not being big Picasso fans! But we like to take the opportunities we are given to broaden our horizons and perhaps learn a new appreciation forsuch a famous artist. Indeed my husband and I each",
          "Interesting display of his works plus commentary and photographs of his life in Antibez. Several other artists were represented too. It kept us busy for about an hour which would have been longer had it been sunny when we would have lingered on the wonderful terrace. A pleasing",
          "There are not a lot of \"cultural things\" to do in Antibes and it's one of them. I don't think it's worth coming solely for that as it's quite a small museum but if you happen to be around, you should pay a visit (and walk around the old town). When we visited they were updating",
          "This museum sits in the Grimaldi castle in the old town of Antibes. It is a wonderful location and well worth the visit if you are coming to the old town. However if you are coming solely to see the museum I would not recommend it as it has a limited number of paintings overall",
          "Loved our morning here, perfect intro in to Picasso time in Antibes. Beautiful gift shop and terrace... Maybe a cafe would finish of the experience",
          "The new Picasso museum deserves to be visited. Nice building, from the ground up to the third floor where the woodwork can be seen. Art collection well enhanced. Two hours there, time has flown... We strongly recommend the visit.",
          "Would highly recommend this museum. Many works and changing displays. Affordable entry charges for young and old. Expand your mind a little in a beautiful building.",
          "The building and the balcony were my favorite parts of the museum. They are beautifully located on the coast and the terrace has some fantastic sculptures. In the winter, the museum is free as the 2nd floor is closed. Half of the museum was not Picasso paintings (but still",
          "A great way to learn about the progression of Picasso's art and that of one of his contemporaries. It piqued my interest to learn more. The museum is in the former Grimaldi castle, right on the oceanfront in Le Vieux Antibes. I would have like to take some photographs (without",

          "I love this museum because I love the works of Picasso. The place is small enough to see his works in details and to spend few hours doing so. I also love the view from its terrace.",
          "We visited the French Riviera in Dec 2015 along with my family and spent a good portion of the day at Antibes - As part of Antibes, the Picasso museum was well worth the time. We started the walk around Anitbes and visited many sites including the Picasso museum. The Museum",
          "This is now my favorite of all art museums, nudging the Getty Malibu. It is a small collection, easy to see in a few hours. Admission is cheap. We visited in January, arriving just as they opened. Almost no crowd at all save a group of school kids",
          "Musee picasso is difrent from others museum. Afer new stasr is worth to visit. Buy some things in a shop. Don t miss a good choice of book about painters.",
          "Building amazing as are views. Collection is mostly work done while staying nearby, so not so exciting as other museums with his collections. Was not a first rate collection of Picassos.",
          "Apparently the most significant artist of last century, a visit to this museum will allow you to draw your own informed conclusions. Stuffed with Picasso and his contemporaries, the opportunity to confirm a bias can never be more opportune. Whether your taste supports the",
          "Although no photography is permitted inside the museum, this is a rare gem right on the Mediterranean. The extensive collection comprises paintings, sculpture, platters, freeform objects, drawings etc. - yes, all Pablo Picasso. It is a family friendly, two or three story",
          "Great find. Lots of paintings, pictures and drawings of Corbusier and Picasso. You can see the genius from beginning to finished product.",
          "This was the first time I had the opportunity to see Picasso's work. It was quite fascinating to see the places where he worked and created his art. The museum is quite small but you will easily spend there one hour or even more if you spend a bit more time focusing on the works",
          "I have visited many museums on 3 continents, but none of them carry the characters of this museum. Picaso himself worked not so far away from the place it is now the museum and one can actually visit his work area as well. I am not a big fan of Picaso or modern art for that",
          "Nice and small museum. You'll be in and out within an hour, but still worth it. The combination with the Le Corbusier drawings was awesome! Couple of noteworthy paintings and a bit of ceramics. The location is spectacular and the views are stunning. Loved to have visited this",
          "This museum offers the experience of seeing exclusive work by the Master, but also the incredible and unique location by the sea. On the balcony, you may see the sea and relax, and appreciate for a moment, what Picasso himself could feel while creating. The architecture is",
          "If it was good enough for Picasso to live in in 1946, rest assured that this wonderful castle contributes to why you must go to Antibes. Apparently, his rediscovery of colors after the nightmare darkness of WWII was aided by being in this lovely setting. The sculptures and",
          "Picasso's art covered so much for so many years that each museum has it's own story to tell and it's own way of showing his art and connection to the place. The story of his residence here after the war and what he donated is extremely interesting. if you have a chance go and",
          "We stayed in Antibes for two weeks this summer in the old town, just some hundred meter from this great museum. It is worth visiting. Picasso lived here for some important years of his life. You get the story here. And at beautiful sight of the town and the sea.",
          "My husband and I visited Antibes and the Musee Picasso on a gorgeous sunny September day. The setting, in a old castle on a hill overlooking the Mediterranean, was jaw-dropping gorgeous. We especially enjoyed the outdoor sculpture garden overlooking the sea (a number of",
          "Facing the ocean, we got unmatched ocean view from this museum, and there are some art works by Picasso in the backyard facing the ocean, it is beautiful!",
          "Personally I consider Picasso to be one of the most successful con artists of the 20th, or any other century, feeling that most of his stuff could have been done by our cat. However my wife wanted to go and, fortunately, the admission was free on the day we went. If you like",
          "Got taken here as a child and have been back a few times. One of the best Picasso museums in a stunning location with beautiful outdoor area and some of the best views. I must see, but don,t go on a Monday!",
          "great museum great view, great \u00e9poque of the arts, will go each year again and again, just difficult to reach by car and to park, otherwise a jewel",
          "Dropped in at this museum on my way back from Cannes to Nice. The museum has many exhibits of Picasso's works-his pictures taken in his atatelier after 1946, paintings, drowings, pottery he painted. From the exhibits, I could feel how he loved this small seaside town and his",
          "The Picasso Museum is not just a museum showcasing Picassos work, but it is a museum that explains Picasso's story through the eyes of a photographer. Very worthwhile! It is located in a beautiful section of Antibe, right on the Mediteranean. The museum contains Picassos",
          "The Picasso museum was a good stop on a rainy day, but the collection is limited in scope and quality. On the other hand, the fee is low, so I guess this is a case of you get what you pay for!",
          "What a treat to see so many different mediums that Picasso used. Seeing paintings on such a large scale and the amount of pottery on display is worth every minute spent in this remarkable museum. Make sure to find your way to the outdoor garden area. Beautiful views from there.",
          "Housed in the old Grimaldi Castle, this museum offers a collection of work during a period when Picasso had escaped the war years in Paris with its grim, iron-grey-German-uniform colour into a burgeoning polychrome that reaches its apogee in ceramics and the joyous dance in \"La",
          "We were staying near this museum in Antibes so naturally we heard about it and had to go. We first visited the museum on a rainy Monday however when we got there we found a sign saying it was open everyday except Monday, this was our fault for not researching it more. At the",
          "Excellent collection of Picasso's work housed in an interesting building with terrific views out to sea. Close to the centre of Antibes so can be combined with a visit to the market or old town, or an amble amongst the expensive yachts moored in the nearby marina.",
          "I did not venture in to the museum so cannot comment on this. However, the buildings themselves are wonderful and make great photos",
          "If you visit the old town of Antibes and you like Picasso, do not miss this small Museum. Most of the works are from a short period in 1946. The building itself is very impressive and the sights of the sea are very beautiful.",
          "Free at festival weekends. Shut for lunch so time your visit and busy at afternoon opening time (2pm) so may be better to visit a bit later. Well organised museum with many photos of Picasso plus various art works.",
          "As per title, I went back 3 times, every time finding something more to see, a new piece, a new exhibition. Though Picasso is not my favorite painter, I still appreciate his creativity and the museum portrays it really well in this wonderful building in the heart of old Antibes.",
          "The museum is dedicated to the master, his muse Jacqueline, and their life together. Besides Picasso paintings, I was surprised to see the amazing handmade and painted ceramics in all its beauty and variety. Note that the museum has a siesta break between 12 PM and 2 PM.",
          "A remarkable find! This museum was, for me, so inspiring. The setting is incredible and the opportunity to see art of this nature is life-changing.",
          "The Picasso Museum sits in what once was Chateau Grimaldi. The Grimaldi family, the Monaco bloodline, lived in this medieval castle until the revolution. Picasso lived here six months in 1946 and got a museum out of the deal! His creativity was intensely energetic during",
          "Located in a rather ordinary looking building, this museum is purely a showcase of Picasso's works. Some of the works were lovely but some left me wondering how in the world some people could rank him as great. Some of his art were obviously juvenile - so \"simplistic\" that",
          "Beautiful building where Picasso had his studio, and is now a showplace for many photos & collected works. Amazing view out the window of the sea.",
          "A beautiful Musee in a wonderful setting in the heart of Antibes old town. A disappointing selection of Picasso's work on show at the moment, some must be on loan since I've been here before and seen more, I especially remember there being many more of his ceramics. Interesting",
          "It is worth visiting the museum just for the building and the view from the terrace. The exhibition itself is very interesting and it gives a nice perspective of Picasso's work whilst he was living in Antibes",

          "Impressive building, nice views from terrace, but for the rest a total disappointment. Only one floor of the two with Picasso works, unchanged for years. No use of modern multimedia. And why is it forbidden to take pictures (no flash of course)? Even 16th century paintings of",

          "Difficult to find through the market but on the sea front, most amazing situation overlooking the Cote D'AZURE. sculptures by other artists mix with his paintings, drawings and thought processes in a superb environment.",
          "A splendid museum. A whole bunch of Picasso's in one place in an awesome setting. I'm not qualified to comment on Picasso other than to say the paintings are emblematic of his stay in Antibes and that is why you must go to this museum if you are there.",
          "This is a great little museum with a nice grouping of Picasso's and a few others' works. The setting is marvelous and the building is lovely. You can do it easily in an hour or two. Be sure to enjoy the sculptures outside. Recommended.",
          "Musee Picasso is located in the old city in Antibes on a high promontory that has a fabulous sea view, no doubt an inspiration to Picasso when he lived and worked there in 1946-47 time period. This is where his famous painting, Joie de Vivre, is displayed. Also, his famous",
          "Probably wasted on a philistine such as me, but meaningful to the cognoscenti. I love much of Picasso's art but I'd rather buy a book.",
          "A really nice museum, there is a big focus on Picasso's personality as he is presented by photos from an american photographer. Beautiful photos and really wonderful works of Picasso. You really kind of get to understand him after the visit haha. I totally recommend it!",
          "Really enjoyed the feel of the place. The film gave a good understanding of how Picasso worked and lived when he was in the south of France. A good variety of his work is on display. Situated in the old town in small winding streets. We parked at a nearby large parking",
          "We know better on Picasso's intimate life, his wife Jacqueline and artistic itinerary through pictures by David Duncan, his personal photographer, and numerous concise commentaries commentaries in the large and beautiful setting of Palais Grimaldi in the old town",
          "Lots of photos of Picasso and Jacqueline (his muse), Picasso's less known paintings and drafts. I think he did not intended these paintings and drawings to be seen by public, becuase you can clearly see many of them are just drafts, but they were interesting anyway. There are",
          "It feels like you are in a castle filled with all works from Picasso. It overlooks the sea and it is just gorgeous.",
          "Good pottery display but oils and other media not his best. Building interesting with wonderful views from the windows on each room. If in area worth a visit but do not go out of your way to visit.",
          "Fabulous building in a fabulous setting, chateau Grimaldi should be the first item on your list of things to see in Antibes.",
          "A little short on his better known works but worth a visit. Good wheelchair access from the seaside road.",
          "Great to walk around and enjoy Picasso works. Do watch the documentary that is playing from the start as it does give you some contect of the photographs and has some really touching stories! I really enjoyed this Musee Picasso and would reccomend its very good value for money",
          "I enjoyed some works at this museum. Didn't realize that it had some pieces by other artists than Picasso. Overall it seemed to reflect the general vibe in Antibes of a lot of ritz but not a lot to show for it.",
          "In a beautiful location, the museum is very well kept. However, there is not much artwork. Pleasant visit, but could have been better.",
          "Don't miss this museum when in Antibes! A Beautiful building, a wonderful garden and Picasso, what more can one ask for?",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to Antibes to visit the Picasso Museum. Will have liked to see more of his works but a beautiful building and some interesting things to look at. Glad we visited.",

          "Location and exhibition are amazing and very interesting. I really recommend to visit it. Unfortunately there were many visitors and some of them were too noisy and annoying. Kids and adults as well: speaking and laughing out loud, touching protection glass. Nobody from the",
          "We visited the museum at the end of August. The whole family enjoyed the museum especially my daughter who is an art student at Leeds University. There are lots of nice pieces by Picasso accompanied by some excellent photos of the man and his wife. The museum isn't solely",
          "Besides the fact that it's nicely airconditioned ;-) the museum holds a lovely collection of photographs, paintings, drawings and sculptures by/of Picasso, as well as some other (modern) artists, which my kids even loved more (especially Hans Hartung). Don't forget to walk",
          "The museum has many pieces from the time Picasso spent in Antibes in the 1940's. It is wonderful because all through it are the photos of Picasso taken by an astounding photojournalist.mdont miss the video of the photographer. It is exceptional. Also, the sculpture garden. The",
          "If you like Picasso you will love this. Could do with some more of his work but well worth a visit to this fantastic setting.",
          "Great little museum. There was a guide going around when we were there and made it really interesting. The building itself is also beautiful and the terrace offers beautiful views and photographic opportunity Well worth a visit",
          "The best Picasso museum I've ever been too - wonderful atmosphere and architecture. And my favourite painting too: Joie de Vivre. Can't go there too many times!",
          "Beautifully located and not \"too big\". Nice photos of Picasso and his wife. Collection of Picasso's art work not that big. Well worth a visit!",
          "Housed in a lovely building overlooking the bay this museum is very special. Admittedly it isn't bulging with pictures and ceramics but there are a fair number and what makes it really interesting are the pictures of the artist and his ( last?)wife, Jacqueline, at work and at",
          "Excellent experience. There is about an hour worth of art to see and they detail which portion of Picasso's life .",
          "We have been to Barcelona which is by far much more to see. Although even Antibes has a lot of pieces as well as some stories about him included several photos. I was outside the museum in 2011 - looking at the walls from the sea side(the rampart) and was impressed by some of",
          "An amazing place, must see. In the old port of Antibes, core of the old city. It is beautifully restored in a very simple and pure way that gives even more intensity and power to the work of the artists. Loved it!",
          "Even just to see a nicely converted historic chateau, the Musee Picasso is worth an hour or two of your time. The collection is a bit thin, though there are intriguing pieces nicely anchored in the location; Picasso did work in this chateau in 1946. My favorite part was the",
          "The Picasso Museum was definitely worth walking through the beautiful Antibes Old Town to visit. Lovely building too.",
          "Antibes is a lovely town to visit. If you love Picasso it's interesting to see his paintings at this little museum.",
          "As a person who has visited many museums yes this is definitely interesting and not just another museum... But if you are not seriously into arts and/or have limited time; consider to spare your time for other to-dos at Antibes...",
          "Extremely well laid out this Picasso collection is on display in the chateau museum. Picasso lived and worked her for a while,",
          "Worthwhile visit , stunning location. Make sure you watch the DVD of the photographer who lived with Picasso and documented his work. Wonderful insights",
          "The building was pretty nice, maybe more impressive than the paintings. There were a lot of sketches and photos with Picasso's story ,so I guess it would be nicer for someone with refined interest in history of art.",
          "Nice museum, not too large or expensive (eg. good with kids). Wheelchair access to the museum. Nice view over the bay from the city wall (go through the Museum).",
          "I do agree somewhat with the negative reviewers in that if you aren't a Picasso fan, you might not get much out of the artwork. There are other artists' work represented here, as well. What I enjoyed most inside was the photography exhibit, showing scenes from his life while",
          "I think it's the most popular place to visit in Antibes. I also think it's worth visiting even if you are not the biggest Picasso fan. Unfortunately part of the museum was close for visitors because of exhibition change. It's fobidden to take photos in museum but there is really",
          "To be fair I should say that I am not a big Picasso fan. But I still wanted to see this collection while on a day trip to Antibes ( probably bc of TA reviews:)). I should say that one should be really in love with all his works to find this collection interesting. Since his",
          "Located close to the sea in an old building, the Picasso museum in Antibes is an interesting mixture of old and modern. Includes many sketches of Picasso and some interesting paintings of the famous artist. The way there is also spectacular with direct view over the sea.",
          "This museum is a wonderful treat in every way. The setting is magnificent and the ancient buildings serves as an excellent backdrop for Picasso's paintings. I love the early paintings and his collection,of works of pottery. A real gem.",
          "The only complaint that I have about this museum is that they close daily for a long lunch (12:00 to 2:00). That said, wandering around Antibes for 90 minutes until it reopened, wasn't bad. The exhibition itself is small but is intended to highlight a very specific time of",
          "If you're in Antibes, this small museum - a tribute to Picasso's time in 1946 in the area - is a must. It's in a stunning location in a on the cliff tops overlooking the sea that was his studio. The museum includes his drawings, ceramics and paintings - as well as photographs,",
          "Being in Antibes and seeing the Picasso Museum we thought that we must visit. The setting is fantastic in the old castle but it must just be me. I don't get this modern art thing. Not much that was on view makes any sense to me, simply!",
          "Good if you are an art lover. My wife didn't like that she couldn't take pictures inside though. Worth a look through and good view on the terrace outside...where you can take pictures...",
          "We enjoyed this museum for its studies of Picasso. Thee were actually very few pieces of his art. The displays were nicely done and in a way, it was nice to see an entire museum. The location of the museum is beautiful overlooking the Mediterranean. Th cost is only 6 euros,",
          "A delightful small museum tucked away near the rampart of the old town at Antibes Enjoy the intimate atmosphere, and appreciate Picasso (who I find a tad derivative..shh!) in a context that does justice to his vision and love of this area",
          "This museum couldn't be in a more stunning location. I think it's a must visit when in Antibes. There are translations in English explaining the art work, which is really helpful for us sad non-French speakers. I thought the museum would be a bit larger, but it was sufficient. I",
          "I have to make a disclaimer: I am not a Picasso fan and believe he was more of a showman than a great artist. Having said that, the museum has a very limited collection of Picasso's works from his brief stay in Antibes. The ceramics are the most interesting. I even liked some of",
          "Most museums in France are closed Tuesday. This museum is an exception; closed Monday. I called Monday morning and asked if they were open and was told they were - not. No signage anywhere and people waiting outside. Finally used a handicap call box and was told they were closed",
          "On the sea... In brilliant sunshine... A beautiful building filled with early Picasso. This is a small museum but truly lovely with sea breezes blowing through the windows and views of the Mediterranean. A short walk from the market and in the middle of many places to eat or",
          "Although there were a few interesting works and photos in this museum, it was overall unimpressive. Perhaps for more of the Picasso \"history buff,\" we didn't find any quintessential Picasso pieces there. Not a lot of descriptions in English, and they don't even provide any sort",
          "The Picasso Museum in Antibes has a good collection of the great man\u2019s works, as well as a number of other painters of the same genre. But do note the opening times: they have the very annoying habit of a lot of shops and attractions in Southern Europe by closing from 12 noon",
          "Dear Mr. Pablo Picasso, I personally thought your house was delightful, however had it been up to me (coming from the UK) I would have played with the idea of a little cafe on that lovely terrace of yours. Perfect location overlooking Le Mer with a cup of coffee in ya hand. You",
          "The location and history of the building is great, but the collection was a bit sparse but good. The entry fee isn't exorbitant at 6 euros so no complaints. Worth a look see if you're in town.",
          "I stayed near train station in Nice was very convenientntomtravel,on train from Nice to Antibes.Then I took a bus up to Vallerius where there is a museum of Picasso made famous the area for his ceramics",
          "Nothing special Picasso was only here for a few weeks, so limited exhibits. Worth going when it is 'free'.",
          "Really is worth a trip ! some great paintings and some good explanations of the art! What i really liked was the Picasso ceramics really unusual to see .",
          "The building is worth a visit, however, the Picasso collection was a little weak. The museum hosts other exhibits, so check to see what the current artist is.",
          "Yes, and i have been to many. The location, the curating, the setting it cannot be beat. This represents Picasso at his best (he had a studio in the castle after WW2), linger and enjoy.",
          "Beautiful Museum, wonderful exhibits. Purchased some wonderful prints to hang in our flat in Limoux.",
          "walking past we thought we should go in \"as we're here\" and the ceramics particularly are wonderful. The building is quite special too, particularly the terrace with its views of the bay. Loos could do with some attention/cleaning and in the UK they would not have missed the",
          "On our doorstep whilst staying in old town of Antibes, so felt we must visit. Impressed by the lightness of the old building therefore giving the exhibits the benefit of natural light. Amazing number of original sketches paintings and pottery.",
          "The exhibition by the other artist was very disappointing. Picassos work was very limited and made me feel slightly disheartened. Lovely terrace though",
          "Lots of Picasso ceramics (that are not in the newly renovated Paris museum) and great location with wonderful views of the Med.",
          "The collection of Picasso paintings is OK with nothing spectacular. I was more impressed by the sketches which illustrate how he developed the shapes and forms in his paintings. The view from \"balcony\" is great and it is easy to understand why Picasso was happy to live here for",
          "This museum is unfortunately entered into Trip Advisor twice, so to see the full review visit the other entry. In short, it was an outstanding little museum, well worth the six euro admission, and really and significantly expanded my knowledge of the artist and his works.",
          "Can't beat the historic Grimaldi Palace with spectacular view of sea with great works of art from Picasso art when he lived in Antibes in 1946-?. La Joie de vivre worth a trip. In midst of old Antibes surrounded by sea views, great restaurants.",
          "We didn't know Picasso was into painting on plates. Naturally his genius shows through on whatever he did and the collection of his pottery painting was both interesting and distinctive. its also worth the strolling the ramparts to the grand house that stages the museum",
          "This is a good local museam with some great works of Picasso also some great peices of his pottery well worth a look",
          "Beautiful museum to experience the beautiful painting of Picasso. The rooms are spacious which allows you to see the painting not only close by but also with a bit of distance. It is lovely to enjoy the view on the balcony after spending some time inside.",
          "Found this an amusing experience and I want to avoid upsetting anyone with this review. Picasso was an important artist solely (for us) because of his individualism but it is fair to say that we felt there are a lot of deluded people in the world if this really is art. Maybe we",
          "The gift shop was the best part of this museum. Lovely building but a really boring collection of sketches. Disappointing.",
          "The museum is a must see, not only for the unique content, but for the beautiful views across the Mediterranean.",
          "I really have enjoyed it, while many tourist often go to St Paul for art this museum has a lot to offer and there are several galleries nearby such as the Gallerie le Cameleon",
          "I was really pleased to see works by Picasso in the place in which they were created. We see several series of works where he explores certain ideas: sea urchins and female figures in particular. I suspect that people who really know Picasso's work will find this very",

          "The Picasso museum of Antibes is basic for understanding the art of Picasso and other great artists of the early 20th century. excellently framed by the environment - the sea - the cathedral - the old city.",
          "Half of the musee is dedicated to a different artist. Some Picasso drawings and paintings that are surely not well known. A lot of experimentation with sea urchins. The best of the musee is the view of the terrace overlooking the bay and with view on the half island Cap d'",
          "Pay..then go directly out the door for the View + unbelievably great sculpture pieces...see pics I have submitted! The 2nd floor was closed & the rest of the collection is OK but not great. The veranda+art+views...Priceless Jewels!",

          "It had a great collection of Picasso's works. On the whole, even if you are not into Art, it does portray the life of an eccentric genius, and is well worth a visit",
          "A video insight into Picasso, the man, through the eyes of photographer, David Duncan was most interesting and well worth watching. The works were possibly not Picasso's best period, many being sketches. Nonetheless , this display is a great asset to Antibes. The museum is a",
          "A lovely collection of Picasso ceramics paintings and drawings from his 1946/7 period when he was based here in this lovely seaside resort. The chateau in which it is based is in a wonderful location right on the seafront. Fabulous. Not the most convenient opening hours though.",
          "It was an incredible experience to take the same stairs and look out the same windows as the great artist Picasso had done. Not to be missed if you are an admirer of his. The seaside castle holds many paintings and ceramics that Picasso himself chose for the museum. To stand in",

          "Musee Picasso displays some works of Picasso, as well as photos of Picasso and his family. Laid out over three floors and a terrace garden area, the works are interesting. It is a nice museum and it was a nice visit for me.",
          "Visited here in January 2015. We were not too impressed with the lower floors as the black and white sketches from other artists did not really appeal. There were also a lot of photographs on exhibit from a famous photographer who had captured lots of aspects of the life of",

          "Picasso lived and worked in this Grimaldi Chateau. Perched on a cliff above the harbor, the setting and chateau are breath taking. Picasso's work hangs on the walls he directed, painted for these rooms with these windows in place. Simply too enchanting to be missed. Antibes is",
          "You can tell this by the many smiling faces on his paintings and sketches on display. A great display of his genius may be seen in the wall of ceramic plates...each unique, each fascinating. Very impressive.",

          "This Picasso museum is located in an old palace that was once owned by Monaco's ruling family as it bears their name? Cool building at any rate and art collection. Prefer the one in Barcelona however.",
          "I love the old building that houses the museum and the work displayed there gives us a more thorough look at the work that he has done. Too bad we could take photos inside. I am not looking to take photos on specific work; I just want to take photos of my friends inside some",

          "Good selection of art, well-presented in a charming building....the Grimaldi Chateau. Picasso actually painted here. The rooms are well-scaled (not vast and huge) to make the visit feel intimate. The sea views from the terrace are wonderful. A very tasteful place. Don't miss it!",
          "If you're looking for more insight into Picasso's life than the paintings you see at art museum exhibits, then this is the museum for you. First off, the Chateau Grimaldi is a fabulous location for this museum. You can spend a good deal of time just staring out at the",

          "Good to see so many works by Picasso in one place, but only really covered the brief period he spent in Antibes. Loved the chateau. Would have liked more explanation in English and a better audio visual display. There is a discount for over 65s but this was not offered and",
          "This is a must-see when in Antibes. The Chateau Grimaldi is exquisite, well preserved, an optimal location for some of Picasso's best work. Outstanding sea views from the terrace and rampart leading up to the entrance. Architecturally, environmentally - a photographer's dream.",

          "Marvellous museum, one of the best on the riviera along with maeght foundation. A must to visit. Main collection very strong with great works by Picasso, supported by rotating shows.",
          "Musee Picasso is a very pleasant way to pass an hour or two. The space itself is very airy and bright, with a lovely sculpture terrace that has beautiful views over the Med and Antibes itself. Art buffs will be particularly interested in the ceramics by Picasso, which are very",
          "Enjoyable way to spend an hour or two. Located in the center of the old town on the water the Musee Picasso features an exhibit by Nicholas de Stael on the lower floors and Picasso on the top. It presented both artists well and provided an insightful look on their lives and",
          "and unfortunately didnt exceed our expectations as it had a fairly limited amount of his art work and some photographs. Building is very interesting though",
          "Museum is based in a lovely chateau Grimaldi, overlooking the sea. The bottom bit was dedicated to Nicolas de Stael, a very interesting exhibition of an artist who committed suicide in the town of Antibes. the top floor is all about Picasso, ranging from photographs taken of him",
          "It was small and easy to take in. It is next to the old city and had a wonderful collection of Picasso's work.",
          "A very well kept museum telling the story of Picasso's time in Antibes and how he worked in the studio. Also a little bit of modern art in general and some other artists of the same category and time as Picasso. Picasso's short stay in Antibes and his time at the Riviera was not",
          "Slightly disappointing that only one floor of the Piccaso museum has Piccaso works of art on it but they are well worth seeing particularly the ceramics. Also interesting photos of Piccaso at work in the museum. Spectacular views from the terrace and some interesting sculptures.",
          "There are many Picasso-museums, this one is unique as it give you insight in Picassos atelier in 1946, many of his paintings from that period, including the masterpiece \"La Joie de Vivre\" and very interesting photos by Michel Sima, but don't expect a retrospective exhibition.",
          "Really good little museum, well worth a visit especially the terrace outside the museum with fabulous views over Antibes",
          "This was disappointing. We'd visited before but forgotten how limited the Picasso collection actually is here. Lesser works, from the lesser career stages. Quite expensive, too, invariably crowded and service without a smile. There are much better places to see Picassos in this",
          "When we're in the Cote d'Azur we often visit the Musee Picasso. Although Picasso only used the top-floor studio within Chateau Grimaldi for a couple of months, it is well worth visiting to get a sense of where he worked They have a good small collection of photos of him at",
          "I always enjoy visiting the Picasso Museum at Antibes. Picasso was in an inventive and sunny mood when he was here and it shows in his marvellous and imaginative work. Leaving it behind in Antibes to the lasting benefit of the town was a fabulous gesture of thanks. And it's",
          "Picasso visited this site for a short period which is why it is now called Musee Picasso. You will find paintings and sketches that he did during his stay on the top floor of the museum. Paintings and statues from other artists are on the other floors. Personally, I would not",
          "Enjoyed seeing the sculptures on the terrace and the paintings were presented well, you will love here if you are a Picasso fan",
          "My favorite part of this museum is the outdoor area with sculptures and amazing views of the Mediterranean. The building that the museum is housed in is also very beautiful. It was not a large collection so we visited in about an hour or so but I'm so glad we did. It made for",
          "If in Antibes please visit this gorgeous museum. The view of the Mediterranean is breathtaking. The museum itself has limited art work by Picasso himself. Some say he had students make the art and then he signed them- for instance the platters. It is an intimate museum -",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the Musee Picasso. It is more intimate than some of the large museums that we visited in Paris and offers the unique experience of seeing his works of art in the place where he created them. Throughout the museum there are photographs of Picasso at work.",
          "Some of the reviews on here are rather negative ahout the picasso museum because, particularly on the lower levels of the building much of the art is from other artists. I think this is a little unfair. On the upper levels there is a substantial and impressive collection. I",
          "It is a beautiful museum, in a great location, the work is well displayed, but the collection is quite limited.",
          "For art lovers, it's a great exhibition featuring a whole floor of Picasso & other painters..educational, loved the outside terrace",
          "Don't miss this little museum in Antibes. It presents a unique insight into Picasso's working life, rough sketches, the sheer volume of his preparatory work. Vibrant colours, or pencil sketches, the work was captivating. As was the study of Picasso by a photographer who was",
          "Well worth a visit, not so much for the Picassos, which don't amount to much, but for the building and the lovely views. And it's near many other attractions in Antibes.",
          "Sweet little museum, that is just as charming on the outside, as it is inside. Beautiful views from the sculpture garden, and a nice little gift shop.",
          "A weak collection of Picasso works, not at all what I expected. Nice sculpture garden, all by other artists. Museum was overrun by groups of very loud children. The staff stood by and made no effort to keep a reasonable calm. Not recommended!",
          "This is a small and intimate museum that is easily done in an hour but is well worth the time if you are in Antibes. The sculptures in the outer couryard are fabulous and the large Picassos are interesting. There are several artists so you will not just be seeing Picasso.",
          "first of all the site, on the remparts of antibes with view on the whole bay is worth the visit. the grimaldi castle in which it is housed is quite beautiful . the museum itself is interesting, exhibiting Picasso mediums that are less known: ceramic, terra cotta, sculptures.",
          "The museum was located in a beautiful seaside location with exhibits indoors and outdoors. The exhibits were well-organized and very informative. For the Picasso exhibits, very informative placards in multiple languages, including English and French were provided. Highly",
          "Antibes is a wonderful little town with a lovely proven\u00e7al market and a promenade looking out to the beautiful yachts. The highlight is the wonderful Picasso Museum in the old Grimaldi Palace where Picasso once lived and worked. The sculptures by Picasso & Mir\u00f3 & others are so",
          "I had to return to the museum I visited 40 years ago, and it was still worth the visit. The old castle itself is worth a visit, and then different pieces of Picasso art, just great. A little disturbing was some rooms with other artists, but you can walk by if you want to",
          "A wonderful castle with great Picasso overlooking the water in Antibes! The outdoor sculpture garden overlooking the water is spectacular! The French government let Picasso live here on condition that he leave the art he created here, and I suspect it was a great deal for both!",
          "The Picasso Museum is just amazing. The museum itself is pretty incredible, so much to see. The town of Antibes is very interesting to tour, so many little curving streets. The outdoor market is well worth the visit, so many olives! The harbor has a lot of beautiful yachts",
          "My girlfriend is an artist and she was in love with this small but beautiful museum which featured some of Picasso's work along with one other local artist. The castle itself is interesting and the view over the bay is stunning.",
          "The Picasso paintings are on the second floor and are amazing. The best part to me was that the museum made Picasso the man come alive with personal history. The surrounding landscape of the Musee gives breathtaking views of the Cote d Azure. This musee is well worth",
          "This is a smallish museum where one floor of the museum is dedicated to Picasso, a one time resident who donated some works to the city. There is some interesting photographs from the period, and quite a number of his drawings as well. The terrace has several sculptures as",
          "Its a picasso museum but you can always go the the louve or the museum de orsay to see some of his paintings. The number of paintings in this museum is not that much. I suggest you go around the Marais area and enjoy the place and restaurants around it.",
          "What am amazing setting to see beautiful art! The first floor is given to other artists, most of whom lived or worked in Antibes. The works of Picasso are exhibited on the second floor and are well with a visit. The sculpture garden at the end of the visit is superb and we",
          "The Picasso works were wonderful and I felt that I left with a better understanding of the artist. However vast space is given to other artists hence my four star rating. It's in a great building, worth the walk!",
          "The beautiful Grimaldi castle host the Picasso Museum, in the old city of Antibes. You can easily reach it by foot from the train station through the vieil Antibes (15 min). Close to plage de la Gravette (7 min by foot) on the left and to plage du Ponteil on the right (10-15 min",
          "We had a day visit to here whilst in Nice and popped in to the museum. excellent collection. Good introduction in English to Picasso and his involvement in the area. Some interesting pieces of work with good explanations. I really enjoyed the ceramics. Worth a visit.",
          "Wondeful, as ever, to see some pieces I've mostly seen on posters etc. Lovely buildong (chateau) which lets the light in, in all the right places.",
          "It is a very interesting place in Antibes. In addition to the work by Picasso, the museum also featuring the work from many other artists about the same time of Picasso. It looks like this is the time and place that Picasso transformed into the Picasso we mostly know today.",
          "This museum has some nice pieces and some strange ones I have never seen before. It does not hold a candle to the one in Paris that is STILL under renovations. But will do when the other is not available.",
          "The museum is great and you can see the beautiful paints of Picaso and other arts. I really recommend the visit in the Old Town of Antibes. The view is stuning!",
          "due to the fact that you can see Picasso works frequently, we were particularly pleased to find a small but nice selection of Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl works .. the castle is situated in the old town of Antibes and offers a great view over the bay and the snow-topped Alpes from its",
          "Lovely building, not the greatest museum but an insinght into the artist's work. The town of Antibes however is wonderful, something for everyone if you like boats this is the place to go, one of the largest marinas in Europe. A great place to capture the light that draws so",
          "The views around here are stunning! We visited, but did not have enough time to visit the museum itself. There are wonderful places to eat around here, and a fantastic fresh food market as well. Note the market closes a little early, so make sure to get there on time. I have",
          "It is not all Picasso and the building itself is lovely. Worth a visit if you have time, but an hour is probably long enough.",
          "The building itself is beautiful. Decent collection of Picasso works. Works by other artists are a mixed bag. Interpretation of the art could be better. A nice way to spend an hour if you have it, but strolling around beautiful Antibes may be more enjoyable.",
          "Its no Barcelona Museum but it is a nice insight into the work he did while he was living in Antibes! The building is beautiful and the views are stunning!! Think it was bout 6euros. Check opening hours before you make the mission",
          "A lovely small museum, including some original Picasso works. There are also works of other artists. It was free to enter, but there should be no photos allowed. I do not appreciate a lot a what Picasso produced, although I have been to many collections of his work, but I",
          "Lovely to visit a location where Picasso produced many of his artwork. Museum has many of Picasso's original (and even unfinished work) and pieces donated by his daughter Jacqueline Picasso. Would probably recommend 1-2 hours here, but only if you've seen much of Antibes",
          "I like the view from terrace, the museum itself is less interesting than I expected. Picasso lived in this house for 4 month, and museum has his work for this period.",
          "The sculpture garden is small but very enjoyable. View is terrific. Building is wonderful. Very limited hours. Half of the building noises a contemporary selection, not Picasso.",
          "Here is an example of 'The kings new cloths'; really poor work perporting to be art. In and out of this exhibition within 20 minutes. In fact the location and architecture of the gallery is more interesting and more artistically rewarding than the wall hangings. At 6 euro each",
          "We expected a major display of Picasso's work from other descriptions about the museum, but there are only a few pieces which we thought show his true talent. The rest were mostly preliminary or minor pieces. Maybe it is the largest collection, but not the best. Works on display",
          "the other exhibits were just pedestrian. The Picasso was OK, but only one worthwhile piece, La Joie de Vive. Gift shop boring. But going to see the long faced gentleman in the uniform who could be a great character actor is worth the trip.",
          "Not a huge fan of Picasso but those who are will love this museum for the art and biographical info. Non-fans will like the historic building and the fabulous views. And it's only a short walk to the nearest cafe for a refresher afterwards.",
          "We went in early Sept 13, it was overcast/drizzly rain so we got the train from Mandelieu La Napoule to Antibes. It was straightforward following the signs from the Station. Th Museum is fairly cheap about 7Euros each. Picasso worked here after WW2 and there is a lot to see. The",
          "The museum itself is very interesting because it's located next to the sea; it was once a medieval fortress. There are many paintings paying homage to Picasso. His works can be found near the end of your exploration of the museum. The cost of entry is relatively inexpensive",
          "We were there in late September and bought our tickets at the door since they were not available on line. Only 6.00 euro a piece. This price would be worth just to get in to go thru the beautiful Grimaldi castle and take in the splendid view of the Med! However, the exhibits are",
          "There are many museums around Europe dedicated to Picasso. This is set in a medeival fortress, overlooking the azur blue Mediterrean sea. Picasso worked here in 1946 and 1947, during a very productive time of his long life. The artist's studio is the main hall of the museum,",
          "The museum displays paintings, drawings, ceramics, statues mainly made by Picasso in a relatively short period of time just after the second world war when he lived in Antibes and worked in this building. There's also a great collection of photographs from the time. Besides",
          "The most interesting part of the museum is the photos of Picasso when he was actually working in the museum. If one is an art fan, this would be a great museum to visit",
          "small museum really only for Picasso enthusiasts as only covers a very limited range of his work. some good exhibits and some very interesting bronzes and sculptures form other artists. But the toilets were horrible, smelly, overflowing bins, wet floors and no paper. Not what",
          "This is the sort of museum where the building, it's history and location are actually more interesting than much of the art on display! There are some great sketches of fauns and nymphs by the man himself ,along with several paintings of plates of fish and squid, inspired it",
          "The museum displays his early work as well as some ceramic works. It's not as spectacular as one might hope, but the building is glorious as is the view of the ocean.",
          "Not as much Picasso exhibits as I had hoped but well worth a visit in the fortnight we spent in Antibes",
          "I'm not a huge art fan, but having caught part of a TV programme on artists in Antibes a few weeks before we went, it was on my mind to visit the museum. It is well laid out with useful arrows pointing you in the right directions. There wasn't as much work by Picasso as I'd",
          "While not a huge Picasso fan, I enjoyed a leisurely half-hour wander through the lovely historic building. The plate collection is great, and some outdoor sculpture on the terrace has a lovely setting overlooking the sea. While not a \"must see\" for me, it would be careless not",
          "It's cute, small and interesting. Very nice position of museum. Beautiful view and the building. But if you expect like totally cool art inside, you shouldn't. It would be stupid not to check it if you spend some time in Antibes...",
          "More contemporary than Picasso's on display. Worth a visit but there were quite large queus even off season.",
          "Its a pretty walk along the seaboard of Antibes. Excitement wells,as you near the Grimaldi Chateau edifice. It sits where the old town meets the sea,offering excellent views from its compact three floors. Inside Picasso enthusiasts are offered a feast of the maestro's",
          "There is some very interesting art, but this is a small museum. If you really want a larger Picasso museum then you need to go to Barcelona. On the other hand, if you happen to be on the Cote d'Azur, this is a lovely place to spend some time. The museum has a spectacular view",
          "The building itself is beautiful. That nice yellowish/orangey stone against the deep blue sky and the view of the sea from the large terrasse is enchanting. The rest of the museum--\"shrug\". It isn't that great. Let me talk about the good aspects first. The few sculptures are",
          "I don't want to write a negative review. However a man work at a reception was so rude! Just said 12Euro.He's so impolite. Just visit other Picasso museum.Malaga,Barcerona. It's the worst experience to visit a museum.",
          "very small museum in a small historic builing right by the water with stunning views across to Cap d'Antibes. Not a retrospective on Picasso but a good selection of works that he created while working there. mainly line drawings, a few pieces of pottery, only a couple of his",
          "This is a great museum in that it has a lot of work from Picasso's time in the actual space so you can feel his inspiration and the work is distinct from a lot of his other work you might be familiar with. There are also a ton of photographs on display of his working there",
          "While this museum does not have much Picasso artwork, a fan of Picasso will appreciate the opportunity to see where he worked and the stark building is quite beautiful. Other international museums house more representative works, but I would still recommend a visit for the",
          "For what's call the picasso museum I was very disappointed. Out of the three small floors only one had works from Picasso. The other main issue I had is all the work is from the late 40's so was all synthetic cubism. No analytical cubism, nothing from his blue or pink period",
          "We stopped in Antibes for a day trip to the beach and were a little ambivalent about seeing the museum at all, but as we virtually stumbled across it and it was located in such an impressive building, we decided to give it a look. Not a total loss, because with Picasso you'll",
          "It's be the sea and the view is astonishing! Given it's Picasso, the selection is good, but don't expect to compare with the Picasso Museum in Paris.",
          "Arrived at 11.40am to be told that the museum shut at 12.00pm to 2pm. We only wanted to have a quick look round and the jobworth door just shrugged and said 'poofff'",
          "Beautiful setting but what a poor collection of paintings. You have to be a real Picasso fan to appreciate them. The outdoor area contains some interesting sculptures but that was the best bit. Some lovely views of the alps from the terrace. Some works by other artists I did",
          "Most of the works are from the time that Picasso lived in Antibes which was not very long, so it is not a real overview. But if you like museums and like Picasso it is worth a visit, Fairly small considering his whole oeuvre but sill fine to add to your art knowledge. I was",
          "The old Grimaldi Castle is where one finds Picasso in Antibes, although in the '20s he used to hang out nearby in Juan-les-Pins with other Bohemians. Other 20th c. artists are featured on lower floors, while many of his, plus photos of him in his studio, can be found on the top",
          "You get a double pleasure at this museum, seeing not only Picasso's work from a very specific period during the war years, but also a medieval chateau transformed into a modern museum. There were two other temporary exhibitions Hans Hartung and his wife, and then Jean Blais,",
          "The Chateau Grimaldi is worth a visit for the location and the building. It's right on the sea with lovely views and has been attractively adapted as a museum. For us the Picasso association - seeing where he worked for a few months - was more interesting than the collection",
          "The mus\u00e9e is housed in an old Grimaldi castle that was build in the 1300+ over ancient greek ruins. That by itself was special. To learn the history of Picasso in that museum, how he spent 2 months there using part of the musee as his workshop and how he paid them back gives you",
          "the museum is amazing, the picasso paintings and setting by the sea are superb in the ancient city of antibes",
          "The walk along the old wall along the Mediterranean Sea led us to the Picasso Museum and former Grimaldi Castle. Such a magnificent view of the turquoise coloured water dotted with sail boats and fishing boats. The staff, from first to last, was most curteous, friendly, and",
          "When you walk the street of old Antibes, you cannot miss the 16th-century chateau des Grimaldi overlooking the mediterranean sea. On the last floor, it houses a small but remarkable collection of ceramics from Picasso. On the 2nd floor, you will discover many pictures of the",
          "Whenever we are in the area, I make it a point to visit this fine, small museum where we once painted. This former castle is spectacularly located and has a terrace overlooking the Mediterranean with ledges holding fine sculptures by Gerard Richier. Instead, Picasso's wall of",
          "cool and cheap, amazing view! Its not a huge museum but it still a pretty good size and some of the piece of arts are real cool. I liked the history and the architecture of the building.",
          "Antibes is a place you should see. It is a pastoral, lyric, French place which you will enjoy very much. I didn't know Picasso lived there and there was a museum of Picasso when I went there. So Musee Picasso was the bonus of my day in Antibes. It is not an extraordinary museum",
          "Interesting selection of Picasso's work created at Chateau Grimaldi. Lower levels house contemporary art from the 20th century and there's an outdoor sculpture area. Museum is located close to the old town, market, and there a plenty of nice restaurants and cafe's near by which",
          "It wasn't until we had made it to the third floor that I whispered to my husband, \"They don't have any of his good stuff here.\" To which he replied, \"Like what kind of stuff were you looking for\" and I said, \"You know, like the melting clocks\" to which he said, \"Do you mean",
          "This museum is in an old chateau overlooking the Mediterranean. Beautiful views; beautiful museum. Not a large museum, but just the right size for a break. Picasso lived and worked here for about six months. Very inspiring setting.",
          "This was my first visit to this museum, so it was just a taste before I come back and spend some more time. The location in the old palace - built on the site of the Greek acropolis back when Antibes was Antipolis - is good, and even if this was in the middle of January the",
          "The 1 euro, 1 hour, bus journey from Nice to Antibes reveals the depressing over-development en route, once you pass Nice Airport and enter the graffitti-stained suburbs. We got off at the tourist office in Antibes and they helped us with maps. We had a coffee at the Place De",
          "This is such a pleasant museum and a must see in Antibes. It was wonderful to know Picasso stayed at this site and created on the shores of Antibes. Other artists were also displayed."

        "wiki": "Perfume (\u30d1\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0, Pafy\u016bmu) is a Japanese pop girl group from Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan, consisting of Ayano Omoto (\"Nocchi\"), Yuka Kashino (\"KASHIYUKA\") and Ayaka Nishiwaki (\"a-chan\"). The group has been signed with Amuse, Inc. since 2003 and with Universal Music Group since 2012.\nThe group was formed in early 2000 inside the young talent academy Actors School Hiroshima and debuted with their first Hiroshima-local single \"Omajinai Perori\" released on March 21, 2002. A year later they moved to Tokyo, started to work with Capsule's producer Yasutaka Nakata, and released their first nationwide indie single, \"Sweet Donuts\" on August 6, 2003. In 2005, they made a major contract deal with Tokuma Japan Communications and released their major debut single \"Linear Motor Girl\" on September 21.\nIt was not until 2008 when the group's seventh single \"Polyrhythm,\" which was chosen as the theme song of a recycle campaign by NHK, that they started to receive major attention in Japan. The single peaked at number seven on the Oricon charts, becoming their first Top 10 single in Japan, and since then, all of their subsequent works starting with their eighth single \"Baby Cruising Love\" have debuted within the Top 5 of the charts.\nPerfume's first original studio album, Game, released on April 16, 2008, became their first number one album in Japan, and \"Love the World\", released on July 9, 2008, became their first number one single. With roughly combined sales of both singles and albums, the group has sold over 5 million records.\nThe group was formed with an original post-Shibuya-kei sound and later transitioned toward contemporary electronic dance music that incorporated elements of synthpop, bubblegum pop, dance-pop, techno, and house music. The group is also known for their heavily processed vocals, making clever use of autotune, Harmony Engine, and vocoders. Over the years, Perfume has been one of the most successful acts in Asian music. The group's musical structure has been identified as technopop.\nIn 2012 the group announced that they had signed a global contract with Universal Music Group, and that they expected to expand their horizons and \"go global.\" Their sixteenth major label single \"Spending All My Time,\" released on August 15, 2012, was seen as a dedication to fans overseas. Their fourth studio album Level 3 was released on October 2, 2013, and was soon followed by \"Sweet Refrain\" a month after, serving as the lead single for their fifth studio album Cosmic Explorer, which was released on April 6, 2016, and selected as one of \"20 Best Pop Albums of 2016\" by Rolling Stone. Their sixth studio album Future Pop was released on August 15, 2018.\n\n\n== Members ==\nPerfume members use their official nicknames on stage and TV rather than their real names.\n\n\n=== Current ===\n\n\n=== Former ===\nYuka Kawashima left the group to pursue her studies. She later joined another group called Risky and then attempted a solo career as Yuka. She graduated from the Hiroshima University of Economics in 2011. She now lives in Hiroshima and works at YNN47.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nBecause Ayaka Nishiwaki (\"a-chan\"), Yuka Kashino (\"KASHIYUKA\"), and Yuka Kawashima (\"Kawayuka\") had the same Japanese kanji character for \u9999 (ka / kaori, fragrance) in their names, they named the group \"Perfume\" (\u9999\u6c34 (kosui) in Japanese). The original name was \"\u3071\u3075\u3085\u301c\u3080\" or \"\u3071\u3075\u3085\u2192\u3080\" written in hiragana with thirteen strokes. Nishiwaki stated that they wished to follow the success of four-member dance group Speed (thirteen strokes in uppercase), who trained at Okinawa Actors School.\nDue to Kawashima's exit and Omoto's entry, they gave a new meaning to this name. When asked why they chose it, Nishiwaki replied, \"The fragrance of perfume can soothe your feelings or make you feel happy. We aspire to be such artists.\" In spring 2003, they moved to Tokyo and joined the management agency Amuse, Inc.. Then the management changed the group name to English. They wanted to keep the hiragana name associated with their heroines, SPEED, but eventually acquiesced. Omoto later said, \"The powers-that-be are scary.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2000\u20132003: Formation, early career development and local recognition in Hiroshima ===\nIn 2000, Nishiwaki, Kashino, and Kawashima voluntarily formed the group inside young talent academy Actors School Hiroshima (ASH) run by TSS Production, a subsidiary of TSS-TV Co., Ltd., formerly called Shinhiroshima Telecasting. Before the group could even debut, Kawashima decided to pull out of the project as she left ASH (and later formed another group called Pinkies). Nishiwaki set out to find a replacement, and Ayano Omoto (\"NOCCHi\") joined as the third member. The three girls attended ASH as part of the inaugural class of 1999.In March 2002, Perfume debuted in Hiroshima with the single \"Omajinai Perori.\" They followed up the release with \"Kareshi Bosh\u016bch\u016b\" in November of that same year. Both singles were sold in Hiroshima under Momiji Label.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the last show of the \"Perfume 8th Tour 2020 'P Cubed' in Dome\" tour at Tokyo Dome on February 26 was cancelled, following the recommendations of the Health Ministry of Japan.\n\n\n== Musical style and image ==\nThe group's music, on several occasions, has been identified as \"technopop\". It was around 2005 that the group's original post-Shibuya-kei sound began making a transition to electronic dance-pop music, influenced by 1980s synthpop and incorporating vocoders.Perfume has worked with producer and songwriter Yasutaka Nakata since 2003. \"We don\u2019t really have any input when Nakata is writing and the ideas behind Future Pop, and all our music, are his,\" the group told Forbes. \"Nakata\u2019s been writing songs for us that match the specific time of our lives so that the music has actually matured with us.\"MTV Iggy said \"There are a few reasons why Perfume is one of Japan\u2019s most thrilling pop acts. For one thing, there\u2019s the music, which is an infectious batch of chart-topping melodies built upon a foundation of intricate maximal house production that would give Daft Punk a run for their money, with heavily processed vocals that stutter robotically yet always sound 100 percent human. On top of that, they have an impeccably designed retro-futuristic image and punishing, innovative choreography that they nevertheless render effortless. Where all of this truly comes together, of course, is on stage.\"The group has influenced acts like Aira Mitsuki, immi, Mizca, SAWA, Saori@destiny, Sweet Vacation, 80_pan and former labelmate Vanilla Beans.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nGame (2008)\n\u22bf (2009)\nJPN (2011)\nLevel3 (2013)\nCosmic Explorer (2016)\nFuture Pop (2018)\n\n\n== Media appearances ==\n\n\n=== Movies ===\n[2011.06.24] Cars 2 - as background music at the party in Tokyo (\"Polyrhythm\")\n[2011.09.23] Moteki\n[2015.10.31] WE ARE Perfume -WORLD TOUR 3rd DOCUMENT\n\n\n=== Television ===\n[2006.07 - 2007.03] PaPaPaPaPaPaPerfume\n[2008.01 - 2008.03] Speciaboys Japan\n[2008.04 - 2008.09] HAPPY!\n[2008.10 - 2009.03] Perfume no Ki ni Naru Ko-chan\n[2009.04 - 2009.06] Perfume no Chandelier House\n[2009.04 - 2016.04] MUSIC JAPAN\n[02.14.2010]  American Dad: May the best stan win.

Marty Friedman named Perfume \"the group that has the largest influence on the Japanese music industry in 2008\", and covered their 5th major single Polyrhythm in the album Tokyo Jukebox. Musicians such as Kreva, Pierre Nakano from the band Ling tosite Sigure, and Aya Hirano are all fans of the group Utamaru from a Japanese hiphop group Rhymester and Okite Porsche from a new wave band RomanPorsche., who are both enthusiastic idol fans, declared that they were Perfume fans in the early stage of activities of the group and made a \"25000 letter dialogue\" over Perfume phenomenon on Yomiuri Shimbun Pop Style blog. Kimura Kaela played Perfume songs in heavy rotation in her radio program \"Oh My Radio!\" (J-Wave 81.3), which led them to appear in NHK and AC Recycling Ads.  After their cameo in OK Go's video for \"I Won't Let You Down\", lead singer Damian Kulash revealed he was a fan via Instagram.On Nico Nico Douga, the most visited Japanese video sharing site (similar to YouTube), MADs featuring Perfume songs and The Idolm@ster videos, were created, which led the album to number 1 status on Amazon.co.jp's music bestsellers. Some Internet media consider this as one of the factors for Perfume's net-based popularity at first.\nOn the July 2007 ranking of Niconico Ichiba, or Niconico market, where users can introduce and buy goods related to videos, Perfume: Complete Best was ranked as number 1 and \"Fan Service: Sweet\" as number 7.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPerfume Global Site\nPerfume Official Site (in Japanese and English)\nUniversal Music Group Artist Page (in Japanese)\nTokuma Japan Communications Artist Page (in Japanese)\nPerfume discography at Discogs\nPerfume discography at MusicBrainz\nAMUSE Profile Site\nPerfume on Spotify",

You can also stop and mix up your own fragrance near the end, and it's included in the entry fee. Of course the fragrances that I liked the best are really old and not produced anymore.",

          "I loved this place. It has interactive displays where you can smell different smells, tons of perfume bottles, explanation of how perfume is made with vintage films to illustrate, great explanation stations for children, and even a little herb roof garden. I actually came here",
          "We paid 3 euro each as students, regular price is 4 euro. I highly recommend to anyone visiting Grasse. Absolutely beautiful setup and display. Very informative and interactive. Well worth the money! Plus they had tons of kids things to keep them busy, of course as adults we",
          "This was a great museum - excellent disabled and pram access! The displays were interesting and designed to keep children and adults interested. The displays took you through the history of perfume, perfume making, bottles and carring cases. I found the modern perfume top",
          "If you're in Grasse its probable that you know its perfume history therefore it goes without saying you're going to visit the international museum. I didn't know what to expect but it was nice to smell the flowers etc that go into making the perfumes that we're all familliar",
          "Our visit to here to the Musee International was very interesting and informative. The tour guide had very good English and knew her craft well. I definitely came away from there knowing a lot more about perfume than I did going in.",
          "Here you get to smell the fragrances of the real Flowers from which these world class perfumes are manufactured. Plus the historic importance of the Perfume Industry is preserved in top form. A Must Visit...it will relax your aromatic senses !!!",
          "This is an interesting place to visit if you are around. Tells you a bit of the story of perfume with some tactiles experiences. How ever it`s not a big place and won`t take you more than 1 hour to go around everything.",
          "It's not a big museum but it's nicely done and plenty of audiovisual displays and things you can smell! You can go through in less than an hour, or less than two hours if you want to take in more information (and nice smells).",
          "Very informative, hands on displays. Something for everyone. We loved it. Good value for money. See this before you do the fragrance factory tours and workshops.",
          "This is a well-planned and fascinating museum for anyone even vaguely interested in perfumery, its history, and its manufacture. Especially appealing are the frequent interactive kiosks for children - a rare thoughtfulness in French museums.",
          "I was staying in Nice and heard of this museum so I decided to give it a go. It was very informative and really interesting to understand the history of perfume and the process of making it.",
          "We went on Sunday 3rd Jan at around 13.15. Lunch time. So it wasn't too crowded. The Museum goes through the entire history of perfumes and the pots and vases used to store them. I would have probably been done with seeing everything in 2 hours. But my boyfriend who pays",
          "Wasn't too sure when I visited with friends this summer but what an interesting and well designed museum.Might miss the video in the first room unless surreal makes you smile(we enjoyed it but it was odd).lots to see and smell and interact with,fun for all ages.",
          "It takes ~1.5-2 hr to really go through the entire exhibit inside the museum. I found the visit prior to the perfume workshop at Galimard Studio particularly helpful in providing some historical context and also chemistry behind the industry.",
          "Very interesting experience, also suitable for children. My 5-y-o really enjoyed the interactive spots, where she found games and small stories. And for the adults is equally enjoyable, with lot of information and the possibility to smell unusual scents.",
          "I came here for the day from Nice on the 500 bus fare \u20ac1.50. a great ride for the money through the lovely colourful country side which is at its best this time of the year. I had something to eat and then decided to visit the museum, only \u20ac4 entry and well worth is. You see",
          "If you read the Perfume Book you cannot loose this visit. All in the place make us feel the smelling human capacity and transport us to the world of senses.",
          "We were looking forward to this museum and did not disappoint us! We traveled 1,500 kilometers and Rivera while visiting France - Provence is worth visiting this beautiful city of Grasse and museums. There is another museum Fragonard. perfumes and seeing the experience.",
          "Lots to see and learn about perfume making through the ages. Would have liked some more hands on demonstrations perhaps bringing the mixing to life? Masses of exhibits and pretty cheap to get in. Parking in Grasse was more challenging and we found a multi storey which meant a",
          "Reader alert: we didn't enjoy this visit. First, finding a parking place was difficult. They have a large garage across from the museum but it's entrance is cleverly disguised so that you can see it only when coming from one direction. From the other direction, from which we",
          "I definitely enjoyed visiting this museum, I learned all sorts of interesting perfume-related facts, though I did find it lacked interactivity, to a degree -- and I would really have enjoyed making/mixing my own perfume over visiting the museum.",
          "Set in a pretty modern building (internally) this Museum takes you through the smells and sights of perfume through the ages. Well worth the (relatively) small admission price for a lovely thing to do. Also well worth sitting in the Orangery to cool down and smell the aromas!",
          "We have been staying in nearby Frejus and were told about this museum from a friend who had been here before. I am not the museum type of person and a perfume museum would certainly not rank high on my list for sure! The entry price was a very reasonable \u20ac6 per person and, by",
          "I really wanted to like this place - we've always enjoyed the Fragonard visit next door, and this is Grasse after all, centre of the perfume world. But on a hot day in August it seemed to be struggling to cope with the number of visitors, despite being a large volume attraction.",
          "In a modern bulding, evething in place, well organized. Lots of things to see, you can learn about parfum history through times. We found it interesting",
          "Very interesting insight into the history (ancient and modern) of perfume manufacture. Allows visitors to get up close with some of the fragrant contents and there's a little \"test\" at the end to challenge your olfactory abilities. The gardens are very nice too. Worth a visit",
          "This place was absolutely amazing. We were so impressed and just steeped in history. I think we spent well over two hours there, which is a first, but completely worth it.",
          "Me and my friends went to this museum just because (if you go to Grasse you gotta go to the museum blablabla) and turns out the museum is super interesting. It has smells for everything, (i mean, really, everything), has the story of parfum, the way they fabricate pafums then",
          "Other reviews have called this place a confusing attraction. I disagree. Visitors should expect to learn about perfume/scent as well as the history of human ideas of physical/bodily beauty. The curators have actually done a great job of making something fairly academic into an",
          "You can see and smell all sorts of plants from which they extract the essences for the perfumes, all kinds of instruments and recipients used throughout time and all the purposes perfume was used. There is also a small little garden to reset a few minutes in the outside air. It",
          "Perfume, or as the French call it, \"parfum\" offers so much more than fragrance. It is a vehicle of high fashion and can transport one back to their most enjoyable experiences given its ability to instantly revive memories. The historical Perfume Capital of the World is perched",
          "Loved this museum - it has been brilliantly thought out with so many experiences for young and older. The contemporary architecture looks stunning against the 18th century building. There are all sorts of interactive displays - again both for adults and kids. Particularly loved",
          "This was a nice view into the manufacturing of perfumes and soaps (a changing exhibition at the time of my visit was about soap making). The museum was nice and modern with interesting scent experiment opportunities along the way. Reserve enough time to enjoy the whole round",
          "We went to the museum on our visit to Grasse. It was fun that you could smell odours at different places, especially at a special garden. Our 5 year old son loved this. He also loved the play things for kids througout the exhibition. We loved the fact that they explained a lot",
          "Loved the building in which this museum is housed - part grand old house where once Napoleon's sister stayed combined with an ultra modern glass extension at the back. Very impressive and old meets new in a clever and intriguing way. Entrance fee was reasonable - children are",
          "The museum was fine but it lacked scientific information about the production of perfume and is more suited to children.",
          "Lots of interesting things to see and smell but the audio guide went on a little and provided a bit too much for a near teenager.",
          "Formally a perfume fractory now converted to a museum this is a great place to start the discovery of Grasse",
          "Really enjoyed this very reasonably priced attraction. The architecture of the building is very clever. The exhibition is also well thought out to keep everyone's attention. I did however get a bit bored of seeing so many scent bottles. Worth a visit though.",
          "I'd promised my students that I'd visit the Perfume Museum after they'd seen it on one of those Lonely Planet programs. Not that I'm in the least bit interested in perfume but a promise is a promise. To say I was pleasantly surprised is a gross understatement. I was, quite",
          "I loved it. The history of perfume from the Romans, Egyptians through the middle ages, the renaissance and to the modern era. Just fascinating!",
          "I enjoyed this because they included everything in English and other languages. There was no hard sell at the conclusion and you could even take photos without a flash",
          "This is a museum of perfumery and is pretty comprehensive, we loved learning about all the different aspects and seeing the old perfumery items beautifully displayed. They have a garden outside Grasse too but we didn't visit it",
          "Surprisingly it was interesting and informative at the same time.definitely worth a visit. The final exhibition where they display the perfumes through the ages is captivating.",
          "Doesn't worth a trip to visit it. But if you are around, it's one more tourist option in the region. Grasse is a small city with narrow roads, so It's not easy to park a car. The museum presents some interesting facts about sent and perfumes as well as ancient french habits.",
          "Of you ever asked yourself why/how/when/for who.. you want to smell, good or bad, take a time to visit this place. And take your time too, then there is a lot to read, hear, admire, and of course to smell. I had the luck to follow a guide, who was able to make my fellows",
          "A pleasant enough way to spend an hour in the pretty town of Grasse. The history bits are the most interesting and some of the interactive smell dispensers are fun. On the downside there are far too many perfume bottles on display! The staff, especially at the entrance, are",
          "I'm used to visiting art galleries and looking at ways artists use colours on canvas. This museum tries to help you make scents (apologies) of the ways different smells can be artistically combined to produce very different emotional responses. Quirky, amusing, interesting, with",
          "This is a good overview of the perfume industry but very little is in English. The perfumes of the year are interesting as are all the bottles. Scent machines throughout the building are cool but sometimes don't work. Lots of distillation equipment to see and if you understand",
          "We had not planned to visit this museum but found our way here partly due to us trying to escape a horrendous downpour that we had not expected. However, I must admit we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The Museum is actually much bigger than it looks from initial appearences from",
          "No scent is ignored, no manufacturing process not explained. Beautiful life size pictures show production in the glorious old days. When perfume was distilled mostly from natural flowers. Warehouses full of them. The outstanding displays include the first perfume bottles of all",
          "Well this is of interest to adults but not so for young children. We went with two girly girls aged 9 and 10. I think most of it washed over them. To be fair there is a lot of interaction and buttons to press but in reality I would suggest go on a rainy day with kids. If it's",
          "This pretty museum is an odd mish mash. The design is nice but the exhibits are fragmented and incoherent. There is a sensory room... but no description of what to expect. We had a 3 yo child so didn't brave it. There are ancient mummy hands but no description of where the",
          "A lovely museum - well designed and thought thru. Some of the exhibitions didn't work but not so many that it was irritating. The 'press the button and smell' gadgets were really good if a bit amusingly overpowering at times. Included in the museum is the history of bottles and",
          "The additional temporary show which makes the price rise from 3 to 6 \u20ac is honestly not worth it (even if, as a student, you can have 50% discount and the staff at reception is very kind and helpful). It's just a room with some photos of the history of bath (though interesting,",
          "I didn't what to expect when I visited Grasse, the town of perfume, so obviously my first stop was this museum. I was truly surprise on how they teach you and educate your nose to the different scents. The building itself and the renovations were quote interesting to me, but the",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this museum and spent longer there than we expected. It traced the development and use of perfumes from Egyptian and Roman times through the middles ages and every era up to the modern day. It also described the perfume making process, although we had",
          "If you are in Grasse for perfume this museum may interest you. It is not a shopping mecca like Fragonard but a beautifully crafted experience about the history, business, and art of perfume.",
          "This s a lovely museum set in one of the nicest parts of the South of France. You can find out everything you need to know about how perfume is made and about this part of France and it is great fun because t is very interactive. You can spend all day here and get lovely",
          "A very nice museum but in the end of a day maybe boring. It presents a lot of interesting things from the parfume production but there is a lot of space for improving the site in a light of presenting the production, real smell and real tourch of parfume. Otherwise a nice and",
          "Grasse is the centre of the perfume industry for the world. If you know nothing about the manufacture of perfume with its attendant printing, packaging and manufacturing industries, you will when you come out of this museum. The entrance is round a side street separate from the",
          "If compared with one of the nearby Parfumeries, MIP offers much improved variety and an array of interesting attractions including visual, interactive, historical and sense of smell features as well as a herb garden and mandarin grove. Takes a good hour and is well worth the \u20ac4",
          "Room after gloomy room of mostly dull artefacts, interspersed with some excellent ideas, such as live plants, a cinema to awaken one's sense of smell, machines that puffed out all sorts of different smells on demand and tubes of smell soaked clay. Initially thought that the",
          "It took us a bit over 2 hours to visit this beautiful museum with the self audio guide. It is very structured with lots of information. The is a historic part and a more instructive part with plants, essences, ecc. which allows you to interact. There is a public parking",
          "It is a very structured Museum that tells the history of perfume and its various functions for humanity. There are several rooms where you can interact with the numerous odors. Besides it shows the growing importance and sophistication of bottles and glassware in the history of",
          "Excellent site to visit. A tour of how perfumes are made from Antiquity to nowadays. A rich museum, but you need to read by yourself the panels.",
          "There is a broad Collection of different parfumebottles which is interresting. Even more interresting is the history and development of parfumes from antique religious rituals and folk medicine to modern cosmetics. You learn how different herbs were used and later Spices from",
          "This was not worth the 5 euros admission! Many exhibits were broken and the interactive smells were empty in many cases. The acoustiguide was not well coordinated with the room numbers so the descriptions had nothing to do with the exhibit in front of you in many instances.",
          "If you plan to visit Grasse only go to this museum if your in the mood for laugh. We where 8 people and we strolled round for a moment sniffing on different smells and looking at bottles and pictures and tried to get some red line in the exhibithon. After a while people tended",
          "We drove to Grasse in the early morning from Cagne-sur-mer. We went to museum quite early, after having a coffee near. We found all the information and smelling experiences very interesting and we spent about 3 hours there!! Definitely worth to go if interested in fragrances and",
          "I spent 3 hours in the museum and enjoyed the displays of antique perfumes, accessories and cosmetics. It was very informative and I took the time to read the cards provided in each of the rooms (available in English, French, German and Italian). The history of the area, the",
          "The museum was Ok but the layout and directions were shambolic. The Paul Poiret exhibition was good. You can learn more about fragrances and perfumes etc by going to the three public perfumers in Grasse. The garden was nice..",
          "I really enjoyed seeing this museum, despite the fact that much of the exhibition design harks back to the 1970s. There is a very good exhibition on Paul Poiret on right now. That alone is worth the visit if you are in Grasse. Don't miss the garden, where you get delicately",
          "Basically a glorified retail shop. Go there if you like perfumes or want to buy some gifts. Plenty of choices and some nice touches to keep one interested.",
          "Don't bother. On a slightly wet day on the coast we got stuck in 3 hours of traffic jas. Could not find parking and eventually broke down in the hire car. It is just not worth it.",
          "The museum has some good and some bad points. First to what I liked: The price is relatively small. The museum costs 4 or 5\u20ac for an adult depending on whether there is an exhibition going on. You cannot opt out of the exhibition. There are small discovery exhibits for children",
          "My daughter just got married in Grasse the reception was at the MIP, the museum is very interesting, the building and architecture are of particular interest. Definitely a worthwhile visit.",
          "Very interesting and interactive museum, not very expensive and well air conditioned. Would be nice to have a cafeteria or smth...",
          "My two girls loved it. They are 14 and 12 and enjoyed the smellies at the end. It was like a sales pitch but we didnt mind at all and even bought something to remind us of the day. The staff obviously see a lot of folk but are enthusiastic and make you feel welcome. A nice",
          "This whiz-bang museum is a work of art housed in a renovated 18th century mansion,which has been daringly enlarged architectually. it retraces 300 years of perfume history through brilliant mix of artefacts,bottles,videos,vintage posters. the museum shows interesting insights",
          "It was about half hour drive from Antibes. The museum is in the interesting town of Grasse, high in the mountains, with a great view. The building of the museum itself is also interesting. Relatively rich collection of various perfumes that were popular through the centuries,",
          "The Museum exhibits are well done with the story of perfume throughout history and the vessels and bottles they were used in. But, I was more interested in the process of how perfume was made. The old photo banners with the warehouse full of flowers and workers preparing them",
          "great value and the extra exhibition was marvellous (Paul Poiret) - was a little difficult to follow and there was really a good couple of hours worth to see",
          "It was 4 euros entry when we visited as there were no special exhibits, and we were also told that we were unable to visit the gardens that day which was a little disappointing. Some of the exhibits seemed to be out of order or there were little things missing, but overall we",
          "A really nice museum about perfume and the perfume industry in Grasse! We really liked the stations where you could experience different scents, everything from roses to opium. A must in Grasse, no doubt, and worth the small entry fee.",
          "We had to pay 5 EUR because they were having a temp exhibition. This temp. exhibition is a small area where they show some selected bottles and mix media art. It was Diesel, YSL and some other perfume packagings. And the whole museum which costs us 4 EUR to visit is really",
          "When you've seen one perfume bottle you have probably seen the lot as far as I am concerned (and there are a lot here) but it was worth the price of the ticket to see MA's travelling case (of which she had 2 made!). That's the way to travel - eat your heart out Tripadviser!",
          "With a great location and a wonderful theme, this museum really misses the boat. The presentation--and what could be more important to a museum?--is disorganized and, well, sort of stinky. I walked around, using my electronic listening guide for a while, but it seemed never to",
          "I must say that it was much more interesting than I thought it would be originally. It describes the history and also production in detail. Also, it has a lot of vaporizers so you are able to try various \"scents\" ... from rose, and berries through vanilla, to things like cocaine",
          "I could have spent hours there, the museum tells the story of perfume from the earliest times. There are so many things to see and of course smell. The displays of perfume bottles were amazing",
          "I never realised the history of perfume could be so interesting! The museum is extremely well designed and is in the centre of Grasse with good parking nearby. The first room you go in is a perfumed sensory room with relaxing music and projections which lasts about ten minutes",
          "Very interesting and formative museum!! Worth the visit! The museum is modern and full of scents in the air",
          "Very interesting place to visit. Ticket is 4 EUR. Very educative. You need minimum 2 hours to visit this museum. Very beautiful scent production bottles. Interesting history.",
          "Visit the museum was a real fun, the path in is even for non-fans of perfume. You can take a trip back in time with machines of the past for perfume creation. It is located not far from Fragonard and Galimard..",

          "It is very extended and take your time or walk through stopping at the highlights. The best of all are the smelling devices. The kids love this too. Visit this museum before going to the museum/shops of Fragonard, Galimard or Molinard next door. One of these will do! There is a",
          "Grasse is a very nice town to explore especially if you are with ladies who like their scents. This is the best of the perfume museums as it does not decant you into a vast perfumery at the end of the visit where temptation might win out (although it must be said that those who",
          "This museum presents a very thorough history of cosmetics, soaps and fragrances. Includes films and sniffing stations.",

          "A well set out museum, great for children. Warm welcome from receptionist. Many interesting exhibits. The museum examines the history of perfumery from ancient Egypt to modern times. Well set out, one is taken through the steps of extraction and marketing of perfumes. Enjoyable.",

        "wiki": "Cannes (; French: [kan]; Occitan: Canas) is a city located on the French Riviera. It is a commune located in the Alpes-Maritimes department, and host city of the annual Cannes Film Festival, Midem, and Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. The city is known for its association with the rich and famous, its luxury hotels and restaurants, and for several conferences. On 3 November 2011 it hosted the 2011 G20 summit.\n\n\n== History ==\nBy the 2nd century BC, the Ligurian Oxybii established a settlement here known as Aegitna (Ancient Greek: \u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bd\u03b1). Historians are unsure what the name means. The area was a fishing village used as a port of call between the L\u00e9rins Islands.\n\nIn 154 BC, it became the scene of violent but quick conflict between the troops of Quintus Opimius and the Oxybii.In the 10th century, the town was known as Canua. The name may derive from \"canna\", a reed. Canua was probably the site of a small Ligurian port, and later a Roman outpost on Le Suquet hill, suggested by Roman tombs discovered here. Le Suquet housed an 11th-century tower, which overlooked swamps where the city now stands. Most of the ancient activity, especially protection, was on the L\u00e9rins Islands, and the history of Cannes is closely tied to the history of the islands.\nAn attack by the Saracens in 891, who remained until the end of the 10th century, devastated the country around Canua. The insecurity of the L\u00e9rins islands forced the monks to settle on the mainland, at the Suquet. Construction of a castle in 1035 fortified the city by then known as Cannes, and at the end of the 11th century construction was started on two towers on the L\u00e9rins islands. One took a century to build.\nAround 1530, Cannes detached from the monks who had controlled the city for hundreds of years and became independent.\nDuring the 18th century, both the Spanish and British tried to gain control of the L\u00e9rins Islands but were chased away by the French. The islands were later controlled by many, such as Jean-Honor\u00e9 Alziary and the Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus. They had many different purposes: at the end of the 19th century, one served as hospital for soldiers wounded in the Crimean War.\nHenry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux bought land at the Croix des Gardes and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise. His work to improve living conditions attracted the English aristocracy, who also built winter residences.\nAt the end of the 19th century, several railways were completed, which prompted the arrival of streetcars. In Cannes, projects such as the Boulevard Carnot and the rue d'Antibes were carried out. After the closure of the Casino des Fleurs (h\u00f4tel Gallia), a luxury establishment was built for the rich winter clientele, the Casino Municipal next to the pier Albert-Edouard. This casino was demolished and replaced by the new Palace in 1979.\nIn the 20th century, new luxury hotels such as the Carlton, Majestic, Martinez, and JW Marriott Cannes were built. The city was modernised with a sports centre, a post office, and schools. There were fewer British and German tourists after the First World War, but more Americans. Winter tourism gave way to summer tourism, and the summer casino at the Palm Beach was constructed.\nThe city council had the idea of starting an international film festival shortly before World War II. The first opened on 20 September 1946, held in the Casino Municipal.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nCannes has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa) and the city enjoys 11 hours of sunshine per day during summer (July), while in winter (December to February) the weather is mild. Both seasons see a relatively low rainfall and most rain occurs during October and November, when 110 mm (4.3 in) falls.\nCannes summers are long and warm, with summer daytime temperatures regularly hitting 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), while average temperatures are about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Temperatures remain high from June to September, the busiest time of the year.\nMean temperatures drop below 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) for only three months of the year (December to February). The spring and autumn are also warm, although more suited to those who prefer slightly cooler weather.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nThe Promenade de la Croisette is the waterfront avenue with palm trees. La Croisette is known for picturesque beaches, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, boutiques and luxury hotels. Le Suquet, the old town, provides a good view of La Croisette. The fortified tower and Chapel of St Anne house the Mus\u00e9e de la Castre. A distinctive building in Cannes is the Russian Orthodox church.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\n\n=== Villas ===\nCannes of the 19th century can still be seen in its grand villas, built to reflect the wealth and standing of their owners and inspired by anything from medieval castles to Roman villas. They are not open to the public. Lord Brougham's Italianate Villa El\u00e9onore Louise (one of the first in Cannes) was built between 1835 and 1839. Also known as the Quartier des Anglais, this is the oldest residential area in Cannes.

        "wiki": "The Immigrant is a 2013 American drama film directed by James Gray, starring Marion Cotillard, Joaquin Phoenix, and Jeremy Renner. It was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. The working titles of the film were Low Life and The Nightingale.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1921, Polish Catholic sisters Ewa (Marion Cotillard) and Magda (Angela Sarafyan) arrive at Ellis Island, New York City as immigrants looking for a better life after escaping their ravaged home in post\u2013Great War Poland. Magda is quarantined because of her lung disease. Ewa is almost deported, but Bruno (Joaquin Phoenix), who is Jewish and claims to be from the Travelers' Aid Society,  notices her and her fluency in English, bribes an officer to let her go, and takes her to his house. Knowing Ewa has to make money to get Magda released, Bruno lets her dance at the Bandits' Roost theater and prostitutes her. Bruno also becomes interested in her romantically.\nEwa looks for her expatriate relatives living in New York, but her uncle by marriage turns her in to the authorities; he says he had heard she had gotten in trouble for engaging in illicit behavior on the ship from Europe, and he wishes to distance himself from sheltering a prostitute. Policemen take her back to Ellis Island, and once again she is slated for deportation. While at Ellis Island Ewa watches a performance by Emil (Jeremy Renner) (Bruno's cousin, making a living as a performing illusionist called Orlando); after his performance he hands her a white rose. The next morning Bruno manages to get her released. \nEwa meets Emil again at the Bandit's Roost. Emil asks Ewa to come onstage to aid him in his mind reading trick, but the men in the audience start catcalling at Ewa. The scene ends in a brawl between Bruno and Emil and with Bruno and the girls being fired from the theater. Soon after Bruno has his \"doves\" parade around Central Park to attract men to sleep with them. Another encounter between Emil and Ewa proves Emil's feelings for her. Emil falls for Ewa, much to Bruno's discontent, which causes continued and intense conflicts between the two men. One violent conflict concludes with Bruno being jailed overnight.\nOne day, Emil sneaks into Bruno's home to see Ewa. While there, he promises to get her the money to save her sister so they can all leave New York together. Coincidentally, shortly after making such promise, Emil hides as Bruno returns. Bruno also makes a promise to Ewa: he is to arrange for her a meeting with her sister. But Emil interrupts Bruno, as he pulls out an unloaded gun and points it at Bruno. Emil pulls the trigger just to frighten him, but his attempt at intimidating Bruno backfires, as Bruno stabs him to death in apparent self-defense.\nOvercoming the shock and distress of the death, Bruno and Ewa dump Emil's body in the street at night to get rid of unwanted police investigations, but the police are told by another prostitute with whom Ewa had had conflicts that Ewa killed Emil. Bruno hides Ewa from the police, who then give him a severe beating and steal a large bundle of money he had been carrying. Ewa learns Bruno had enough money to pay for her sister's release all along but was hiding it from her as he did not want her to leave him. Bruno claims he has now had a change of heart and would help Ewa and her sister if he had any money. Ewa makes another contact with her aunt and successfully pleads for her aunt to give her the money for Magda. With it, Bruno pays his contact on Ellis Island to release Ewa's sister and gives them both tickets to New Jersey. Ewa and Magda leave, while a repentant Bruno stays in New York, intending to confess to the police about Emil's killing.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nDirector James Gray said The Immigrant is \"80% based on the recollections from my grandparents, who came to the United States in 1923\", and he described it as \"my most personal and autobiographical film to date\". He was also inspired by Giacomo Puccini's operas that comprise Il Trittico.James Gray wrote the movie for Marion Cotillard and Joaquin Phoenix. He stated that if they hadn't wanted to do the movie, he's not sure he would have made it.When Gray was trying to think of a movie for Cotillard, he was talking to his brother, who found these journals from their grandfather who ran a saloon in the Lower East Side in New York in the 1920s, after he came from Kiev, and there were all these low lives frequenting the place. One of them was this what Gray describes as a \"enigmatic, screwed-up, manipulative pimp who used to go to Ellis Island and cruise for women who came to the country by themselves.\" According to Gray in the 1920s, women trying to get into the U.S. by themselves were not let in specifically because they were targets for prostitution, but through bribery, canny pimps would get around these rules. And so a movie idea was born. Gray told that he had never seen a movie of that subject. \"Lower East Side, Ellis Island, pimps; it seemed very vivid to me. So I said, 'that sounds perfect,'\" he told. However, getting Cotillard on board wasn't as easy as he'd hoped. The director described sending the screenplay to Cotillard, but then having to wait seven days for an answer after she had promised to read the script over a weekend. \"Well, Sunday came and went and it was like getting a colonoscopy over a week,\" he said of the agonizing wait for an answer.Gray also stated that Cotillard is the best actor he's ever worked with.Because Gray wrote about 20 pages of dialogue in Polish, Cotillard had to learn Polish to take on the role and speak English with a credible Polish accent. Cotillard had only two months to learn her Polish dialogue.Principal photography on the film began on January 27, 2012 in New York City, under the working title \"Low Life\". Filming was completed on March 17, 2012.In June 2012, The Weinstein Company acquired U.S. distribution rights.Though the film was completed in time for 2012's Toronto Film Festival, U.S. distributor The Weinstein Company insisted on holding it until Cannes 2013, with Harvey Weinstein hoping he might convince the director to change the ending. James Gray didn't change the ending and the film was only released in the U.S. in 2014.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\nThe Immigrant screened at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, the 2013 Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival, the 2013 New York Film Festival, the 2013 Chicago International Film Festival, the 2014 Miami International Film Festival, the 2014 Newport Beach International Film Festival and the 2014 Sedona Film Festival.The film was released in the United States on May 16, 2014.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThe Immigrant received generally positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 86% based on 111 reviews, with an average score of 7.45/10; the general consensus states: \"Beautiful visuals, James Gray's confident direction, and a powerful performance from Marion Cotillard combine to make The Immigrant a richly rewarding period drama.\" Metacritic gave the film a rating of 77/100, based on 34 reviews.Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune described the film as \"Gray's most satisfying to date, an ode to melodrama of another day, done with style and surprising restraint.\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club lauded it as an \"American masterpiece,\" claiming: \"Gray is the most underappreciated of this country's major filmmakers; his movies distill a century's worth of American feature film\u2014a little late silent cinema here, a little New Hollywood there\u2014into a distinctly personal style. ... What makes The Immigrant a great film is the way in which Gray uses actors and his mastery of the unspoken to create a tremendously lived-in, felt-through world. Every space\u2014public or private, interior or exterior\u2014feels authentic, historically and emotionally.\"  Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine gave the film 3 and a half out of 4 stars, saying that \"The Immigrant feels closer in spirit to Roberto Rossellini's collaborations with Ingrid Bergman\" and calling it \"Gray's Voyage to Italy\".Brian Clark of Twitch Film gave the film a mixed review, commenting that \"while the film boasts great performances, the narrative and overall drama lacks the ferocity, momentum and intensity of Gray's other work\". Lee Marshall of Screen International in his unfavorable review wrote that \"though Gray offers a well-crafted package, especially on the visual front, there's surprisingly little contemporary resonance in this immigration melodrama\".Time magazine ranked Marion Cotillard's performance in the film as the fourth best performance of 2014, shared with her performance in Two Days, One Night.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Immigrant on IMDb\nThe Immigrant at Rotten Tomatoes\nThe Immigrant at Metacritic\nThe Immigrant at Box Office Mojo",

        "wiki": "Cannes (; French: [kan]; Occitan: Canas) is a city located on the French Riviera. It is a commune located in the Alpes-Maritimes department, and host city of the annual Cannes Film Festival, Midem, and Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. The city is known for its association with the rich and famous, its luxury hotels and restaurants, and for several conferences. On 3 November 2011 it hosted the 2011 G20 summit.\n\n\n== History ==\nBy the 2nd century BC, the Ligurian Oxybii established a settlement here known as Aegitna (Ancient Greek: \u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bd\u03b1). Historians are unsure what the name means. The area was a fishing village used as a port of call between the L\u00e9rins Islands.\n\nIn 154 BC, it became the scene of violent but quick conflict between the troops of Quintus Opimius and the Oxybii.In the 10th century, the town was known as Canua. The name may derive from \"canna\", a reed. Canua was probably the site of a small Ligurian port, and later a Roman outpost on Le Suquet hill, suggested by Roman tombs discovered here. Le Suquet housed an 11th-century tower, which overlooked swamps where the city now stands. Most of the ancient activity, especially protection, was on the L\u00e9rins Islands, and the history of Cannes is closely tied to the history of the islands.\nAn attack by the Saracens in 891, who remained until the end of the 10th century, devastated the country around Canua. The insecurity of the L\u00e9rins islands forced the monks to settle on the mainland, at the Suquet. Construction of a castle in 1035 fortified the city by then known as Cannes, and at the end of the 11th century construction was started on two towers on the L\u00e9rins islands. One took a century to build.\nAround 1530, Cannes detached from the monks who had controlled the city for hundreds of years and became independent.\nDuring the 18th century, both the Spanish and British tried to gain control of the L\u00e9rins Islands but were chased away by the French. The islands were later controlled by many, such as Jean-Honor\u00e9 Alziary and the Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus. They had many different purposes: at the end of the 19th century, one served as hospital for soldiers wounded in the Crimean War.\nHenry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux bought land at the Croix des Gardes and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise. His work to improve living conditions attracted the English aristocracy, who also built winter residences.\nAt the end of the 19th century, several railways were completed, which prompted the arrival of streetcars. In Cannes, projects such as the Boulevard Carnot and the rue d'Antibes were carried out. After the closure of the Casino des Fleurs (h\u00f4tel Gallia), a luxury establishment was built for the rich winter clientele, the Casino Municipal next to the pier Albert-Edouard. This casino was demolished and replaced by the new Palace in 1979.\nIn the 20th century, new luxury hotels such as the Carlton, Majestic, Martinez, and JW Marriott Cannes were built. The city was modernised with a sports centre, a post office, and schools. There were fewer British and German tourists after the First World War, but more Americans. Winter tourism gave way to summer tourism, and the summer casino at the Palm Beach was constructed.\nThe city council had the idea of starting an international film festival shortly before World War II. The first opened on 20 September 1946, held in the Casino Municipal.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nCannes has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa) and the city enjoys 11 hours of sunshine per day during summer (July), while in winter (December to February) the weather is mild. Both seasons see a relatively low rainfall and most rain occurs during October and November, when 110 mm (4.3 in) falls.\nCannes summers are long and warm, with summer daytime temperatures regularly hitting 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), while average temperatures are about 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Temperatures remain high from June to September, the busiest time of the year.\nMean temperatures drop below 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) for only three months of the year (December to February). The spring and autumn are also warm, although more suited to those who prefer slightly cooler weather.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nThe Promenade de la Croisette is the waterfront avenue with palm trees. La Croisette is known for picturesque beaches, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, boutiques and luxury hotels. Le Suquet, the old town, provides a good view of La Croisette. The fortified tower and Chapel of St Anne house the Mus\u00e9e de la Castre. A distinctive building in Cannes is the Russian Orthodox church.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\n\n\n=== Villas ===\nCannes of the 19th century can still be seen in its grand villas, built to reflect the wealth and standing of their owners and inspired by anything from medieval castles to Roman villas. They are not open to the public. Lord Brougham's Italianate Villa El\u00e9onore Louise (one of the first in Cannes) was built between 1835 and 1839. Also known as the Quartier des Anglais, this is the oldest residential area in Cannes. Another landmark is the Villa Fi\u00e9sole (known today as the Villa Domergue) designed by Jean-Gabriel Domergue in the style of Fiesole, near Florence, which may be visited on appointment.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite ===\n\nIt took the Man in the Iron Mask 11 years to leave the tiny, forested St Marguerite Island. The mysterious individual was believed to be of noble blood, but his identity has never been proven. His cell can be visited in the Fort of St Marguerite, now renamed the Mus\u00e9e de la Mer (Museum of the Sea). This museum also houses discoveries from shipwrecks off the island, including Roman (1st century BC) and Saracen (10th century AD) ceramics.\n\n\n=== \u00cele Saint-Honorat ===\n\nCistercian monks are the only inhabitants of the smaller, southern St Honorat Island. Monks have inhabited the island since AD 410 and, at the height of their powers, owned Cannes, Mougins, and Vallauris. Medieval vestiges remain in the stark church, which is open to the public, and in the ruins of the 11th-century monastery on the sea shore. The monks inhabit the L\u00e9rins Abbey and divide their time between prayer and producing red and white wines.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire de Provence houses artifacts from prehistoric to present, in an 18th-century mansion. The Mus\u00e9e de la Castre has objects from the Pacific Atolls, Peruvian relics and Mayan pottery.

It's also easy enough to walk back down for a different view etc.",

          "This hill top is a treasure,  there are so many beautiful places to explore up there. It is best you go up the hill from  the \"I love nice\" area. Beware, this place is opened till 8pm in summer and 6pm in winter. And this time must be strictly adhered to, otherwise, you will be locked inside.",

          "Very nice place, with beautiful view.",

          "Amazing views from over the top of nice, a little bit of a walk up the hill, though well worth heading too. Not many places will give a better view :D",
          "Amazing views from both sides - coastline, promenade, old town and beyond from west side; harbor, coastline and mountains on the other.  With all the trees, it also provides a lot of shade, which is nice if it is a hot day.  Bonus, if you do not want to climb the stairs - there is an elevator!",
          "There's two ways up, the front or the back. The front provides the best views, but maybe not for those afraid of heights.  Also a nice way to work off some of those vacation pounds.",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful place, stunningly beautiful and I mean it. One thing to be mentioned, the gate closes at 8pm and no one checks inside if someone is there or not, we didn\u2019t know what time it closes as the description was written in french \u2026",
          "Went on a very windy dqy, alot of walking, but great scenes especially the waterfall.",

A great view from the castle Hill of the Mediterranean coastline and the yatch pier on the opposite side, visible from Castle Hill site. Only thing which (may or may not) be an issue was the blistering sun under which we were walking",
          "You can get fantastic view of Nice from here. \n\nHowever my experience wasn\u2019t so due to two police associates sternly warned us not to proceed further and it\u2019s not even sunset yet.

          "Castle hill was absolute beautiful. You must come here if you are visiting Nice. The Panoramic views are breathtaking and the waterfall up top is a sight to see. There was also beautiful music played at the top that was a delight to dance too. My dad and sisters were all dancing to it. Truly a experience to remember",
          "If you want to see Nice from the height, this is the place to go. There are stairs to get here, but you can also take the elevator: be aware that there might be a queue to get on the elevator and you might lose a bit of time there. The \u2026",

          "Fun kid's playground. Great views. Nice cafe.",
          "Full of energy to climb the mountain is a good choice for exercise and the other option is too take the elevator to stand on the top to view all of the Nice and the beautiful beach, that is very amazing and touching. The wind and sunshine \u2026",
          "Can't say enough about this free national park.  During the off-season, the lift does not have a line and is free! You may hike up the stairs or follow the roadways up. The park provides 360\u00b0 views of Nice.  There is a cafe at the top with \u2026",
          "One can see a lot in Nice but that's the most remarkable viewpoint where you have to go. \nIt is important to take water with you because the walk is uphill and you should have some time for exploring the whole chateau.",
          "Take the elevator or the stairs, the view is breathtaking!",
          "A place where you can get the entire view of Nice Beach. The climb up thou, it's a good workout! So eat something and drink up before going up! You need all the energy. Once on top, view is breathtaking. Alot of people waiting for sunset, so go get a spot and watch the sun.",

          "Iconic view of Nice, must-see. Unfortunately, the opening hours aren't generous, so if you visit in the Summer months, you can't really catch the sun setting, but have the sun shining really brightly in front of your shots. So time your visit.\nThe stairs aren't bad at all, perhaps just 5 minutes up.",
          "Nice walk uphill, surrounded by trees and plants, with an amazing view",
          "Quite the view of Nice and the surrounding area.  If you visit Nice then I strongly recommend the climb to the top of Castle Hill.\n\nWe took a Segway tour that took us to the top, definitely made the trip a little quicker and easier.",

          "Very nice park in the centre of Nice. Take the elevator or climb the stairs (not too exhausting) and enjoy the view. You can see the beach, port and the old town. \nThere aren\u2019t a lot of historical sites to be discovered, but there is an artificial waterfall.",
          "Wonderful hilltop view of the city and a fabulous waterfall. You can make it to the top via stairs, or an elevator (more vistas from the stairs). Once at the top there is a park with playground equipment, a restaurant, and public bathrooms. Don't forget to go to the back side of the area to see the Port and the yachts.",
          "So beautiful place, the view point on Nice, beach and sea is wonderful. Little nature park on the mountain. Recommend to visit. Free entry. And you can take an elevator in  bed weather.",

          "Beautiful view of whole Nice.. Love this place..",
          "We had a romantic walk up this picturesque, wooded hill. The views over the city to the ocean and the Alps are stunning and the waterfall, although man-made, is still a sight to behold and can be seen cascading over the rocks from the city centre. We sat for a while at the top amongst the Roman ruins and enjoyed a picnic.",
          "We got to the park from rue Rossetti and it was super easy walk in the shades, visited Israel cemetery and the to the top of the hill. The cherry on the top was this free lift and the you can immediately drop into he sea!",
          "Lovely spot. Free lift for the less able. Great views.",
          "An amazing view of Nice and it only takes a little bit of stair climbing. Really stunning and not too crowded. Also recommend going the other way down to the harbour. Really nice little path all the way down to the sea front.",
          "Gorgeous view, lovely waterfall. There's also a lift almost all the way up (free of charge) in case you don't feel like walking up the stairs.",
          "We had a nice walk around the park. There is a lift for those who need more accessible options.",
          "Awesome awesome awesome.  The elevator is well worth the wait.  We saw the city, the port, the ruins, the waterfall, and the cemetery.. Woof!  Toilettes are .50\u20ac but are nice for public restrooms.  We did the hill after we had explored the \u2026",
          "LOTS OF STEPS. Wrong idea to climb this in 30 degree heat.\nAmazing views though - can't find it anywhere else!",
          "Great scenic view from the top. One of the best place to take pictures in Nice. Hard to walk up , I believe there was an elevator but you have to pay 1 euro. There was a food store st the top which was decently priced. Huge man made water falls, looks pretty real. Definitely recommend it for all ages.",
          "Amazing Park! Best view of the boulevard from top of the hill. Would love to come again.",
          "A great walk!! Beautiful view at the top. Make sure to check out the old cathedral ruin! Cool bit of history :-)",
          "Great hill, lots of view points to see the amazing Nice but I guess they should add some activities up there or some cafes",
          "#calm, #beautiful, #history, #nice, #france, #castlehill and great view from top of the hill.",
          "There is no Castle at Castle Hill. I'm a tiny bit disapointed. Good view though. Really beautiful waterfall at the top. Don't go up by the stares you see from the beach. There's a better way if you go through the Old town.",
          "Amazing views of Nice. Easily accessible by the lift, but also recommend walking down from the top via stairs as you get lovely views. The waterfall is beautiful.",
          "Beautiful walk up the hill . Different vistas at different points . The waterfall near the top is refreshing to see after the long uphill climb . Well worth the hilly effort for the views of Nice , the sea and the distant mountains .",
          "An incredible walk up to the top. Take the elevator across the road from the #ILOVENICE photo opp on the beach side. Just panoramic views and waterfall. Take some pics and go for a swim.",
          "Beautiful view point. Pictures don\u2019t do justice to it\u2019s real beauty. Be prepared to walk up the never ending staircase to get there. But it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s close to the pebbly and slightly rocky beaches right at the foot of this point. Recommended.",
          "Very big hill with nice view and lots of other things on top like a playground and a shop that has food and soda/water.",
          "Great place to get the great view of the nice city. It has good parks for kids and picnic spots for people. It\u2019s good to visit in summer as the waterfall is not open in winter. Lots of activities going on in the castle area. A must visit place in nice.",
          "Great scenic park on top of the hill.  Fantastic view of both the beach front to the west as well as the port to the east.  Park is not open at night or early morning.",

        "wiki": "if.... is a 1968 British drama film produced and directed by Lindsay Anderson satirising English public school life. Famous for its depiction of a savage insurrection at a fictitious boys' boarding school, the X certificate film was made at the time of the May 1968 protests in France by a director who was strongly associated with the 1960s counterculture.\nThe film stars Malcolm McDowell in his first screen role and his first appearance as Anderson's \"everyman\" character Mick Travis. Richard Warwick, Christine Noonan, David Wood, and Robert Swann also star.\nif.... won the Palme d'Or at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival. \nIn 1999, the British Film Institute named it the 12th greatest British film of the 20th century; in 2004, the magazine Total Film named it the 16th greatest British film of all time. In 2017 a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for Time Out magazine  ranked it the 9th best British film ever.\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 91% of 47 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.92/10. According to the site's critical consensus, \"Incendiary, subversive, and darkly humorous, If.... is a landmark of British countercultural cinema.\"\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film opens at a traditional male British public school in the late 1960s, as the pupils return for a new term. Mick Travis, Wallace, and Johnny Knightly are three non-conformist boys in the lower sixth form, their penultimate year. They are watched and persecuted by the \"Whips\", upper sixth-formers given authority as prefects over the other boys. The junior boys are made to act as personal servants for the Whips, who discuss them as sex objects.\nEarly scenes show the school's customs and traditions. The headmaster is somewhat remote from the boys and the housemasters. The protagonists' housemaster, Mr. Kemp, is easily manipulated by the Whips into giving them free rein in enforcing discipline. Some members of the staff are shown behaving bizarrely.\nOne day, Mick and Johnny sneak off campus and steal a motorbike from a showroom. They ride to a caf\u00e9 staffed by an unnamed girl, about whom Mick fantasizes wrestling while nude. Meanwhile, Wallace spends time with a younger boy, Bobby Philips, and later shares his bed.\nLater, the three boys drink vodka in their study and consider how \"one man can change the world with a bullet in the right place.\" Their clashes with school authorities become increasingly contentious. Eventually, a brutal caning by the Whips spurs them to action.\nDuring a school-wide military drill, Mick acquires live ammunition, which he, Wallace, and Johnny use to open fire on a group of students and faculty, including Kemp and the school chaplain. When the latter orders the boys to drop their weapons, he is cowed into submission and assaulted by Mick.\nAs punishment for their actions, the trio are ordered by the headmaster to clean out a large storeroom beneath the main hall. In a surreal sequence, they discover a cache of firearms, including automatic weapons and mortars. Joined by the girl from the caf\u00e9 and Philips, they commit to revolt against the establishment.\nOn Founders' Day, when parents are visiting the school, the group starts a fire under the hall, smoking everyone out of the building, where they open fire on them from the rooftop. Led by the visiting General who was giving a speech, the staff, students, and parents break open the Combined Cadet Force armoury and begin firing back. The headmaster tries to stop the fight, imploring the group to listen to reason, only to be shot dead by the girl. The battle continues, and the camera closes in on Mick's determined face as he keeps firing.\nThe screen abruptly cuts to black and \"if....\" is seen in red letters.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production and locations ==\nDavid Sherwin's original title for the screenplay was Crusaders, during the writing of which he drew heavily from his experiences at Tonbridge School in Kent. In 1960, he and his friend and co-writer John Howlett took it to director Seth Holt. Holt felt unqualified to direct, but offered to produce the film. They also took it to Sherwin's hero, Rebel Without a Cause director Nicholas Ray, who liked it but had a nervous breakdown before anything came of it. Holt introduced Sherwin to Lindsay Anderson in a Soho pub.The school was Anderson's alma mater, Cheltenham College, Gloucestershire, but this was not made public at the time under the agreement needed to shoot there. The then headmaster, David Ashcroft, persuaded the school governors to agree that the film could be made.\nAldenham School in Elstree, Hertfordshire, was used for later scenes filmed after previous summer commitments prevented further shooting at Cheltenham.\nThe sweat room scenes were filmed in the School Room in School House at Aldenham School (though they were redesigned for the film). The dormitory scenes were also at Aldenham\u2014specifically The Long Room for the junior boys, and the room with the wooden partitions called Lower Cubs (short for cubicles). The shower scene and toilets were in School House changing rooms.\nThe transport cafe was the (now demolished) Packhorse Cafe on the A5/Watling Street in Kensworth, Dunstable, Bedfordshire, close to the Packhorse Pub.\nThe painting in the dining hall is of Aldenham School's founder, Richard Platt. The Hall scene was an amalgamation of the school halls at Cheltenham and Aldenham.\nCarew Manor, in Beddington, Surrey, was used for the opening staircase scene and for several other scenes. It was filmed during the summer when the school had closed for holidays.\nSome scenes were shot at the former Trinity School of John Whitgift in central Croydon, before it was demolished to make way for the Whitgift Centre; pupil extras from Whitgift School were engaged at \u00a35 per day.\nAnderson originally approached Charterhouse School and later Cranleigh School for permission to shoot the film: negotiations were going well until the schools discovered the content of the film and pulled out.\nThe outside shots of the school including the final showdown on the roof were filmed at Cheltenham College after term ended.\nThe Speech Day interior was filmed inside St John's Church on Albion Street, Cheltenham. The church was later demolished.\nThe motorbike shop was filmed at the Broadway Motor Company on Gladstone Road, Wimbledon.Much is said of the film's use of black and white sequences. In the audio commentary to the 2007 DVD release, Malcolm McDowell confirmed that lighting the chapel scenes for colour filming would have taken much longer than for black and white. The time they could use the school chapel was limited, so Anderson opted to not shoot those scenes in colour. Liking the effect this gave, he then decided to shoot other sequences in black and white to improve the 'texture' of the film. As a child, he was impressed watching a gangster film which started in black and white and then turned to colour.The black and white sequence featuring Mrs Kemp (Mary MacLeod) walking naked through the school was allowed by the then Secretary of the Board of the British Board of Film Censors, John Trevelyan, on the condition that shots of male genitalia from the shower scene were removed.Stephen Frears is credited as an assistant to the director, while Chris Menges is credited as a cameraman.\n\n\n== Sources and influence ==\nThe film's surrealist sequences have been compared to Jean Vigo's French classic Z\u00e9ro de conduite (1933). Anderson acknowledged an influence, and described how he arranged a viewing of that film with his screenwriters, Sherwin and Howlett, at an early stage in production planning, though in his view the Vigo film's influence on if.... was structural rather than merely cosmetic. \"Seeing Vigo's film gave us the idea and also the confidence to proceed with the kind of scene-structure that we devised for the first part of the film particularly.\"McDowell's performance in if.... caught the attention of Stanley Kubrick, who subsequently cast him in his 1971 film adaptation of Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange. Additionally, McDowell used his performance in if.... in his inspiration for the Clockwork Orange protagonist, Alexander DeLarge. Having been given the script by Kubrick, McDowell was unsure how he should play the part of Alex, and so he contacted Lindsay Anderson, asking for advice. McDowell relates the story:\nAnyway, he said 'Malcolm, this is how you play the part: there is a scene of you, a close-up in if...., where you open the doors to the gymnasium, to be beaten. You get a close-up.' I said 'that's right.' He said 'do you remember...' I said 'yes. I smiled.' He said 'that's right. You gave them that smile. That sort of ironic smile,' he said 'and that's how you play Alex.' And I went 'my god, that's brilliant. That's brilliant.' That's all I needed and that was enough, and that is a brilliant piece of direction for an actor.\n\n\n== Sequels ==\nif.... is the first film in the \"Mick Travis trilogy\", all starring Malcolm McDowell as everyman character Mick Travis. The others are:\n\nO Lucky Man! (1973)\nBritannia Hospital (1982)However, those two movies do not follow the same continuity of the first film, and have little in common other than the main character of Mick Travis and several identically-named characters in similar roles (on the commentary track for O Lucky Man!, Malcolm McDowell refers to it as a \"so-called trilogy\"). At the time of Anderson's death he had completed a final draft of a proper sequel to if...., but it was never made. The sequel takes place during a Founders' Day celebration at which many of the characters reunite. Mick Travis is now an Oscar-nominated movie star, eschewing England for Hollywood. Wallace is a military major who has lost his arm, Johnny is a clergyman, and Rowntree is the Minister of War. In the script, Rowntree is kidnapped by a group of anti-war students and saved by Mick and his gang, though not before Mick crucifies Rowntree with a large nail through his palm.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBFI Top 100 British films\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nLambert, Gavin (2000).

          "We visited here twice withing a week: the first time was by ascent of Escalier de la Tour passing the Musee de la Castre - which was quite hard going following our walk around Ile Ste Marguerite an hour or two earlier. The second time was by the 'Little Train' which climbs up",

          "We walked from our cruise ship to the top of this hill and the Eglise Notre Dame. It was worth the visit for the views and the sense of history inside. This is a great example of the way ancestors protected their cities and mixed in their faith, all in one location."

          "Beach was so good clean and healthy enviroment.we were group of people we hangout there.What i was excepted it was there.Best memory with my friend",
          "When we decided to go to cannes I worried the public beaches would be awful in comparison to the private ones (which we could no way afford), but this beach is beautiful. The sand is clean, water is clear. We had no issue with jellyfish or anything similar when we were there!",
          "We have been to quiet a few beaches in Europe but we talked the whole time how nice, clean, relaxing, not super duper busy this beach was! The sand was so clean and nice and the water was calm and extremely clean too! Must go to in Cannes if you're there during the beach season!",
          "A great beach, sandy and clean, the water is very clear and blue, however it can get quite packed as it isn\u2019t very big.",
          "This beach was fabulous ..we didn't intend on going to the beach on our trip to Cannes but seeing how amazing they looked we couldn't resist. So we went to the stores there and got beach supplies and some snorkels and spent the day here.. snorkeling was amazing we spent hours in",
          "Its great beach for families and any others in the heart of cannes,great sands and water and very peaceful.",
          "Nice beach at the far end of the beach front. Free so popular. Walking by early in the morning had homeless people sleeping on it",
          "lovely beach, clean, close to the harbour and the centre, some realy lovely restaurants, cafes etc on the beach. Safe children's area",
          "Bang in the centre of Cannes, this is a good option for beach-goers. Gets very busy, but you can always find a space for your towel!",
          "It can often be hard to find a beautiful beach so close to a vibrant city but this truly is something very beautiful, and especially at sunset. If you're here during the film festival you have to catch a film on the big screen because that's incredible!",
          "It is a really good choice considering the circumstances (that it is a city beach). In case you visit during the Film festival do not miss the movies playing during night on the beach.",
          "We jumped on a 15 min train from Antibes to Cannes for about 3 Euro. It was very easy to find our way around and staff at the station were helpful. Cannes is beautiful with an amazing mile long promenade (La Croisette) and deep sandy beaches. You can pay for a sun bed and enjoy",
          "Very busy beach with plenty of onlookers. Mostly private beaches and blue chairs could be hired along the sea wall (road level up). A busy town with the rich and poor alike rushing to their destinations and some just chilling. Lots of people watching and organised trams",

          "Parking is a challenge but that\u2019s to be expected so allowed extra time. We parked a little on the outside and wondered around. Really exciting seeing all the super yatchs. At the time of our visit a boat show was being held so the place was a height of activity and excitement.",
          "Beach looks nice - sandy and soft, but water is not so clean and \u201cblue\u201d as in Nice. However, sand is very nice compared to rocks. Worth the visit!",
          "It was a bright hot sunny day. While walking we decided to make the kids play on the beach and had our sand stuff. It was a calm nice place. Each had his towel, chairs not available that day (maybe until June). The water was so cold that barely you could see someone swimming.",
          "The sand is really nice with not that many rocks. Lots of restaurants and the blue water is lovely. Definitely a good place to go swimming.",
          "Beaches right in the middle of the town. The most of them are private but there are also free beaches.",
          "This beach is great because it's soft sand instead of rocks. However, it's inexplicably extremely crowded. Better to stay in Nice if you're just looking to go to the beach.",
          "Free Beach on the Croisette. The beach is very clean, clean water and sand, but a bit crowdy. There are only a couple of showers with fresh water. You can keep your belongings for about $3 \u2013 very convenient!",
          "I like soft sand beaches over stone or grainy ones and Cannes Beach has really nice soft sand it's easy to walk from one end to the other even past the hotel beaches as long you don't stop on there sun beds. The water is warm, clean and clear. It's also claim when I visited and",

          "Can have a good rest here and you have plenty space to enjoy your picnic with your family, good for children playing as well. A lot of bar and restaurant by this beach, little bit expensive, better to bring your own drink and food if you wanna spend long time on this beach.",
          "This is an average small beach. There are better beaches in other places in Europe. I did not waste my time there",
          "Sandy beach with a clear sea. Lovely stay, spent the whole day here. Weather was fantastic and because we traveled during the local's working hour, it was very empty and quiet. Close by to restaurants - like 10mins away. we went to L'assiette provencale : my review for this",
          "This part of the beach is for the public and is absolutely free. You can sit here, enjoy sun bathing and taking a dip in the refreshing clean water. It's one of the better beaches i have been to and is absolutely clean. Absolutely enjoyed myself and even go a back massage done",
          "We took a day trip from Nice to Cannes and spent part of day sunbathing and swimming there and have to say that it was great. Do be careful if you plan on going in the section that offer chairs and umbrellas as the prices can be quite steep.",
          "We only visited Cannes for the day from Nice but this was a great spot for some sunbathing and relaxing in the heat. Busy but not too crowded although we got there quite early",
          "It has a lot of pluses. First of all it is free. Second ot has sand. It is very nice and the water very good. Great place to go for a suntan and swimming.",
          "a beautiful beach for a family to spend a couple of hours. the water is clean and clear. the sand is also beautiful and soft for the kids to play with. there are a couple of showers with fresh water as you exit and a toilet which come in handy. recommended",
          "The beach was crowded given it was a hot weekend, but the water is very clean and being able to rent an umbrella and 3 chaiselongs for a reasonable price was nice. You can even have your belongings kept safely for a mere 2 Eur. Definitely recommend it.",
          "This is a nice beach to sunbath. Even has topless sunbathing, which is quite common in France. A perfect place to chill out after walking all day.",
          "Beach is not large and there were many people there. But it was clean and nearby of the center of Cannes so it's easy to get to any location from there",
          "In front of Grand Hotel, this small beach is filled with sun bathers. I prefer much quieter beach than this. But some people like it I guess. Average.",
          "This free beach on the Croisette is perfectly located, and great for swimming and sunbathing. Get there early and take a place on either side of the beach, near the fences . It does get crowded late afternoon, but if you are on the sides, you will be able to protect your space",
          "The beach is good but there is too many people, maybe because of the summer... But we didn't like it",
          "Wu just visited Cannes for one day, but we have seen the movie \"Mister Bean at holiday\" and here it the last scene at this beach. So we had to see the beach and take a bath here. And it was a wonderful break from the city tour. Our girls were very satisfied when they could say",
          "Nice beach close to the centre of Cannes. Would possibly be very busy in mid summer but nice in October for a swim and sunbathe, \u20ac14 per day for a bed and umbrella.",
          "Fascinated by the movie - Mr. Bean's holiday we added this location to our wish list and our trip here was not disappointing. Weather did not co-operate on our travel day being cloudy, but good for kids to spend good amount of time building sand castles and in water. We were",
          "A very beautiful beach which is well maintained and with very friendly staff. Prices are okay considering that you are in Cannes. The beach is very clean and during opening hours there\u00b4s always a lifeguard on site. This is a perfect choice for family and friends who do not need",
          "We've travelled far and wide across the French Riviera but we have not found a better kid-friendly beach. Clean golden sand, clean water, very reasonably priced chairs. No rocks in the water like some Antibes beaches. Perfect for families in my opinion.",
          "We visited the beach during the Lions festival. It was busy and hot and full of fun young people. Nothing special but the water was nice and the beach seemed clean.",
          "Nice sandy beach with deck chairs instead of mattress. Reflected in price of \u20ac 7 euros for chair and \u20ac 7 for umbrella for day so good value Staff are friendly till closing time. The beach officially closes at 630 but the staff start packing the beach material at 5 That's when",
          "This is a beach not too far from the Centre of Cannes where you can take a moment. During the film festival you can also get the chance to see a film on the big screen.",
          "Our daughters pleaded with us to drive them to Cannes from Antibes for the afternoon so they could tick it off their 'wish list'. We were pleased we did. Driving in we found a free garden area and carpark for an easy lunch preprepared. Drove straight to the casino carpark, -",
          "Cannes was our second destination of Euro-trip on first week on June. Dirty beach, noisy... I would not recommend.",
          "The boats in the harbour are amazing. But other than this there really isn't much, the beach is okay but too small and crowded. And buying anything is very expensive. Worth a visit for a day but not any longer."

        "wiki": "Grey Gardens is a 1975 American documentary film by Albert and David Maysles. The film depicts the everyday lives of two reclusive, formerly upper class women, a mother and daughter both named Edith Beale, who lived in poverty at Grey Gardens, a derelict mansion at 3 West End Road in the wealthy Georgica Pond neighborhood of East Hampton, New York. The film was screened at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival but was not entered into the main competition.Ellen Hovde and Muffie Meyer also directed, and Susan Froemke was the associate producer. The film's editors are credited as Hovde (who also edited Gimme Shelter and Salesman), Meyer and Froemke.In 2010, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In a 2014 Sight & Sound poll, film critics voted Grey Gardens the joint ninth best documentary film of all time.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nEdith \"Big Edie\" Ewing Bouvier Beale as Herself\nEdith \"Little Edie\" Bouvier Beale as Herself\nBrooks Hyers as Himself\u2014Gardener\nNorman Vincent Peale as Himself (voice)\nJack Helmuth as Himself\u2014Birthday Guest (uncredited)\nAlbert Maysles as Himself (uncredited)\nDavid Maysles as Himself (uncredited)\nJerry Torre as Himself\u2014Handyman (uncredited)\nLois Wright as Herself\u2014Birthday Guest (uncredited)\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nEdith Ewing Bouvier Beale (1895\u20131977), known as \"Big Edie\", and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (1917\u20132002), known as \"Little Edie\", were the aunt and the first cousin, respectively, of former US First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. The two women lived together at the Grey Gardens estate for decades with limited funds in increasing squalor and isolation.The house was designed in 1897 by Joseph Greenleaf Thorpe and purchased in 1923 by \"Big Edie\" and her husband Phelan Beale. After Phelan left his wife, \"Big Edie\" and \"Little Edie\" lived there for more than 50 years. The house was called Grey Gardens because of the color of the dunes, the cement garden walls, and the sea mist.Throughout the fall of 1971 and into 1972, their living conditions\u2014their house was infested by fleas, inhabited by numerous cats and raccoons, deprived of running water, and filled with garbage and decay\u2014were exposed as the result of an article in the National Enquirer and a cover story in New York Magazine after a series of inspections (which the Beales called \"raids\") by the Suffolk County Health Department. With the Beale women facing eviction and the razing of their house, in the summer of 1972 Jacqueline Onassis and her sister Lee Radziwill provided the necessary funds to stabilize and repair the dilapidated house so that it would meet village codes.\nAlbert and David Maysles became interested in their story and received permission to film a documentary about the women, which was released in 1976 to wide critical acclaim. Their direct cinema technique left the women to tell their own stories.\n\n\n== Production ==\nAlbert and David Maysles initially came into contact with the Beales after Lee Radziwill suggested they make a documentary on her childhood in East Hampton and took them with her on a trip to Grey Gardens. According to Ellen Hovde, the initial film was being funded by Radziwill; when the Maysles attempted to show her their early footage of the Beales to convince her that a documentary about them was a better idea, Radziwill confiscated their negatives and withdrew her funding.\nThe Maysles brothers shot and recorded all the footage themselves. Ellen Hovde and Muffie Meyer received co-directing credit for their editing work.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nEdith Bouvier Beale \u2013 \"Tea for Two\" (music by Vincent Youmans and lyrics by Irving Caesar)\nEdith Bouvier Beale \u2013 \"We Belong Together\" from Music in the Air (lyrics and book by Oscar Hammerstein II and music by Jerome Kern)\nEdith Bouvier Beale \u2013 \"You and the Night and the Music\" (music by Arthur Schwartz and lyrics by Howard Dietz)\nEdith Bouvier Beale \u2013 \"Night and Day\" (written by Cole Porter)\nEdith \"Little Edie\" Bouvier Beale \u2013 \"People Will Say We're in Love\" (music by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II)\nEdith \"Little Edie\" Bouvier Beale \u2013 \"Lili Marleen\"\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\"Big Edie\" died in 1977 and \"Little Edie\" sold the house in 1979 for $220,000 ($775,000 today) to Sally Quinn and her husband, longtime Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee, who promised to restore the dilapidated structure (the sale agreement forbade razing the house). The couple subsequently restored the house and grounds. \"Little Edie\" died in Florida in 2002 at the age of 84.\nJerry Torre, the teenage handyman shown in the documentary (nicknamed \"The Marble Faun\" by \"Little Edie\"), was sought by the filmmakers for years afterward, and was found by chance in 2005 driving a New York City taxicab. A 2011 documentary, The Marble Faun of Grey Gardens by Jason Hay and Steve Pelizza, showed that he was then a sculptor at the Art Students League of New York.Lois Wright, one of the two birthday party guests in the film, hosted a public television show for 30 years in East Hampton from the early 1980s to December 2018. She wrote a book about her experiences at the house with the Beales.In 2006, Maysles made available previously unreleased footage for a special two-disc edition for the Criterion Collection. It included a new feature titled The Beales of Grey Gardens, which also received a limited theatrical release. In 2018, a prequel, That Summer, shot in 1972 and using 16mm footage, was released.Quinn and Bradlee resided in the restored Grey Gardens for 35 years until Bradlee's death in 2014, after which Quinn found the home \"too sad\" to occupy alone. For the next several years, the property was available to rent until Quinn ultimately sold it in 2017. Prior to the sale, Quinn was forced to sell the remaining furniture originally belonging to the Beales, citing a lack of space. The current owners remain private but have stated that they will continue to renovate the property.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n\n=== Musical theatre ===\n\nThe documentary, and the women's story, were adapted as a full-length musical, Grey Gardens, with book by Doug Wright, music by Scott Frankel and lyrics by Michael Korie. Starring Christine Ebersole and Mary Louise Wilson, the show premiered at Playwrights Horizons in New York City in February 2006. The musical re-opened on Broadway in November 2006 at the Walter Kerr Theatre, and was included in more than 25 \"Best of 2006\" lists in newspapers and magazines. The production won a Tony Award for Best Costume Design, and Ebersole and Wilson each won Tony Awards for their performances. The Broadway production closed on July 29, 2007. It was the first musical on Broadway ever to be adapted from a documentary.\n\n\n=== Television film ===\n\nGrey Gardens, an HBO film, stars Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore as the Edies, with Jeanne Tripplehorn as Jacqueline Kennedy, and Daniel Baldwin as Julius Krug. Directed and co-written (with Patricia Rozema) by filmmaker Michael Sucsy, filming began on October 22, 2007, in Toronto. It flashes back and forth between Little Edie's life as a young woman and the actual filming/premiere of the 1975 documentary. First aired on HBO on April 18, 2009, the film won six Primetime Emmys  and two Golden Globes.\n\n\n=== Play ===\nIn 2008, \"Little Edie & The Marble Faun\" premiered as part of the Metropolitan Playhouse's Annual Author Festival. In a mashup between Grey Gardens and Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The Marble Faun\", the relationship between Little Edie, Big Edie, and Jerry was explored.\n\n\n== References in other works ==\nIn 1999, fashion photographer Steven Meisel shot an editorial, with the same name, featuring Amber Valletta, for Vogue Italia.Rufus Wainwright's song \"Grey Gardens\" appears on his 2001 album Poses.Canadian rock band Stars' song \"The Woods\" from their album Heart contains samples of dialogue from the film.In the season 3 Gilmore Girls episode, A Deep Fried Korean Thanksgiving, the episode begins with Lorelai and Rory watching Grey Gardens.The Comedy Central Roast of Joan Rivers (2009) featured a joke by comic impressionist Mario Cantone that Joan and her daughter Melissa starred together in a TV movie titled Grey Gardens.On NBC's The New Normal, season 1, episode #2: \"Sofa's Choice\" (2012), a character impersonates Little Edie.In the Season 5 episode \"Mrs. Donaghy\" on NBC's 30 Rock, Tina Fey's character Liz Lemon does an impersonation of Little Edie.

In part 3 of Bravo's Season 6 The Real Housewives of New York reunion episode, host Andy Cohen suggests to cast member Sonja Morgan \"...you have a little Grey Gardens in you\".

          "I remember when this space was occupied mainly by the bus station and an ugly 1970's multi storey car park. Prior to 2013 it was a run down park with fountains that didnt work with horrible blue cracked tiling. Today in 2015 it is a wonderful park to visit with a truly massive",
          "Over this number of years they have been improving this area and I must say that it has been well worth the time, effort and clearly substantial cost - well spent. During our weeks stay in Nice we spent three lunchtimes and thoroughly enjoyed our time here having a takeaway",
          "This was a pretty garden to walk through on our way back to the hote. Lots of beautiful flowers and public restrooms (I didn't visit them so can't tell you if they were clean). I would not make a special trip to see this. If you stumble across it them you'll enjoy it but",

        "wiki": "The Kid Stays in the Picture is a 1994 autobiography by film producer Robert Evans.  A film adaptation of the book was released in 2002.\nThe title comes from a line attributed to studio head Darryl F. Zanuck, who was defending Evans after some of the actors involved in the film The Sun Also Rises (1957) had recommended he be removed from the cast.\nThe film adaptation was directed by Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgen and released by USA Films. It was screened out of competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n\n=== Book ===\nThe book chronicles Evans' rise from childhood to radio star to film star to production chief of Paramount Pictures to independent producer, his marriage to Ali MacGraw, his downfall including his 1980 cocaine bust and implication in the murder of Roy Radin, aka \"The Cotton Club Murder\", his banishment from Paramount Pictures, and his return to the studio in the early 1990s.\nThe audiobook version was read by Evans himself, with (presumably impromptu) additions.\nA revised edition of the book, published in 1995, adds several chapters of new material, including material on his projects after his return to Paramount Pictures.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nThe film version, released in 2002, utilizes Evans' narration interspersed mostly with photographs from Evans' life as well as brief film footage from films such as Love Story, The Sun Also Rises, Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, and The Godfather, along with interviews to tell the story from his discovery by Norma Shearer for Man of a Thousand Faces (1957) to his return to Paramount Pictures.\nAccording to the commentary by directors Burstein and Morgen on the DVD, many elements from the book, such as Evans' childhood and his other marriages (the film focuses only on his marriage to Ali MacGraw), were dropped because they felt they did not move the story along.\n\n\n== Critical response ==\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 112 reviews, with an average rating of 7.69/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Though not objective by any means, The Kid Stays in the Picture is irresistibly entertaining.\"\n\n\n== Stage production ==\nAn adaptation of the book\u2014along with material from a further, unpublished volume of Evans' memoirs\u2014for the Broadway stage was announced in 2010, to be written by Jon Robin Baitz and directed by Richard Eyre, but the production was canceled in 2011.Another stage adaptation of the book was first performed at the Royal Court Theatre in London in 2017. It was adapted by the Complicite theatre company and directed by Simon McBurney. The cast included Danny Huston, son of John Huston, who worked with Evans on Chinatown.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe film version was parodied in the IFC series Documentary Now! with Bill Hader as Jerry Wallach.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Kid Stays in the Picture on IMDb\nReview of The Kid Stays In The Picture\nDVD Verdict review\nDVD Talk review\nWorks by or about Robert Evans in libraries (WorldCat catalog)\nRobert Evans at Library of Congress Authorities, with 9 catalog records",

          "lovely market , not the biggest , but plenty of lovely fresh local produce , had a nice relaxed atmosphere . well worth a visit",
          "Go to this market & buy all the good stuff needed for a picnic. Beautiful salamis, cheeses, tapenade, olives, etc. & look for the couple that sells (Italian) truffle paste to smear on the fresh baguette bought from the bakery fronting the market. I\u2019m almost out of truffle so",
          "The variety of products available here is amazing. There are loads of different fruit and veg vendors. Some seem to specialise in certain products. For example there is one vendor with loads of different varieties of tomato. Everyone is friendly, and the place is busy.",
          "My wife, two children and I visited the Marche Provencal in Antibes many times during our stay in Antibes in July 2018. The fruits and vegetables are really good and the prices are quite reasonable. My wife also bought chicken and fish here. And fresh high quality tomato",
          "A daily under cover market which has a variety of produce on display. The herbs and spices stall is of particular note and the stall holders are really friendly, and offer samples to try. Good prices. The overall scent within the market is amazing with all the fresh fruit,",
          "While visiting the south of France this was one of my favorite things to do -- roam the aisles of the market looking for deals and interesting items. I found plenty of both! The vendors are very friendly and many offered samples. There's quite an assortment of items for sale",
          "Went to this market almost every morning on our trip to Antibes. There is a array of local produce fruits, vegetables and local products such as lavender. A must on a visit to Antibes",
          "Just happened upon this local open air market. It is covered, so that is nice if the weather is bit dreary. I thoroughly enjoyed walking and browsing through the market. Just wish I had been staying longer so I could have purchased so much more. Love to come back here",
          "Not being spoiled by this kind of marked it is always a pleasure to walk around and take in the sights, smells and taste of all the lovely products. Not too big, but full of life in the opening hours (06-13). Around the marked you'll find several small places to have a"

        "wiki": "Rust and Bone (French: De rouille et d'os) is a 2012 French\u2013Belgian romantic drama film directed by Jacques Audiard, starring Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts, based on Craig Davidson's short story collection Rust and Bone. It tells the story of an unemployed 25-year-old man who falls in love with a woman who trains killer whales.The film competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival and received positive early reviews and a ten-minute standing ovation at the end of its screening. It was a critical and box office hit in France and was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award, two Golden Globes, two BAFTA Awards, three Magritte Awards, and nine C\u00e9sar Awards, winning four, including Most Promising Actor for Matthias Schoenaerts.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAlain van Versch, an unemployed father in his mid 20s known as Ali, arrives in Antibes, southern France, to look for work to support his young son Sam. Having no money, he crashes with his sister Anna, who already has her own share of problems with money and temporary employment.\nAli gets a job as a bouncer in a nightclub but still keeps his passion burning for fighting. On a usual evening in the night club, Ali meets St\u00e9phanie and escorts her safely to her home after she is injured in a brawl at the club. She works at a local marine tourist park. She suffers an accident during a show and wakes up in the hospital to realize that her legs have been amputated.\nAli meets a guy at work who informs him about a kick boxing fixture he can make money from. St\u00e9phanie, now in a wheelchair and trying to adjust to her life without legs, is deeply depressed and gives Ali a call. Ali visits her and takes her to a beach where St\u00e9phanie forgets her self-consciousness and feels freedom when Ali carries her out to the ocean to swim.\nOver a period of time, Ali and St\u00e9phanie spend a lot of time together, and St\u00e9phanie starts to feel better about herself while in Ali's company. She gets artificial limbs and starts to walk again.  St\u00e9phanie accompanies Ali to his mixed martial arts fights and is surprised to learn he has a son.\nAfter a frank discussion, Ali offers to have sex with St\u00e9phanie to help her adjust to her new body. Their friendship evolves to include casual sex, although St\u00e9phanie prevents deeper intimacy by telling Ali that there will be no kissing during their encounters.\nAli, St\u00e9phanie, and some friends visit the same night club where Ali used to work. Ali goes to the dance floor and flirts with a girl as St\u00e9phanie watches curiously. Ali goes away with the girl, leaving a surprised and dejected St\u00e9phanie with other friends. A man at the bar tries to kiss her but she backs away from him, revealing her prosthetic legs. Looking down at her aluminum legs in her skirt, the man apologizes to her and St\u00e9phanie flies into a rage, throwing a glass and attacking the man. She has to be escorted out of the club.\nThe next day St\u00e9phanie sullenly questions Ali about their relationship status. She tells him that if they continue having casual sex, they have to respect each other's feelings and be more discreet about their other involvements. Their intimacy increases and St\u00e9phanie, letting down her guard, kisses Ali, igniting true intimacy. St\u00e9phanie also begins managing Ali's bets for his fighting after his manager leaves town.\nAnna is fired from her job when the managers realize she has been taking home expired food products. Anna blames Ali for this, as Ali was involved in an odd job where he installed spy cameras in work areas. He does this at the direction of the management to spy on the activities of their employees. This results in a standoff between Ali and Anna's partner, who demands he move out and not come back.\nAli, feeling guilty and rejected, leaves town without a word to St\u00e9phanie. She is hurt to be left behind. Sam stays with Anna while Ali goes to a combat sports training facility near Strasbourg, losing touch with St\u00e9phanie.\nAnna's partner, with her permission, drops off Sam to visit for a day with Ali at the training facility. It is winter and Ali and Sam play in the snow on a frozen lake. A weak spot on the frozen lake cracks and Sam falls through the ice, swiftly losing consciousness. He is submerged in the icy waters as Ali turns away momentarily distracted by a call of nature. It takes Ali a while to realize that Sam has fallen through.  Once he spots the hole and sees Sam under the ice of the frozen lake, Ali releases a desperate volley of punches to break the surface and is finally able to pull the unconscious boy out. In the process, Ali fractures almost every bone in his hands.\nAfter carrying Sam to the hospital, Ali stays at the boy's bed while he's in a coma. Sam survives, coming out of his coma. St\u00e9phanie, who calls after hearing about Sam's accident, speaks to Ali at the hospital. Ali breaks down while talking to St\u00e9phanie on the phone, and confesses his love for her.\nAs Ali narrates, he explains how broken bones normally heal stronger than before, but he knows the pain will return in his hands.\nAfter some time passes, Ali is shown celebrating a fight victory in Warsaw as St\u00e9phanie happily watches. After the celebration of the win, Ali and St\u00e9phanie take Sam by the hand and lead him out through the revolving door of a hotel.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMarion Cotillard as St\u00e9phanie\nMatthias Schoenaerts as Ali\nArmand Verdure as Sam\nCorinne Masiero as Anna\nC\u00e9line Sallette as Louise\nBouli Lanners as Martial\nMourad Frarema as Foued\nJean-Michel Correia as Richard\nYannick Choirat as Simon\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was produced by Why Not Productions for \u20ac15.4 million. It was co-produced with France 2 Cin\u00e9ma, Page 114 and the Belgian company Les Films du Fleuve. Filming started on 4 October 2011 and lasted eight weeks. Locations were used in Antibes, Cannes, Belgium, Paris, northern France, and Brussels. To prepare for the role, Cotillard took swimming lessons and spent a week at Marineland to learn how to direct whales. Explaining how the team adjusted to St\u00e9phanie having no legs, Cotillard told: \"When we did the first costume fitting, we had to try those pants that were empty of my legs and I had to fold my legs in the wheelchair. That image was so powerful that we kept it throughout the movie. And also we worked with amazing CGI guys.\"The special effects were provided by the French company Mikros Image. One of the key methods used was to have Cottilard wear green knee length socks. The legs below her knees were then erased by computer or replaced with the image of prosthetic lower legs.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\nThe film premiered on 17 May 2012 in competition at the 65th Cannes Film Festival. It was released in France and Belgium through UGC Distribution the same day. StudioCanal UK acquired the British distribution rights, and the film was released in the UK on 2 November 2012. It opened in the United States through Sony Pictures Classics on 23 November 2012.\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nThe film was screened at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival and received early positive critical reactions. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 81% based on 160 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus states, \"Surging on strong performances from Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts, Rust and Bone is as vibrant and messily unpredictable as life itself.\" Metacritic gave the film a rating of 73/100, based on 39 reviews.HitFix praised Audiard \"for the way he takes melodramatic convention and bends it to his own particular sensibility, delivering a powerful tale about the reminders we all carry of the pains that have formed us\" and found Cotillard's work \"incredible, nuanced and real.\"Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film a four-star rating out of five, writing Rust and Bone is \"a passionate and moving love story which surges out of the screen like a flood tide\" and \"its candour and force are matched by the commitment and intelligence of its two leading players.\"Time's Mary Corliss found that the romance is \"sometimes engrossing, sometimes exasperating\" and that the cinematography recalls Kings Row and An Affair to Remember.\" Corliss also wrote, \"Schoenaerts exudes masculinity that is both effortless and troubled\" while \"Cotillard demonstrates again her eerie ability to write complex feelings on her face, as if from the inside, without grandstanding her emotions\" and added, \"her strong, subtle performance is gloriously winning on its own.\"Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune, thought Schoenaerts' sensitive-brute instincts recall Marlon Brando and Tom Hardy.Critic A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film \"a strong, emotionally replete experience, and also a tour de force of directorial button pushing.\"Roger Ebert, who did not review the film upon its original release, later added it to his \"Great Films\" series and gave four stars.Cate Blanchett wrote a review for Variety praising Marion Cotillard's performance in the film, describing it as \"simply astonishing\", stating that \"Marion has created a character of nobility and candour, seamlessly melding herself into a world we could not have known without her. Her performance is as unexpected and as unsentimental and raw as the film itself.\"\n\n\n=== Awards and nominations ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n2012 in film\nCinema of France\nCinema of Belgium\nDisability in the arts\nList of mixed martial arts films\nList of films featuring mental disorders\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nRust and Bone on IMDb\nRust and Bone at AllMovie\nRust and Bone at Rotten Tomatoes\nRust and Bone at Metacritic\nRust and Bone at Box Office Mojo",

        "wiki": "Park Chan-wook (Korean: \ubc15\ucc2c\uc6b1 Korean pronunciation: [pak\u031at\u0361\u0255\u02b0anuk\u031a ]; born August 23, 1963) is a South Korean film director, screenwriter, producer, and former film critic. One of the most acclaimed and popular filmmakers in his native country, Park is best known for his films Joint Security Area (2000), Thirst (2009), The Handmaiden (2016) and what has become known as The Vengeance Trilogy, consisting of Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002), Oldboy (2003) and Lady Vengeance (2005).\nHe is also known for his English-language works Stoker (2013) and The Little Drummer Girl (2018), a television miniseries based on the novel of the same name by John le Carr\u00e9.\nHis films have gained notoriety for their immaculate framing, black humor and often brutal subject matters.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nPark was born and raised in Seoul and studied philosophy at Sogang University, where, in light of his disappointment with the analytic orientation of the department and consequent scant offerings in aesthetics, he started a cinema club, the 'Sogang Film Community', and published a number of articles on contemporary cinema. Originally intending to be an art critic, Park, upon seeing Vertigo, resolved to become a filmmaker. After graduation, he wrote articles on film for journals and soon became an assistant director of films like Kkamdong, directed by Yu Yeong-jin, and Watercolor painting in a Rainy Day, directed by Kwak Jae-yong (My Sassy Girl).\n\n\n== Career ==\nPark's debut feature film was The Moon Is... the Sun's Dream (1992). After five years, he made his second film, Trio. Park's early films were not successful at the box office, and he pursued a career as a film critic to make a living.In 2000, Park directed Joint Security Area, which was a great success both commercially and critically, even surpassing Kang Je-gyu's Shiri as the then most-watched film ever made in South Korea. This success made it possible for Park to make his next film more independently. Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is the result of this creative freedom.\nPark's unofficially-titled Vengeance Trilogy consists of Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002), Oldboy (2003) and Lady Vengeance (2005). It was not originally intended to be a trilogy. Park won the Grand Prix at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival for Oldboy. The films concern the utter futility of vengeance and how it wreaks havoc on the lives of those involved. Lady Vengeance was distributed by Tartan Films for the United States theatrical release in April 2006. American director Quentin Tarantino is an avowed fan of Park. As the head judge at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, he personally pushed for Park's Oldboy to be awarded the Palme d'Or (the honour eventually went to Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11). Oldboy garnered the Grand Prix, Cannes's second-highest honour. Tarantino also regards Park's Joint Security Area to be one of 'the top twenty films made since 1992'.\nIn a May 2004 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Park listed Sophocles, Shakespeare, Kafka, Dostoevsky, Balzac and Kurt Vonnegut as influences on his career.Since 2004, Park has been an owner of the filmmaking company Moho Film, which participated in the production of Snowpiercer (2013) and The Handmaiden (2016).\nIn 2006, Park was the member of official section jury at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival.\nIn February 2007, Park won the Alfred Bauer Prize at the 57th Berlin International Film Festival. The award, named after the festival's founder and in praise of works that introduce new perspectives, went to Park for his film, I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK.In 2009, Park directed the vampire film Thirst, starring Song Kang-ho, which won the Prix du Jury (alongside Fish Tank, directed by Andrea Arnold) at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. He considered directing Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy but ultimately turned it down.In 2011, Park said his new fantasy-horror film Paranmanjang (Night Fishing) was shot entirely on the iPhone. The film was co-directed with Park's younger brother, Park Chan-kyong, who had no prior directing experience. It was nominated for Berlinale Shorts during the 2011 Berlin Film Festival and won the Golden Bear for Best Short Film.\nIn 2013, Park directed his first English-language film, Stoker. He said he learned to accelerate the production process and completed filming in 480 hours. Although Park does speak English, he used an interpreter on set. On why the script attracted his attention, Park said: \"It wasn't a script that tried to explain everything and left many things as questions, so it leads the audience to find answers for themselves, and that's what I liked about the script... I like telling big stories through small, artificially created worlds\". On 2 March 2013, Park appeared on a panel discussion about the film Stoker held at the Freer Gallery of Art in the Smithsonian's Museums of Asian Art.In 2014, Park directed a short film commissioned by luxury brand Ermenegildo Zegna, co-written by himself, Ayako Fujitani, Chung Chung-hoon and Michael Werwie, scored by Clint Mansell, and starring Jack Huston and Daniel Wu. It screened at the Rome International Film Festival and the Busan International Film Festival.In September 2014, it was announced that Park would adapt Fingersmith, a historical crime novel by Sarah Waters. The film entered production in mid-2015 and ended on 31 October 2015. That film ended up becoming The Handmaiden and premiered in competition to rave reviews at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, where Artistic Director Seong-hie Ryu won the Vulcain Prize for the Technical Arts, and the film was nominated for both the Palme d' Or and Queer Palm. At the 2016 Buil Film Awards, The Handmaiden won for Best New Actress (Tae-ri Kim), The Buil Readers' Jury Award and Best Art Direction (Seong-hie Ryu). The film holds a 95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and saw box office success in several countries, including South Korea, the United States and the United Kingdom.In October 2014, it was announced that Park had signed on to direct the sci-fi body-swap film, Second Born.In January 2018, it was reported that Park would direct a TV miniseries adaptation of The Little Drummer Girl, a novel by John le Carr\u00e9. It aired on BBC One in October of that year and stars Michael Shannon, Florence Pugh and Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd. At the 24th Busan International Film Festival, Park announced that he is writing scripts for feature films, for theater and for TV, including a new installment in Vengeance Trilogy, and a second adaptation of Donald E. Westlake's novel The Axe.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPark was raised in a devout Catholic family in Korea, and describes himself as an atheist. He has collaborated with his younger brother, Park Chan-kyong, who is a media artist. He dedicated his career tribute to his wife Kim Eun-Hee at the 15th Marrakech International Film Festival.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Films ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Short films ===\n* directed with his brother Park Chan-kyong\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\nPark is a recipient of the Bogwan Order of Cultural Merit (2004).\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n2005.

          "This fort has protected the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur for centuries, in particular, the port of Antibes, first built by the Greeks 2,500 years ago. It is open from 10am to 5 or 6 pm year around except on Mondays. There are great views of Antibes and all between Antibes and Nice.",
          "Our tour guide was awesome, providing information in French AND ENGLISH because we requested it. She wasn\u2019t that confident that her English was good but it was AMAZING! Having been on the French only tour before, I definitely got a lot more from it this time! Really interesting",
          "If you like fortifications as much as me then this is the place for you. The fort originates from the 16th century, and was built on the heights above the harbour of Antibes by way of protection. Vauban redesigned the whole structure later in the 17th century, so that the fort",
          "Great views from the top. Our guide was entertaining and informative. A bit of an uphill hike but worth it. Not overly crowded. An old citadel where Napoleon was held captive for 10 days. Site of a James Bond movie Never Say Never with Sean Connery and Kim Basinger.",
          "Access is by walking along the edge of the harbour past all the expensive yachts and boats from Europe and some from Asia. The entrance to the fort is not easy to find but it provides an historic perspective of what was needed to defend the Cannes Port in earlier times.",
          "You can only visit the fort on a paid guided tour as parts of it are dangerous. However, the tours leave every 20 minutes or so in summer and are not expensive. The guides try to deliver the tour in both French and English. The layout of the Fort is fascinating, and you can",
          "We looked online to find it was closed at lunchtime except it wasn't. The internet was actually wrong. Children under 16 are free. 3\u20ac for adults. You get a guides tour with a staff member who speaks English and French. It took around 30 minutes and it didn't feel hurried. It is",
          "The nice guided walk, in English, was recommended. You could know the history of Antibes on the way from the port to the fort and took photos on the Old Town and the coastline. Worth the payment of fee.",
          "beautiful views. fun, quick tour. well preserved fort in the beautiful city of Antibes. parking is free and easy access across the road.",
          "Overall, we enjoyed the stroll around the castle and then did the mandatory guided tour that runs every 30 mins. If you have the time and looking for something to do this fortress was nice to see and provided a different view of Antibes but if you do not have time to visit here",
          "So we are in Antibes for week and looking for a good walk. So walked from harbour up to fort which overlooks the town. Only a few euro to get in and so worth it to take the guided tour of the fort and learn a bit of history. Our guide was lovely, a French girl who was able to",
          "We walked to the fort from the old town missing the sign to stay on the sports field side but eventually found the entrance by following the path around the harbour side. We thought the 3 Euro entrance was great value for the 30 minute guided tour. Our guide provided English",
          "It is quite a hike up the slopes to get here but well worth it. For \u20ac3 you get a guided tour and some idea of the way the fort was used back in the day. There are some very good views from the higher levels. My advice would be to try to time your visit so that you are not under",

          "We love this Fort and we visited again today whilst in Antibes. We were in an all English tour which was the last of the morning. Emily our guide has only been employed for a month and conducted the tour in English for us. She worked incredibly hard and the tour was a total",
          "This is an amazing place to visit. Great views of Antibes and the surrounding area from here. Emily, our guide, was marvellous. Made the history come alive, and was clearly passionate about it. The nerd in me loved the old door!",
          "We paid 3 Euros to enter the fort and had a private guided tour (in English) and then were able to explore on our own. A very interesting place to visit at a very low cost.",

          "A bit of a walk to get to the Fort itself as you can only approach it from the side not facing the town but well worth it. The fort can only be viewed as part of a guided tour but these are frequent and mean that you get much more from the visit. Out tour guide switched between",

          "Not a bad way to spend an hour or 2. Did learn a little. Would recommend especially if you like history.",

          "Not one of the most spectacular forts in Europe, this fort above Antibes is fairly plain with a long history including imprisonment of Napoleon during the French Revolution. A short, guided tour of the fort is okay, the views of the harbor and surrounding area are very nice.",

          "You can take envibus #14 and get off at the Fort parking, where the bus turns around. With only 3EUR it is definitely worth a visit. I waited for a guide who could do \"English\" tour along with French and really enjoyed this informative tour of Fort Carre. It might be a",
          "Fort Carre is an inexpensive (3 Euro) tour, which gives wonderful views over the Port Auban and the surrounding countryside. Our tour guide spoke French and English, but I believe this isn't always the case. Port Auban is the biggest marina in Europe and gets the biggest",

          "great fort. Nice to get a tour and see the different functions. Napoleon stayed here and you have nice views on the city, the water, nice, etc.",
          "For the small charge this is worth it for the views! The tour guide did the whole tour in French and English. Interesting history, and great photographic opportunities! It would have been nice to have had a translation booklet for the information boards, but we had a great visit.",
          "If you're in Mediterranean riviera you'll see the sea view in different spectacular aspect from the small sandy shore, from a popular museum and also from this Fort.",

          "The opening hours appear to be 10.00 to 16.00 with a lunch break from 12.30 to 13.00 (Tuesday to Saturday, but check the Antibes website or tourist office to be sure). Walk around the port to get there, follow signs around a sports field and then up the slope to the fort, which",
          "Tour in French only, my partner had to translate into English for myself and German for another couple, nothing really to see inside just walked around the place, the views of the old town and boats are however made it worth while, cheap too at only 3 euros. If you want a good",

          "Parking is across the street from the stadium. Then you walk to the left of the stadium, next to the sea and you will find a path with signs towards the fort. It is 3\u20ac for adults and 1,50\u20ac for students. The only way to see it is to take the guided tour. It is worth it. You",
          "After walking around Antibes and ending at the main port, I decided to walk to Fort Carre which appeared to be close. A short 10 minute walk later, I came to a sign that said the entrance was on the OTHER side. There was no direct route due to a high school sports field; it took",
          "For the paltry sum of 3 euros, this is a must-do. Even if you're not a history buff, it is the best place to take photos of the harbor and surrounding hillsides. If you ARE a history buff, then pay attention, because the tour guide is a treasure trove of information about this",
          "You can only visit the fort with a tour guide and luckily this was very cheap (3 euro full-price 1,50 for students etc). There is not a lot to see but the tour guides are very enthusiastic and the view is great!",
          "Fort Carre is one of those buildings, where people pass when they arrive in Antibes or leaving the town for the airport, but never actually visit. I for one, would really recommend it, it is a nice place to visit, the park surrounding it has many hidden surpries and the view",
          "Although one mud wait to join a guided tour it is well worth it. The admission price is ridiculously low and the guide very friendly, but be warned, only speaks French. The views of the Cote d'Azure from the walls are breathtaking and the interior very interesting. It is quite",
          "I was a bit surprised that this didn't rate higher on the things to do in Antibes, but in a way that was a good thing too - it meant fewer people. It's easy enough to find this from Antibes train station (we came here from Nice), there were lots of signs pointing towards it.",
          "Large fort overlooking the harbour and provides good views of the coast and the town. Guided tours are provided or you can make your own way around it.",
          "So it takes a while to get there, whichever way you walk (the route through the marina and then round the headland is more spectacular) and a guided tour (in French) is mandatory, but the views are awesome and the fort itself is interesting. The guide is also happy to translate",
          "I give this advice as my headline because I got there late and it was closed so I didn't get to see inside. I got some lovely photos of the outside but rue not really seeing it's true value",
          "The inner part of Fort Carre is accessible only by a 45 min long guided tour (3 Euros). Our guide spoke good English, gave us a great intro into the history of the place (why does it have 4 angles and where do they point? is there really a 500 year old door guarding the fort?)",
          "On a guided tour, the past life and working of the fort is interesting. The best however is the view on antibes and the walk around the fort.",
          "A great visit, will last less than one hour and well worth the visit. Hear about the history and walk the historic fortification where James Bond movie have been made!",
          "Quite a long walk up there with not many signs. At the reception you can't pay by card, what a shame, we had to ask money from other visitors (they were nice and borrowed some). The guy there didn't help us at all to find a solution. The view is amazing, but the fort is not",
          "We have been visiting Antibes for many years and have just got around to visiting the fort, the guides give tours in English or French. the tour is informative and the fort is in very good condition.",
          "Nicely located with good parking opportunities close to beach, track and field area and overlooking the harbour. Worth spending a couple of hours around here.",
          "We enjoyed our tour of the fort -- in English! It's interesting historically, and offers a great view of the huge harbor (over 1000 slips) and surroundings. It's a pretty long walk from old town though.",
          "Spent a lovely day in Antibes walking around mainly with an ice cream in my hand. The fort is fantastic for getting some excellent views and therefore photographs of the marina, Did not opt to do the tour but I believe it is really well priced. It is beautifully lit at night",
          "Fort Carre is superb fortress which overlooks the beautiful Marina and the Cote D' Azur. Sean Connery used the location to film Never \"Say Never Again\". The guided tour is good value for 3 Euros.",
          "Historically fabulous! We were told that it was 3 Euro for the guided tour of the fort...but only French speaking. No Guide No Go we were told! The views from the exterior of the fort are worth the walking...we loved it! There are amazing athletic fields+facilities below the",
          "Lights at night are worth it. But sun in the day is best shaded under the artistic sculture of the man of letters. Just part of the riviera no other place to go tour.",
          "A long walk to the entry, then a short wait for the 1/2 hour tour to begin . Given in broken English, as we would not have understood the French, it was difficult to grasp the detail although we appreciated the effort .It would have been helpful to have been given the English",
          "The place is really nice, but you are forced to take a 30 min guided visit. The guide was really rude and always rushing us. He didn't allow us to enjoy our time visiting the fort and admire the nice view. I believe is a nice place to visit, but they shouldn't force people to",
          "Fort Carre provides an excellent view of the coast and Antibes. There is a little effort needed to get there, with a 15 minute walk from the road, through the park area and up to the entrance. The visit is a mandatory guided visit, and is pleasant and not expensive (it is",
          "Seaside.... history.... and nature!!! I like it, near the sea, and the Antibes old village! A good place to be there!",
          "I don't understand why the authorities do not make more of this building. It needs better signage, marketing and you should be allowed to walk around it without a guide. The entrance is difficult to find and not inviting.",
          "We stayed only 5 minutes from the fort and visited it in the evening. It was well lit and it was a lot of fun walking around up top and seeing the harbor and boats at night. It's got a great view, and you can stroll through it pretty quickly.",
          "In the 14th century, Savoy\u2019s possession of the town was contended by France until it fell to them in 1481, after which Fort Carr\u00e9 was built and the port, today one of the busiest on the Mediterranean coast, was fortified by Vauban. The Fort is star-shaped, with entry via a",
          "Had nothing to do one weekend, so went to Fort Carre as it was walkable from the hotel. Good views, there is history behind the fort, but nothing too great.",
          "Fort Carre is worth visiting if military forts are your thing. The views are pretty cool and the guides are good. It's cheap (three euro for the guided tour) and it doesn't take all that long. I took the #14 bus (one euro) to get there and hung out on the beach before going in.",
          "This is down the way from the harbor we had just eaten lunch and this was our walk after. There is really nothing there just the fort which is quite cool on the water.",
          "Distance This place is next to the harbor, which is kind of close to the SNCF station. So if you're planning to visit this place, make sure you are ready to walk (and hike a bit), a lot! Around 3kms from the SNCF to the fort. Timing Make sure you time the visit to this place",
          "You can't miss this landmark so worth a visit just for the views over the marina and Antibes, about a 20 minute walk from Antibes harbour, cost about 3 euros entry and you get a guided tour, interesting history",
          "The worst part, you are charged to tour the fort with a guide. And the French guides take a 2 hour lunch break in the afternoon. The guides don't contribute much to the viewing experience. Nothing of substance is in the fort, but once you go to the top of the fort the view more",
          "I usually don't rate site seeing places but since was such a deception I take an exception. If you want to take a good scroll there are much better places in the neighborhood. And I just can't understand why one wants to see the incredible number of yachts in Antibes from a",
          "I visited the castle, without a guide. It takes a little while to get there indeed, and I could't say that it worth it. If you want to visit it either way you may have some fun but do not expect something special. There are much more impressive castles in southern France than",
          "We had been to several other forts on our trip, so this one was not particularly memorable. It was fun to walk around and the walled walk beside the ocean was beautiful.",
          "The fort was interesting, with information in English as well as French, but you have to go on the guided tour which was not mentioned in any of the literature that we had. Our guide was very good and spoke pretty good English, but we did feel rushed at some points and there"

        "wiki": "The MACM, the Mougins Museum of Classical Art (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Classique de Mougins) is an art museum located in the village of Mougins, in the Alpes-Maritimes region of France. It is 30 minutes from Nice airport and 15 minutes from the centre of Cannes.\nThe MACM opened to the public in June 2011. The museum has won several international awards and has loaned dozens of objects to other museums and university exhibitions all over the world.\nThe museum\u2019s large and diverse collection of antiquities includes Roman, Greek and Egyptian sculpture, vases, coins, and jewellery, and the world\u2019s largest private collection of ancient arms and armour .\nThe ancient artworks are interspersed with paintings, drawings, and sculptures by artists such as Henri Matisse, Marc Chagall, Raoul Dufy, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Auguste Rodin, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Andy Warhol, Marc Quinn, Antony Gormley, and Damien Hirst, and others. The collection also includes works by artists who spent time in Mougins, such as Francis Picabia, Jean Cocteau, Man Ray, and Pablo Picasso (who spent the final 12 years of his life in Mougins village).\nThe founder of the museum is Christian Levett, a British investment manager with an interest in history and art. A collector since childhood, in 2009 he formed the museum to place his antiquity and classical art collection on public display. The Mus\u00e9e de Mougins was created by remodelling a 600m2 medieval edifice to house his collection. The building itself used to be the village prison in medieval times, it was then turned into a mill before becoming a private residence in the 1950s.  The interior was entirely renovated to display the collection while the fa\u00e7ade remains in its original style.\nThe museum\u2019s director is Leisa Paoli.\n\n\n== Concept ==\nAlthough the majority of objects on display are antiquities, the museum embraces a concept of displaying ancient, neo-classical, modern and contemporary art side by side to show the pervasive and lasting influence of the ancient world. Thus works by Sir Peter Paul Rubens, Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Damien Hirst and others are included in the museum alongside their ancient inspirations.\nThis dialogue and fusion between ancient and modern is particularly clear in the museum where, for example, depictions of the Greek Goddess Aphrodite by Warhol, Dal\u00ed and Yves Klein accompany 1st and 2nd Century AD depictions of the Goddess, in marble and in bronze.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounder, Christian Levett, a philanthropist in the field, sponsored multiple exhibitions at The British Museum, Royal Academy, National Gallery, Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. He has funded archaeological works in the UK, Spain, Italy and Egypt and sponsored academic scholarships at Wolfson College and The Ruskin School of Art in Oxford. He has aided curatorial funding at The Ashmolean, The British Museum, and The British School at Rome.\nAs well as this, he has funded renovation works at The Charterhouse Museum London, Charterhouse School Surrey, The National Gallery and the chapel Notre Dame de Vie in Mougins, and has sponsored conferences at King\u2019s College London, Senate House UCL and at The Mougins Museum. He is a member of the Arms and Armour Committee at The Metropolitan Museum of New York and member of The Board of Visitors at The Ashmolean Museum Oxford and is a past board member of The Hadrian\u2019s Wall Trust. Levett is also an Honorary Fellow of The Ashmolean Museum, an honorary fellow of Wolfson College Oxford and a member of the Oxford University Chancellors Court of Benefactors.\nOn 29 October 2019 Levett consigned for sale at Christie's a marble statue of the Emperor Hadrian from his collection, known as the Cobham Hall Hadrian, to benefit the Museum.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe MACM is spread over four floors chronologically from the crypt to the second floor as follows: The Egyptian Gallery, in the crypt, depicts the theme of the afterlife with funerary masks, numerous other ancient artefacts and a sarcophagus, punctuated with works from Chagall, Calder, Rubens and Cocteau. The People and Personalities Gallery on the ground floor presents busts and statues of historical figures from ancient Greece and Rome, their influence highlighted by sculptures of Sosno, Arman, Quinn and Hirst. The Gods and Goddesses Gallery, on the first floor, displays Greek and Roman bronze and marble statues, heads and busts, pottery, glass and silverware, an extensive collection of coins and an antique jewellery display case. Works by neo-classical and modern artists such as Renoir, Rodin, Klein, Warhol, Picasso, Modigliani, Braque and Dal\u00ed are also exhibited in the museum. The Armoury, on the second floor, displays the largest private collection of Greek and Roman arms and armour in the world.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Publications ==\nThe MACM has produced several publications, including:\n\nMougins Museum of Classical Art, 2011, edited by M. Merrony\nLa Collection Famille Levett, 2012, edited by M. Merrony and translated by C. Dauphin\nAnimals in the Ancient World, 2014, C. Dauphin\nPompeii in Pictures, 2015, K. Sch\u00f6rle\nLes Animaux dans le Monde Antique, 2016, C. Dauphin\nDufy Dessine le Sud, 2019, F. Guillon Laffaille\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThe permanent collection at the MACM is constantly evolving. New pieces are acquired with a view to sustaining and developing the museum\u2019s concept of the fusion of ancient and modern art and the influence that Antiquity has had on subsequent artistic creation.\nThe Museum has also hosted and been otherwise involved in many temporary exhibitions:\n\n\n== Exhibitions at the MACM ==\nDoric, Sean Scully. 12 July - 29 September 2013\nVessels, Gary Komarin. 1 May \u2013 29 June 2014\nLayers of Time, Alexander Mihaylovich. 10 April - 14 June 2015\nPompeii in pictures, Giorgio Sommer. 19 June \u2013 2 August 2015\nAnimal, The Levett Bestiary collection.

It is a traditional hotel for film stars attending the Cannes Festival.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe present hotel is the result of the merger of the parcels of the former h\u00f4tel Beau-Rivage and of two neighbouring villas.

        "wiki": "Netflix, Inc. is an American media-services provider and production company headquartered in Los Gatos, California, founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California. The company's primary business is its subscription-based streaming service which offers online streaming of a library of films and television programs, including those produced in-house. As of April 2020, Netflix had over 182 million paid subscriptions worldwide, including 69 million in the United States. It is available worldwide except in the following: mainland China (due to local restrictions), Iran, Syria, North Korea, and Crimea (due to U.S. sanctions). The company also has offices in Brazil, the Netherlands, India, Japan, and South Korea. Netflix is a member of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). Today, the company produces and distributes content from countries all over the globe.\nNetflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental by mail, but Hastings abandoned the sales about a year after the company's founding to focus on the initial DVD rental business. Netflix expanded its business in 2007 with the introduction of streaming media while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental business. The company expanded internationally in 2010 with streaming available in Canada, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series House of Cards.\nSince 2012, Netflix has taken more of an active role as producer and distributor for both film and television series, and to that end, it offers a variety of \"Netflix Original\" content through its online library. By January 2016, Netflix services operated in more than 190 countries. Netflix released an estimated 126 original series and films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel. Their efforts to produce new content, secure the rights for additional content, and diversify through 190 countries have resulted in the company racking up billions in debt: $21.9 billion as of September 2017, up from $16.8 billion from the previous year. $6.5 billion of this is long-term debt, while the remaining is in long-term obligations. In October 2018, Netflix announced it would raise another $2 billion in debt to help fund new content. On July 10, Netflix became the largest entertainment/media company by market cap. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\n\nMarc Randolph and Reed Hastings founded Netflix on August 29, 1997 in Scotts Valley, California. Randolph worked as a marketing director for Hastings' company, Pure Atria. Randolph had co-founded MicroWarehouse, a computer mail-order company; Borland International later employed him as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the biggest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. The two came up with the idea for Netflix when commuting between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger, although Hastings has given several different explanations for how the idea came about.Hastings invested $2.5 million in startup cash for Netflix. Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model. Hastings and Randolph considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, first introduced in the United States on March 24, 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home-video sales and rental industry. Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of  Apollo 13, but he and Randolph designed this apocryphal story to explain the company's business model and motivation.Netflix launched as the world's first online DVD-rental store, with only 30 employees and 925 titles available -  almost the entire catalogue of DVDs at the time, - using the pay-per-rent model, with rates and due dates similar to those of its bricks-and-mortar competitor,  Blockbuster.\n\n\n=== Membership fee, Blockbuster acquisition offer, growth start ===\nNetflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999, and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time (see Technical details of Netflix), the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.In 2000, when Netflix had just about 300,000 subscribers and relied on the U.S. Postal Service for the delivery of their DVDs, they were losing money and offered to be acquired by Blockbuster for $50 million. They proposed that Netflix, which would be renamed as Blockbuster.com, would handle the online business, while Blockbuster would take care of the DVDs, making them less dependent on the U.S. Postal Service. The offer was declined.While they experienced fast growth in early 2001, both the dot-com bubble burst and the September 11 attacks occurred later that year, affecting the company badly and forcing them to lay off one-third of their 120 employees. However, sales of DVD players finally took off as they became more affordable, selling for about $200 around Thanksgiving time, becoming one of that year's most popular Christmas gifts. By early 2002, Netflix saw a huge increase in their subscription business.Netflix initiated an initial public offering (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at the price of US$15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during the fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.Randolph, a dominant producer and board member for Netflix, retired from the company in 2004.Netflix was sued in 2004 for false advertising in relation to claims of \"unlimited rentals\" with \"one-day delivery\".\n\n\n=== Video on demand introduction, declining DVD sales, global expansion ===\n\nFor some time, the company had considered offering movies online, but it was only in the mid-2000s that data speeds and bandwidth costs had improved sufficiently to allow customers to download movies from the net. The original idea was a \"Netflix box\" that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.Netflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers. On October 1, 2006, Netflix offered a $1,000,000 prize to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%.In February 2007, the company delivered its billionth DVD, and began to move away from its original core business model of DVDs, by introducing video on demand via the Internet. Netflix grew as DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011.Another contributing factor for the company's online DVD rental success was that they could offer a much larger selection of movie titles to choose from than Blockbuster's rental outlets. But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as Cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.In January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1 million United States streaming customers, and 29.4 million total streaming customers. In addition, revenue was up 8% to $945 million for the same period. That number increased to 36.3 million subscribers (29.2 million in the United States) in April 2013. As of September 2013, for that year's third quarter report, Netflix reported its total of global streaming subscribers at 40.4 million (31.2 million in the United States). By the fourth quarter of 2013, Netflix reported 33.1 million United States subscribers. By September 2014, Netflix had subscribers in over 40 countries, with intentions of expanding their services in unreached countries. By October 2018, Netflix's customer base reached 137 million worldwide, confirming its rank as by far the world's biggest online subscription video service.\n\n\n=== Early Netflix Original content ===\nNetflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution. Through its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. As of late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters. Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008, in part to avoid competition with its studio partners.\n\n\n=== Entertainment dominance, presence, and continued growth ===\nNetflix has been one of the most successful dot-com ventures. In September 2002, The New York Times reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers. The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14 million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of DVD players in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals as well. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.By 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the United States Postal Service's first-class service to the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America in the evening. In November, it began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals. On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services. Andy Rendich, a 12-year Netflix veteran, was to be CEO of Qwikster. Qwikster would carry video games whereas Netflix did not. However, in October 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and would not, in fact, create Qwikster for that purpose.In April 2011, Netflix had over 23 million subscribers in the United States and over 26 million worldwide. In July 2011, Netflix changed its prices, charging customers for its mail rental service and streaming service separately. This meant a price increase for customers who wanted to continue receiving both services. On October 24, Netflix announced 800,000 unsubscribers in the United States during the third quarter of 2011, and more losses were expected in the fourth quarter of 2011. However Netflix's income jumped 63% for the third quarter of 2011. Year-long, the total digital revenue for Netflix reached at least $1.5 billion. On January 26, 2012, Netflix added 610,000 subscribers in the United States by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, totaling 24.4 million United States subscribers for this time period. On October 23, however, Netflix announced an 88% decline in profits for the third quarter of the year.\n\nIn April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC. Politico referred to the PAC, based in Los Gatos, California, as \"another political tool with which to aggressively press a pro-intellectual property, anti-video-piracy agenda\". The hacktivist group Anonymous called for a boycott of Netflix following the news. Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers indicated that the PAC was not set up to support the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), tweeting that the intent was to \"engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA\".In February 2013, Netflix announced it would be hosting its own awards ceremony, The Flixies. On March 13, 2013, Netflix announced a Facebook implementation, letting United States subscribers access \"Watched by your friends\" and \"Friends' Favorites\" by agreeing. This was not legal until the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 was modified in early 2013.\n\n\n=== Rebranding and wider international expansion ===\nIn April 2014, Netflix approached 50 million global subscribers with a 32.3% video streaming market share in the United States. Netflix operated in 41 countries around the world. In June 2014, Netflix unveiled a global rebranding: a new logo, which uses a modern typeface with the drop shadowing removed, and a new website UI. The change was controversial; some liked the new minimalist design, whereas others felt more comfortable with the old interface. In July 2014, Netflix surpassed 50 million global subscribers, with 36 million of them being in the United States.Following the launch of Daredevil in April 2015, Netflix director of content operations Tracy Wright announced that Netflix had added support for audio description (a narration track that contains aural descriptions of key visual elements for the blind or visually impaired), and had begun to work with its partners to add descriptions to its other original series over time. The following year, as part of a settlement with the American Council of the Blind, Netflix agreed to provide descriptions for its original series within 30 days of their premiere, and add screen reader support and the ability to browse content by availability of descriptions.At the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show, Netflix announced a major international expansion of its service into 150 additional countries. Netflix promoted that with this expansion, it would now operate in nearly all countries that the company may legally or logistically operate in. A notable exception was China, citing the barriers of operating Internet and media services in the country due to its regulatory climate. Reed Hastings stated that the company was planning to build relationships with local media companies that could serve as partners for distributing its content in the country (with a goal to concentrate primarily on its original content), but stated that they were in no hurry, and could thus take \"many years\".Also in January 2016, Netflix announced it would begin blocking virtual private networks, or VPNs. At the same time, Netflix reported 74.8 million subscribers and predicted it would add 6.1 million more by March 2016. Subscription growth has been fueled by its global expansion. By the end of the year, Netflix added a feature to allow customers to download and play select movies and shows while offline.In February 2017, Netflix signed a music publishing deal with BMG Rights Management, where BMG will oversee rights outside of the United States for music associated with Netflix original content. Netflix continues to handle these tasks in-house in the United States. On April 17, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was nearing 100 million subscribers. On April 25, 2017, Netflix announced that it had reached a licensing deal in China with the Baidu-owned streaming service iQiyi, to allow selected Netflix original content to be distributed in China on the platform.\nThe Los Angeles Times stated: \"Its series and movies account for more than a third of all prime-time download Internet traffic in North America.\"On August 7, 2017, Netflix acquired Millarworld, the creator-owned publishing company of comic book writer Mark Millar. It is the first ever company acquisition in Netflix's history. Netflix plans to leverage Millar and his current and future work for future original content. Chief content officer Ted Sarandos described Millar as being a \"modern-day Stan Lee\". The following week, Netflix announced that it had entered into an exclusive development deal with Shonda Rhimes and her production company Shondaland.On January 22, 2018, the company crossed $100 billion in market capitalization, becoming the largest digital media and entertainment company in the world, bigger than every traditional media company except for AT&T, Comcast and Disney and the 59th largest publicly traded company in the US S&P 500 Index.On March 2, 2018, Netflix stock price surged to a new all-time high of $301.05 beating its 12-month price target of $300.00, and finishing the session with a market capitalization of $130 billion putting it within shouting distance of traditional media giants like Disney ($155 billion) and Comcast ($169 billion). The milestone came a day after British satcaster Sky announced a new agreement with Netflix to integrate Netflix's subscription VOD offering into its pay-TV service. Customers with its high-end Sky Q set-top box and service will be able to see Netflix titles alongside their regular Sky channels.On August 16, 2018, Netflix announced a three-year overall deal with black-ish creator Kenya Barris. Under the deal, Barris will produce new series exclusively at Netflix, writing and executive producing all projects through his production company, Khalabo Ink Society.On August 27, 2018, Netflix signed a five-year exclusive overall deal with international best\u2013selling author Harlan Coben. Under the multi-million pact, Netflix will work with Coben to develop 14 existing titles and future projects. On the same day, the company inked an overall deal with Gravity Falls creator Alex Hirsch.According to Global Internet Phenomena Report Netflix consumes 15% of all Internet bandwidth globally, the most by any single application.In October 2018, Netflix acquired ABQ Studios, a film and TV production facility with eight sound stages in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The reported purchase price is under $30 million.In November 2018, Paramount Pictures signed a multi-picture film deal with Netflix as part of Viacom's growth strategy, making Paramount the first major film studio to sign a deal with Netflix. A sequel to Awesomeness Films' To All the Boys I've Loved Before is currently in development at the studio for Netflix.Netflix sought and was approved for membership into the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) on January 22, 2019, as the first streaming service to become a member of the association.In April 2019, it was announced that Netflix was seeking to purchase Grauman's Egyptian Theatre from the American Cinematheque to use as a special events venue, Later on May 29, 2020, it was announced that Netflix will acquire the theater and invests in some renovations of it.In May 2019, Netflix acquired the StoryBots children's media franchise as part of a commitment to expand its educational content.On May 9, 2019, Netflix made a deal with Dark Horse Entertainment to make television series and films based on comics from Dark Horse Comics.In July 2019, Netflix announced that it would be opening a hub at Shepperton Studios as part of a deal with Pinewood Group.In early August 2019, Netflix negotiated an exclusive multi-year film and television deal with Game of Thrones creators/showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss reportedly worth US$200 million. As a result of their commitments to Netflix, Benioff and Weiss withdrew from an earlier agreement with Disney to write and produce a Star Wars film series.On November 13, 2019, Netflix and Nickelodeon entered into a multi-year content production agreement to produce several original animated feature films and television series based on Nickelodeon's library of characters, in order to compete with Disney's new streaming service Disney+, which had launched the day before. This agreement expanded on their existing relationship, in which new specials based on the past Nickelodeon series Invader Zim and Rocko's Modern Life (Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus and Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling respectively) were released by Netflix. New projects planned under the team-up include a music project featuring Squidward Tentacles from the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants, and films based on The Loud House and Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.In January 2020, Gloria Sanchez Productions entered a multi-year non exclusive first-look television deal with Netflix, and also entered a feature multi-year deal with Paramount Pictures.On February 25, 2020, Netflix formed partnerships with six Japanese creators to produce an original Japanese anime project. This partnership include manga creator group CLAMP, mangaka Shin Kibayashi, mangaka Yasuo Ohtagaki, novelist and film director Otsuichi, novelist Tow Ubutaka, and manga creator Mari Yamazaki.During the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, Netflix acquired 16 million new subscribers, which almost doubles the result of the final months of 2019.On April 7, 2020, Chernin Entertainment made a multi-year first look deal with Netflix to make films.\n\n\n== Ownership ==\nAs of 2017, Netflix shares were mainly held by institutional investors, including Capital Group Companies, The Vanguard Group, BlackRock and others.\n\n\n== Finance ==\nFor the fiscal year 2018, Netflix reported earnings of US$1.21 billion, with an annual revenue of US$15.8 billion, an increase of approximately 116% over the previous fiscal cycle. Netflix's shares traded at over $400 per share at its highest price in 2018, and its market capitalization reached a value of over US$180 billion in June 2018. Netflix ranked 261 on the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States companies by revenue. Netflix was announced to be the number one best stock in the 2010s, with a total return of 3,693%.\n\n\n== Services ==\nNetflix's video on demand streaming service, formerly branded as Watch Now, allows subscribers to stream television series and films via the Netflix website on personal computers, or the Netflix software on a variety of supported platforms, including smartphones and tablets, digital media players, video game consoles and smart TVs. According to a Nielsen survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the Wii, 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a PlayStation 3 and 12% an Xbox 360.When the streaming service first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services. Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.Netflix service plans are currently divided into three price tiers; the lowest offers standard definition streaming on a single device, the second allows high definition streaming on two devices simultaneously, and the \"Platinum\" tier allows simultaneous streaming on up to four devices, and 4K streaming on supported devices and Internet connections. The HD subscription plan historically cost US$7.99; in April 2014, Netflix announced that it would raise the price of this plan to $9.99 for new subscribers, but that existing customers would be grandfathered under this older price until May 2016, after which they could downgrade to the SD-only tier at the same price, or pay the higher fee for continued high definition access.In July 2016, a Netflix subscriber sued the company over the price increases, alleging he was told by a Netflix customer support representative in 2011 that they would pay the same price in perpetuity as long as they maintained their subscription continuously.On November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an Internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time. Netflix will partner with airlines to provide them with its mobile streaming technology. This will start in early 2018 as part of an effort to get airlines to provide better in-flight Wi-Fi.In 2018, Netflix introduced the \"Skip Intro\" feature which allows customers to skip the intros to shows on its platform. They do so through a variety of techniques including manual reviewing, audio tagging, and machine learning.\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nOn October 1, 2008, Netflix announced a partnership with Starz to bring 2,500+ new films and shows to \"Watch Instantly\", under Starz Play.In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.\nOn July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services. The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price. The announcement led to panned reception among Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall. Twitter comments spiked a negative \"Dear Netflix\" trend. The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change:\"Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs. Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering.\"In a reversal, Netflix announced in October that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.In January 2018, Netflix named Spencer Neumann as the new CFO.In January 2020, Netflix opened a new office in Paris with 40 employees.\n\n\n=== Disc rental ===\nIn the United States, the company provides a monthly flat-fee for DVD and Blu-ray rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional warehouses. As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the United States. The subscriber can keep the rented disc as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of discs that each subscriber can have simultaneously via different tiers. To rent a new disc, the subscriber must return the previous disc in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.\nNetflix offers pricing tiers for DVD rental. On November 21, 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-ray for an additional fee. In addition, Netflix sold used discs, delivered and billed identically as rentals. This service was discontinued at the end of November.On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, and similar deals involving Universal and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9. In 2011, Netflix split its service pricing. Currently, Netflix's disc rental memberships range from $7.99 to $19.99/m, including a free one-month trial and unlimited DVD exchanges.\nOn September 18, 2011, Netflix announced that it would split out and rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as Qwikster. CEO Reed Hastings justified the decision, stating that \"we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently.\" It was also announced that the re-branded service would add video game rentals. The decision to split the services was widely criticized; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other (with ratings, reviews, and queues not carrying over between them), and would have required separate user accounts. Also, the two websites would require separate subscriptions.On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it had shelved the planned re-branding in response to customer feedback and after the stock price plummeted nearly 30%, and that the DVD-by-mail and streaming services would continue to operate through a single website under the Netflix brand. Netflix stated that it had lost 800,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2011\u2014a loss partially credited to the poor reception of the aborted re-branding.In March 2012, Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch that it had acquired the domain name DVD.com. By 2016, Netflix had quietly rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.As of 2017, the service still had 3.3 million customers, and Hastings stated plans to keep it for at least five more years. In the first quarter of 2018, DVD rentals earned $60.2 million in profit from $120.4 million in revenue.\n\n\n=== Profiles ===\nIn June 2008, Netflix announced plans to eliminate its online subscriber profile feature. Profiles allow one subscriber account to contain multiple users (for example, a couple, two roommates, or parent and child) with separate DVD queues, ratings, recommendations, friend lists, reviews, and intra-site communications for each. Netflix contended that eliminating profiles would improve the customer experience. However, likely as a result of negative reviews and reaction by Netflix users, Netflix reversed its decision to remove profiles 11 days after the announcement. In announcing the reinstatement of profiles, Netflix defended its original decision, stating, \"Because of an ongoing desire to make our website easier to use, we believed taking a feature away that is only used by a very small minority would help us improve the site for everyone,\" then explained its reversal: \"Listening to our members, we realized that users of this feature often describe it as an essential part of their Netflix experience. Simplicity is only one virtue and it can certainly be outweighed by utility.\"\n\n\n==== Reintroduction ====\nNetflix reinvigorated the \"Profiles\" feature on August 1, 2013, that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles, associated either with individuals or thematic occasions. \"Profiles\" effectively divides the interest of each user, so that each will receive individualized suggestions and adding favorites individually. \"This is important\", according to Todd Yellin, Netflix's Vice President of Product Innovation, because, \"About 75 percent to 80 percent of what people watch on Netflix comes from what Netflix recommends, not from what people search for\". Moreover, Mike McGuire, a VP at Gartner, said: \"profiles will give Netflix even more detailed information about its subscribers and their viewing habits, allowing the company to make better decisions about what movies and TV shows to offer\". Additionally, profiles lets users link their individual Facebook accounts, and thus share individual watch queues and recommendations, since its addition in March after lobbying Congress to change an outdated act. Neil Hunt, Netflix's former Chief Product Officer, told CNNMoney: \"profiles are another way to stand out in the crowded streaming-video space\", and, \"The company said focus-group testing showed that profiles generate more viewing and more engagement\".Hunt says Netflix may link profiles to specific devices, in time, so a subscriber can skip the step of launching a specific profile each time s/he logs into Netflix on a given device.Critics of the feature have noted:\n\nNew profiles are created as \"blank slates\", but viewing history prior to profile creations stays profile-wide.\nPeople don't always watch Netflix alone, and media watched with viewing partner(s) \u2013 whose tastes might not reflect the owner(s) \u2013 affect recommendations made to that profile.In response to both concerns, however, users can refine future recommendations for a given profile by rating the shows watched and by their ongoing viewing habits.\n\n\n=== Subsidiaries ===\nDVD.com \u2013 Rents DVDs by mail\nMillarworld \u2013 A comic book company that was founded in 2004 by Scottish comic book writer Mark Millar as a creator-owned line.\nNetflix Pte.

While the player was initially developed at Netflix, Reed Hastings eventually shut down the project to help encourage other hardware manufacturers to include built-in Netflix support. Wood eventually launched the player as the first device from Roku Inc. which is now primarily known for its streaming video players, with Netflix serving as a primary investor in the new company.In 2011, Netflix introduced a Netflix button for certain remote controls, allowing users to instantly access Netflix on compatible devices.Netflix revealed a prototype of the new device called \"The Switch\" at the 2015 World Maker Faire New York. \"The Switch\" allows Netflix users to turn off lights when connected to a smart home light system. It also connects to users' local networks to enable their servers to order takeout, and silence one's phone at the press of a button. Though the device hasn't been patented, Netflix released instructions on their website, on how to build it at home (DIY). The instructions cover both the electrical structure and the programming processes.Since 2015, the company received significant technical support from France's CNRS concerning video compression and formating, through CNRS' Laboratoire des Sciences du Num\u00e9rique de Nantes (LS2N). In March 2017 at Barcelona's World Congress for mobile technologies, the American company presented the French lab's open-source technological creation: a compression tool allowing HD+ video quality with a bandwidth need of under 100 kilobytes per second, 40 times less than that of HDTV needs and compatible with mobile services worldwide.In May 2016, Netflix created a new tool called FAST to determine the speed of an Internet connection.\n\n\n== Content ==\n\n\n=== Original programming ===\n\nA \"Netflix Original\" is content that is produced, co-produced, or distributed by Netflix exclusively on their services. Netflix funds their original shows differently than other TV networks when they sign a project, providing the money upfront and immediately ordering two seasons of most series.In March 2011, Netflix began acquiring original content for its library, beginning with the hour-long political drama House of Cards, which debuted in February 2013. The series was produced by David Fincher, and starred Kevin Spacey. In late 2011, Netflix picked up two eight-episode seasons of Lilyhammer and a fourth season of the ex-Fox sitcom Arrested Development. Netflix released the supernatural drama series Hemlock Grove in early 2013.In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation and Netflix co-produced Turbo Fast, based on the movie Turbo, which premiered in July. Netflix has since become a major distributor of animated family and kid shows.\nOrange Is the New Black debuted on the streaming service in July 2013. In a rare discussion of a Netflix show's ratings, Netflix executives have commented that the show is Netflix's most-watched original series. In February 2016, Orange Is the New Black was renewed for a fifth, sixth and seventh season. On June 9, 2017, season 5 was premiered and the sixth season premiered on July 27, 2018.In November 2013, Netflix and Marvel Television announced a five-season deal to produce live-action Marvel superhero-focused series: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. The deal involves the release of four 13-episode seasons that culminate in a mini-series called The Defenders. Daredevil and Jessica Jones premiered in 2015. The Luke Cage series premiered on September 30, 2016, followed by Iron Fist on March 17, 2017, and The Defenders on August 18, 2017. In April 2016, the Netflix series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were expanded further, to include a 13-episode series of The Punisher. In addition to the Marvel deal, Disney announced that the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars would release its sixth and final season on Netflix, as well as all five prior and the feature film. The new Star Wars content was released on Netflix's streaming service on March 7, 2014.In April 2014, Netflix signed Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz and his production firm The Hurwitz Company to a multi-year deal to create original projects for the service. The period drama Marco Polo premiered on December 12, 2014. The animated sitcom BoJack Horseman premiered in August 2014, to mixed reviews on release but garnering wide critical acclaim for the following seasons.The science fiction drama Sense8 debuted in June 2015, which was written and produced by The Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski. Bloodline and Narcos were two other drama series that Netflix released in 2015. On November 6, 2015, Master of None premiered, starring Aziz Ansari. Other comedy shows premiering in 2015 included Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Grace and Frankie, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, and W/ Bob & David.\nNetflix continued to dramatically expand their original content in 2016. The science fiction horror Stranger Things premiered in July 2016, music-driven drama The Get Down in August, historical drama The Crown in November, and the year's premieres included comedy shows such as Love, Flaked, Netflix Presents: The Characters, The Ranch, and Lady Dynamite. Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.On September 14, 2016, Netflix and 20th Century Fox jointly acquired the U.S distribution rights to the Canadian independent drama film Two Lovers and a Bear following its screening at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2016.Netflix has also invested in distributing exclusive stand-up comedy specials from such notable comedians as Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Chris Rock, Jim Gaffigan, Bill Burr and Jerry Seinfeld. In January 2017, Netflix announced all Seinfeld's Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee episodes and season 10 would be on their service.The company has started internally self-producing its original content, such as The Ranch and Chelsea, through its Netflix Studios production house. Netflix expected to release 1,000 hours of original content in 2017.In October 2017, Netflix iterated a goal of having half of its library consist of original content by 2019, announcing a plan to invest $8 billion on original content in 2018. There will be a particular focus on films and anime through this investment, with a plan to produce 80 original films and 30 anime series. In September 2017, Minister of Heritage M\u00e9lanie Joly also announced that Netflix had agreed to make a CDN$500 million (US$400 million) investment over the next five years in producing content in Canada. The company denied that the deal was intended to result in a tax break. A study found that Netflix had realized this goal by December 2018.In November 2017, Netflix announced that it would be making its first original Colombian series, to be executive produced by Ciro Guerra.In May 2018, chief content officer Ted Sarandos stated that Netflix had increased its spending on original content, with 85% of its new content spending that year being devoted to it.On December 31, 2018, a concert film of Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour was released on Netflix.In January 2019, Sex Education made its debut as a Netflix original series with much critical acclaim. It was praised for its refreshing take on the teen dramedy genre with honesty, vulnerability, and raunch.In February 2019, Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand Goop signed a deal to produce a wellness-themed documentary series for Netflix. This led to widespread criticism of the streaming company for giving Paltrow a platform to promote her company, which has been criticized for making unsubstantiated claims about the effectiveness of the health treatments and products it promotes. Multiple critics argued that Netflix's move was \"a win for pseudoscience.\" Once The Goop Lab was available for review, numerous media outlets published harsh criticism of Netflix's decision to promote Goop:\n\nShowbiz Cheatsheet published \"The Goop Lab Isn\u2019t The First Time Netflix Has Forced You to Pay for Dangerous Opinions\", which said that \"Netflix documentaries have become a successful niche for the platform, but since they tackle real-life subjects, caveats should arguably be placed on-screen. Such is the case for health documentaries there, including the controversial and upcoming The Goop Lab that many deem an infomercial for Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop. Health documentaries pushing pseudoscience have become a cottage industry lately, which essentially means Netflix is making subscribers pay for opinions deemed a little bit dangerous... The least Netflix could do is place a message of warning saying the science behind these documentaries isn\u2019t necessarily proven. Doing so will give a caveat before going in and taking them as a new form of health gospel.\"\nPatheos published \"Gwyneth Paltrow's The Goop Lab Is Unscientific Garbage. Then It Gets Worse\" which said \"Shame on Netflix for promoting this harmful nonsense. Getting a few more eyeballs and subscriptions is apparently worth the cost of all the damage this show will do to public health if viewers take any of it seriously.\"\nWired UK wrote several reviews critical of both The Goop Lab, and of Netflix for creating it, saying \"Think Goop is bad? It's only the tip of Netflix's pseudoscience iceberg\".\n\n\n=== Film and television deals ===\nNetflix currently has exclusive pay TV deals with several studios. The pay TV deals give Netflix exclusive streaming rights while adhering to the structures of traditional pay TV terms. Netflix's United States library includes newer releases from Relativity Media and its subsidiary Rogue Pictures, as well as DreamWorks Animation (until May 2018, when the studio signed a new contract with Hulu), Open Road Films (though this deal expired in 2017; Showtime has assumed pay television rights), Universal Animation (for animated films declined by HBO), FilmDistrict, The Weinstein Company (whose co-founder, Harvey Weinstein, has been accused of sexual harassment as of 2017 (see Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations), causing Netflix to withdraw from hosting the 75th Golden Globe Awards with TWC, and ending its Golden Globes partnership with the mini-major film studio), Sony Pictures Animation, and the Walt Disney Studios (until 2019) catalog.\nOther distributors who have licensed content to Netflix include Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment and The Walt Disney Studios (including 20th Century Fox). Netflix also holds current and back-catalog rights to television programs distributed by Walt Disney Television, DreamWorks Classics, Kino International, Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Distribution, along with titles from other companies such as Allspark (formerly Hasbro Studios), Saban Brands, Funimation, and Viz Media. Formerly, the streaming service also held rights to select television programs distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution, Sony Pictures Television and 20th Century Fox Television. Netflix also previously held the rights to select titles from vintage re-distributor The Criterion Collection, but these titles were pulled from Netflix and added to Hulu's library. One of the more significant acquisitions was for the show Breaking Bad, produced by Sony Pictures Television. Netflix acquired the rights after the show's third season in 2010, at a point where original broadcaster AMC had expressed the possibility of cancelling the show. Sony pushed Netflix to release Breaking Bad in time for the fourth season, which as a result, greatly expanded the show's audience on AMC due to new viewers binging on the Netflix past episodes, and doubling the viewership by the time of the fifth season. Breaking Bad is considered the first such show to have this \"Netflix effect\".Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films would come to Netflix 90 days after their premiere on Epix. However, the exclusivity clause ended on September 4, 2012, when Amazon signed a deal with Epix to distribute its titles via the Amazon Video streaming service. These include films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.On September 1, 2011, Starz ceased talks with Netflix to renew their streaming arrangement. As a result, Starz's library of films and series were removed from Netflix on February 28, 2012. Titles available on DVD were not affected and can still be acquired from Netflix via their DVD-by-mail service. However, select films broadcast on Starz continue to be available on Netflix under license from their respective television distributors.\nNetflix also negotiated to distribute animated films from Universal that HBO declined to acquire, such as The Lorax, ParaNorman, and Minions.On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films. Later that year, on December 4, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, which were available on Netflix beginning in 2016. However, classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas were instantly available upon completion of the deal. Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013. The agreement with Disney ended in 2019, as the company was preparing to launch a new streaming service that would carry all Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel Studios, and Lucasfilm releases. Netflix retains the rights to continue streaming the Marvel series that were produced for the service. With the Disney-Fox merger, movie and TV titles from 20th Century Fox will likely follow suit after their deal with Netflix expires, except Two Lovers and a Bear, which Netflix will likely retain U.S streaming rights to as Fox and Netflix jointly acquired the U.S distribution rights to the film.Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes in 2011 welcomed Netflix's ability to monetize older content that was previously not generating money for media companies. On January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs, previously held by Amazon Video, were given to Netflix shortly after their deal with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. programs expired. However, Cartoon Network's ratings dropped by 10% in households that had Netflix, and so many of the shows from that channel and Adult Swim were removed in March 2015. However, most of these shows were added to Hulu in May of the same year.In Canada, Netflix holds pay TV rights to films from Paramount, DreamWorks Animation and 20th Century Fox (shared with The Movie Network), distributing all new content from those studios eight months after initial release. In 2015, the company also bought the Canadian pay TV rights to Disney films.In 2014, opinion blogger Felix Salmon wrote that Netflix could not \"afford the content that its subscribers most want to watch\". He cited as evidence the company's loss of rights to stream several major movies. According to journalist Megan McArdle, the loss of these movies was extremely problematic for the company; specifically, she said that \"[Netflix's] movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for a good movie rental place\".Netflix also began to acquire distribution rights to third-party films in 2017 into 2018. One of its first acquisitions was the film The Cloverfield Paradox, which Netflix had acquired from Paramount Pictures in early 2018, and launched on its service on February 4, 2018, shortly after airing its first trailer during Super Bowl LII. While the film was critically panned, analysts believed that Netflix's purchase of the film helped to make the film instantly profitable for Paramount compared to a more traditional theatrical release, while Netflix benefited from the surprise reveal. Other films acquired by Netflix include international distribution for Paramount's Annihilation, worldwide distribution of Universal's Extinction, and Warner Bros.' Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle. In February 2020, after Mattel Television ended the deal to broadcast the British television series Thomas & Friends on Nickelodeon in the US, they made a deal to stream the show in March 2020, making it the first time in years that Thomas content was available on Netflix. As of March 2020, Netflix offered just under 3,000 film titles for streaming on its U.S. service. This does not include multi-episode titles (series).\n\n\n==== Producers and distributors ====\nThe following only applies to the United States. Listed companies may still or may not have licensing agreements with Netflix in other territories.\n\n\n==== Current ====\n\n\n==== Former ====\n\n\n=== Interactive content ===\nNetflix has released some content that is interactive on certain devices, allowing the user to make choices that change the story and accompanying video track:\n\nIn June 2018, Netflix announced a partnership with Telltale Games to port its adventure games to the service in a streaming video format. The games would be adapted to be similar to the existing interactive narrative stories that Netflix already offers, allowing simple controls through a television remote. The first such game, Minecraft: Story Mode, was expected to be released later in the year, and Telltale also received rights to produce a video game adaptation of Stranger Things for conventional gaming platforms. In September 2018, Telltale underwent a \"majority studio closure\" and laid off nearly its entire staff beyond a skeleton crew of 25 employees, citing a loss of funding. Netflix stated that while the Minecraft: Story Mode port would go on, the company was seeking alternate options for the Stranger Things project.\n\n\n== Device support and technical details ==\n\nNetflix can be accessed via an internet browser on PCs, while Netflix apps are available on various platforms, including Blu-ray Disc players, tablet computers, mobile phones, smart TVs, digital media players, and video game consoles (including Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and the PlayStation 3). The Wii and the PlayStation 2 were formerly compatible with Netflix as well.\nIn addition, a growing number of multichannel television providers, including cable television and IPTV services, have also added Netflix apps accessible within their own set-top boxes, sometimes with the ability for its content (along with those of other online video services) to be presented within a unified search interface alongside linear television programming as an \"all-in-one\" solution.4K streaming requires a 4K-compatible device and display, both supporting HDCP 2.2. 4K streaming on personal computers requires hardware and software support of the Microsoft PlayReady 3.0 digital rights management solution, which requires a compatible CPU, graphics card, and software environment. Currently, this feature is limited to 7th generation Intel Core or later CPUs, Windows 10, Nvidia Geforce 10 series and AMD Radeon 400 series or later graphics cards, and running through Microsoft Edge web browser, or the Netflix universal app available on Microsoft Store.\n\n\n== Sales and marketing ==\n\nDuring Q1 2011, sales and rentals of DVDs and Blu-rays plunged about 35%, and the sell-through of packaged discs fell 19.99% to $2.07 billion, with more money spent on subscription than in-store rentals. This decrease was attributed to the rising popularity of Netflix and other streaming services.In July 2012, Netflix hired Kelly Bennett \u2013 former Warner Bros. Vice President of Interactive, Worldwide Marketing \u2013 to become its new chief marketing officer. This also filled a vacancy at Netflix that had been empty for over six months when their previous CMO Leslie Kilgore left in January 2012.Netflix's website has 117.6 million subscribers as of 2018, with 8.3 million being added in the fourth quarter of 2017. As of January 28, 2018, Netflix's website ranked as the 30th most trafficked website in the world and 9th most trafficked website in the United States.Netflix has a Twitter feed, used to tweet about the new and upcoming shows that include hashtags to encourage engagement of their audience to not only watch the show but to contribute to the hashtag themselves.\n\n\n== International expansion ==\n\nAs of October 2019, Netflix officially supports 26 languages for user interface and customer support purposes: Arabic (Modern Standard), Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian (Bokm\u00e5l), Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian and European), Romanian, Spanish (Castilian and Latin American), Swahili, Swedish, Thai, Turkish and Vietnamese.Netflix has encountered political controversy after its global expansion and for some of its international productions, including The Mechanism, Fauda and Amo. In June 2016, Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky asserted that Netflix is part of a US government plot to influence the world culture, \"to enter every home, get into every television, and through that television, into the head of every person on earth\". This was part of his argument for the increase of funding of Russian cinema to pitch it against the dominance of Hollywood.In February 2020 the company released its first report of when it has complied with government requested content takedowns in their countries, a total of 9 times since its launch:\nIn Singapore, Netflix complied with requests to take down Cooking on High, The Legend of 420, and Disjointed in 2018, The Last Temptation of Christ in 2019, and The Last Hangover in 2020.\nIn Germany,  Netflix complied with a request to take down a version of Night of the Living Dead in 2017.\nIn Vietnam,  Netflix complied with a request to take down Full Metal Jacket in 2017.\nIn New Zealand, Netflix complied with a request to take down the film The Bridge in 2015. The film is deemed objectionable by the country's Office of Film and Literature Classification.\nIn Saudi Arabia, Netflix complied with a request to take down an episode criticizing the country's government from the series Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj in 2019, which drew criticism in the media.In India, Netflix along with Disney's Hotstar announced plans in early 2019 to adopt self-regulation guidelines for content streamed on their platforms within the country in an effort to prevent potential implementation of government censorship laws. The Jordanian series Jinn was condemned by members of the country's government for contravening the country's moral standards, and the country's highest prosecutor has sought to have the series banned from streaming. On September 3, 2019, Netflix applied for a license to continue its streaming services in Turkey, under the country's new broadcasting rules. The television watchdog of Istanbul, Radio and Television Supreme Council (RT\u00dcK) issued new guidelines, under which content providers were required to get new license for operating in the country.  Netflix was later ordered by the RT\u00dcK to remove LGBT characters from their Turkish original series Love 101 and The Protector.\n\n\n=== Worldwide users ===\n\n\n== Competitors ==\n\nNetflix's success was followed by the establishment of numerous other DVD rental companies, both in the United States and abroad. Walmart began an online rental service in October 2002 but left the market in May 2005. However, Walmart later acquired the rental service Vudu in 2010.Blockbuster Video entered the United States online market in August 2004, with a US$19.95 monthly subscription service (equivalent to $27 in 2019). This sparked a price war; Netflix had raised its popular three-disc plan from US$19.95 to US$21.99 just prior to Blockbuster's launch, but by October, Netflix reduced this fee to US$17.99. Blockbuster responded with rates as low as US$14.99 for a time, but, by August 2005, both companies settled at identical rates. On July 22, 2007, Netflix dropped the prices of its two most popular plans by US$1.00 in an effort to better compete with Blockbuster's online-only offerings. On October 4, 2012, Dish Network scrapped plans to make Blockbuster into a Netflix competitor. (Dish bought the ailing Blockbuster, LLC in 2011 and will continue to license the brand name to franchise locations, and keep its \"Blockbuster on Demand\" video streaming service open.)In 2005, Netflix cited Amazon.com as a potential competitor, which until 2008, offered online video rentals in the United Kingdom and Germany. This arm of the business was eventually sold to LoveFilm; however, Amazon then bought LoveFilm in 2011. In addition, Amazon now streams movies and television shows through Amazon Video (formerly Amazon Video On Demand and LOVEFiLM Instant).Redbox is another competitor that uses a kiosk approach: Rather than mailing DVDs, customers pick up and return DVDs at self-service kiosks located in metropolitan areas. In September 2012, Coinstar, the owners of Redbox, announced plans to partner with Verizon to launch Redbox Instant by Verizon by late 2012. In early 2013, Redbox Instant by Verizon began a limited beta release of its service, which was described by critics as \"No Netflix killer\" due to \"glitches [and] lackluster selection\".CuriosityStream, a premium ad-free, subscription-based service launched in March 2015 similar to Netflix but offering strictly nonfiction content in the areas of science, technology, civilization and the human spirit, has been dubbed the \"new Netflix for non-fiction\".Hulu Plus, like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video, \"ink[s] their own deals for exclusive and original content\", requiring Netflix \"not only to continue to attract new subscribers, but also keep existing ones happy\".Netflix largely avoids offering pornography, but several \"adult video\" subscription services were inspired by Netflix, such as SugarInstant and WantedList.In Australia, Netflix most notably competes with Stan, the local SVOD competitor that only operates in the Australian marketplace and currently undercuts Netflix on monthly pricing while using extensive original Australian content as its major value proposition. Netflix currently holds a sizeable lead in market share over Stan, with Netflix reaching over 11.5 million household users in Australia in 2019 compared to Stan reaching over 2.5 million household users in the same period. In the Nordic countries, Netflix competes with Viaplay, HBO Nordic and C More. In Southeast Asia, Netflix competes with HOOQ, Astro On the Go, Sky on Demand, Singtel TV, HomeCable OnDemand, and iflix. In New Zealand, Netflix competes with local streaming companies including Television New Zealand (TVNZ), Mediaworks New Zealand, Sky Network Television, Lightbox, Neon and Quickflix. In Italy, Netflix competes with Infinity, Now TV and TIMvision. In South Africa, Netflix competes with Showmax. In the MENA region, Netflix competes with icflix, Starz Play Arabia, OSN's Wavo, and iflix Arabia. Also, in Brazil, Netflix competes with Globoplay, a Grupo Globo's streaming service, and PlayPlus, a Grupo Record's streaming service.\nIn Mexico, Televisa removed its content from Netflix in 2016 and moved it to its own streaming service Blim.The Walt Disney Company launched their own streaming service, Disney+, in November 2019. As a result, Disney content currently hosted on Netflix will begin to be phased out over the next couple of years. Disney reported in early 2020 that their subscriber count had blown past internal and industry estimates at 50 million globally - a 22 million increase since the prior report two months earlier.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nIn August 2017, an employee after getting fired was rampaging and destroying the interior of the building. He was later arrested for assault and the destruction of property.In February 2019, police stormed the Netflix headquarters in Hollywood after a man with a gun was reported wandering around the premises. The buildings were placed on lockdown.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\nOn July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online-only web television programs at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove and House of Cards, earned a combined 14 nominations (nine for House of Cards, three for Arrested Development and two for Hemlock Grove). The House of Cards episode \"Chapter 1\" received four nominations for both the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first webisode of a television series to receive a major Primetime Emmy Award nomination: David Fincher was nominated in the category of Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. \"Chapter 1\" joined Arrested Development's \"Flight of the Phoenix\" and Hemlock Grove's \"Children of the Night\" as the first webisodes to earn Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination, and with its win for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, \"Chapter 1\" became the first webisode to be awarded an Emmy. Fincher's win for Directing for a Drama Series made the episode the first Primetime Emmy-awarded webisode.On December 12, 2013, the network earned six Golden Globe Award nominations, including four for House of Cards. Among those nominations was Wright for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama for her portrayal of Claire Underwood, which she won at the 71st Golden Globe Awards on January 12. With the accolade, Wright became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for an online-only web television series. It also marked Netflix' first major acting award. House of Cards and Orange is the New Black also won Peabody Awards in 2013.On July 10, 2014, Netflix received 31 Emmy nominations. Among other nominations, House of Cards received nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Orange is the New Black was nominated in the comedy categories, earning nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew and Uzo Aduba were respectively nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (the latter was for Aduba's recurring role in season one, as she was promoted to series regular for the show's second season).Netflix got the largest share of 2016 Emmy award nominations among its competitors, with 16 major nominations. However, streaming shows only got 24 nominations out of a total of 139, falling significantly behind cable. The 16 Netflix nominees were: House of Cards with Kevin Spacey, A Very Murray Christmas with Bill Murray, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None, and Bloodline.Stranger Things received 19 nominations at the 2017 Primetime Emmy Awards, while The Crown received 13 nominations.In April 2017, Netflix was nominated for Broadcaster of the Year in the UK's Diversity in Media Awards.\nIn December 2017, Netflix was awarded PETA's Company of the Year for promoting animal rights movies and documentaries like Forks Over Knives and What the Health.\nAt the 90th Academy Awards, held on March 4, 2018, Netflix won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature for the film Icarus. During his remarks backstage, director and writer Bryan Fogel remarked that Netflix had \"single-handedly changed the documentary world\". Icarus had its premiere at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and was bought by Netflix for $5 million, one of the biggest deals ever for a non-fiction film.Netflix became the most nominated network at the 2018 Primetime and Creative Arts Emmy Awards with 112 nominations, therefore breaking HBO's 17-years record as most nominated network at the Emmys, who received 108 nominations.On January 22, 2019, Netflix scored 15 nominations for the 91st Academy Awards, including Best Picture for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's Roma, which was nominated for 10 awards. The 15 nominations equal the total nominations Netflix had received in previous years. Its increased presence in the Academy Awards has led filmmakers such as Steven Spielberg to speak out against the nomination of streaming content. As a possible solution, Netflix is in the process of buying Grauman's Egyptian Theatre to host events and screen its films and series. However, there are no plans to roll out full theatrical releases there.\n\n\n== Finance and revenue ==\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\nIn 2010, Netflix's stock price increased 219% to $175.70 and it added eight million subscribers, bringing its total to 20 million. Revenue jumped 29% to $2.16 billion and net income was up 39% to $161 million.\n\n\n=== 2011 ===\nIn April 2011, Netflix was expected to earn $1.07 a share in the first quarter of 2011 on revenue of $705.7 million, a huge increase compared to the year-earlier profit of 59\u00a2 on revenue of $493.7 million, according to a survey of 25 analysts polled by FactSet Research.At their peak, in July 2011, Netflix shares were trading for $299. Following the customer dissatisfaction and resulting loss of subscribers after the announcements by CEO Hastings that streaming and DVD rental would be charged separately, leading to a higher price for customers who wanted both (on September 1), and that the DVD rental would be split off as the subsidiary Qwikster (on September 18), the share price fell steeply, to around $130. However, on October 10, 2011, plans to split the company were scrapped. The reason being that \"two websites would make things more difficult\", he stated on the Netflix blog. On November 22, Netflix's share tumbled, as share prices fell by as much as 7%. By December 2011, as a consequence of its decision to raise prices, Netflix had lost over 75% of its total value from the summer. Describing their business model as \"broken\", Wedbush downgraded Netflix's stock rating to \"underperform\", the equivalent of sell.\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\nIn May 2014, Netflix increased the fee for UK subscribers by \u00a31. The price increase took effect immediately for new subscribers, but would be delayed for two years for existing members. Netflix applied similar increases in the United States (an increase of $1) and the Eurozone (an increase of \u20ac1). According to Forbes, \"Netflix can add roughly $500 million in annual incremental revenues in the U.S. alone by 2017 with this move\" and \"roughly $200\u2013250 million in incremental revenues from price changes in international markets\". However, Reuters' Felix Salmon is critical about Netflix's financial future, noting that \"any time that Netflix builds up a profit margin, the studios will simply raise their prices until that margin disappears\".\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\nIn April 2016, Netflix announced it would be ending a loyalty rate in certain countries for subscribers who were continuously subscribed before price rises. Netflix spent about $5 billion on original content in 2016; this compares to a 2015 revenue of US$6.77 billion (2015).\n\n\n=== 2019 ===\nIn 2019, Netflix reported revenues of $20.1bn and net income of $1.9bn. The company had total assets of $34.0bn, primarily content assets ($24.5bn). Netflix is now considered the largest buyer of video content globally.\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic Netflix reported \"revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2020 was $5.768B, a 27.58% increase year-over-year.\"\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\n\n=== Accessibility ===\nIn 2011, Netflix was sued by the U.S. National Association of the Deaf for not providing captioning for the deaf or hard of hearing on all of its content, citing the Americans with Disabilities Act. Netflix later agreed to a settlement, where it would caption its entire library by 2014, and by 2016, have captioning available for new content within seven days of release. In an unpublished decision issued 2015, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the ADA did not apply to Netflix in this case, as it is \"not connected to any actual, physical place\". Netflix has continued to face criticism from disability rights supporters over the quality of captioning on some of its content.\n\n\n=== Broadband and energy consumption ===\nOn March 18, 2020, Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services urged streaming services including Netflix to cut back their service to limit the stress on Europe's broadband networks. Confinement measures taken during the COVID-19 Pandemic increased pressure on the networks with people both working and looking for entertainment at home.  Netflix responded by agreeing  to reduce its streaming rate in the European Union countries by 25% for 30 days.  Although the streaming rate will be cut by 25%, users will still be able to stream in HD and 4K with reduced image quality.\n\n\n=== Content and partnerships ===\nIndividual Netflix productions have also faced controversy over their content. Critics argued that 13 Reasons Why glamorized mental health issues such as suicide, depression and post-traumatic stress. In 2018, Netflix was criticized for using stock footage from the 2013 Lac-M\u00e9gantic rail disaster in Bird Box and Travelers. The footage was subsequently replaced. In January 2019, Netflix censored an episode of Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj in Saudi Arabia after requests by the Communications and Information Technology Commission, citing material critical of the country (such as Mohammad bin Salman and the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen).The announcement that Gwyneth Paltrow's company Goop had partnered with Netflix led to criticism, noting that the company has frequently been criticized for making unsubstantiated claims about the effectiveness of health treatments and products that it promotes. Multiple critics argued that granting Goop access to Netflix's platform was a \"win for pseudoscience\".\n\n\n=== Film distribution model ===\nNetflix's distribution model for original films has led to conflicts with the legacy film industry. Some cinemas have refused to screen films distributed theatrically by Netflix (primarily to ensure awards eligibility), as it defies the standard three-month release window, and releases them simultaneously on its streaming platform (although Roma was instead given a three-week run before being added to the streaming service). Steven Spielberg, governor of the directors branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), has been critical of the streaming model over the \"communal\", cinema experience, but later clarified his views by arguing that viewers should have access to \"great stories\", and be able to \"find their entertainment in any form or fashion that suits them\". In April 2019, AMPAS voted against the possibility of changes to the Academy Awards eligibility criteria to account for streaming services such as Netflix, although AMPAS president John Bailey did state that the organization would \"further study the profound changes occurring in our industry\".In 2018, Netflix pulled out of the Cannes Film Festival, in response to new rules requiring competition films to have been released in French theaters. The Cannes premiere of Okja in 2017 was controversial, and led to discussions over the appropriateness of films with simultaneous digital releases being screened at an event showcasing theatrical film; audience members also booed at the Netflix vanity plate at the screening. Netflix's attempts to negotiate allowing a limited release in France were curtailed by organizers, as well as French cultural exception law\u2014where theatrically screened films are legally forbidden from being made available via video on-demand services until at least 36 months after their release.Beginning at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, films may now be restricted from screening at Scotiabank Theatre Toronto\u2014one of the festival's main venues\u2014and screened elsewhere (such as TIFF Bell Lightbox and other local cinemas) if distributed by a service such as Netflix. Organizers stated that the restriction was due to a policy enforced by the facility's owner and operator, Cineplex Entertainment, requiring adherence to 3-month theatrical windows.\n\n\n=== Tax avoidance ===\nAccording to a blog post by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, Netflix reported its largest ever profit in the US for 2018, but paid nothing in federal or state tax. The explanation is that US Tax law allows companies to claim tax credit on foreign earnings and thus avoid double taxation. US Senator Bernie Sanders has criticized Netflix for this both on Twitter  and at a Fox News town hall event on April 15, 2019. A spokesperson from Netflix has addressed such claims as \"inaccurate\", but no evidence has been provided that Netflix did pay any state or federal taxes.Allegations of tax evasion are also being investigated by Italian prosecutors. While Netflix doesn't have a headquarters in Italy, the prosecution claims that the digital infrastructure such as servers and cables amounts to a physical presence in the country.\n\n\n=== Viewership figure claims ===\nNetflix has been called out by some media organizations and competitors for only rarely and selectively releasing its ratings and viewer numbers. A notable instance of this involves the film Bird Box. A week after its release, Netflix claimed that it had the biggest seven-day viewing record of any of its original films at over 45 million viewers, but did not provide data to validate it. It also was not possible to accurately compare its week-long success to a major cultural event such as the Super Bowl or Academy Awards or to a blockbuster film run. In June 2019, Netflix claimed that 30,869,863 accounts watched the Adam Sandler- and Jennifer Aniston-starring Netflix original film Murder Mystery, despite it being critically panned, making it the biggest \"opening weekend\" for a Netflix original film. If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556 million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of Game of Thrones.In the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average. This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of The Witcher with that of HBO's Game of Thrones.\n\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode. Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.Netflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of House of Cards: \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300 million and $400 million, which makes Netflix's deal for House of Cards extremely cost effective, according to Spacey. Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they do not need to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.\nThe Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60-percent of Americans said that they binge-watch shows, and nearly 8 out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule. Netflix has continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHulu\nPeacock (streaming service)\nCBS All Access\nDisney+\nHBO Max\nList of accolades received by Netflix\nStreaming television\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNetflix \nBusiness data for Netflix:",

        "wiki": "The Rothschild banking family of France is a French banking dynasty founded in 1812 in Paris by James Mayer de Rothschild (1792\u20131868). James was sent there from his home in Frankfurt, Germany, by his father, Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744\u20131812). Wanting his sons to succeed on their own and to expand the family business across Europe, Mayer Amschel Rothschild had his eldest son remain in Frankfurt, while his four other sons were sent to different European cities to establish a financial institution to invest in business and provide banking services. Endogamy within the family was an essential part of the Rothschild strategy in order to ensure control of their wealth remained in family hands.\n\n\n== Involvement in finance and industry ==\nThrough their collaborative efforts, the Rothschilds rose to prominence in a variety of banking endeavors including loans, government bonds and trading in bullion. Their financing afforded investment opportunities and during the 19th century, they became major stakeholders in large-scale mining and rail transport ventures that were fundamental to the rapidly expanding industrial economies of Europe. In partnership with N M Rothschild & Sons of England, they owned Chemin de Fer du Nord railway in France that ran from their Gare du Nord station in Paris to the English Channel. In addition, the Rothschilds in France became leaders in the wine growing industry. By the later part of the 19th century, oil was fast becoming an important commodity and the French bank was heavily involved in oil exploration in the Baku area of present-day Azerbaijan through their company, the Caspian and Black Sea Oil Industry and Trade Society established in 1883. Their investment proved to be a lucrative one and by the turn of the century, the various oil companies in Azerbaijan were producing more oil than any other country in the world. In 1898, the Rothschilds established the Mazut Transportation Society that developed a fleet of oil tankers operating in the Caspian Sea. In 1911, the Royal Dutch Shell company purchased the Azerbaijan oil fields from the Rothschild family.\nThe French Revolution in 1789 brought positive changes for French Jews, resulting in their full emancipation in 1791. In 1806, Napoleon I ordered the convening of a \"Grand Sanhedrin\" in Paris and in 1808 he organized the \"Consistoire central des Isra\u00e9lites de France\", the administrative agency for all French Jews. The consistorial system made Judaism a recognized religion and placed it under government control. This Consistoire has been a functioning body ever since, except under the Nazi occupation of France during World War II. By tradition, the Central Consistoire has had a member of the Rothschild family as its President.\nJacob Mayer Rothschild, the youngest son, settled in Paris in 1812 where his name Jacob was translated to James. In 1817, he formally created the bank, de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res whose partners were brothers Amschel of Germany, James of France, Carl of Naples, Nathan of England and Salomon of Austria. Highly successful as lenders and investors, the Paris operation also became bankers for Leopold I of Belgium. In 1822 the influential James and his four brothers were awarded the hereditary title of \"Baron\" by Emperor Francis I of Austria.\nFollowing the July Revolution of 1830 that saw Louis-Philippe come to power in France, James de Rothschild put together the loan package to stabilize the finances of the new government and a second loan in 1834. In recognition of his services to the nation, King Louis-Philippe elevated James to a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor. According to the records, in 1815 the capital of the Paris banking house James Mayer de Rothschild founded amounted to \u00a355,000 (equivalent to \u00a33.7 million in 2016); by 1852 the figure was \u00a33,541,700 (equivalent to \u00a3409.2 million in 2016), and just ten years after his death, \u00a316,914,000 (equivalent to \u00a31.71 billion in 2016). There is a theory that before Louis-Phillipe came to power the Rothschilds were fronting for the House of Orleans. A major portion of the business has consisted of selling French government bonds to French investors through London to protect their anonymity. There was a general perception on the part of the French that otherwise their government might unilaterally reset terms.\nNo French fortune was more likely to face the problem than the younger branch of the royal family. The theory follows that when the Orleanists came to power they became less provident but by then the Rothschilds had numerous other clients.\nThe de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res banking business was passed down to ensuing generations. Run by his sons Gustave and Alphonse, during the Franco-Prussian War the bank put together a syndicate that raised the five billion francs the country was obliged to pay Prussia under the terms of the 1871 armistice. James Mayer de Rothschild had stipulated \"that the three branches of the family descended from him always be represented.\" For the next two generations that was the case but in 1939, Edouard Alphonse de Rothschild and cousin Robert-Philippe-Gustave de Rothschild, incompatible with their other cousin Maurice de Rothschild, bought out his share. Maurice went on to be enormously successful and, having inherited a fortune from the childless Adolph Carl von Rothschild of the Naples branch of the family, he moved to Geneva, Switzerland and perpetuated the new Swiss branch of the family.\nIn 1873 de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res in France and N M Rothschild & Sons of London joined with other investors to acquire the Spanish government's money-losing Rio Tinto copper mines. The new owners restructured the company and turned it into a profitable business. By 1905, the Rothschild interest in Rio Tinto amounted to more than 30 percent. In 1887, the French and English Rothschild banking houses lent money to, and invested in, the De Beers diamond mines in South Africa, becoming its largest shareholders.\nChanges in the heads of government, war, and other such events affected the family's fortunes both for their benefit and to their detriment. However, the interests of all Rothschild banking families across Europe were adversely impacted in a very major way by three historical events: 1) the Revolutions of 1848, 2) the Great Depression of the 1930s and 3) Nazism of the late 30s through World War II. For the French branch, the 1981 nationalization by the newly elected socialist government of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was an equally significant disaster.In 1953, future President of France, Georges Pompidou, joined de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res and from 1956-1962 he served as general manager. In 1962, the Rothschild's created Im\u00e9tal (now named Imerys), an umbrella company for their considerable mining ventures. Headed by Guy de Rothschild, Im\u00e9tal looked outward, investing in Great Britain and the United States, a move that put him on the December 20, 1963 cover of Time. In the 1960s, government reform of banking regulations ended the legal distinction between banques d'affaires and deposit banks and in 1967 de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res became Banque Rothschild, a limited-liability company.\nA part of the success of the bank that James Rothschild built was through the funding of loans to European governments. This sector of banking began to decline during the latter part of the 19th century following the introduction of new methods for government financing. By 1980, the Paris business employed about 2,000 people and had an annual turnover of 26 billion francs ($5 billion in the currency rates of 1980). But then the Paris business suffered a near death blow in 1981 when the Socialist government of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand nationalized and renamed it Compagnie Europ\u00e9enne de Banque. In 1987 a successor company called Rothschild & Cie Banque was created by David Ren\u00e9 de Rothschild who was joined by his half-brother Edouard de Rothschild and cousin Eric de Rothschild. Capitalized at only $1 million and starting with just three employees, they soon built their tiny investment bank into a major competitor in France and continental Europe. In 2003, following the retirement of Sir Evelyn de Rothschild as head of N M Rothschild & Sons of London, the English and French firms merged into the Group Rothschild under the leadership of David Ren\u00e9 de Rothschild. In 2006, the French banking division expanded into Brussels, Belgium.\n\n\n== Decline and rise of economic power ==\nBy the end of the 19th century, the introduction of national taxation systems had ended the Rothschild's policy of operating with a single set of commercial account records resulting in the various houses gradually going their own separate ways. The system of the five brothers and their successor sons had all but disappeared by World War I. However, the estate tax relative to the bank and corporate assets was far more detrimental long-term because it restricted growth at a time when publicly owned banks were expanding rapidly with huge resources raised on capital markets.  In the 1930s, their vast railroad holdings were nationalized and in 1940 the Nazis seized their bank. Then, after having the bank restored to them at the end of the war, in 1981 the bank Rothschild Freres was nationalized by the French socialist government of President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. The New York Times wrote that the Rothschilds \"grossly misjudged the opportunities directly across the Atlantic\" and quoted Evelyn Robert de Rothschild as saying that while the family had been in business for 200 years \"we never seized the initiative in America and that was one of the mistakes my family made.\"\n\n\n== The Rothschilds today ==\n\nBoth the British and the French branches emerged from the Second World War with new generations of the family at the helm. Historic partnership ties between the two branches were revitalized, leading to a complete merger in 2003 into Rothschild & Co.\nAn enduring entrepreneurial spirit saw business survive nationalization in France and the development of an international network of branch offices.\nThe Rothschilds created their first hedge funds in 1969, and strengthened its position as a world leader in investment banking. Additionally, the firm is a global private bank with over 4,000 private clients in 90 countries.  Rothschild & Co provides a comprehensive range of services to individuals, governments, and corporations worldwide.\n\n\n== Involvement in wine growing ==\nThe second French branch was founded by Nathaniel de Rothschild (1812\u20131870). Born in London, he was the fourth child of the founder of the British branch of the family, Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777\u20131836). In 1842, he married Charlotte de Rothschild (1825\u20131899), daughter of James Mayer de Rothschild and in 1850, they moved to Paris, where he was to work for his father-in-law's bank. However, in 1853 Nathaniel acquired Ch\u00e2teau Brane Mouton, a vineyard in Pauillac in the Gironde d\u00e9partement. Nathaniel Rothschild renamed the estate Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild: it would become one of the best-known wine labels in the world.\nIn 1868, Nathaniel's uncle/father-in-law, James Mayer de Rothschild, acquired the prestigious neighboring vineyard, Ch\u00e2teau Lafite.\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nThe French Rothschilds and members of the other branches in Europe were all major contributors to causes in aid of the Jewish people. However, many of their philanthropic efforts extended far beyond Jewish ethnic or religious communities. They built hospitals and shelters for the needy, supported cultural institutions and were patrons of individual artists. Their donation of works of art to various galleries has been the largest of any family in history. At present, a research project is underway by The Rothschild Archive  in London to document the family's philanthropic involvements.\n\n\n== Family members ==\n\nNotable Rothschild family members in France include:\n\n\n== Rothschild properties ==\nAll branches of the Rothschild banking family are famous for their art collections and a number for their palatial estates.

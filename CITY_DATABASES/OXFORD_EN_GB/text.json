        "wiki": "Oxford Castle is a large, partly ruined Norman medieval castle on the western side of central Oxford in Oxfordshire, England. Most of the original moated, wooden motte and bailey castle was replaced in stone in the late 12th or early 13th century and the castle played an important role in the conflict of the Anarchy. In the 14th century the military value of the castle diminished and the site became used primarily for county administration and as a prison. The surviving rectangular St George's Tower is now believed to pre-date the remainder of the castle and be a watch tower associated with the original Saxon west gate of the city.\nMost of the castle was destroyed in the English Civil War and by the 18th century the remaining buildings had become Oxford's local prison. A new prison complex was built on the site from 1785 onwards and expanded in 1876; this became HM Prison Oxford.\nThe prison closed in 1996 and was redeveloped as a hotel and visitor attraction. The medieval remains of the castle, including the motte and St George's Tower and crypt, are Grade I listed buildings and a Scheduled Monument.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nAccording to the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis (Abingdon Chronicle), Oxford Castle was built by the Norman baron Robert D'Oyly the elder from 1071\u201373. D'Oyly had arrived in England with William I in the Norman Conquest of England and William the Conqueror granted him extensive lands in Oxfordshire. Oxford had been stormed in the invasion with considerable damage, and William directed D'Oyly to build a castle to dominate the town. In due course D'Oyly became the foremost landowner in Oxfordshire and was confirmed with a hereditary royal constableship for Oxford Castle. Oxford Castle is not among the 48 recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, but not every castle in existence at the time was recorded in the survey. D'Oyly (d'Oilly)'s Oxford holdings are, however, mentioned in the Domesday Book as \"Meadow 30 acres. 1 mill, value 0.5 [pounds].\"; the mill mentioned is presumably the Castle Mill, formerly adjacent to the still surviving St. George's Tower, rebuilt in 1781 before eventually being demolished in 1930.D'Oyly positioned his castle to the west side of the town, using the natural protection of a stream off the River Thames on the far side of the castle, now called Castle Mill Stream, and diverting the stream to produce a moat. There has been debate as to whether there was an earlier English fortification on the site, but whilst there is archaeological evidence of earlier Anglo-Saxon habitation there is no conclusive evidence of fortification. Oxford Castle was an \"urban castle\", overlying a portion of the Saxon town wall, but it remains uncertain whether local buildings were demolished to make room for it. Poore et al. (2009) give a suggested street plan of the town in late Saxon times (their figure 4) showing the then town wall with its north, west, south and east gates; at the north gate is the Saxon tower now associated with the church of St Michael at the North Gate, while the west gate is occupied by the apparently Saxon tower of St. George's, which is now believed to have subsequently been incorporated into the fabric of the later Norman castle.\n\nThe initial castle was probably a large motte and bailey, copying the plan of the castle that D'Oyly had already built 12 miles (19 km) away at Wallingford. The motte was originally about 60 feet (18 m) high and 40 feet (12 m) wide, constructed like the bailey from layers of gravel and strengthened with clay facing. There has been debate over the sequencing of the motte and the bailey: it has been suggested that the bailey may have built first (thus utilising the pre-existing St. George's Tower as the first keep) which would make the initial castle design a ringwork rather than a motte and bailey.By the late 12th to early 13th century, the original palisade walls and wooden keep had been replaced in stone. The new curtain wall incorporated St George's Tower, which is built of coral rag stone, 30 by 30 feet (9 m \u00d7 9 m) at the base and tapering significantly toward the top for stability. This was the tallest of the castle's towers, and is now believed to be a survival from late Saxon times (c. 1020) as a watch tower associated with the west gate of the Saxon city. Evidence that this tower is Saxon in origin and thus pre-dates the castle itself is presented in Poore et al. (2009), who comment that \"a single, massive stone tower does not seem to belong within the outer defences of an earth-and-timber castle\", and other sources have concurred on architectural grounds, also noting that its orientation does not match that of the remainder of the castle, and that its height would have originally afforded an extensive view over the city, but which would have been superseded (and in fact, blocked) with the construction of the castle motte. The date of the remaining towers is uncertain although the southernmost, round tower, of which the base still remains, is dated to 1235 in various documentary sources, including Woolnoth's The Ancient Castles of England and Wales of 1825; in at least one source, it is referred to as \"Henry III's Tower\".Inside the walls the buildings included a chapel with a crypt attached to St. Georges Tower, which may be on the site of a previous church. The chapel originally had a nave, chancel and an apsidal sanctuary. It was a typical early Norman design with solid pillars and arches. In 1074 D'Oyly and his close friend, Roger d'Ivry had endowed a chapel with a college of priests, which is presumed to be the structure in question; at an early stage it acquired a dedication to Saint George. As detailed below, the crypt of this chapel still survives, albeit in a new location within the castle, having been moved and reconstructed from its original materials in 1794.\nThe ten-sided stone shell keep, 58 feet (18 m), constructed in the 13th century to replace an earlier wooden structure, closely resembled those of Tonbridge and Arundel Castles. The keep enclosed a number of buildings, leaving an inner courtyard only 22 feet (7 m) across. Within the keep, stairs led 20 feet (6 m) down to an underground 12 feet (3.7 m) wide stone chamber, with an Early English hexagonal vault and a 54 feet (16 m) deep well providing water in the event of siege.\n\n\n=== Role in the Anarchy and Barons War ===\n\nRobert D'Oyly the younger, Robert D'Oyly the elder's nephew, had inherited the castle by the time of the civil war of the Anarchy in the 1140s. After initially supporting King Stephen, Robert declared his support for Empress Matilda, Stephen's cousin and rival for the throne, and in 1141 the Empress marched to Oxford to base her campaign at the castle. Stephen responded by marching from Bristol in the Autumn of 1142, attacking and seizing the town of Oxford and besieging Matilda in the castle. Stephen set up two siege mounds beside the castle, called Jew's Mount and Mount Pelham, on which he placed siege engines, largely for show, and proceeded to wait for Matilda's supplies to run low over the next three months. Stephen would have had difficulty in supplying his men through the winter period, and this decision shows the apparent strength of Oxford Castle at the time.Finally in December, Matilda responded by escaping from the castle; the popular version of this has the Empress waiting until the Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage in the snow, being lowered down the walls with three or four knights, before escaping through Stephen's lines in the night as the king's sentries tried to raise the alarm. The chronicler William of Malmesbury, however, suggests Matilda did not descend the walls, but instead escaped from one of the gates. Matilda safely reached Abingdon-on-Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day. Robert had died in the final weeks of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney for the remainder of the war. At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D'Oyly, Robert D'Oyly the younger's son, in 1154.In the Barons' War of 1215\u201317 the castle was attacked again, prompting further improvements in its defences. In 1220 Falkes de Breaut\u00e9, who controlled many royal castles in the middle of England, demolished the Church of St Budoc to the south-east of the castle and built a moated barbican to further defend the main gate. The remaining wooden buildings were replaced in stone, including the new Round Tower which was built in 1235. King Henry III turned part of the castle into a prison, specifically for holding troublesome University clerks, and also improved the castle chapel, replacing the older barred windows with stained glass in 1243 and 1246. Due to the presence of Beaumont Palace to the north of Oxford, however, the castle never became a royal residence.\n\n\n=== 14th\u201317th centuries ===\n\nBy 1327 the fortification, particularly the castle gates and the barbican, was in poor condition and \u00a3800 was estimated to be required for repairs. From the 1350s onwards the castle had little military use and was increasingly allowed to fall into disrepair. The castle became the centre for the administration of the county of Oxford, a jail, and a criminal court. Assizes were held there until 1577, when plague broke out in what became known as the \"Black Assize\": the Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire, two knights, eighty gentlemen and the entire grand jury for the session all died, including Sir Robert D'Oyley, a relative of the founder of the castle. Thereafter assizes ceased to be held at the castle.Ralph Agas's map of Oxford in 1578 shows that by then, while the curtain wall, keep and towers remained, the barbican had been demolished to make way for houses. Hassall, 1976, states that by 1600 the moat was almost entirely silted up and houses had been built all around the edge of the bailey wall, although this is contradicted by the castle's appearance in John Speed's map of Oxford, 1605. In 1611 King James I sold Oxford Castle to Francis James and Robert Younglove, who in turn sold it to Christ Church College in 1613. The college then leased it to a number of local families over the coming years. By this time Oxford Castle was in a weakened state, with a large crack running down the side of the keep. A map of the castle prepared for Christ Church College in 1615 shows the keep on its mound, St. George's Tower with associated buildings and sections of the curtain wall remaining to the north and south, and the next tower to the south, plus a single remaining tower to the north-east, as well as the Castle Mill and a southern entrance to the castle complex; according to this map, by 1615 houses and their gardens had been built up to over half of the Castle Ditch or moat, which appears to still contain water.\nIn 1642 the English Civil War broke out and the Royalists made Oxford their capital. Parliamentary forces successfully besieged Oxford in 1646 and the city was occupied by Colonel Ingoldsby. Ingoldsby improved the fortification of the castle rather than the surrounding town, and in 1649 demolished most of the medieval stonework, replacing it with more modern earth bulwarks and reinforcing the keep with earth works to form a probable gun-platform. In 1652, in the third English Civil War, the Parliamentary garrison responded to the proximity of Charles II's forces by pulling down these defences as well and retreating to New College instead, causing great damage to the college in the process. In the event, Oxford saw no fresh fighting; early in the 18th century, however, the keep was demolished and the top of the motte landscaped to its current form.\n\n\n=== Role as prison ===\n\nAfter the Civil War, Oxford Castle served primarily as the local prison. As with other prisons at the time, the owners, in this case Christ Church College, leased the castle to wardens who would profit by charging prisoners for their board and lodging. The prison also had a gallows to execute prisoners, such as Mary Blandy in 1752. For most of the 18th century, the castle prison was run by the local Etty and Wisdom families and was in increasing disrepair. A view of the castle published in 1769 in the work \"England Displayed\" by P. Russell and Owen Price is of interest in that it shows the appearance of the chapel attached to St George's tower prior to its demolition in 1794, as well as the motte and some then-surviving portions of the curtain wall including an arch or gateway in the wall immediately to the north of the tower. The chapel and/or associated buildings are also shown, from a range of angles, in views by other artists including Samuel and Nathaniel Buck's Antiquities (drawing dated 1729), a 1773 engraving included in Francis Grose's Antiquities of England and Wales, 1786, a painting by Michael Angelo Rooker dating from 1779, and a view by the artist John Baptist Malchair dating from 1784. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard visited the castle several times, and criticised its size and quality, including the extent to which vermin infested the prison. Partly as a result of this criticism, it was decided by the County authorities to rebuild the Oxford Prison.In 1785 the castle was bought by the Oxford County Justices and rebuilding began under the London architect William Blackburn. The wider castle site had already begun to change by the late 18th century, with New Road being built through the bailey and the last parts of the castle moat being filled in to allow the building of the new Oxford Canal terminus. Building the new prison included demolishing the old chapel attached to St George's tower and repositioning part of the crypt in 1794. The work was completed under Daniel Harris in 1805. Harris gained a reasonable salary as the new governor and used convict labour from the prison to conduct early archaeological excavations at the castle with the help of the antiquarian Edward King.In the 19th century the site continued to be developed, with various new buildings built including the new County Hall in 1840\u201341 and the Oxfordshire Militia Armoury in 1854. The prison itself was extended in 1876, growing to occupy most of the remaining space. The inmates included children, the youngest being a seven-year-old girl sentenced to seven days hard labour in 1870 for stealing a pram.  In 1888 national prison reforms led to the renaming of the county prison as HM Prison Oxford.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nToday, the remains of the Saxon St.George's Tower, Motte-and-Bailey Mound, the Prison D-Wing and Debtor's Tower make up the Oxford Castle & Prison tourist attraction. \nThe prison was closed in 1996 and the site reverted to Oxfordshire County Council. The Oxford Prison buildings have since been redeveloped as a restaurant and heritage complex, with guided tours of the historic buildings and open courtyards for markets and theatrical performances. The complex includes a hotel in the Malmaison chain, Malmaison Oxford, occupying a large part of the former prison blocks, with cells converted as guest rooms. However, those parts of the prison associated with corporal or capital punishment have been converted to offices rather than being used for guests. The mixed-use heritage project, officially opened on 5 May 2006, won the RICS Project of the Year Award 2007.The full extent of the original castle is somewhat obliterated today, especially with the intrusion of the newer County Hall into the eastern side, while New Road runs over the location of north-east portion of the curtain wall with its two square towers; nevertheless the position of its outer perimeter moat is approximated by portions of New Road, Castle Street and Paradise Street (refer map at right), while the remains of the original Barbican lie underneath the modern Westgate shopping centre. Since 1954 the two oldest parts of the castle have been Grade I listed buildings: the 11th-century motte with its 13th-century well-chamber, the circa 11th-century St George's tower (listed as Norman, but now generally believed to be Saxon), the relocated crypt chapel, and the 18th-century D-wing and Debtors' Tower. The site is protected as a Scheduled Monument. As at 2018, guided tours of the surviving medieval and 18th century portions are available to visitors via a commercial operator, Heritage Projects (Oxford Castle) Ltd, with opening hours and pricing available via their website.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCastles in Great Britain and Ireland\nList of castles in England\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nAmt, Emilie.

          "Mixed feelings about this visit.  I absolutely love castles.  Part of the thrill is being able to explore and imagine.  The guided tour only option was a negative.  Our tour guide, bless him, did a good job but his accent was so thick that I felt like I spent an hour stuck in a \"Compare the meerkat\" commercial.",
          "Staff was quite helpful while browsing the gift shop. Tour was excellent - very engaging and informative. Definitely worth doing and hiking up the castle mound afterwards.",
          "Always a great family day out. The kids got to learn whilst participating. The adults as well. It was very informative, with lots of stories from its castle days through to its more recent gaol history.",

          "The children (5 yrs) enjoyed going up the tower but otherwise not much of interest for them so I felt \u00a38.50 was a bit much just for the tower. Spent most of the tour trying to keep them quiet so I missed most of it too which was a shame as the guide was good.",

          "A very historic visit.",
          "Really interesting. It's such a shame that, way back when, they decided to demolish the majority of the castle, for political reasons, but what's left is still a great experience. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the castle/prison, but also about English history",
          "A fascinating place to visit and a great guided from Agneta.",
          "This is a must go destination and should make a day out of it if youre coming from London. Going into the castle is fantastic as you get to see how they lived and learn a bit of history at the same time. We got the opportunity to see the guards changing as well.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Oxford University Museum of Natural History, sometimes known simply as the Oxford University Museum or OUMNH, is a museum displaying many of the University of Oxford's natural history specimens, located on Parks Road in Oxford, England. It also contains a lecture theatre which is used by the university's chemistry, zoology and mathematics departments. The museum provides the only public access into the adjoining Pitt Rivers Museum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe university's Honour School of Natural Science started in 1850, but the facilities for teaching were scattered around the city of Oxford in the various colleges. The university's collection of anatomical and natural history specimens were similarly spread around the city. Regius Professor of Medicine, Sir Henry Acland, initiated the construction of the museum between 1855 and 1860, to bring together all the aspects of science around a central display area. In 1858, Acland gave a lecture on the museum, setting forth the reason for the building's construction. He viewed that the university had been one-sided in the forms of study it offered\u2014chiefly theology, philosophy, the classics and history\u2014and that the opportunity should be offered to learn of the natural world and obtain the \"knowledge of the great material design of which the Supreme Master-Worker has made us a constituent part\". This idea, of Nature as the Second Book of God, was common in the 19th century.The largest portion of the museum's collections consist of the natural history specimens from the Ashmolean Museum, including the specimens collected by John Tradescant the elder and his son of the same name, William Burchell and geologist William Buckland. The Christ Church Museum donated its osteological and physiological specimens, many of which were collected by Acland. The construction of the building was accomplished through money earned from the sale of Bibles. Several departments moved within the building\u2014astronomy, geometry, experimental physics, mineralogy, chemistry, geology, zoology, anatomy, physiology and medicine. As the departments grew in size over the years, they moved to new locations along South Parks Road, which remains the home of the university's Science Area.\nThe last department to leave the building was the entomology department, which moved into the zoology building in 1978. However, there is still a working entomology laboratory on the first floor of the museum building. Between 1885 and 1886 a new building to the east of the museum was constructed to house the ethnological collections of General Augustus Pitt Rivers\u2014the Pitt Rivers Museum. In 19th-century thinking, it was very important to separate objects made by the hand of God (natural history) from objects made by the hand of man (anthropology).\n\n\n== The building ==\n\nThe neo-Gothic building was designed by the Irish architects Thomas Newenham Deane and Benjamin Woodward, mostly Woodward. The museum's design was directly influenced by the writings of critic John Ruskin, who involved himself by making various suggestions to Woodward during construction. Construction began in 1855, and the building was ready for occupancy in 1860. The adjoining building that houses the Pitt Rivers Museum was the work of Thomas Manly Deane, son of Thomas Newenham Deane. It was built between 1885 and 1886.\nThe museum consists of a large square court with a glass roof, supported by cast iron pillars, which divide the court into three aisles. Cloistered arcades run around the ground and first floor of the building, with stone columns each made from a different British stone, selected by geologist John Phillips (the Keeper of the Museum). The ornamentation of the stonework and iron pillars incorporates natural forms such as leaves and branches, combining the Pre-Raphaelite style with the scientific role of the building.\nStatues of eminent men of science stand around the ground floor of the court\u2014from Aristotle and Bacon through to Darwin and Linnaeus. Although the university paid for the construction of the building, the ornamentation was funded by public subscription, and much of it remains incomplete. The Irish stone carvers O'Shea and Whelan had been employed to create lively freehand carvings in the Gothic manner. When funding dried up, they offered to work unpaid, but they were accused by members of the University Convocation of \"defacing\" the building by adding unauthorised work. According to Acland, the O'Shea brothers responded by caricaturing the members of Convocation as parrots and owls in the carving over the building's entrance. Acland insists that he forced them to remove the heads from these carvings.\n\n\n== Significant events ==\n\n\n=== The 1860 evolution debate ===\n\nA significant debate in the history of evolutionary biology took place in the museum in 1860 at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Representatives of the Church and science debated the subject of evolution, and the event is often viewed as symbolising the defeat of a literalist interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative. However, there are few eye-witness accounts of the debate, and most accounts of the debate were written by scientists.\n\nThe biologist Thomas Huxley and Samuel Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford, are generally cast as the main protagonists in the debate. Huxley was a keen scientist and a staunch supporter of Darwin's theories. Wilberforce had supported the construction of the museum as the centre for the science departments, for the study of the wonders of God's creations.\nOn the Wednesday of the meeting, 27 June 1860, botanist Charles Daubeny presented a paper on plant sexuality, which made reference to Darwin's theory of natural selection. Richard Owen, a zoologist who believed that evolution was governed by divine influence, criticised the theory pointing out that the brain of the gorilla was more different from that of man than that of other primates. Huxley stated that he would respond to this comment in print, and declined to continue the debate. However, rumours began to spread that the Bishop of Oxford would be attending the conference on the following Saturday.\nInitially, Huxley was planning to avoid the bishop's speech. However, evolutionist Robert Chambers convinced him to stay.\nWilberforce's speech on 30 June 1860 was good-humoured and witty, but was an unfair attack on Darwinism, ending in the now infamous question to Huxley of whether \"it was through his grandfather or grandmother that he claimed descent from a monkey.\" Some commentators suggested that this question was written by Owen, and others suggested that the bishop was taught by Owen. (Owen and Wilberforce had known each other since childhood.)\nWilberforce is purported to have turned to his neighbour, chemist Professor Brodie and exclaiming, \"The Lord has delivered him into mine hands.\" When Huxley spoke, he responded that he had heard nothing from Wilberforce to prejudice Darwin's arguments, which still provided the best explanation of the origin of species yet advanced. He ended with the equally famous response to Wilberforce's question, that he had \"no need to be ashamed of having an ape for his grandfather, but that he would be ashamed of having for an ancestor a man of restless and versatile interest who distracts the attention of his hearers from the real point at issue by eloquent digression and skilled appeals to religious prejudice.\"\nHowever it seems unlikely that the debate was as spectacular as traditionally suggested \u2013 contemporary accounts by journalists do not make mention of the words that have become such notable quotations. Additionally, contemporary accounts suggest that it was not Huxley, but Sir Joseph Hooker who most vocally defended Darwinism at the meeting.\nWhile all the accounts of the event suggest that the supporters of Darwinism were the most persuasive, it seems likely that the exact nature of the debate was made more sensational in the reports of Huxley's supporters to encourage further support for Darwin's theories.\n\n\n=== The 1894 demonstration of wireless telegraphy ===\nThe first public demonstration of wireless telegraphy took place in the lecture theatre of the museum on 14 August 1894, carried out by Professor Oliver Lodge. A radio signal was sent from the neighbouring Clarendon Laboratory building, and received by apparatus in the lecture theatre.\n\n\n=== Charles Dodgson and the dodo ===\nToday the head and foot of a dodo displayed at the museum are the most complete remains of a single dodo anywhere in the world. Many museums have complete dodo skeletons, but these are composed of the bones of several individuals. The museum also displays a 1651 painting of a dodo by Flemish artist, Jan Savery.\nCharles Dodgson, better known by his pen-name Lewis Carroll, was a regular visitor to the museum, and Savery's painting is likely to have influenced the character of the Dodo in Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\n\n\n== The museum today ==\n\nThe museum collections are divided into three sections: Earth Collections covering the Palaeontological collections and the mineral and rock collections, Life Collections which include zoological and entomological collections, and the Archive Collections. The museum is led by a Director (currently Professor Paul Smith, formerly Head of the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Birmingham), who succeeded Professor Jim Kennedy in 2011, and there are front of house, education, outreach, IT, library, conservation and technical staff.\nSince 1997 the museum has benefited from external funding, from government and private sources, and undertaken a renewal of its displays. As well as central exhibits featuring the dodo and dinosaurs, there are sets of displays with contemporary designs but within restored Victorian cabinets, on a variety of themes: Evolution, Primates, the History of Life, Vertebrates, Invertebrates and Rocks and Minerals. There are also a number of popular touchable items, which include two bears, a fox and other taxidermy. Additionally there is a meteorite and large fossils and minerals. Visitors can also see large dinosaur reconstructions and a parade of mammal skeletons.\n\nA famous group of ichnites was found in a limestone quarry at Ardley, 20 km northeast of Oxford, in 1997. They were thought to have been made by Megalosaurus and possibly Cetiosaurus. There are replicas of some of these footprints, set across the front lawn of the museum.\nThe Hope Entomological Collections, numbering over 5 million specimens are held by the museum. The Hope Department was founded by Frederick William Hope and the first appointed curator of the collections was John Obadiah Westwood. Many important insect and arachnid specimens from various collectors and collections make up the museums holdings including (but not limited to) those of Octavius Pickard-Cambridge, George Henry Verrall, Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Marie Auguste Dejean,  Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latreille, Alfred Russel Wallace, Charles Darwin, Jacques Marie Frangile Bigot, and Pierre Justin Marie Macquart among others.\nThe roof of the museum is a popular nesting area for migrating swallows. Cameras have been installed which broadcast a live stream to a display near the main enterance. \nOn March 17, 2020, the museum shut indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Keepers, secretaries and directors ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Abbot's Kitchen, an early chemistry laboratory next to the museum, built at the same time.\nRadcliffe Science Library, the science library of Oxford University, close to the museum.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOxford University Museum website\nRegulations for the Oxford University Museum of Natural History\nVirtual Tour of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History\nHistory of the Insect collections\nOxford University Estates Services Conservation Management Plan for the University Museum (38mbs)\nVirtual Tour of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History 2014",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Port Meadow is a large meadow of open common land beside the River Thames to the north and west of Oxford, England.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe meadow is an ancient area of grazing land, still used for horses and cattle, and according to legend has never been ploughed, at least for around 4,000 years. It is said that in return for helping to defend the kingdom against the marauding Danes, the Freemen of Oxford were given the 300 acres (120 ha) of pasture next to the River Thames by Alfred the Great who, legend has it, founded the city in the 10th century (although Alfred actually died in the 9th century). The Freemen's collective right to graze their animals free of charge is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 and has been exercised ever since.\nThe meadow runs from Jericho to Wolvercote (where north of the Shiplake Ditch it becomes Wolvercote Common) along the east (left) bank of the River Thames, with the Cotswold Line railway, the Oxford Canal and the suburb of North Oxford further to the east, and the village of Binsey to the west. Access to Port Meadow is via Walton Well Road or Aristotle Lane in the south (or from the south via Roger Dudman Way or the Thames Path) or from Godstow Road, Wolvercote via Wolvercote Common in the north. It is a typical English flood-meadow and is a favourite area for walking, with easy access from the city of Oxford. It is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest. At the southern end of the meadow is Fiddler's Island in the River Thames. In the winter the meadow sometimes floods; if frozen it forms a huge and relatively safe area for skating. In late spring vast areas are carpeted with buttercups. Horses, cattle and geese graze the meadow and many birds can often be seen.\nAt the eastern edge of Port Meadow, just north of the entrance from Aristotle Lane, is Burgess Field, a reclaimed landfill site and home to a nature reserve, managed by Oxford City Council. It covers an area of about 8.5 hectares (21 acres) and a circular path around the edge of the reserve takes you through some small copses.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe River Thames (known as the Isis in this area) flows past this large grazing meadow. This is where the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) and the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed up the river on 4 July 1862 with three young girls \u2014 Lorina, Alice, and Edith Liddell. While journeying slowly from Folly Bridge to near Godstow, Dodgson began at their request to make up a story that later was expanded into Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\nBecause the meadow appears never to have been ploughed, it contains well-preserved archaeological remains, some of which survive as residual earthworks. Of particular note are several Bronze Age round barrows, an area of Iron Age settlement, and the foundations of 17th-century fortifications from the Parliamentary siege of Oxford during the English Civil War.\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the meadow was used for horse racing, and low stone bridges laid over washes and ditches for this purpose still survive.During the First World War part of Port Meadow was used to train the Royal Flying Corps and turned into a military aerodrome. Fifteen air crew and pilots were killed flying from Port Meadow or close by. In 1940, during the Second World War, a camp was set up on the meadow for military personnel evacuated from Dunkirk.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the meadow was known as a location for free festivals and raves.Just across the Thames is Bossoms Boatyard, with a small marina and Medley Footbridge across the Thames. The Medley Sailing Club, the furthest upstream sailing club on the River Thames, is on the western bank. To the south is the start of the Castle Mill Stream and Cripley Meadow, largely consisting of allotments.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nFrom 2012, the Oxford University Estates Directorate, with the help of Longcross, have been developing the one-hectare Castle Mill site (400 m \u00d7 25 m) between the Cripley Meadow Allotments and the railway tracks, close to the southern end of Port Meadow, as extensive student accommodation.\nThe development was controversial, since the four to five storey blocks overlook Port Meadow. Campaigners warned of damage to views of Oxford. There has been an online petition and a \"Save Port Meadow\" campaign was established in December 2012. Concerns were raised by the Oxford Preservation Trust and the Green Party. Anger was caused even among members of Oxford University. The development was likened to building a \"skyscraper beside Stonehenge\". In February 2013, Oxford City Council entered negotiations with Oxford University to reduce the height of the buildings by two storeys. On 7 May 2013, the Campaign to Protect Rural England applied to the High Court for judicial review of the decision to grant planning permission on the grounds that requirements for a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) were not met.\nIn 2016, Oxford University proposed an array of mitigating techniques, including cladding and horizontal beams to \"break up the vertical fa\u00e7ade\". Later, changes were made to the buildings in an attempt to reduce their visual impact.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPort Meadow Halt, a former railway station on the Varsity Line\nBurgess Field Nature Park, to the east\nCripley Meadow, to the south\nTrap Ground Allotments, to the east\nWolvercote Common, to the north\nBinsey Poplars, an 1879 poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844\u20131889), written after the felling of a row of poplar trees on the River Thames overlooking Port Meadow\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Port Meadow, Oxford at Wikimedia Commons",

          "We go here quite regularly, not so much in the winter but the rest of the year is wonderful. We have a golden retriever who loves paddling and swimming in the water. Its nice to be able to cross the river and make a circular walk rather than turning round to go back.",
          "Thankfully this area is never likely to be developed. It has few man-made atrractions, because it is an attraction in itself. I have been there in all the different seasons, the last time being this winter. You have to avoid it on the occasions that the Thames floods, but apart",
          "Port Meadow offers a bit of serenity in the middle of a city covered in stone. The pathway offers the ideal location for a peaceful stroll to sort through thoughts, or to catch up with an old friend. Tucked behind the trees there is a pub called the Perch. If I could, I would",
          "It may seem strange to think that Oxford, a relaxed, culturally vibrant city would need somewhere apart from it all but especially during the holidays Oxford can be rammed full of shoppers and tourists and for residents and longer-term visitors alike it is nice to have somewhere",

          "As a major tourist destination in England Oxford never fails to deliver, but too many people see just colleges and architecture and miss some of the wonderful open spaces that Oxford has to offer, and this is one of them and possibly the best. It is great for walking, running",

          "If you want to go for some really long & really wonderful walks, Port Meadow is for you. On one occasion we began on the canal path at Magdalen Bridge & walked all the way to The Perch, a very fine old pub. On another, we walked across a different section. It's the only portion",
          "Port Meadow is an open space within sight of Oxford City centre, & is the sort of expanse that makes property developers slaver at their chops. However, Port Meadow's purpose is to act as a flood plain for the Thames, which, after recent heavy rain, it is doing admirably. We can",
          "Apparently Port Meadow is unique as it has been untouched since medieval times. However, to the eye it just looks like another lump of flat, rather dull grassland which floods periodically. If you've never seen a large field before, this will be remarkable. Otherwise it's",

          "Perhaps because of the large lake from the Thames overspill, I loved this walk. The flood water made it impossible to go up to the nunnery, so we had to turn back along the towpath. Round off your walk at The Perch pub for mulled cider on the way back - there's a huge garden and",
          "If I have two hours to waste and the sun is out, I'll walk the circuit of Port Meadow (up the river and back down the meadow or, if flooded, the canal). It's not an exceptionally pretty bit of countryside, but a relaxing break from the city without having to actually leave the",

          "Port meadow is older than the University. Towns people have been grazing livestock in the meadow for 2000 years, there are signs of settlement there that date back at least that far. The Thames borders the entire Meadow which is huge and geese, ducks and other water fowl nest",
          "I went on a cycle ride with a few others and started at a pub in Wolvercote and cycled down the canal to Oxford and then back via Port Meadow following the river. It was such a nice bike ride and I felt as though I was in the middle of no where cycling through the meadow except",

          "Lovely afternoon cycling through the meadow with my husband and 2 year old. Beautiful pastures of cows and horses, and a stop at The Perch for a pint makes it even better. We followed the trail from Jericho to Wolvercote, where we stopped for another pint at The Trout. Great",

          "This is a haven to get away from the tourists and the crowds. Here you will find a place to escape from the busy-ness. There are normally cows or horses that are strolling through the meadow and it's quite relaxing to go for a walk or run through the meadow. You will also find",

        "wiki": "The University of Oxford Botanic Garden is the oldest botanic garden in Great Britain and one of the oldest scientific gardens in the world. The garden was founded in 1621 as a physic garden growing plants for medicinal research. Today it contains over 5,000 different plant species on 1.8 ha (4 1\u20442 acres). It is one of the most diverse yet compact collections of plants in the world and includes representatives from over 90% of the higher plant families.\nSimon Hiscock became Horti Praefectus in 2015. His predecessor, Timothy Walker, served from 1988 to 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nIn 1621, Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby, contributed \u00a35,000 (in excess of \u00a35,000,000 in 2018) to set up a physic garden for \"the glorification of the works of God and for the furtherance of learning\". He chose a site on the banks of the River Cherwell at the northeast corner of Christ Church Meadow, belonging to Magdalen College. Part of the land had been a Jewish cemetery until the Jews were expelled from Oxford (and the rest of England) in 1290. Four thousand cartloads of \"mucke and dunge\" were needed to raise the land above the flood-plain of the River Cherwell.\n\n\n=== Catalogue ===\nHumphry Sibthorp began the catalogue of the plants of the garden, Catalogus Plantarum Horti Botanici Oxoniensis. His youngest son was the well-known botanist John Sibthorp (1758\u20131796), who continued the Catalogus Plantarum.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nThe Garden comprises three sections:\n\nthe Walled Garden, surrounded by the original seventeenth-century stonework and home to the Garden's oldest tree; an English yew, Taxus baccata\nthe Glasshouses, which allow the cultivation of plants needing protection from the extremes of British weather\nthe Lower garden\nthe area between the Walled Garden and the River CherwellA satellite site, the Harcourt Arboretum, is located six miles (9.7 km) south of Oxford.\n\n\n== The Danby Gateway ==\n\nThe Danby gateway to the Botanic Garden is one of three entrances designed by Nicholas Stone between 1632 and 1633. It is one of the earliest structures in Oxford to use classical, indeed early Baroque, style, preceding his new entrance porch for the University Church of St Mary the Virgin of 1637, and contemporary with Canterbury Quad at St John's College by others. In this highly ornate arch, Stone ignored the new simple classical Palladian style currently fashionable, which had just been introduced to England from Italy by Inigo Jones, and drew his inspiration from an illustration in Serlio's book of archways.The gateway consists of three bays, each with a pediment. The largest and central bay, containing the segmented arch is recessed, causing its larger pediment to be partially hidden by the flanking smaller pediments of the projecting lateral bays.\nThe stone work is heavily decorated being bands of alternating vermiculated rustication and plain dressed stone. The pediments of the lateral bays are seemingly supported by circular columns which frame niches containing statues of Charles I and Charles II in classical pose. The tympanum of the central pediment contains a segmented niche containing a bust of the Earl of Danby. It is a Grade I listed structure (ref. 1485/423).\n\n\n== Walled garden ==\n\nBotanical Family bedsThe core collection of hardy plants are grouped in long, narrow, oblong beds by botanical family and ordered according to the classification system devised by nineteenth century botanists, Bentham and Hooker. The families represented in the Walled Garden include: Acanthaceae, Amaranthaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Apocynaceae, Araceae, Aristolochiaceae, Berberidaceae, Boraginaceae, Campanulaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Cistaceae, Commelinaceae, Compositae, Convolvulaceae, Crassulaceae, Cruciferae, Cyperaceae, Dioscoreaceae, Dipsacaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Gentianaceae, Geraniaceae, Gramineae, Hypericaceae, Iridaceae, Juncaceae, Labiatae, Leguminosae, Liliaceae, Linaceae, Loasaceae, Lythraceae, Malvaceae, Onagraceae, Paeoniaceae, Papaveraceae, Phytolaccaceae, Plantaginaceae, Plumbaginaceae, Polemoniaceae, Polygonaceae, Portulacaceae, Primulaceae, Ranunculaceae, Rosaceae, Rubiaceae, Rutaceae, Saxifragaceae, Solanaceae, Umbelliferae, Urticaceae, Verbenaceae, Violaceae.\nIn 1983, The National Council for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens (NCCPG) chose Oxford Botanic Garden to cultivate the national collection of euphorbia. One of the rarest plants in the collection is Euphorbia stygiana, with only ten plants left existing in the wild. The Garden is propagating the species as quickly as possible to reduce the possibility of it becoming extinct.\n\nMedicinal bedsThe South West corner of the Botanic Garden is home to a modern medicinal plant collection. Here you will find 8 beds, each growing plants with a connection to medicine used to treat a particular type of disease or illness. There are beds for\n\nCardiology (heart complaints)\nOncology (cancer and cell-proliferation)\nInfectious Diseases (viral and parasitic)\nGastreoenterology (alimentary tract and metabolism)\nDermatology (skin complaints)\nHaematology (blood typing and disorders)\nNeurology (nervous system and anaesthesia)\nPulmonology (lungs and airways)The plants growing in these beds contain many different natural products and fall into at least one of the following three categories:\n\nDirectly suitable for use as a drug\nSynthetic modification provides a clinically suitable drug\nStarting point for a drug discovery programme\nBearded irisesOne bed in the northwest corner of the garden contains a display of bearded irises each May. Examples include Iris 'Eileen' and Iris 'Golden Encore'. Some of the varieties grown in the Garden are not grown anywhere else.\n\nWall bordersThe borders along the foot of the wall contain collections that thrive in the microclimate, many of these plant collections are grouped by their geographical origin. The Mediterranean collection at the north border includes Euphorbia myrsinites. The South American collection at the north border includes Acca sellowiana. The South African collection at the northeast border includes Kniphofia caulescens.\nOther wall borders contain plants from Biodiversity hotspots including Japan and New Zealand. Such areas hold high numbers of Endemic plant species, yet face substantial threat to their natural vegetation. Over 50% of the world's plant species are contained within these hotspots which collectively cover only 2.3% of the Earth's land surface.\n\n\n== Glasshouses ==\nConservatoryThe house is an aluminium replica of the original 1893 wooden house and grows seasonal flowers such as primulas, abutilons, fuchsias, and achimenes. Various exhibitions which change throughout the year are displayed in the centre area.\n\nAlpine HousePlants which cannot grow to their full potential outside are displayed in this house. The displays are changed regularly so that there is always something in flower.\n\nFerneryA collection of ferns from around the world are housed here including Platycerium bifurcatum (stag's horn fern), Lygodium japonicum (a climbing fern), and Trichomanes speciosum (a filmy fern native to western Britain).\n\nTropical Lily HouseThe tank in the lily house built in 1851 by Professor Charles Daubeny, Keeper of the Garden at the time, is the oldest existing part of the glasshouses. Tropical water lilies grow in boxes in the tank, including the hybrid Nymphaea \u00d7 daubenyana named in honour of Professor Daubeny in 1874. Also growing in the house are economic plants including bananas, sugar cane, and rice, and the papyrus reed, Cyperus papyrus, a native of river banks in the Middle East. Flowering high in the glasshouse is the yellow-flowered Allamanda cathartica.\n\nInsectivorous HouseThis house grows a collection of Carnivorous plants. Carnivory has evolved several times in plants and this collection displays many of the mechanisms required to trap insect prey. Some traps are passive, such as the sticky flypaper of the genus Pinguicula whereas others like the Venus flytrap, Dionaea muscipula, actually move and are triggered by the unlucky insect walking across the surface.\n\nPalm HouseThe largest glasshouse in the Garden, this house grows palms and a large number of economic plants including citrus fruits, pepper, sweet potato, pawpaw, olive, coffee, ginger, coconut, cocoa, cotton, and oil palm. There is a collection of cycads which look like palms but are unrelated. Several important teaching collections present include the Acanthaceae including the shrimp plant Justicia brandegeana, the Gesneriaceae, and a large number of Begonia species.\n\nArid HousePlants in this house come from arid areas of the world and demonstrate ways in which plant forms economise the use of water. Many different species of Cacti and Succulent plants are found here demonstrating all of their various tactics to reduce water loss to their hostile environments.\n\n\n== Outside the walled garden ==\nRock Garden\nBog Garden\nHerbaceous BorderFirst laid out in 1946, this planting is a classic example of the traditional English herbaceous border. Unlike other areas of the Garden, this border relies entirely on herbaceous perennials. These die back to a rootstock each winter before bursting back into life again in spring and flowering through the summer. The planting is designed to provide interest from April to October. The display begins with tulips in a range of colours, followed by early, mid-season and late flowering perennials. The plants are arranged in layers, with the smaller plants positioned at the front of the border and the taller plants toward the back. Occasionally we allow a few of the larger plants to make their way to the front to break up the formality.\n\nAutumn Border\nGlasshouse Borders\nMerton BordersDesigned in collaboration with Professor James Hitchmough from the Department of Landscape Architecture at the University of Sheffield\nAt 955m2 these borders form the largest single cultivated area in the Botanic Garden. They are an example of sustainable horticultural development, with minimal impact on the environment in the long term.\nThe plants have been selected for their ability to withstand drought conditions and originate from seasonally dry grassland communities in three regions of the world:\n\nThe Central to Southern Great Plains (USA) through to the Colorado Plateau and into California\nEast South Africa at latitudes above 1000m\nSouthern Europe to Turkey and across Asia to Siberia\n\n\n== In literature ==\nThe Garden was the site of frequent visits in the 1860s by Oxford mathematics professor Lewis Carroll and the Liddell children, Alice and her sisters. Like many of the places and people of Oxford, it was a source of inspiration for Carroll's stories in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The Garden's waterlily house can be seen in the background of Sir John Tenniel's illustration of \"The Queen's Croquet-Ground\".\nAnother Oxford professor and author, J. R. R. Tolkien, often spent his time at the garden reposing under his favourite tree, Pinus nigra. The enormous Austrian pine was much like the Ents of his The Lord of the Rings story, the walking, talking tree-people of Middle-earth. However, the tree was removed in 2014 after two limbs fell, posing a security risk for the visitors.\nIn the Evelyn Waugh novel Brideshead Revisited, Lord Sebastian Flyte takes Charles Ryder \"to see the ivy\" soon after they first meet. As he says, \"Oh, Charles, what a lot you have to learn! There's a beautiful arch there and more different kinds of ivy than I knew existed. I don't know where I should be without the Botanical gardens\" (Chapter One).\nIn Philip Pullman's trilogy of novels His Dark Materials, a bench in the back of the garden is one of the locations/objects that stand parallel in the two different worlds that the protagonists, Lyra Belacqua and Will Parry, inhabit. In the last chapter of the trilogy, both promised to sit on the bench for an hour at noon on Midsummer's day every year so that perhaps they may feel each other's presence next to one another in their own worlds. Now a place of pilgrimage for Pullman's fans, the bench is recognizable due to graffiti such as \"Lyra + Will\" or \"L + W\" left by its visitors and, since 2019, the sculpture by Julian Warren installed behind it.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDepartment of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford\nCambridge University Botanic Garden\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nColvin, Howard, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600\u20131840 3rd ed.

          "I can see this would be great in summer but at this time of year there is little to see in the gardens except labels of plants that will appear at a later time. Being Xmas time there was a Xmas fair on the site and places for food but in all it did lack any spark. One exception",
          "Lovely garden one can learn a lot from plants here an absolutley amazing day out, you can find some very exclusive trees and plants that you don't get to see every day in the glass houses one of them being a cactus-tree, seek and you shall find 'lol' check it out",

          "I was a bit dubious when it was suggested we go here, but I'm so glad we did. The planting is beautiful and so varied. A lovely atmosphere. We had to rush around in an hour, but you could easily spend double the time there. Apart from the grounds, the greenhouses are interesting",
          "It is a lovely garden with many species of plants. Of particular interest is the medicinal area where they have plants and show their uses as medicine. I was disappointed in the roses. It appears no one properly tends to them. It's also a little pricey for a walk through",
          "One of the cutest historical botanical gardens I've ever seen. Situated a bit outside the centre, well organised, with lovely glass houses for bad weather. Just a lovely day out.",
          "Took our daughter and her college friends here to explore the gardens. Many lovely places to take photos among the flowering plants and trees!! For a small fee you can enjoy the gardens, and sit along the punting river and drink a cup of tea. Definitely a nice place for",
          "We went to the Oxford botanical garden on nice July Sunday. A lot of different plants and flowers all over the place. Great inspiration for my own garden. Also great place to sit and have a tea.",
          "While it\u2019s smaller than the Edinburgh research garden (and my home-town Montreal Botanical garden with monster-sized cottonwood trees), it\u2019s worth a visit. The greenhouses are botanically intimate! I enjoyed the indoor tropical lily pad display. The different greenhouses are",
          "These gardens are an absolute delight. The greenhouse plants are a marvel especially the pitcher plants and giant lilies. Outside the walled garden the Merton borders are an example of sustainable horticultural development and are a complete joy. It\u2019s difficult to say how",
          "Lovely gardens are associated with the Brittish culture and this was a great example of the beauty and charm available.",
          "This is definitely a place worth visiting, if you have any interest in plants at all. Well set out with places to picnic on the grass. A few more benches scattered about would be nice for the older visitors. Will definitely be back to see how the seasons change it \ud83d\ude0a",
          "I liked especially the rose garden, which was near the road. I\u2019m not sure if it was a part of the botanic garden at all but I like it anyway",
          "We were on a day trip to Oxford and the botanic garden was first on the list, we expected it to be a short visit, how wrong we were. The gardens are beautiful and very interesting. The beds are laid out with plants of the same family unlike other gardens that go more for show,",
          "The tropical greenhouse was the place to be on a nice Feb afternoon. Warm, sticky. I never knew what half of these plants looked like in the flesh - vanilla, cacao etc. An education. Really like this place.",
          "A bit of an in between time for colour in the garden. Some things were over in the perennial boarders. It would have probably been better a few weeks earlier or later. Some nice walks and very near the river. No cafe and coffee van not open",
          "We visited in early June and there was a variety of flowers in bloom (though I suspect Spring would be the best time to visit). While not very big, the gardens were peaceful and uncrowded. There are information signs to accompany most of the plants, which made the experience",
          "This the oldest botanic garden in England with 1000\u2019s of plants grouped by family in numerous planting beds on the 4+ acre site. We visited the garden in late May, a beautiful time to visit and throughly enjoyed strolling among the the numerous well labeled plantings, small",
          "This was a pleasant way of spending an hour or two. Entry for those of us over 65 is only \u00a34 and is good value for that. The grounds are larger than you might expect and go down to the river and are a pleasant stroll. Plants are grouped by botanical family which is confusing for",
          "We visited on a cool day in April but there was still plenty to see. Lots of benches to sit on and admire everything. Plenty of spring plants and flowers to look at, also some vegetables to admire. A peaceful oasis away from the bustle of Oxford.",
          "Visited 09/06. For a charge of \u00a35.50, it\u2019s well worth going. The ferns house is lovely, so many to look at and all the wild flowers were in bloom too. Shame it was too early for the agapanthus.. I like all kinds of flowers, shrubs and especially grasses so this garden is perfect",
          "It was very nice to explore the gardens and definitely worth it considering the ticket price. The greenhouses have some interesting plants and the gardens in general are relaxing to walk around next to the river Cherwell.",
          "If you are expecting something like a Chelsea Show garden you might be disappointed. Beds are arranged in plant families with little concession to design within the beds, but the beds are quite beautifully .organised for pleasant wandering around and between, with ponds,",
          "We visited University of Oxford Botanic Gardens (need to pay fee) during a weekend and walked around for couple of hours. Enjoyed the gardens and beautiful flowers as it is spring time. Happy to recommend to you if you have couple of hours and you like plants and flowers.",
          "Not large in size but fascinating with regard to the medical plant section, the hierarchy of plant species and the various glass houses. Worth every penny",
          "What an amazing place to visit. The gardens are beautiful with seating areas dotted about for you to observe the splendour. There is a small outdoor coffee van with seats overlooking the river. The coffee was one of the best i have had You can park the hustle and bustle behind",
          "My wife and I spent 75 minutes here and while we did enjoy our visit we left feeling that had we visited several weeks later there would have been so much more to see. We are not keen gardeners but our visit gave us both a better appreciation of what is possible in a limited",
          "I have been to many fine National Trust gardens but this is so much better. Firstly there are 7 huge greenhouses containing a wonderful selection of plants including carnivorous plants. The Water Lily house has some amazing lily pads. The vast gardens are laid out in beds ,",
          "Visited recently and arrived late afternoon. We were amazed how quiet the garden was away from the hustle and bustle of the High street! Although quite small there are lots of beautiful borders with approx. 6000 different plants most of which are well labelled. The gardens are",
          "One of the oldest Botanic Gardens in the UK as it shows that some of the facilities needs updating however its still well maintained and clean. Lots of flowers and plants to see as well as fruit and vegetables as well.",
          "I visited the Botanic Garden with my partner one sunny afternoon. It was a very relaxing visit around the beautiful gardens where you could take your mind off things. We really enjoyed the greenhouses more than the outside flowers. The sun definitely improved our visit to the",
          "Really enjoyed the garden- it\u2019s not a huge area, it\u2019s quality rather than quantity. It\u2019s an ideal half day activity, not an overload of information but just a nice amount. I thought admission was very good value. Lots of interesting species, sufficient information but not too",
          "Me and my husband ummed\u2019 and arrrd\u2019 about paying to go into this garden, being from north wales where we are spoilt with gardens already we thought is it worth it, but it definitely was! We went on a Sunday morning so it was nice and quiet when we first arrived, lovely canal",
          "The garden is small and you can cover the entire place within a few hours, including the greenhouses. Some interesting sites and flowers.",
          "We appreciated the peace of this place and the varied glass houses. The bird song was amazing. Sitting at the bottom of the garden we were serenaded by a blackbird very close to us, and had the pleasure of seeing assorted sparrows and tits. There are concessions for disabled",
          "We visited in April so a little out of season. We enjoyed walking around and the gardens are nicely kept. Some of the greenhouses were closed when we visited, we enjoyed the ones we saw but the plants didn't look particularly well kept in them. The labels of the plants",
          "Compact botanical gardens and very pleasant to walk around. All very small scale but very well cared for and well labelled. Small glasshouses which we really enjoyed. Tiny cafe in a van. Pleasant views of the river and punts. \u00a36 entrance fee is reasonable and good to",
          "Well worth a visit! Cared for by wonderful staff, beautiful in Spring (and probably all year round!).",
          "My boyfriend brought me here on a whim while we were in Oxford and it was my favourite site on the whole trip. The greenhouses hold incredible exotic species, with an entire section devoted to carnivorous plants; the grounds themselves are lovely and excellent to wander, have",
          "It is definitely pretty and if you are into plants then well worth it. It\u2019s also a great spot for a picnic. I\u2019m glad I went but agree with others that it was below my expectations.",
          "The gardens are quite small but very well maintained. The green houses were the best part. There are plenty of benches for a sit down. The lawns are well kept, and good for a picnic. I felt the entrance fee is a bit steep for the size.",
          "Special atmosphere, palm houses with specialty specimens, interesting beds e.g. plants involved with gin ......not for the family to run about in even though on the river bank.",
          "Tempted to see it even though there are much greenery around Oxford where you do not need to pay. The greenhouses, view of river punters, greenery is fine, but not much variety of plants really.",
          "Plenty of unrest both historically and with the plants here, lessons in cocoa and coffee production etc - not expensive and well worth the entry fee.",
          "This garden enjoys a super location just a short walk from the city centre. We visited in March so it was a bit lacking in colour and l think it'll be rather more interesting towards the end of April and thereafter as plants 'do their thing' through the season. All the botanical",
          "We took a very early spring visit to the gardens and truly enjoyed that stop. Things were well explained and greenhouses were open, so there were opportunities to get in from the chill. We were surprised at how much was blooming. Please extend your walk along the canals,",
          "I have visited a number of Botanical Gardens around the world and Oxford is a must see venue. The collection of plants and flowers is second to none and the position of the gardens close by the river is a beautiful setting. It is hard to believe, whilst walking around the",
          "The oldest botanical garden in England. There is never much to see in the outside garden in February, except for the various varieties of snowdrops, but the greenhouses were full of very interesting plants. There was the cactus house and carnivorous plants. I found the pitcher",
          "Me, I love a botanical garden. I spent many a happy Sunday afternoon in the Cambridge University botanical gardens and, though while it was many years ago, the Oxford gardens did seem much smaller. At 10.90 GBP for a pair of adults, with the cashiers\u2019 suggestion of a",
          "The cacti were cool and some of the ferns. Probably not worth the admission fee though as nearly everything else was dead or colourless. I probably wouldn't have given a poor review however they wouldn't keep my wheelie bag at the counter. I can sort of understand if there were",
          "We paid \u00a312 for both of us and had to walk it twice to make sure we hadnt missed anything, the gardens are small with very little to see. Complete waste of money and our time we did the entire complex in about 15 mins.",
          "Visited on sunny Tuesday November morning \u2013 dating from 1621 the Gardens are worth a visit despite the borders being cleared there were still autumn leaves and architectural plants to admire \u2013 the Gardens provide a pleasant spot alongside Cherwell \u2013 we will return in a different",
          "Came to the botanical gardens on a day visit & the weather was glorious Lovely peace & quiet so many plants, shrubs, trees & flowers Close to the shops & many other attractions",
          "Even this time of year, with everywhere covered with leaves, this is worth a visit. Would need a visit each season to see the changes throughout the year.",
          "Only one of the three green houses were open,there was no reduction in price. Told the visit would take 1hr. It was difficult to make it last 20 minutes.",
          "We visited the gardens after my son had his graduation ceremony. The sun was shining, we were not surprisingly in a good mood and the garden was beautiful. It's not huge and you cannot compare it to Kew or the like but it is well laid out, quiet and beautiful views of the water",
          "I visited here first in 2017 in the spring when there was so much more in flower and bloom. However on a lovely autumn morning it is still a lovely places to walk round and soak up the peace and quiet and yet still be in a very busy city centre. I just wish they had a caf\u00e9",
          "We visited in November. Not a lot of flowering plants but still beautiful set. Thames running alongside. \u00a35 .45 entry fee. Physic gardens very interesting",
          "We saw this by chance and with an interest in gardening, we paid \u00a36 each to get in.Quite disappointing visit, as most flowers were dead and much tidying was needed in most beds. Wouldn't bother paying unless it was in Spring or Summer if you visit.",
          "It was delightful to see so many plants still in full bloom at this time of year. Yes there were beds where the plants were dying off, but it is autumn. Well worth a trip even at this time of year. Lots of benches to sit and just relax and enjoy the peaceful surroundings.",
          "Lovely garden, with beautiful plants, we enjoyed on an unseasonably warm October afternoon. Great way to spend the afternoon.",
          "Many rare exotics as well as classic flowers and shrubs. Do read the words which are so informative and unusual. Make sure you see the beds devoted to modern medicines. Nature invented everything before we arrived! Awesome views of Magdalen College tower throughout and glimpses",
          "Wonderful formal gardens right in Oxford City Centre. All manner of English and international plants with fantastic very old trees and shrubs. Also wonderful hot houses containing unusual and exotic hot climate trees and plants. A truly magic experience.",
          "It's good , worth a visit but on the day several greenhouse closed for maintenance , very disappointing , no previous notice on website Not as good as Cambridge , sorry but it's true",
          "Was so looking forward to seeing the gardens but sadly they were really disappointing.. The beds were unkept and variety minimal.",
          "The botanic garden isn't huge but it is a jewel and well worth visiting. The greenhouses are dripping with fascinating plants, the Lilly house is beautiful inside, the 400 year old yew tree is spectacular and there are many fascinating things to see.",
          "The gardens and glass houses were stunning particularly the borders and the water lilies, if you are in Oxford this is a must.",
          "Even after the weather we have had this year and the challenges this has brought the Autumn border was looking wonderful. It was great value for and an escape from the hustle and bustle of Oxford at the start of a new year for students.",
          "We have been meaning to come here for a long time so decided to on a sunny afternoon. We wanted to see most of all the palm houses but these were closed, such a shame. Otherwise a nice Sunday stroll in pleasant surroundings.",
          "A place a of solitude i the middle of a busy town , amazing plants and all with a history of there own .trees and greenhouses to explore or sit and meditate by the river or rockery pool . An amazing place to visit throuvht the year and see the changing plants .",
          "Finally made it here. Absolutely loved it. An oasis in the middle of the city. Friendly gardeners and stunning colours in the borders. If I lived in the city, I'd be here every day.",
          "The garden is not at its peak but there is still plenty of interest especially late colour in the herbaceous borders as well as fruit and vegetables. Part of the glasshouse is closed due to its annual pruning.",
          "The staff are brilliant, so helpful, so knowledgeable. They made my choice of The Conservatory for an early evening drinks reception, a great idea! Everyone loved the venue, and the gardens looked beautiful. I've been a regular visitor to the Botanic Garden for the last 20 odd",
          "I was there on a Sunday in September, the weather was perfect, sunny with a gentle breeze. The gardens were ablaze with colour, I think I walked around with my mouth open in awe for most of the time. I've been to many botanical gardens and this one is up there with the best of",
          "So much to see including tropical species in the greenhouse. Well kept gardens, a nice thing to do while in Oxford.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed this lovely garden. The admission price is very reasonable, and you can come back multiple times on the same day, so you are free to take your time and stroll leisurely through the many paths. They have a huge variety of plants from around the world. The",
          "Took a stroll through with my 6 year old for an hour or so. Wish we had had more time but took what we could. A few amazing specimens be it the 20 foot tall cacti or the 4 foot Lilly pads that could hold a child. Beyond the greenhouses the outdoor gardens were fun and",
          "It was alright but for the kids it got a bit boring in places very well done and lots of interesting facts.",
          "As a mum with a baby I appreciate the calm, the plants ( baby likes looking at leaves!) the great baby change and the decent coffee. We have annual membership and it\u2019s a regular stop on our walk into town.",
          "Nice botanical garden, lovely selection of different plant beds and green houses and information about different species and environments. Easily spent two hours there looking at all the different sections of the garden and the different plants in the green houses. The little",
          "Lovely bedding plants, although some were past their best due to the recent hot weather. The lily house was a bit disappointing as it was mainly water lilies and plants and few other lilies. Small cafe facility but we didn't try this.",
          "So glad we paid a visit. There are glasshouses full of exotic plants, aloes, succulents and cacti. The grounds are well laid out with a fountain and neatly kept flower beds. The trees, shrubs and plants are clearly labelled and the profusion of colour was stunning.",
          "It's a pleasure to visit in summer when all the plants and flowers are alive. But it's not that huge so be prepared.",
          "Visited Oxford at the weekend and decided to have a wander around the gardens to get away from the hustle and bustle for a couple of hours and walked around the gardens and sat in front of the pond having a picnic lunch. We have been to other botanical gardens which are much",
          "We were only going to pop in for a quick look but ended up staying 2 or 3 hours. Beautifully tended and curated with lots of labels for \u201coooh what\u2019s that?\u201d moments. Interesting glass houses, herbaceous borders (right at the far end), fabulous trees and a little coffee stand",
          "Popped in as part of Oxford Treasure Hunt Was a little pricey to visit but the gardens were well presented and interesting",
          "Almost opposite the Magdelin bridge punting, you can see the greenhouses as you float down the river, so on another trip to Oxford we popped in. \u00a36.00 an adult under 16s free, which is probably about right. It isn't huge but it's a nice slow walk, plenty of benches and spaces",
          "The oldest Botanical Gardens and surely one of the best. The Glasshouses are particularly spectacular and the herbaceous boarder was exquisite. I would highly recommend spending an hour or two.",
          "The gardens are stunning, we had a couple of hours walking around, the weather was amazing which helped but even on a busy August Saturday it was peaceful and pleasant, after many years living in Oxford I'd never been so came back as a tourist for the day, well worth it!",
          "Of course this is not Kew Gardens; however, it has a nice and varied collection worth a look if you are a garden lover.",
          "The botanic garden is just off the High Street but as soon as you walk in the bustle of Oxford seems a world away. It really is a wonderful oasis after pounding the busy streets. We went to escape the crowds but it offered much more than just an escape. My husband is not a great",
          "I visited the botanical gardens and was so glad I made it. Excellent variety of flora and fauna and views",
          "Great place to chill out after a bit of punting against the strong currents. Plenty of greenery to enjoy, or just have a cake/picnic by the river.",
          "These gardens were beautiful and serene. They are right next to the Cherwell, and we saw people punting while we toured the gardens. They had a hunt-and-find set up for the kids, which my 4.5-year-old totally enjoyed. In addition, if you have a group of children, there is",
          "The Oxford Botanic Garden is right downtown off the main road, yet you are overcome by beauty and tranquility as soon as you enter. My son and I were visiting Oxford and decided to spend an afternoon at the botanic garden. There are so many amazing plant specimens it is almost",
          "Clos to Christchurch - after a nice walk and on the bank of a river. We love the botanic gardens in Prague and were curious to see this one. Plenty of flowers, trees, hothouses full of different cacti, carnivorous flowers, plams etc, Very nice place for about one and a half",
          "Located along the river, it was extremely pleasant to stroll the colorful grounds. Unfortunately, there are few trees to offer shady relief during the current heat wave.",
          "I would definitely recommend the botanic gardens to anyone visiting oxford who has a little free time (maybe an hour plus). The gardens aren\u2019t huge but are worth a visit, and are stunning in the summer time. Also student entry is \u00a34 which is nice to see!",
          "We had not been there for several years as it was being redesigned. However in July it was a riot of color especially the Merton section. Many unusual plants and mature trees. Take a picnic.",
          "What can I say this gorgeous little sanctuary in the heart of Oxford deserves more than 5 stars. I wish I could get my hand on borders like that in my garden. Picked up lots of ideas for a \"long\" border of my own.",
          "Oxford's Botanic Garden is beautiful and strolling there was pleasant and peaceful. The admission fee seemed a little high for such a low-key small attraction, but I do understand that it must be expensive to maintain the grounds. Viewed from that perspective I didn't really",
          "Browse the family gardens, the walk along the river, and the greenhouses. Perfect way to spend a few hours and you can have tea on the High street right after.",
          "One of the many jewels in Oxford s crown. Bow scrape etc On summers day it of course is idyllic, don't forget to look out for the Cheshire Cat.",
          "Nice gardens to visit. Very peaceful away from the busy city centre. Nothing dramatic to view. Just a clam interlude on a busy day.",
          "Spent a lovely morning visiting this garden. It was immaculate and a delight. The greenhouses were interesting as was the Medicinal Garden. A peaceful haven in the middle of a bustling City.",
          "I hadn't visited for over 10 years and was hopeful of a good display of poppies as I am an avid grower myself. Whilst I loved the poppies I was slightly disappointed more plants weren't in flower, but still an excellent way to spend your time.",
          "Once you've bought your ticket, it's valid all day, until the last entry time, so you might like to see it early on, then have lunch somewhere and return later in the day, like I did. (Do check with them on the day, though.) I spent quite a while on both visits looking at the",
          "This garden is right by the river so you can watch the people going up and down the river in punts, pedalos etc. Very pretty areas to see and greenhouses to visit as well. There was a pop up cafe there for drinks, cakes and ice creams. It was \u00a34 for seniors and was very quiet",
          "It is the oldest botanic garden in Britain (founded in 1621) and one of the oldest scientific gardens in the world. It started as a physic garden growing plants for medicinal research. You can purchase Oxford Physic Gin, made with botanicals from the gardens, in the small gift",
          "You could spend all day here, wandering around the plants, just sitting by the pond or lounging on the grass. So much to see and such wonderful specimens. If you love plants then this is a must for you.",
          "We spent a couple of enjoyable hours late in the afternoon here. It is a perfect miniature botanic garden - compact, well themed, with lovely planting beds, staging and paths from space to space, while also allowing lots of open grass for people to sit and relax. I thought they",
          "Compared to Cambridge University Botanic Garden, my husband and I were rather disappointed with our visit. It took about an hour to look round the garden and hot houses, and then we sat by the river for a little while watching the punts go past. We did take a picnic with us,",
          "The greenhouses and rock garden were definitely highlights...they are beautiful. The rest of the garden is very pretty too and was very nice to walk around however it's smaller than I expected and there's not a wealth of information. Because of this I thought that the \u00a36 was a",
          "Pleasant time outdoors. The garden itself is quite small but really nicely taken care of. It is situated in inner city, surrounded by some beautiful colleges and architecture. It is not the most exciting of activities but if you're after some one-on -one nature time- this place",
          "Smaller than I expected but pretty nevertheless. Nice place to meander round & have a relaxing hour or so.",
          "Had a very pleasant couple of hours wandering around the gardens and glass houses in the sunshine. \u00a36 each seemed reasonable and there is also a little outdoor coffee vendor by the river so you can pass the time being amused by people\u2019s punting efforts. Despite some of the",
          "Inadequate toilet facilities only 2 available. Big queues\ud83d\ude29 totally unacceptable. ........! These places are so happy to rip tourists off",
          "Even as the green houses carried some nice plants the garden itself was in waiting to bloom. So my advice is to come in summer.",
          "I visited here on a rainy day in July but it was worth the visit. The garden is immaculately maintained. The staff was very nice and enthusiastic about being there.",
          "We were fortunate to come in good weather. Its moderate in size but certainly a pleasent find. It offers some variety in layout and choice of plants. It also is right along the riverside which is nice. Its just over \u00a35 for entry which is very reasonable too. I would definitely",
          "For the \u00a315 it cost 3 of us to get in, I was expecting something a little more. Yes, there are plenty of nicely lined plants in beds, a lot of exotic examples and some water features. But there was nothing spectacular that makes me want to go back. Maybe I'm spoilt with the",
          "Nice little garden and collection of glasshouses that can be seen in about an hour. I thought the entry fee of \u00a36.00 was reasonable too. Some people have complained about the \"overgrown\" plants in the greenhouses, nut I quite enjoyed ducking and moving various flora and fauna",
          "It's on a beautiful site right next to the river, with a remarkable collection of both tropical and temperate plants. The stone archway in the entrance will be familiar to those who love Morse and Lewis.",
          "I visited the Botanic Garden in April, which probably wasn't the best time of year as most of the outdoor flowers were not in bloom. The garden is built over a Jewish graveyard. The glass houses were nice to see though. I particularly liked the cacti. It's best to wait until",
          "Visited here lunchtime today for some peace and quiet - and fresh air. Perhaps not the best time of year to see flowers in bloom, but the greenhouses were full and the bluebells were out. There were many couples and young families there as well.",
          "Extremely good value at \u00a35 per person.. whilst the gardens weren\u2019t in full bloom it was peaceful and still beautiful. The glass houses had some fantastic plants in and we spent a wonderful 2 hours just wandering round.",
          "Wonderful and interesting selection of plants in a beautiful and peaceful environment. Well worth an hour, reasonable price.",
          "The botanical gardens in Oxford are quite small but full of easy to read informative information boards. We visited on a freezing cold March day but felt it was a successful visit well worth the money we paid. There weren\u2019t many plants in flower but it was still interesting to",
          "Great place to take a bit of time out from the bustle of the city. In the winter it can be a little sparse in the main garden, but there is always plenty to see in the hot houses, where there are climates from arid to humid. I have an interest in insects and arachnids, and this",
          "It was an amazing experience for me to visit University of Oxford Botanic Garden. I have never seen so many different plants. What I liked the most is that you get to learn which plants are used in medical industry, which plants are poisonous etc.... All those information could",
          "Beautiful location and decent collection of plants. It is a bit pricey, but you can get a yearly pass and if you live in the area it's a beautiful place to go have lunch or for a walk.",

          "This is Britain's oldest botanic gardens that were founded in 1621 by the Earl of Danby whose statue is at the gates, along with statues of Charles I and Charles II. There is still an original walled garden here. Also a rock garden and a magnificent insectivorous plant house",
          "I was quite disappointed by my visit. Going in mid January of course I didn't expect a plethora of flowers. My main complaint was being charged the full price during winter months to mainly visit a mound of earth and dead plants on the pleasant but hardly spectacular grounds.",
          "Nice enough place to spend some time if tired of walking around and seeing the architectural sites in Oxford.",
          "Although the garden is fairly bereft of interest in January we did enjoy walking through the glasshouses and found the interpretive displays to be interesting and well worth the visit. We must return when the weather warms up!",
          "A fabulous quiet corner of Oxford with the added bonus of an interesting range of plant life and accessible interpretation. Visit on a noce day and just wander around and sit in the peaceful surroundings.",
          "The botanical gardens may be beautiful in the spring and summer but in the late fall, they are nothing terribly special. I would avoid a November/December trip (except maybe for the Xmas fair).",
          "I visited this garden on a dry, Saturday afternoon. There was still snow on the ground in places. A lovely, quiet stroll around thousands of plants. Most were asleep for winter but the glasshouses were fantastic.",
          "Lovely quiet walk around the gardens and glasshouses and beside the river. Would be even better in the summer but we'll worth a visit even in December.",
          "To be fair, it was November when we visited, but while it was somewhere to kill some time, I wouldn\u2019t rush back. I like to feel inspired and take ideas away when I visit botanic gardens, but something just didn\u2019t resonate with me. I think it would be very different in",
          "a great place to just sit - or to see beautiful plants and setting - just of the high street in Oxford",
          "A rather small, but beautifully laid out garden. Knowledgeable and friendly staff provide visitors with information and a pamphlet detailing what is in bloom at the time you visit. The garden is worth the few pounds entrance fee.",
          "We spent a couple of hours here and enjoyed it. On a warm day you can sit and chill out for a bit which is what we did. Its very pretty with lots of interesting plants to look at. Not as big as a lot of botanical gardens but its still worth a visit!",
          "Ever since my first visit to Oxford- quite a long time ago- I've always loved the Botanic Garden. My daughter and I visited on a rather misty, autumn afternoon and, although not as spectacular as in Spring/Summer, it was so calm and peaceful. There are still plenty of plants to",
          "Many species of plant life, tranquil setting, pricing was reasonable but we did get student and senior discount. Still beautiful in October would recommend.",

          "A beautiful garden and greenhouses. We visited on a day when taking in a number of locations in Oxford and despite the rain were able to take time in the gardens and greenhouses when it rained. In an hour you can cover the garden but you could take longer if you wished.",
          "It's not expensive and worth the visit. There are trees and plants that so wonderful. To go around does not take that much time unless you analize each flower. There is staff accessible for questions and you get a map to find your way. Its a great stop on your way to Cowley.",
          "We stopped here to rest and enjoy the greenery, and were lured on to explore further. I especially liked the \"plants that changed the world\" section.",
          "This garden takes about an hour to view. It is well laid out & divided into different areas & catagories. There are benches at convenient intervals! The herbacious border was beautiful. There were some interesting plants & trees in the conservatories. There is a small outdoor",

          "This is one of the best botanical gardens I have seen. Great variety of flowers and plants. They are grouped very well and there is plenty of information regarding what you are seeing should you wish to be educated as well as just looking at beautiful plants. The medical section",

          "If you're looking to make the most of the wildflower meadow plantings down near the river and the herbaceous border, mid to late summer is the prime time to go. Having been here before there's also plenty to see at other times of the year - through spring there's the lovely",

          "Every time I come to Oxford, I feel compelled to spend my first morning here to recuperate after an 8 hour flight. It is lovely in the Summer which is the only time of year I've been there. Last time I went, there was a surprise thunderstorm and we decided to leave. They",

          "We visited here and we enjoyed the garden , there is a little cart that sells hot drinks with a small seating area facing the river, where we sat watching the rowing boats going passed. It's worth a visit to have a look.",
          "We had some free time while wandering around in Oxford, so we decided to stop by. What a great place! Lots more to look at than we initially thought. My daughter especially loved the insect eating plants in one of the greenhouses (We don't have young children, but if you do, you",
          "Was there on a weekend when they had a small fair / festival in the gardens. Somewhat deranged puppet act was a huge hit with the kids, as was running this beautiful garden after the ride from London. Alice in Wonderland was penned in the vicinity, and its feels like it. Just",
          "On a splendid august day, we stayed the last two hours before closing time in the Botical garden of Oxford. The gardens are beautiful well taken care of, but not to strict as well. We had a good rest on the lawn, enjoying the beautiful borders of the garden. The greenhouses have",
          "A place for garden & plant loving people, specially who are interested in botany. Vast land divided into plant specific zones for easy identification .A large part has been allotted for taxonomic plants which are in large glass houses. Some of the exclusive plants are Giant",

          "The Botanic Gardens were a pleasant morning diversion for us. Easily seen in an hour, it's worth the small admission fee.",
          "Highly recommended. An oasis of calm on a busy touristy summer afternoon - perfect to escape for a few hours. I could have spent all day there. I know it is small but it was actually much bigger than I'd expected and there is plenty to explore. There are several glasshouses",
          "Overall, average and a bit tired, but the great perennial border was well worth the price. A peaceful place and with views of the river.",
          "This is a relatively small botanic garden and it is passed its best for the year but still worth an hour if you have plenty of time. Probably not worth a visit this late in the year if you only have a day and are not a regular visitor to Oxford unless you have a special interest",

          "So many pretty flowers I don't even know where to begin! A beautiful place to spend a few hours on a lovely sunny afternoon.",
          "You don't have to have green fingers to visit here! If you're a Tolkien fan after watching The Lord of the Rings, look out for the fantasy trees from the movie. There are other movie facts to look out for too...",
          "A very pleasant way to spend a few hours wandering around enjoying the walled gardens, the glasshouses and the river bank. Not the biggest botanical garden in the world but set in a lovely location and with some beautiful and histoic displays.",
          "This place is well worth a visit. 3 hours is enough, it has lots of unusual plants with good info. We went on a Saturday afternoon and seen the plants that changed the world exhibition. There were also specialist ciders and beers being served along with food at reasonable prices",

          "Not only are most of the plants labelled but there are very helpful descriptions of their historical usage and development. So many unusual species in the glasshouses. Like any other garden some areas will have passed their best but do not let that put you off. small outside",
          "Went there a couple of months back with a good friend. Really loved this place. Sure some things were shut off but my friend and I had a fabulous time just taking in the scenary. Loved most of the green houses and the open gardens. Would have been nice to have some more",

          "It was probably the wrong time of year to see the gardens at their best, but we had so looked forward to seeing them and felt rather let down. The majority of the plants are past their best and certain areas of the garden felt a little uncared for. I was also surprised to see",
          "Slightly pricey entry into a garden that pales in comparison to the Cambridge Botanical Gardens... Good concession rates however. Not comparable to most National Trust Gardens as well. Upon this visit there was a duo of slightly rude female staff.",
          "Although not large these gardens are well worth a visit, but are often quiet. The glasshouses are small but interesting, and there is fun to be had watching people who hired punts make fools of themselves. We were there at the end of the day and at times the only people in sight.",
          "We stayed in Witney which is about a half hour drive if that away and used the park and ride at Peartree which cost just \u00a32 for the day.Buses are extra but having an OAPs Bus Pass it was free to me and my wife.Takes about 20 minutes into town. And saves a lot of hassle as it",
          "We decided to walk round the Botanical Garden as we had some time free on the Sunday Morning and we found it to be very pleasant and enjoyable. All for only \u00a35 as well.",
          "Great place to pass away a couple of hours... lovely gardens, conservatories with cacti, water lilies etc great to walk through..good place for photos. Coffee etc available by river walk..can watch people trying to punt!! Well worth a visit.",
          "Even on a clouded day in the summer the colours displayed in this garden are overwhelmingly beautiful. It's great to take some fruit with you and eat it on a bench near the river while you are visiting the garden. It's great stop away from the business of all the tourists",
          "A University run beautiful garden with unusual and historic trees and plants. A series of Greenhouses and Hot Houses with mysterious, strange and beautiful planting from all round the world. There is a small entrance fee during the tourist season.",
          "I had no idea what to expect and wished I had a better camera with me! As you pass through the entrance you see a series of planted flower beds which are laid out with plants according to medicinal properties etc. Keep on going and you go through a gate way and enter a magical",

          "Oxford is full of history. Visiting Oxford feels a bit like visiting an open air museum. Everything breathes a grand past. The Botanic Garden is no exception. Situated on the banks of the river, there are interesting views from almost everywhere in this garden park. In some",
          "These are beautiful gardens which should be of interest to gardeners and non gardeners. In a very busy City they offer a calm restful spot. Good value for money.",
          "The glass houses, trees, and gardens are all very interesting if you like botanical. The glass houses had all sorts of exotic plants, the gardens were flowering, and the apple trees were full of apples. The stone wall garden might have been copied at Downton Abbey, the orchid",
          "Collections of plants and trees put together over the past 200 years. Collections housed in glasshouses and in parkland, most labelled to aid recognition. moving through the garden you come across a rock garden and water garden, but the water garden was a disappointment as it",
          "Very nice gardens. facts about the plants in the greenhouses, plants arranged in terms of uses, especially like medicinal gardens. The wild flower gardens were spectacular. Take in your own food, as there is only one coffee stall",
          "If you like to observe plants, you can enjoy a good one hour or so here. I did. Not an extra agent mega species garden. Not sure if the prices of 3.5-5 pounds are justified though, I would expect more with that peice. Should be cheaper. I guess the money is spent to keep the",
          "We spent a couple of hours wandering through the glass houses and gardens. The walled herbaceous border is stunning as are the flowers in the Merton borders. Definitely worth the entry fee and worth revisiting I think",
          "The gardens were really spectacular. It was a good time of the year to view them as lots of the plants were flowering. There were different areas to see with different types of plants. The glass houses were also interesting. The gardens were not as big as I thought they would be",
          "This is a wonderful way to relax and spend a couple of hours in the sunshine. The gardens are beautifully maintained and contain many beautiful flowers. There are seats situated around the place where you may sit to admire the plants and flowers. A great place to spend time on a",
          "Rather small but intimate and exciting garden. It includes both open areas and greenhouses. Almost all plants are carefully marked and some of them have very interesting and clear comments (especially most common ones which we regularly use in our life: potato, coffee, tobacco,",

          "Marvellous to find calm to walk, or sit and talk, on the edge of tourist dominated Oxford, within a few minutes of colleges and bustle. Lovely at any time of year.",
          "The day I was here was very warm by Oxford standards and the sidewalks were packed with groups. I was looking for some peaceful shade and the Botanical Gardens hit the spot. The Brits are famous for their love of gardening and this is a place to see that on full display. Not a",
          "Unexpected oasis of calm and cool in a hot busy Oxford July day. A mini Kew with the greenhouses and intelligent displays in the beds. Well worth a visit if you need to relax for an hour or so. Not quite a 'Hidden Gem' but close",
          "Especially the greenhouses are worth a visit. The variety and beauty of the plants inside is amazing. Otherwise, a nice one hour walk.",
          "Spent a lovely hour or two walking around the gardens and green house. Saw the largest cacti/succulent have ever seen. Lovely to visit a garden in city centre. Had coffee overlooking the river which was very entertaining watching a selection of men discovering how difficult it",
          "The Botantic Gardens as a whole are well worth visiting - the herbaceous border in late June was wonderful, the medicinal beds are fascinating and the glass houses are lovely with the lily ponds. However, by far the best aspect in our opinion was the spectacularly beautiful",
          "All the plants are named so for anyone wanting to take away info its all there. The glass houses are outstanding , the gardens lovely, especially the wild flower section which was going strong while we were there. N/E/C/S/J",

          "I visited here with my family for Father's Day. It was a lovely little walk and a beautiful place to enjoy a sit down and watch the world go by. The only thing that let the experience down was the toilets. Disgusting! Overall a lovely family trip out and reasonably priced.",
          "Some lovely plants on show in several climate zoned greenhouses. Outside gardens are lovely, but not all of the plants are well labelled so you may not get information that you need to really take advantage of the gardens",
          "You can spend 30 minutes or many hours here....it is not large, but the gardens and greenhouses are beautiful and full of interesting plants. I've visited in winter and summer and enjoyed it both times.",
          "The gardens were lovely, very peaceful to wander around at your own pace. There were beds laid out relating to illnesses which were very informative and areas for produce that had shaped food history. The long border was stunning. If I lived in Oxford I would be visiting many",
          "I visit Botanic Gardens on a regular basis and this was next on the list! Great selection of plants....well laid out and some unusual specimens too. A must see if your in Oxford and you like gardens. Good value too at \u00a35.50 with gift aid. No refreshments on site though which is",

          "Oxford is known for its historical university and colleges, but do not forget the botanical gardens, they are a peaceful escape of the very busy city centre. It is lovely garden, well taken care of. Absolutely stunning in the spring and summer, and still even worth it in the",

          "So many things to see and do in Oxford but for the garden lover this is enjoyable. A mix of old and new plantings as well as conservatory gardens. Stroll behind the conservatory and sit on the bench to watch the punters on the river.",

          "We stopped here because I thought the tree from the famous photo of Tolkien was still in the garden, but apparently it had to be removed so it was a bit of wasted of the 5pound entry fee. Serves me right for not doing more research. The gardens are really nice though.",

          "I have to go back to check again because most of the flowers didn't bloom yet. Only tulips was already amazing. The admission is only \u00a35 it's a fair price to help the garden to stay like that, clean and organize. Hopefully next month will return!",
          "We enjoyed an afternoon. We photographed a heron (bird) in one of the fountains. The greenhouses were the most interesting part. Unusual plants there, especially for England.",
          "I love nature so today I decided to visit the Botanic Garden in Oxford. It was a very bad experience. I spent only about 20 minutes there and that was more than enough to walk around. Although there were some nice tulips, a magnolia tree and of course green grass and trees - but",
          "Wonderful selection and lots of colour, even in early spring. Very calm and a lovely walk by the water. Don't miss the ponds.",
          "A really interesting well established collection. I have been visiting these gardens over many years and I still find something interesting every time. The greenhouses in particular have some great collections, from giant cacti to insect eating venus fly traps. The medicinal",
          "But still a lovely afternoon in the stillness of the garden. We imagine the garden will be in its full Spring glory now - we were a little early.",
          "We were fortunate to visit on the first day in spring with plenty of sunshine and it was an incredible place to be. Sitting by the canal, interacting with the most confident ducks in the world, watching the amateur punters struggling and colliding with each other on the water",
          "Well I made the drive from London for a few hours in the sun in Oxford. The botanical gardens for the afternoon was on the menu with are packed lunch. Was a lovely spring day and we caught tulips and other flowers in a beautiful surrounding. For its city centre location it was",
          "It is a very good place to spend some time. Lot to see and a lot to learn. I saw the largest lemon in my life and some of the rudest ducks. Staff is very helpful even if the card reader not working (A small cake stand or something will be great.)",
          "The Oxford Botanic garden is rather small, but has 5 glass houses with different climates, a nice water garden, and an astonishing variety of plants everywhere. Nice for getting away from the hectic High Street. 5 GBP entry fee for an adult and worth it. You can either just",
          "My husband and I enjoyed visiting the Botanic Gardens very much. It was a lovely Spring day and so much to see. Well worth a visit.",
          "This is the oldest surviving Botanic garden in England which began as a physic garden in the 1620s about 50 years before the foundation of Chelsea Physic garden in London. There is a varied collection of plants and much of historical interest to see. The gardens are a peaceful",
          "A small by most city botanic garden standards but this is a University garden not funded by the Council but by the multi million pound University. March sees it in preparation but it's tranquil and the staff are friendly as is everyone in Oxford.",
          "This beautiful peaceful spot inspired a number of the authors who have called Oxford home. Th magnolias were just coming out, and the garden is in that delightful waking-up-from-winer stage when anything is possible. The glass houses were full of interesting small trees,",
          "Well worth a the time to walk around the University of Oxford Botanic Garden. Very peaceful and a lovely setting.",
          "What a pleasant place to spend an hour or two. We followed the Post code on our GPS and ended up in Rose Lane which is a narrow dead end with double yellow lines and too narrow to park in even with a disabled badge. There is no disabled parking or indeed any parking on site.",
          "Whether you're a keen botanist, or just looking for a pleasant walk through attractive scenery, the Botanic Garden is well worth a visit...particularly if you're a HDM fan! Plenty of beautiful and unusual sights to see!",
          "Step away from it all right near Magdalen Bridge. A lovely summer's day with a picnic at the Botanic is bliss!",
          "While not the largest botanic garden (this being easily 100th of the size of Kew Gardens), this is a sweet little visit for any budding botanists, or anyone who enjoys a bit of peace and quiet as it's never busy. Students at both universities go free, so I'm not aware of its",
          "Greenhouses well worth a visit. It must be really colourful in Spring and summer. However, it is a bit 'cramped'.",
          "The gardens are not big, and have some nice green houses, and are located next to the river, so on a nice day it is very pleasant to walk through them. In the winter there is not much blossom to see. It is not a must see if your time in Oxford is limited.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Our son is a gardener and was able to explain the latin names and identify the plants and shrubs. Even in Winter it is a great place to visit. The displays of Iris, snowdrops and other bulbs was spectacular. The greenhouses have some very pretty",
          "These gardens are wonderful for a spring or summer visit...take a picnic and watch the punts float by!",
          "If you want to imagine yourself in a scene in typical English idyll. You can sit on the grass bank next to the Thames and watch punts gangle by (if you want to try yourself rather go to Cherwell boat house: tip: uses the pole like a rudder). There are benches to sit on with a",
          "Visited in April last year so as expected it wasn't the best time to see the plants. Spent an hour or so wandering around and visited the glass houses to warm up a bit.",
          "Impressive!!Really a lovely place to visit. I spend wonderful time there.Just wear a comfortable clothes and shoes to walk there.",
          "I visit the garden every time I go to Oxford not just to enjoy the plants and the hothouses but also to sit on Will and Lyra's bench. You've just got to do it if you've read the 'His Dark Materials' trilogy!",
          "Once inside the gardens it's possible to loose yourself amongst the carefully thought out planting. The greenhouses also offer a great variety of flora too.",
          "Although winter time this place has some character and is worth visiting. The greenhouses are also interesting. There is a small shop in the entrance which sells very nice cards and some gardeners tools.",
          "As regular visitors we are often here, supporting financially as a family. Fantastic collection and a beautiful spot to pass a couple of hours. Go there! We lunch here often, whatever the weather, usually buying bread & something from town before hand. There is a smal cafe but",
          "lovely afternoon spent here plants well marked, got yelled at by a magpie (personal highlight!) rather than purchase a another keychain or refrigerator magnet, I bought a years membership to support the garden",
          "Small, exquisite delight with terrific collection of plants in extraordinary location by Magdalene Bridge..must see",
          "This is a wonderful garden, it is interesting in any season, but my most favourite thing is definitely the Merton borders in July and August.",
          "Nice setting near the river just outside the city centre, a friendly welcome at the gate, wide paths so easy to walk around. But November is maybe not the best time to visit as, perhaps understandably, there is a lot of maintenance going on and the plants and the beds are not",
          "This is not just a great place for a quiet wander aroundm, but it has some great plants and planting schemes. There is an entrance fee but on a sunny day you will get good value. There are flower beds here, small cottage borders, and large planting experiments. There are many",
          "Step off the busy street into this oasis of colour, calm and interest. There is lots to see if you're interested in gardening and design. There's a great walk down to the river. The glasshouses are a must. The herbaceous border is terrific. Catering is very limited so maybe",
          "Lovely experience staff helpful wheelchair provided but not an outdoor one which would have been nice [as stated by staff member who said he would speak to the right person to update it]. Staff informed and pleasant and greenhouses lovely but sad lilypad one closed for cleaning",
          "We spent a lovely couple hours strolling in the Botanic Garden on our recent visit to Oxford. It was a beautiful sunny morning, and the whole place was in full fall with lots of great color in the trees. There are also some neat greenhouses, a cool walled-garden area, and little",
          "The Botanic garden isn't large but is an interesting visit. From the Conservatory, to the Palm and Arid House, to the Botanical beds, there is much of interest. Work was going on at the time, so some of the beds weren't so interesting. It really is a peaceful place and worth the",
          "On the edge of the city centre and beside the Thames, this garden is one you should visit. The entrance fee (\u00a35) is well worth it. The gardens are formal but with informal planting. The greenhouses are very interesting.",
          "The glasshouses are excellent, the gardens magnificent and the local wild life very interesting. We saw grey squirrels and jay birds as well as several other species of birds. Take a picnic in summer and just soak in the gardens tranquility.",
          "A very affordable and convenient couple of hours if you have time whilst in Oxford. Even without bright floral displays, there is lots to see, particularly the \"Plants that changed the World\" and \"Medicinal Plants\" areas. The greenhouses are well worth a visit also. Just",
          "'To promote the furtherance of learning and to glorify nature' is the motto of the Oxford Botanic Garden and it does just that. I found the entrance to the gardens and then walked past the first of the green houses thinking this is all pretty ordinary and then I walked into the",
          "We thought visiting in October we may be disappointed but the gardens were lovely to explore and the glass houses worth a visit.",
          "...but Lyra's and Will's bench is still there. Oxford is a beautiful town so if you take the time to visit it you should also visit the University of Oxford Botanic Garden. There are many reasons to do so from one's botanical interests to literary fandom. Unfortunately the",
          "I love this garden. Everything is well labeled too so it is easy to know what you are seeing. Very pretty.",
          "We visited botanic garden on a Sunday morning. The garden is lovely and very tranquil. It has wonderful selection of plants, trees and vegetables. We loved this oldest botanic garden and its glass houses, scientific plants and a walk by the river.",
          "This is a relatively small garden but with a lot to see and clearly has some magnificent plant life from all over the world. The glass houses are definitely worth looking into and the wildlife in the area is always close by. The fern house and carnivorous plant house are",
          "My wife is keen on gardens and plants . She really enjoyed the visit and seeing such a variety of plants . For me it was interesting to learn about the import and development of plants from the information notices . The therapeutic and medicinal uses were explained simply .",
          "We enjoyed our time at the gardens. We don't know a lot about plants so the mini guide that gives key plants to look out for was great. Loved the greenhouses, the Lily House was our favourite and we also met the resident robin!",
          "An early morning visit, piece and tranquility; something you need to find for yourself in Oxford. Walking through the glasshouses, along the the side of the river and meandering through the gardens in the sun made our visit all the more worthwhile. There is something for",
          "On a busy visit to Oxford it is worth taking an hour out in these exquisite gardens. Take a stroll beside the Cherwell watching punters enjoying the river. Take a seat and drink in the beauty of the garden. Sometimes there are art exhibitions which are worth seeing.",
          "I would love to revisit this garden in the Spring or early Summer. It is beginning its slowdown towards winter and beginning to fade. That said it is still a worthwhile visit.",
          "This is a lovely place beside the river. I am not hugely interested in all the plants but enjoyed visiting the greenhouses and the various planted areas I found the fruit and veg areas very interesting. This is a lovely relaxing place to be in the centre of Oxford with seating",
          "I am not particularly knowledgeable about botany or gardening, but I loved my visit to the Botanic Garden. Huge range of gardens, from very formal to rather wild, along with vines, a huge number of shrubs, many trees, and many grass varieties. I especially enjoyed the tropical",
          "Plopped down for an annual pass after my first visit. Not huge, but beautifully done -- glass houses, containers, herbaceous borders, exotic and interesting plants and trees, beauty and peace -- along the Cherwell, no less. Photo op after photo op, or just sit and enjoy the",
          "Even in mid September the entire garden seemed to be in bloom - the flowers, that is. In addition to flowers and green plants there were vegetables, with accompanying signage.",
          "Came to the park around noon to eat lunch with my wife and baby daughter and was not let down by the splendor of the park. You could walk around freely amongst the flora in the garden and there are many benches to relax on. The fact that it is not too big is a bonus as it makes",
          "I was in Oxford for more than a year before visiting the Botanic Garden . . . well worth the wait. A peaceful place for a walk, and perhaps a heart-to-heart talk with a friend.",
          "We are not very knowledgeable about \"gardening\", but enjoy looking round this type of garden, particularly colourful shrubs & bushes. Pleasant walk in itself.",
          "If you have some time while in Oxford the gardens are a lovely place to walk and feel for a bit like you're out of the city and it's busy-ness. I bet it's wonderful on a sunny day - it was rainy and quite cool when we visited and I still found it charming.",
          "I was disappointed with my visit. I used to spend a lot of time here but increasingly found that the displays of plants had deteriorated and looked scruffy. After a gap of over 2 years I thought I'd check out the Botanic Garden again...and I was very disappointed; the beds were",
          "I am a Friend of Kew so get free entrance here and as this place is lovely I always try and come here when I am in Oxford. This garden is better earlier in the Summer (June / July probably the peak) but the fruit and veg plots are interesting as is the 'dry' garden which is not",
          "I'm not a fan of botanical gardens, that's sure. When entering, I was asking myself what exactly brought me here, and, to my big surprise, it's a great place! I enjoyed my visit a lot, they have not only various flowers and trees, but also vegetables, nicely arranges grassy",
          "Visiting in September, although was nice to see the array of plants within the greenhouses, the borders were somewhat lacking as the summer drew to a end. Overall though a very nice few hours spent wandering around.",
          "Formal garden beds with plants used for healing form part of this garden, with less formal areas beyond, including a rock garden. I was thrilled to find a Dawn Redwood and a newly planted Sargent cherry among the trees.",
          "Peaceful gardens in the bustle of Oxford. Some beds could have been better but we enjoyed the hot houses. Overall an enjoyable place to visit. Tea and cake from a van.",
          "A beautiful, large garden to visit, but not overwhelming. Interesting greenhouses containing exotic plants, glorious flower beds.",
          "We paid \u00a35 each to spend a very pleasant hour and a half walking around these beautiful gardens - it was incredibly relaxing! In fact we probably could have stayed even longer, if we had the time. The displays are well maintained and well presented, the location is very",
          "This really is a very interesting place. I did not really know what to expect but was so glad I'd gone and will certainly go back again. The gardens are well set out with many peaceful paths to walk along. I particularly liked the cacti in the greenhouses and the water",
          "We've lived near Oxford for ages but never stopped in before. What a lovely place for an afternoon stroll. The greenhouses are amazing. Bring a picnic - there are a few nice spots to sit down and chill.",
          "I took one of the first guided tours to be offered, and it makes a big difference. Our guide, Peter, was very well prepared to show us the grounds.",
          "We had just a few days in Oxford so wanted to cram in as much as possible and I'm so glad we walked here from the city centre - it was well worth it! Yes there is a \u00a35 charge for an adult, but I felt this was reasonable as you can spend as much or little time as you wish in the",
          "I am guessing that the entrance fee is to keep the hordes of tourists from trampling the flower beds. It is a beautiful place full of history going back hundreds of years but you really have to love plants to think 5 pounds is worth it for these smallish gardens.",
          "We don\u2019t get to Oxford that often but, when we do, we always try to visit the Botanic Garden. It never lets us down. As with any proper garden, there is always something different to see. A highlight this visit was the extensive flower meadow. The water lilies, too, were looking",
          "Very interesting, even for non-horticulturists; the main border of the walled garden was stunning. The medicinal section was interesting. At \u00a35 each to go in, it was expensive for the offering. Kew Gardens is only \u00a314 as a comparison.",
          "Visiting Oxford (a bit like Cambridge) is worth the visit just to witness it's Architecture. It's truly amazing. It's interesting to know that Oxford's origins lie in the late Saxon period with its original street pattern still surviving along with some of its earliest",
          "Enjoyed our trip to the gardens and it was lovely to see it being used by lots of people. Some of the labelling of plants was missing but the huge variety of plants was great. It covers a large area in the centre of Oxford and is very central. My only complaint was that the",
          "Costing very little to enter. It's almost a secret garden which you enter from the noisy hustle and bustle of the city. Quiet tranquil beautiful if you are interested in plant and unusual trees I urge you to visit. Very easy to find right next to the river where you can also",
          "Away from the hustle and bustle of the city. A peaceful haven to gather you thoughts and enjoy Mother Nature.",
          "What a jewel. Calm and tranquil, stunning array of specimens and fascinating reminders of medicinal and other uses to which plants are put. Plenty of places to sit and take it all in. Entry fee very reasonable for what you see. Will definitely be back at other times of the year.",
          "Picturesque, well maintained gardens. Free for students of Oxford university . nice selection of plants. Little in the way of info about the different plant species on display though",
          "The botanic gardens are a beautiful, tranquil oasis of beautiful plants in the middle of this very busy city. I loved the large flower borders with innovative planting.",
          "This is the perfect place to take a deep breath from the bustle of Oxford. Very serene and visually chocolate box England. Not that expensive to get in either. Would thoroughly recommend.",
          "One of the smaller botanical gardens but very pleasantly laid out, right on the rivers edge. Offers special picnic days so you can eat on lawns which is a nice touch. Lots of fruit trees and exotic plants. Very nice selection of tropical Forna in the arboretums. All in all",
          "It's a tiny set of gardens that will take you 10 minutes to see. There are a lot better botanical attractions that are free to visit.",
          "Visited Oxford today as going to Highclere Castle tomorrow. As it was a beautiful sunny day and we had noticed Oxford had a botanical garden we decided to visit! It was an ideal day for this and we weren't disappointed. The flowers were in full bloom and we also visited the lily",
          "My husband and I visit botanical gardens where ever we go. This garden is so well done. The greenhouses are lovely and the layout of the various regular and medicinal gardens is wonderful. It was nice to get away from the tourists and have a peaceful visit in the gardens.",
          "Lovely location for a meander; lots of variety. Highlights included carnivorous plants and healing herbs.",
          "August is an excellent time to visit this Botanic Garden filled with history, wonderful selection of plants from every species some real eye openers, the glass hoses were excellent and I have never ever seen so many Caniverous plants make sure you take your camera you will not",
          "My mother and I recently spent the day in the University of Oxford Botanic Garden and it was glorious. Its location next to Magdalen Bridge makes it very central but once you are there surrounded by the most beautiful plants, trees and flowers you forget you are so close to the",
          "Was expecting more from the University Botanic Garden. A dry-day activity as greenhouses are limited and there is no indoor cafe.",
          "Really enjoyed wandering and looking at all the beautiful plants and flowers- unfortunately no cafe to have a cup of tea etc except for mobile van (which had very good cakes)and a couple of outside tables.",
          "Not the best garden iI have visited. The most interesting was the medicinal plant section on the far right as you enter. There is an accompanying book which can be purchased describing this part of the garden. Very interesting. The wild flower section was also a pleasureable",
          "We visited on a sunny, warm Sunday afternoon. The wildflower gardens were looking lovely, as was the vegetable display. We were pleased to see that every plant had a name tag - it's often not the case in show gardens - so it was easy to identify each variety. The glasshouses are",
          "We visited the garden on Sunday. We only had 1 hour to go around as it closed at 6pm. Shame, as we felt we had to rush around, so I suggest you give yourself 1-2hours if you want to properly enjoy the place. The variety of plants and colours was amazing. We particularly liked",
          "Having not been well recently, I was pleased when a friend took me here and we shared a picnic in the grounds. It was a warm day, but we found shade among the many wondrous flowers. The reception staff were very kind in looking after our hamper whilst we looked around the site",
          "We can visit to Botanic garden in many different cities, and in free. Nothing special to pay the entry charge of \u00a35+ quid.",
          "As well as the formal gardens there is an exceptionally beautiful wildflower garden. A super place for all ages. Our granddaughter loved it. Only two improvements - make sure the rolls in the sausage stall are fresh each day - they were not. Think of the sun and position more of",
          "it's a great place but it was not my favourite. I would rather visit the University Parks. Moreover, it's very expensive.",
          "Worth a look if you are a garden lover, take a picnic, stroll by the river \u00a35 entry fee, only a coffee van think they could do better with a little cafe.",
          "This is a magical place with beautiful indoor and outdoor displays - at any time of the year. It's close to Magdalen Bridge and so close to the river too.",
          "This cost 5GBP admission but was a peaceful glorious place. I loved the sculpture of the Cheshire Cat in a place that was frequented by the real Alice from Lewis Carroll's famous book.",
          "I visited in glorious summer and had a magical time just enjoying the vivid floral displays; if you visited in winter, I imagine these gardens could be disappointing for your five-pound entry charge, as there is little information about what you're looking at given in the beds",
          "It is rather small but great! Love the greenhouses. Nice location next to the river. So many different plants and flowers. I would love to spend many afternoons in there. Acceptable entrance fee.",
          "Beautiful place to visit away from the bustle of the city. Plants and flowers in abundance. Nice and relaxing can be done at own pace.",
          "I used to visit the botanic gardens frequently more than forty years ago. Visiting this time with my daughter I was very impressed with how the gardens have evolved. I particularly liked the prarie planting using drought resistant plants and the vegetable beds. They were a",
          "Lovely tranquil place. Well kept gardens and conservatory. Lovely river to punt on. All around is easy to walk. And little caravan selling homemade cakes tea and coffee with seating on river.",
          "This is it! You'll be walking into a tropical paradise. Flora you never even imagined existed. If you're looking for somewhere to let your mind wander, this is the place to do it.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Beautiful gardens and interesting greenhouses full of exotic plants, cacti, succulents and carnivorous plants. Very impressive displays and collections. Friendly staff and reasonable prices.",
          "Our stroll to this lovely garden was enhanced by the beautiful flowers. Take time for the greenhouses.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Lots of beautiful and rare plants in the greenhouses (especially like all the Nepenthes). also have a lokk at the centuries old mulberry tree. Even it was raining when i visited it was worth it.",
          "Whether you're a keen gardener or just want a peaceful stroll through beautiful borders, woodland areas, shade, benches, fountains, the Botanic Gardens are a must-see at any time of year. The colleges all have beautiful gardens, but this is special - and generally less crowded.",
          "I wanted to visit this place after reading about it in the trilogy \"His dark materials\" by Philip Pullman. I was very pleasantly surprised by the beauty of the garden and it turned out to be a perfect time to visit too! We arrived around ten in the morning and we were almost",
          "Beautiful gardens, if a little small. Lots of interesting plants inside and out. Felt like a million miles away from Oxford city centre - I like the sense of space and tranquility. Could have done with having a little tea shop and ideally placed next to the river.",
          "This is the oldest Botanic Garden in the world, I believe. Many unusual specimen plants and trees and a riot of colour in summer. Relaxing benches by pretty fountains. For me it was a return to memories of leisurely afternoons here in my teens, 30-odd years ago. In those days it",
          "A quiet small garden with thousands of plants Nice historical old architecture srounding the place It is very close to the high street and it has an easy access In this place you will enjoy the nature and the smell of fresh flowers It is a place you must visit in Oxford city",
          "Despite the inclement weather I throughly enjoyed my visit here. So much so that I signed up to be a \"friend \" & subsequently visited the National Botanic gardens of Wales & the Edinburgh botanical gardens too.",
          "Found myself heading this way to escape the crowds and really enjoyed the peace, not to mention the beauty of the gardens. Also if you're in anyway medically inclined there is a great section of the gardens devoted to plants in healthcare.",
          "A lovely way to spend a pleasant afternoon. For gardeners or non gardeners alike. My friends and I came away with lots of ideas for our own gardens.",
          "I spent a delightful afternoon here. The gardens are beautiful with lots of little known and labelled plants. The greenhouses were very interesting, we loved the lily pond.I can recommend a visit here, especially if you need a quiet time after all the hustle and bustle of",
          "The garden incorporates both landscape plants as well as an edible garden. It is quite large, take your time to explore the more formal and well as the casually planted areas. In addition there are glass house exhibits to showcase more tropical plants. Worth a couple of",
          "Although the Botanic Garden is relatively small, it sure packs a punch! The collections in the glasshouses are diverse, fascinating and very well cared for - plenty to keep expert and beginner gardeners amused. Outside, the borders are vibrant and the whole site has a quiet and",
          "only 3.50 to enter and we found all of it very well kept inside and out,Lovely hot house some very interesting plants to view and an extroadinary beds outside of plants used for different medicinal remedies..beautiful kept ponds..well worth the visit.",

          "My friend & I had a day in Oxford,she is a keen gardener so really wanted to visit the Botanic Garden.Definitely the right time of year to visit as most plants were in bloom.Enjoyed the greenhouse exhibits,the insect eating plants were interesting & the giant lilly pad in one of",
          "I must admit that we are not gardeners but that said we had the most amazing time looking a the various plants and garden displays on show. Extremely interesting for all non gardeners like us, but for the garden enthusiasts an excellent place to visit",
          "The Oxford Botanic Garden is spacious, beautiful, and peaceful. It is situated across from Magdalen College in between the river and the Merton gardens. Cost is minimal and free for members of the university. The gardens themselves were more beautiful (for me, the nonexpert)",
          "We enjoyed looking at the tropical section and the cactus room. Overall I was expecting it to be bigger than this. This is to compare with the Botanic garden in Cambridge.",
          "The Oxford's botanic garden has hundreds of years of history as a plant collection and there is an enormous variety of plants to see. The outdoor areas are beautiful and well maintained, with plants well labelled as you'd expect. It was a bit damp and chilly when we went so we",
          "Beautiful place it was a pity we went before the plants were in bloom, as I am sure it would have been spectacular",
          "This is one of our favourite places to go when in Oxford. There is always something of interesting to see in the garden, Even in winter it is worth a visit, especially the greenhouses. On our last visit in May there were lots on plants in flower in the green houses. The",
          "Spent an hour or so walking around this garden and glasshouses on a beautiful day in Oxford recently. Lovely position down by the river and would have been peaceful if there weren't about four lawn mowers being used at the same time!",
          "Very attractive bedding and greenhouses. Would be lovely to visit in later Spring when more plants are in flower. Next to the river so there's a lot of bird life in and around the gardens.",

          "Good place to bring child",
          "An interesting and well kept oasis near to the centre of Oxford. Decent welcome and the size of the site meant it was easy to use. Access by public transport was easy - not sure about private cars. Worth a look if you have an hour or two to spare.",

          "Much smaller than anticipated but very well kept",
          "I liked it, but it's kind of tiny. Also, it was hard for me, as a biologist, to fully cherish the visit, as at least half of the plants weren't signed. Plant recognising apps work well, but why should I use them in the botanical garden? \u2026",

          "Great if you are an amatuer botanist and want to see an amazing selection of flowers and plants but it's quite expensive for entry and Christ Church Commons is free and right round the corner so I wouldn't recommend it unless you love botanical gardens.

          "Absolutely stunning!  Go if you can",
          "Lovely green spot to sit in sunny weather. Great fun even if you're not much of a botanist. Plus there are loads of tourist punters crashing into the banks of the Thames just downriver so you can sit and have a laugh at that",

        "wiki": "The Radcliffe Camera (Camera, meaning \"room\" in Latin; colloquially, \"Rad Cam\" or \"The Camera\") is a building of Oxford University, England, designed by James Gibbs in neo-classical style and built in 1737\u201349 to house the Radcliffe Science Library. It is sited to the south of the Old Bodleian, north of the Church of St Mary the Virgin,\nand between Brasenose College to the west and All Souls College to the east. The Radcliffe Camera's striking circularity, its position in the heart of Oxford, and its separation from other buildings make it the focal point of the University of Oxford, and as such it is almost always included in shorthand visual representations of the university.  \nThe library's construction and maintenance was funded from the estate of John Radcliffe, a notable doctor, who left \u00a340,000 upon his death in 1714. According to the terms of his will, construction only began in 1737, although the intervening period saw the complex purchase of the site. The exterior was complete in 1747 and the interior finished by 1748, although the library's opening was delayed until 13 April 1749.\nUpon its completion, Francis Wise was appointed as its first librarian. Until 1810, the library housed books covering a wide range of subjects, but under George Williams it narrowed its focus to the sciences. Williams brought the library from a state of neglect up to date, although by 1850 the Radcliffe Library still lagged behind the Bodleian. It was at this point that Henry Wentworth Acland, then librarian, laid out plans for the Radcliffe Library building to merge with the university and the library's collection of books to be moved to the newly constructed Radcliffe Science Library, which were accepted by the library's trustees and the university. It was at this point that the building became known as the Radcliffe Camera, serving as a reading room for the Bodleian. Some visitors and tourists erroneously believe the Radcliffe Camera houses the Bodleian's collection of rare books; however, a large collection of rare and antiquarian books are contained in the nearby Weston Library and there are in excess of 1 million searchable records online for books, journals, magazines, newspapers, maps, ephemera, and music printed before 1900 covering antiquarian collections held in almost 60 libraries in Oxford.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nJohn Radcliffe (c.1650\u20131714) attended University College from the age of thirteen, becoming a fellow of Lincoln College at eighteen. He had a successful career in medicine, serving a number of high-profile, wealthy patients including William III and Queen Anne. He built up a large fortune and died childless. He is buried in St. Mary's Church, Oxford.It was known that he intended to build a library in Oxford at least two years before his death in 1714. It was thought that the new building would be an extension westwards of the Selden End of the Bodleian Library. Francis Atterbury, Dean of Christ Church, writing in December 1712 describes plans for a 90 ft room on the site of neighbouring Exeter College, and that the lower storey would be a library for Exeter College and the upper story Radcliffe's Library.Radcliffe also dedicated \u00a3100 a year to furnishing his proposed library with books. Plans were prepared by Nicholas Hawksmoor and are now held in the Ashmolean Museum. By 1714, however, Radcliffe had settled on a different site for his new library, to the south of the existing Bodleian. William Pittis, Radcliffe's first biographer, ascribes the change of heart to excessive demands from the Rector and Fellows of Exeter College.\n\n\n=== Plans ===\nRadcliffe died on 1 November 1714. His will, proved on 8 December, provided for the building of a new library on the new site, stating:\n\nAnd will that my executors pay forty thousand pounds in the terme of ten years, by yearly payments of four thousand pounds, the first payment thereof to begin and be made after the decease of my said two sisters for the building a library in Oxford and the purchaseing the houses  between St Maries and the scholes in Catstreet where I intend the Library to be built, and when the said Library is built I give one hundred and fifty pounds per annum for ever to the Library Keeper thereof for the time being and one hundred pounds a year per annum for ever for buying books for the same Library.\nIt also provided \u00a3100 a year to maintain the new library, but only once 30 years had elapsed from his death. The library-keeper was to be chosen by several influential figures: the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, the Chancellor of the University of Oxford, the Bishop of London and the Bishop of Winchester, the Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary, the Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench and the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and the Master of the Rolls. The first payment was to be made after the death of Radcliffe's two sisters, Hannah Redshaw and Millicent Radcliffe. The latter lived until 1736, although it appears between the death of Redshaw in 1716 and Millicent Radcliffe in 1736, much preparatory work was done acquiring the site for the library.A number of tenement houses fronting Catte Street, built right up to the Schools, some gardens, Brasenose College outbuildings and Black Hall occupied the site required for the library. A number of colleges became involved in the development of the site. An added problem was that Brasenose required an equal amount of land fronting High Street in return for the land they were being asked to give up. As a consequence, the Trustees had to negotiate with the owners and the tenants of the houses. An Act of Parliament was passed in 1720 that enabled any corporations within the University to sell ground for building a library. The negotiations dealing with Catte Street took over twenty years, with the final payments being made to Oriel, Magdalen and University Colleges in 1737 (N.S.).Radcliffe had placed four men in charge of his estate: William Bromley, sometime Speaker of the House of Commons; Sir George Beaumont, a Lord of the Admiralty; Antony Keck, a banker; and Thomas Sclater Bacon, a lawyer. There appears to have been some difficulty in getting the required majority to agree to work beginning before 1736, with the four split between Bromley and Beaumont wanting to start and Bacon and Keck set against them. Accordingly, Bromley made plans for work to start not long after 1720, but they were never fulfilled. The early start was to be funded by the high share price of investments in the South Sea Company, which proved overly optimistic.It was therefore in 1720 that the choice of architect was first considered \u2013 Christopher Wren, John Vanbrugh, Thomas Archer, James Thornhill, John James, Nicholas Hawksmoor, and James Gibbs were all considered. By the time the Trustees began to consider the building project, however, their choice had been restricted: Wren had died in 1723, Vanbrugh in 1724, and Thornhill in 1734. In 1734 Hawksmoor and Gibbs were invited to submit plans. A model, believed to be to Hawksmoor's specification, was made in 1734 and presented to the University in 1913. The model was well-received and it appears to have only been Hawksmoor's death in 1736 that led the Trustees to appoint Gibbs as architect to the project. Gibbs was given a salary of \u00a3100 per annum \"for directing and supervising the building of the Radcliffe Library and drawing all plans that shall be necessary for completing that work and corresponding with the builders, and going down four times in every year to see the building\".On 4 March 1737, the Trustees directed Gibbs along with Francis Smith of Warwick and William Townesend of Oxford 'to prepare Stones and things ready for building the library'. An early set of plans were engraved and prints delivered to the most important members of the town and University, no doubt to ensure that their opposition was dealt with swiftly. The University in particular seems to have influenced the Trustees' plan, although the Library would not form part of it. A second set were made a year later. A third set of prints, representing the final plans, were reprinted by Gibbs in his Bibliotheca Radcliviana of 1747.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nOn 17 May 1737, the foundation stone was laid. Four days before, the Trustees had decided on an inscription for it to bear on a copper plate. The whereabouts of neither the stone nor the plate are known, although it is believed that the copper plate adorned a section of the wall that was removed to create the doorway in 1863.

An extract states:Mr. William Townsend of Oxford, and Mr. William Smith of Warwick, were employed to be masons; Mr. John Philipps to be the carpenter and joiner; Mr. George Devall to be plumber; Mr. Townsend junior to be stone carver; Mr. Linel of Long-acre, London, to be carver in wood; Mr. Artari, an Italian, to be their plaisterer in the fret work way; Mr. Michael Rysbrack to be sculptor, to cut the Doctor's figure in marble; and Mr. Blockley to be locksmith.\nFrancis Smith, the father of William, was chosen as one of the masons, but died in 1738 and was succeeded by his son near the beginning of building. In 1739, John Townesend also succeeded his father on the latter's death. The Clerk of Works for most of the construction was Thomas Jersey, who was paid \u00a340 per annum. He was replaced in 1745 by George Shakespeare and shortly thereafter William Robinson. The construction went smoothly until February 1741, save for a short interruption in the latter part of 1740 when the threat of smallpox halted construction. It was in February 1741 that there appears to have been either a misunderstanding or a change of plan concerning what the dome was to be constructed out of. It had been partially completed out of stone, to the value of over \u00a3700 of stonework completed or prepared, when all work was immediately halted. The Trustees threatened to take the matter to the Court of Chancery if Townesend and Smith pursued their claim for \u00a3700 to cover the stonemasons' bills; the Trustees did not make good this threat and they eventually paid the bill. Part of the stone dome was removed and the dome recovered in timber and lead. 41 tonnes of Derbyshire lead was used on the roof. The incident took over a year to completely resolve. The dome had been completed by March 1743. In 1742 or 1743, when the exterior scaffolding was being removed (only work on the cupola and balustrade remained) two men were killed in an accident. The Trustees approved the payment of \u00a320 to be held on trust for the family of one of the dead men and inquired after the circumstances of the accident and the men injured.\n\nThe interior work began once the main structure was complete. John Phillips was employed as a carpenter for the Library's floors, windows and bookcases. Joseph Artari was chosen to be the project's plasterer, employing Charles Stanley and Thomas Toberts alongside him. In March 1745, the Trustees intervened to help ensure no work was proceeding by candlelight as the Library neared completion. A portrait of Radcliffe was sent to John Michael Rysbrack, who was tasked with creating a six-feet tall marble statue of the Library's benefactor. It was installed by Townesend and Smith. The responsibility for the ironwork for the gates for the seven exterior arches of the library was given to Robert Bakewell of Derby. His original estimate proved too low, however, explained by Gibbs to be a result of the French war. It eventually cost \u00a3364. The Trustee's meeting of 13 March 1746 reveals that the remaining work consisted of the paving of the library inside and out, the staircase rail, and the locks, hinges and bolts for the bookcases.The exterior of the building was complete by 1747 and the building fully completed in 1748. A librarian was appointed, as was a porter. Before Radcliffe's death, the sub-librarian of the Bodleian, Thomas Hearne, was widely considered to have been Radcliffe's choice as his new librarian. He was not appointed, however, and the post remained unfilled. In 1737, another sub-librarian, Francis Wise, reached out to several influential figures (including the Duke of Newcastle) to assist him in securing the position. However, by 1741 he had grown deeply weary of the level of competition he faced, particularly from a Richard Green, Radcliffe's great-nephew. The position did not go to Green, however: Wise was appointed to the position by a majority of one in 1748. The first porter was Pudsey Mussendine, who was paid a salary of \u00a320 per annum, and received a gown in Radcliffe's colours and with his coat of arms emblazoned on it. The opening ceremony was delayed by around a year because of disturbances in Oxford. It finally took place on 13 April 1749.Work on the exterior continued after the opening of the Library. In 1750, part of the land between the Camera and St. Mary's Church was remodelled to remove a dividing wall, level the ground and lay pebbles on it. This cost a total of \u00a3158. 17s, of which \u00a3100 came from the Trust and the rest from the University. The Old Convocation house was repaired in 1759 at the cost of \u00a3144. In 1751, the Trustees also agreed to the construction of twenty obelisks to hold gas lamps, which the University agreed to maintain. Only 14 were actually erected and in 1755 the Trustees reimbursed the University for the cost of maintaining them up to that point and took on the obligation itself out of the \u00a3100 per annum left by Radcliffe for the Library's upkeep. In 1758\u20139, for example, they were lit on 89 nights at a cost of \u00a323. 6s. 1d.\n\n\n=== History as an independent library ===\n\nThe library's collection grew only slowly. The first book to be placed in the library was identified by one contemporary account as Thomas Carte's A General History of England. The first donation was some 50,000 pamphlets from a Mr Bartholomew of University College, subsequently gifted to the Bodleian in 1794. The first major purchase was books to the value of \u00a345 from a seller in Newport in 1751, although they were kept in private possession until 1755. In 1754, the Library received a number of books from the estate of James Gibbs, mostly concerning architecture. A number of classical and history books by the bequest of Richard Frewin, Camden Professor of Ancient History, and law books of Charles Viner, the founder of the Vinerian Professorship of Common Law, were also added to the Library. Early purchases also included the purchase of the manuscripts of James Fraser to the value of \u00a3500, and those of George Sale for \u00a3157 10s., both concerned with the Middle East \u2013 the first on the advice of Thomas Hunt, Laudian Professor of Arabic. The texts appear to have suffered from poor care after their acquisition. Three further collections were purchased before Wise's death in 1767. Even at this early stage, the Trustees appear to have collaborated with the Bodleian to avoid duplication. The Library quickly became known as 'the Physic Library'. Despite its name, its acquisitions were varied for the first sixty years, but from 1811 its intake was confined to works of a scientific nature. During the first half of the 19th century the collections included coins, marbles, candelabra, busts, plaster casts, and statues. These collections have since been moved to more specifically appropriate sites.A muniment room was created in 1753 to house the collection documents relating to Radcliffe's will and the accumulated deeds of the land on which the Library had been built. Despite regular inspections, in 1817, a number of deeds were found to have degraded completely. Although the Trustees did not believe that the particular documents lost were likely to cause many future problems, the remaining manuscripts were moved to the main Library to prevent further damage. In other respects, Wise's tenure was marked only by his poor (and worsening) health and poor relations with the University. University members expected to be admitted and the Vice-Chancellor made it clear to Wise that he believed the Library part of the University and thus under his overall control. Wise did not agree, threatening at one point to padlock the Library and refer any man who cut it to the courts. The Vice-Chancellor took this as an unprovoked insult and turned to consideration of the University statutes and the imposition, if they did not already exist, of such statutes as would compel the ageing Wise to attend to his duties from which he was now regularly absent. Five years before his actual death in 1767, a satirical death notice was placed in the London papers announcing the \"greatly regretted\" death of Wise \"[his death] occasioned by a violent cold, contracted by too close attendance on the duties of his respective offices\". In those last years, Wise was so ill that he could no longer attend the Library. Upon his death, his collection of coins was presented to the Library.He was replaced by Benjamin Kennicott who served as librarian until his death in 1783. His librarianship saw the purchase of more Arabic, Hebrew and Persian works, the subject of study of Kennicott. Despite several reparative measures, the building continued to fall into disrepair, with Kennicott immersed in his academic study. Comments at the time of his death noted that the collection was \"so far from being 'one of the first collections in the Universe,' that it is even inconsiderable and invaluable when compared, not only with the Bodley collection, but perhaps others in Oxford.\" Kennicott's successor, Thomas Hornsby, did nothing to improve the situation, devoting much of time to his other post of Radcliffe Observer. There are no records of any books being bought before his death in 1810. There was, however, one controversial benefaction of a series of marbles, with a custodian appointed and funded (along with the cost of securing the statues) by Sir Roger Newdigate. It was eventually accepted, although not without opposition from Hornsby who believed it would distract from the Library's academic purpose and block readers' light. Upon Newdigate's death, the statues had not been purchased and his executors added to the opposition. The benefaction was reassessed and finally rejected. In the last years of his tenure, Hornsby was asked to provide a catalogue, but no such document was put together before his death.Hornsby's successor was chosen as George Williams. It was under his tenure that \"a new era dawned\" for the Radcliffe Library. Williams, a physician in the Radcliffe Infirmary and Professor of Botany, adopted an approach which had been mooted a couple of years before to fill the Library's shelves not with a general collection of works, but rather specifically scientific books. Huge sums were spent from funds which had accumulated from previous years: \u00a32000 in 1814, and around \u00a3500 annually for the years after. Dr. Abraham Robertson was asked to donate a copy of the Radcliffe Observatory's records each year in exchange for being allowed to borrow certain books. In 1814, the Library hosted a banquet for the visiting Prince Regent. The Library also received a number of marble busts and a collection of 1,000 marble specimens. The grounds of the Library were enclosed by railings in 1827 at a cost of \u00a31,310, although the ascertainment of the exact extent of the Trustee's holdings required careful examination and a previous overlooked transfer completed. Upon Williams' death in 1834, the Trustees gave an unprecedented statement of thanks; it was echoed by a report in The Gentleman's Magazine which read: \"In carrying into effect these great national as well as academic purposes, the Trustees found in Dr. Williams's extensive reading, retentive memory... exact judgment, comprehensive views and philosophical mind, the very talents and accomplishments which were necessary to ensure the successful execution of their design\".Williams was succeeded by John Kidd, Regius Professor of Medicine. Gas heating and lighting was introduced into the Library, a third member of staff (an assistant) hired at a salary of \u00a325 per annum, and insurance taken out against the risk of fire \u2013 \u00a310,000 to cover the buildings and a further \u00a310,000 for the books. In 1835, the Library catalogue was finally published, for which Kidd received \u00a3100 by way of bonus. He was, however, unsuccessful in three attempts to secure a pay rise. The book collection continued to expand, with Kidd required to provide a memorandum of books added each year to the Library, and the first proper bookcases installed. A visitors' book was created to distinguish students and academics from \"those who visit the Library from mere motives of general curiosity\". In other respects Library life was unremarkable for the rest of Kidd's tenure, which ended with his death in 1851.Henry Wentworth Acland succeeded Kidd as Librarian. He made several structural alterations, creating a reading room, improving the lighting and heating and adding a hot water system. More significantly, in light of the sum of \u00a3200 to be spent on books annually, which Acland considered insufficient, he set out a detailed proposal to bring the Library under the leadership of the University. In 1856, he laid out his plan to the Trustees, at which point the Library contained between 14,000 and 15,000 volumes: \"[I fear] the Library be found wanting in some standard work of reference [or] the ordinary Scientific Literature... [while] it is supposed by visitors... that the great collection of scientific works in Oxford is to be found in the Radcliffe Library... the Bodleian Library is far richer in scientific transactions and periodicals; it receives, or ought to receive, without cost all British books... the Radcliffe Library must be accounted to be, and will remain, of much less public utility than is generally supposed.\" The Radcliffe Library building was to become a reading room of the Bodleian, and the collection transferred to the new 'Museum Library' being constructed (now the Radcliffe Science Library). The plan was accepted by both parties and on 23 October 1861 the keys to the Radcliffe Library building were handed to Bodley's Librarian. It took four more years to finalise everything. The Radcliffe Library building thus became the Radcliffe Camera as the Library ceased to be fully independent. The Trustees retained the freehold to the building, which was finally transferred to the University in 1927.\n\n\n=== Later history as part of the University ===\nBetween 1909 and 1912 an underground book store of two floors was constructed beneath the north lawn of the library with a tunnel connecting it with the Bodleian, invisibly linking the two library buildings, something envisaged by Henry Acland in 1861. It was known as the \"Radder\" in 1930s slang but was later referred to as \"the Radcliffe Link\" or \"the Link\". This was refurbished as reading rooms, completed in 2011, and is now known as the \"Gladstone Link\".After the Radcliffe Science Library moved into another building, the Radcliffe Camera became home to additional reading rooms of the Bodleian Library. The interior of the upper reading-room houses a six-foot marble statue of John Radcliffe, carved by John Michael Rysbrack. It now holds books from the English, history, and theology collections, mostly secondary sources found on Undergraduate and Graduate reading lists. There is space for around 600,000 books in rooms beneath Radcliffe Square.\nIn November 2010, the Radcliffe Camera was occupied by students for over twenty-four hours, as part of wider national protest against proposed changes to university funding and substantial increases in the cost of tuition.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe building is the earliest example in England of a circular library. It is built in three main stages externally and two stories internally, the upper one containing a gallery. The ground stage is heavily rusticated and has a series of eight pedimented projections alternating with niches. The central stage is divided into bays by coupled Corinthian columns supporting the continuous entablature. The pedimented windows stand above mezzanine openings, reflecting the interior arrangement. The top stage is a lanterned dome on an octagonal drum, with a balustraded parapet with vases.\nThe construction used local stone from Headington and Burford, which was then ashlar faced. The dome and cupola are covered with lead. Inside, the original walls and dome were distempered but this was later removed, revealing the decorations to be carved in stone. Only the decorative work of the dome is plaster.Originally, the basement was an open arched arcade with a vaulted stone ceiling, with Radcliffe's coat of arms in the centre. The arcade arches were fitted with iron grilles: three of them were gates which were closed at night, and which gave access to the library by a grand staircase. In 1863, when the building had become a reading-room of the Bodleian, the arches were glazed, a new entrance was created on the north side in place of a circular window, with stone steps leading up to the entrance.\n\nThe area around the Library was originally partly paved, partly cobbled, and partly gravelled. In 1751 stone posts and obelisks surmounted by lamps were placed around the perimeter. All but the three at the entrance to Brasenose Lane were removed around 1827 when the lawns were laid and iron railings installed.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe 1744 work The Present State of the Universities by Thomas Salmon described the new Radcliffe library as \"the most magnificent Structure in Oxford... I find a great many People of Opinion that he intended to perpetuate his Memory by it, and therefore give it the name of 'Radcliffe's Mausoleum'\". This was echoed by The Gentleman and the Lady's Pocket Companion for Oxford (1747) which said that \"the most magnificent structure in Oxford is the new public Library\". In 1773, however, Edward Tatham was not so complimentary: \"The writer... cannot help expressing his disapprobation of the situation of the Radclivian Library. Whatever merit this edifice reflects on the architect, and splendor on the University, it certainly destroys the regularity of the area, and intercepts the view of every building in it.\" He regarded the north side of Broad Street, south of the gardens of Trinity College, to have been a more suitable site and the chosen site left largely open \"as we pronounce in general that the areas in a town should be free, open, and without obstruction\". Gibbs later said of the Trustees \"I never observed a trust discharged with greater unanimity, integrity and candor, during the whole time I had the honour of serving you, from the laying of the first stone of this fabric to its finishing.\" Contemporaries found great irony in the fact that the iconoclast Radcliffe, who scorned book-learning, should bequeath a substantial sum for the founding of the Radcliffe Library. Sir Samuel Garth quipped that the endowment was \"about as logical as if a eunuch should found a seraglio\".\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nJ. R. R. Tolkien, author of The Lord of the Rings, remarked that the building resembled Sauron's temple to Morgoth on N\u00famenor. It is also mentioned in The Notion Club Papers.\nDorothy Sayers' 1936 mystery novel Gaudy Night is set in Oxford, and one of the most important concluding conversations between Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane takes place on the balustraded circular rooftop of the Radcliffe Camera. (Chapter XXIII, Gaudy Night)\nElizabeth Kostova's novel The Historian includes a very intense scene set in the interior of the Radcliffe Camera.\nThe Camera was used as a location in the films Young Sherlock Holmes (1985), Opium Wars (Yapian zhanzheng) (1997), The Saint (1997), and The Red Violin (1998).\nThe structure is seen in the 2008 film The Golden Compass. It is also mentioned in Lyra's Oxford, a book in the universe of His Dark Materials.\nThe building is also seen in the Inspector Morse, Inspector Lewis and Endeavour television series, set in Oxford.\nThe games Civilization IV and Civilization Revolution include the Radcliffe Camera as a representation of Oxford University, which can be built in each game.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nRadcliffe Infirmary\nRadcliffe Observatory\nRadcliffe Science Library\nRadcliffe Quadrangle\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nSalter, H.

          "No trip around Oxford would be complete without visiting this exquisite building! The Camera is an extension of the Boldeian, with a tunnel connecting the two. A guide on our visit said it\u2019s ironic that it\u2019s the most photographed building in the whole of Oxford, yet",
          "The building is right across from the church. It appears to be very unusual as it is round. There were students studying inside and the guide said it was part of the library.",
          "There is so much history in this magnificent building, not least its shape, name & history. It was built in the mid 18th Century as a science library. Don't miss it.",
          "Such grandeur and such history oozes out of every brick of this marvelous structure! Felt like starting at it got hours together!",
          "This still-used building certainly stands out as you walk up to it. Quite stunning, actually. And interesting to learn about how it is used. Not to be missed, but not that much time needed here since there are so many other unique sights to see in Oxford.",
          "This building is fascinating. It's shape and explanation of the name are interesting and it is worth getting a pass to go inside this working library. It has a genuine feel and has been modernised without encroaching on its original feel.",
          "What a stunning building! It's a shame we weren't allowed inside but we did get lots of photos. The gardens were pretty too.",
          "What a fascinating place. From the square you certainly understand why Oxford is the city with dreaming spires. The road is cobbles though so a bit uneven and awkward to walk on.",
          "Lovely buildning and iconic to Oxford but it's crowded with lots of tourists. Better snap that photo and move somewhere else, although Oxford is generally quite crowded with tourists.",
          "You can't enter if you're not a student but it's still the most iconic building in the city. Get some photos around during daylight!",
          "As there were a lot of foreign tourist groups we did not stay long. We enjoyed a coffee in the square at the local church and watched the world (literally!) go by. The whole area of the square is full of interesting buildings.",
          "Iconic building in the centre of Oxford, with a lot of history. Nice spot to sit and have lunch or simply wander around.",
          "This is an Iconic Building that can be seen from many parts of the city, truly amazing. It has to be a must visit even only for a photo, if in Oxford",
          "Its really a beautiful building in this serene and beautiful campus of Oxford University. I didnt get to go inside though",
          "This is an incredibly beautiful building, in keeping with the rest of Oxford. Unfortunately you can\u2019t go inside (as far as I\u2019m aware) but is a must for lovely photos. The view of Radcliffe Camera from the University Church is a must!",
          "Such a beautiful building! It\u2019s really great for photography with access all the way around. The surrounding area is also lovely and can be incorporated into shots",
          "By far my fave builduing in oxford! lovely to walk around on a summers day. Nice cafe in the church too.",
          "No visit to Oxford is worth is weight in salt unless you have seen the magnificent structure of The Radcliffe Camera. Designed by James Gibbs in neo-classical style and built in 1737\u201349 to house the Radcliffe Science Library. It is sited to the south of the Old Bodleian.",
          "Feels like Rome... Full of tourists, profound selection of restaurants. Lots of ancestral buildings.",
          "The only way to see the interior of this beautiful building is to book yourself on a guided tour and it is worth every penny. This is such an iconic building in Oxford and the interior needs to be seen to appreciate its beauty. Particularly interesting when you see it when",
          "A landmark of the Oxford city and University of Oxford. The building is beautiful, would love to visit inside if allowed next time.",
          "Beautiful to see from the outside, and we also got to enter it as part of the upstairs downstairs tour with the Bodleian Library which was great (separate review). Probably the Trevi Fountain of Oxford - it's so iconic and if you are walking around town on multiple days you will",
          "A must to see & do in oxford. Right in the heart of Oxford. Brillian views but a high climb so be prepared.",
          "As one of the all time trade marks of Oxford, Radcliffe camera as well as the Radcliffe square does not disappoint. Sights are absolutely beautiful, you might see the Oxford students walking around in their gowns (quite Potter-esque) and if you're in Oxford a selfie with the",
          "Situated centrally in scenic Redcliffe Square nearby St.Mary. Built in 1749 for the books given to the Univercity by John Redcliffe. Now is the principal reading room of the Boldeian Library. One of the most memorable Oxford buildings which worth definitely your visit.",
          "A beautiful building a must see, as with the buildings surrounding oxford town centre, so much history and so much to learn",
          "We had a walk around the Bodleian Library complex and the Radcliffe Camera at the weekend during a day trip to Oxford. It's a wonderful piece of architecture and an iconic piece of Oxford. It's worth a look and the obligatory selfie :-)",
          "I visited here during the summer and was floored by how beautiful this building is. And the fact that it is a working part of the university and library is amazing",
          "What a sight this reading room is, we walked past it maybe a dozen times, it is just absolutely gorgeous!",
          "This spectacular building is really worth visiting only from outside and it is a library and there is no admission to the public.",
          "Amazing architecture. It's actually a history library inside - not a huge building, but apparently it extends outwards a long way underground, to increase its storage space. You'll recognise it from Inspector Morse films - you can't go to Oxford and not see it!",
          "This is a unique building and landmark in Oxford. I remember the first time I saw it it took my breath away. As part of the Bodleian Library, it is not open to the public but can be admired at leisure from outside if the weather allows! It sits in the middle of Radcliffe Square,",
          "Closed to the public but worth visiting to see the outside. Stunning history library. Despite entry inside the library being off-limits to most visitors you can wonder in through the gates and right around the base of the building which does allow some different photo's. Lots of",

          "This is one of Oxford's most iconic buildings situated in the cobbled Radcliffe Square opposite the University Church of Saint Mary the Virgin. It is a library building (Bodleian) of Oxford University. Saturday 24th March and we walked from High Street down Catte and into",
          "A very nice square, which you will definitely come across if you are in Oxford. And if you do not come across it, you have not explored the university grounds thoroughly.",
          "This is a beautiful building to walk around and take some pictures of. Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t get in, as it was closed to the public.",
          "We just walked past the RadcliffeCamera - we did not go inside. It is something you see in the British TV shows set in Oxford, so it was fun to see it.",
          "I was visiting Oxford as part of a group day trip from London and this was the last attraction we visited before heading for the pub. Last but definitely not least. This is an iconic place in Oxford, a beautiful and elegant building kind of hidden away. A very beautiful",
          "Very nice , worth having a look and taking some photos , you can\u2019t go inside unless you are a member .",

          "Tucked away behind the High Street, this is a really unusual site, in the heart of one of the most historic areas of the city. Did appear possible to enter unfortunate, but this is a beautiful building.",
          "I wish I could've taken photos, the library is one of a kind a veritable gem, it's a privilege to have had a few hours to browse the collection. The history and brilliance of the minds veritably bounces off the walls-go! Totally recommend to any Oxford visitor.",
          "We couldn\u2019t go in here, hence the rating, but it is a fascinating building none the less. We had coffee at St Mary\u2019s Vaults, sat outside and just enjoyed looking at it. At night when it is lit up you can see students beavering away inside, and get glimpses of what it looks",
          "One of the landmarks of Oxford - a city of fine architecture. Stunning from outside and well known for the beautiful interioir. Unfortunately, tourist can't go inside. It's great to watch the beauty of the building while sipping your tea at the outdoor seating area of Vaults &",
          "Well known and pictured, the Radcliffe Camera is stunning. Part of the Bodleian Library, it houses mainly theological and historical books.",
          "If Classical music delights you then this is the place. The antiquated seating can be uncomfortable so bring a cushion for maximum enjoyment.",
          "It's a stunning building - definitely adds to the landscape of Oxford. Would have liked to see the inside, but unfortunately its not open to the public.",
          "I have visited this a couple of times as it is one of Oxford's best known land marks. The beautiful stone makes a lovely photo on a sunny day. It is remarkable to look at but unfortunately is not open to the general public and only students of Oxford University are allowed",
          "The camera houses the department of History library and, unlike the Bodleian it is not accessible by the general public. An iconic view of the city and good to visit even if you can only take a selfie outside. Inside the upper reading room is spectacular, so if you get a",

Unfortunately it does not allow tourists in and access is for members only however building exterior offers some nice photos. Why this building name contains \u2018Camera\u2019 remains a mystery",

          "This is a very impressive building the architecture is quite amazing, you simply have to come and see it. There always seems to be a lot of people sitting around here it is a natural meeting place. One big disappointment is that there no access to the building for the public, so",

          "The Radcliffe Camera lies next to the Bodleian Library complex and is now part of the library, housing the main reading room. Because it is a 'working library' open admission is not allowed but one can take a tour. The building itself is an architectural gem, built in",

          "The Radcliffe Camera is part of the Bodleian library -- inside it looks quite medieval and is always full of students working or revising for their exams, so I don\u00b4t think this is a particularly pleasant place to stay in while working. I really think it is more beautiful on the",

          "We saw this as part of a tour-fascinating to see inside one of the most recognisable Oxford buildings.",
          "Just wow. Beautiful place, where you can take so nice pictures. The only thing I dont like is, that you cant go in. Only if you are the student of Oxford. But really, one thing you must see in Oxford :)",

          "It's worth a visit if you're around, as it's surrounded by other touristy landmarks of the Oxford. However, I would not rank it in the top 3 destinations for Oxford but it would be such a shame to miss it as it's very close by destinations like Christ Church.",
          "one of the main attraction in this precinct of Oxford. Very popular with tours but worth the effort!",

          "Quite a picturesque building that's fairly easily accessibly although probably annoyingly for some you can't go inside. It's definitely worth the five or so minutes it will take to view and you may well walk past it on your way to something else.",
          "This striking building wasn't available to go inside and I'm not sure if it ever is. It's easy to find being located right in the city centre. Walk around it and take in this spectacular structure. There are numerous other equally interesting buildings nearby which can be seen",

        "wiki": "Christ Church (Latin: \u00c6des Christi, the temple or house, \u00e6d\u0113s, of Christ, and thus sometimes known as \"The House\") is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in England. Christ Church is a joint foundation of the college and the cathedral of the Oxford diocese (Christ Church Cathedral and its cathedral school), which serves as the college chapel and whose dean is ex officio the college head.Founded in 1546 by King Henry VIII, it is one of the larger colleges of the University of Oxford with 629 students in 2016. It is also the wealthiest college with an endowment of \u00a3577.6m as of 2019. Christ Church has a number of architecturally significant buildings including Tom Tower (designed by Sir Christopher Wren), Tom Quad (the largest quadrangle in Oxford), and the Great Dining Hall which was also the seat of the parliament assembled by King Charles I during the English Civil War. The buildings have inspired replicas throughout the world in addition to being featured in films such as Harry Potter and The Golden Compass. This has helped Christ Church become the most popular Oxford college for tourists with almost half a million visitors annually.Christ Church has many notable alumni including thirteen British prime ministers (more than any other Oxbridge college), King Edward VII, King William II of the Netherlands, seventeen Archbishops, writers Lewis Carroll (Alice in Wonderland) and W. H. Auden, philosopher John Locke, and scientist Robert Hooke. Christ Church is also partly responsible for the creation of University College Reading, which later gained its own Royal Charter and became the University of Reading. The first female undergraduates matriculated at Christ Church in 1980.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1525, at the height of his power, Thomas Wolsey, Lord Chancellor of England and Cardinal Archbishop of York, suppressed the Priory of St Frideswide in Oxford and founded Cardinal College on its lands, using funds from the dissolution of Wallingford Priory and other minor priories. He planned the establishment on a magnificent scale, but fell from grace in 1529, with the buildings only three-quarters complete, as they were to remain for 140 years.\nIn 1531 the college was itself suppressed, but it was refounded in 1532 as King Henry VIII's College by Henry VIII, to whom Wolsey's property had escheated. Then in 1546 the King, who had broken from the Church of Rome and acquired great wealth through the dissolution of the monasteries in England, refounded the college as Christ Church as part of the reorganisation of the Church of England, making the partially demolished priory church the cathedral of the recently created Diocese of Oxford.\nChrist Church's sister college in the University of Cambridge is Trinity College, Cambridge, founded the same year by Henry VIII.  Since the time of Queen Elizabeth I the college has also been associated with Westminster School. The dean remains to this day an ex officio member of the school's governing body.Major additions have been made to the buildings through the centuries, and Wolsey's Great Quadrangle was crowned with the famous gate-tower designed by Sir Christopher Wren. To this day the bell in the tower, Great Tom, is rung 101 times at 9 pm at the former Oxford time (9:05 pm GMT/BST) every night, for the 100 original scholars of the college (plus one added in 1664). In former times this was done at midnight, signalling the close of all college gates throughout Oxford. Since it took 20 minutes to ring the 101, Christ Church gates, unlike those of other colleges, did not close until 12:20. When the ringing was moved back to 9:00 pm, Christ Church gates still remained open until 12.20, 20 minutes later than any other college. Although the clock itself now shows GMT/BST, Christ Church still follows Oxford time in the timings of services in the cathedral.\nKing Charles I made the Deanery his palace and held his Parliament in the Great Hall during the English Civil War. In the evening of 29 May 1645, during the second siege of Oxford, a \"bullet of IX lb. weight\" shot from the Parliamentarians warning-piece at Marston fell against the wall of the north side of the Hall.Several of Christ Church's deans achieved high academic distinction, notably Owen under the Commonwealth, Aldrich and Fell in the Restoration period, Jackson and Gaisford in the early 19th century and Liddell in the high Victorian era.\nFor over four centuries Christ Church admitted men only; the first female students at Christ Church matriculated in 1980.\n\n\n== Organisation ==\nChrist Church, formally titled \"The Dean, Chapter and Students of the Cathedral Church of Christ in Oxford of the Foundation of King Henry the Eighth\", is the only academic institution in the world which is also a cathedral, the seat (cathedra) of the Bishop of Oxford. The Visitor of Christ Church is the reigning British sovereign (currently Queen Elizabeth II), and the Bishop of Oxford is unique among English bishops in not being the Visitor of his own cathedral.\nThe head of the college is the Dean of Christ Church, who is an Anglican cleric appointed by the crown as dean of the cathedral church. There are a senior and a junior censor (formally titled the Censor Moralis Philosophiae and the Censor Naturalis Philosophiae) the former of whom is responsible for academic matters, the latter for undergraduate discipline. A Censor Theologiae is also appointed to act as the dean's deputy; this post is currently held by Professor Ian Watson.\nThe form \"Christ Church College\" is considered incorrect, in part because it ignores the cathedral, an integral part of the unique dual foundation.\n\n\n=== Governing body ===\nThe governing body of Christ Church consists of the dean and chapter of the cathedral, together with the \"Students of Christ Church\", who are not junior members but rather the equivalent of the fellows of the other colleges. Until the later 19th century, the Students differed from fellows in that they had no governing powers in their own college, as those resided solely with the dean and chapter.\n\n\n== Buildings and grounds ==\n\nChrist Church sits in approximately 175 acres (71 hectares) of land. This includes the Christ Church Meadow (including Merton Field and Boathouse Island), which is open to the public all year round. In addition Christ Church own Aston's Eyot (purchased from All Souls College in 1891), Christ Church recreation ground (including the site of Liddell buildings), and School Field which has been leased to Madgalen College School since 1893. The meadow itself is inhabited by English Longhorn cattle. In October 1783 James Sadler made the first hot air balloon ascent in Britain from the meadow. The college gardens, quadrangles, and meadow are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.Christ Church has a number of architecturally significant buildings. These include:\nGrade I listed:\n\nChrist Church Library\nChrist Church Cathedral\nPeckwater Quadrangle\nThe Great Quadrangle or Tom Quad including:\nTom Tower\nGreat Hall\nMercury Fountain\nCanterbury Quadrangle\nChapter HouseGrade II* listed:\n\nBlue Boar Quadrangle\nChrist Church Picture GalleryOthers:\n\nThe Meadow Building (Grade II)\nThe Old Library\nThe Lee Building /. Anatomy School (Grade II)\nChrist Church Kitchen & Scullery (Grade II)\nOld Brew House (Grade II)\nLiddell Buildings\n\n\n=== Influences ===\nThe college buildings and grounds are the setting for parts of Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, as well as a small part of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. More recently it has been used in the filming of the movies of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series and also the film adaptation of Philip Pullman's novel Northern Lights (the film bearing the title of the American edition of the book, The Golden Compass). Distinctive features of the college's architecture have been used as models by a number of other academic institutions, including the NUI Galway, which reproduces Tom Quad. The University of Chicago, Cornell University, and Kneuterdijk Palace have reproductions of Christ Church's dining hall (in the forms of Hutchinson Hall, the dining hall of Risley Residential College, and the Gothic hall of Kneuterdijk Palace, respectively). ChristChurch Cathedral in New Zealand, after which the City of Christchurch is named, is itself named after Christ Church, Oxford. Stained glass windows in the cathedral and other buildings are by the Pre-Raphaelite William Morris group with designs by Edward Burne-Jones.\n\n\n== Cathedral choir ==\n\nChrist Church is unique in that it has both a cathedral choir and a college choir. The cathedral choir comprises twelve men and sixteen boys. The men are made up of lay clerks and choral scholars, or academical clerks. The boys, whose ages range from eight to thirteen, are chosen for their musical ability and attend Christ Church Cathedral School. Aside from the director, there is also a sub-organist and two organ scholars. The college choir, however, is always a student run society, and sings Evensong once a week in term time. In vacations the services are sung by the Cathedral Singers of Christ Church - a choir drawn from semi-professional singers in and around Oxford. The cathedral also hosts visiting choirs from time to time during vacations.\nThroughout its history, the cathedral choir has attracted many distinguished composers and organists - from its first director, John Taverner, appointed by Cardinal Wolsey in 1526, to William Walton. The present director of music (known as the organist), is Steven Grahl who succeeded Stephen Darlington in September 2018. In recent years, the choir have commissioned recorded works by contemporary composers such as John Tavener, William Mathias and Howard Goodall, also patron of Christ Church Music Society.\n\nThe choir, which broadcasts regularly, have many recordings to their credit and were the subject of a Channel 4 television documentary Howard Goodall's Great Dates (2002). The documentary was nominated at the Montreux TV Festival in the arts programme category - and has since been seen internationally. The choir's collaboration with Goodall has also led to their singing his TV themes for Mr. Bean and Vicar of Dibley. They appeared in Howard Goodall's Big Bangs, broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 in March 2000. Treasures of Christ Church (2011) is an example of the choir's recording and debuted as the highest new entry in the UK Specialist Classical chart. The disc featured on BBC Radio 3's In Tune on 26 September 2011 and on Radio 3's Breakfast Show on 27 September that year.\n\n\n== Picture gallery ==\n\nChrist Church holds one of the most important private collections of drawings in the UK, including works by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael and Michelangelo. The collection is composed of approximately 300 paintings and 2,000 drawings, a rotated selection of which are available to the public for viewing in the purpose-built Christ Church Picture Gallery. Many of the works were bequeathed by a former member of the college, General John Guise (1682/3-1765), enabling the creation of the first public art gallery in Britain.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\n\n=== College arms ===\nThe college arms are those of Cardinal Wolsey and were granted to him by the College of Arms on 4 August 1525. They are blazoned: Sable, on a cross engrailed argent, between four leopards' faces azure a lion passant gules; on a chief or between two Cornish choughs proper a rose gules barbed vert and seeded or. The arms are depicted beneath a red cardinal's galero with fifteen tassels on either side, and sometimes in front of two crossed croziers.\n\n\n=== Cathedral arms ===\nThere are also arms in use by the cathedral, which were confirmed in a visitation of 1574. They are emblazoned: \"Between quarterly, 1st & 4th, France modern (azure three fleurs-de-lys or), 2nd & 3rd, England (gules in pale three lions passant guardant or), on a cross argent an open Bible proper edged and bound with seven clasps or, inscribed with the words In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum and imperially crowned or.\"\n\n\n== Graces ==\nThe college preprandial grace reads:\n\nThe first part of the grace is read by a scholar or exhibitioner before formal hall each evening, ending with the words Per I\u0113sum Christum Dominum nostrum (\"Through Jesus Christ our Lord.\") The remainder of the grace, replacing Per I\u0113sum Christum etc., is usually only read on special occasions.\nThere is also a long postprandial grace intended for use after meals, but this is rarely used. When High Table rises (by which time the Hall is largely empty), the senior member on High Table simply says Benedict\u014d bened\u012bc\u0101tur (\"Let the Blessed One be blessed\", or \"Let a blessing be given by the Blessed One\"), instead of the college postprandial grace:\n\n(The Bible clerk reads from the Greek Testament.)\nOmnipotens et misericors Deus, qui donis Tuis nos exsatiasti, effice ut quicquid per nos fieri aut pr\u00e6termitti velis, diligenter observemus, mandata Tua universa prompto atque fideli obsequio obeuntes, per Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.Versicle: Domine, salvam fac Reginam.Response: Et exaudi nos, quando invocamus Te.Deus in cuius manu sunt corda regum; qui es humilium consolator, fidelium fortitudo, protector omnium in Te sperantium, da Regin\u00e6 nostr\u00e6 Elizabeth\u00e6 populoque Christiano ut Te Regem regum, et dominantium Dominum, agnoscant semper et venerentur, et post hanc vitam regni Tui \u00e6terni fiant participes ; per Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.Deus, a quo derivatur omnis munificentia et bonitas, debitas Tibi gratias agimus, quod felicis memori\u00e6 Regem Henricum eius nominis octavum, ad Ecclesiam hanc fundandam animaveris; et rogamus pro sancta Tua misericordia, ut cum nos hoc tanto beneficio adiuti, ad laudem Tui nominis profecerimus, una cum omnibus qui iam in Domino dormierunt, beatam resurrectionem, et \u00e6tern\u00e6 felicitatis pr\u00e6mia consequamur, per Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.\n\n\n== Student life ==\nAs well as rooms for accommodation, the buildings of Christ Church include the cathedral, one of the smallest in England, which also acts as the college chapel, a great hall, two libraries, two bars, and separate common rooms for dons, graduates and undergraduates. There are also gardens and a neighbouring sportsground and boat-house.\nAccommodation is usually provided for all undergraduates, and for some graduates, although some accommodation is off-site. Accommodation is generally spacious with most rooms equipped with sinks and fridges. Many undergraduate rooms comprise 'sets' of bedrooms and living areas. Members are generally expected to dine in hall, where there are two sittings every evening, one informal and one formal (where gowns must be worn and Latin grace is read). The buttery next to the Hall serves drinks around dinner time. There is also a college bar (known as the Undercroft), as well as a Junior Common Room (JCR) and a Graduate Common Room (GCR), equivalent to the Middle Common Room (MCR) in other colleges.\nThere is a college lending library which supplements the university libraries (many of which are non-lending). Law students have the additional facility of the college law library, which has received large financial supplements from Christ Church law graduates. Most undergraduate tutorials are carried out in the college, though for some specialist subjects undergraduates may be sent to tutors in other colleges.\nCroquet is played in the Masters' Garden in the summer. The sports ground is mainly used for netball, cricket, tennis, rugby and football and includes Christ Church cricket ground. In recent years the Christ Church Netball Club, which competes on the inter-college level in both mixed and women's matches, has become known as a popular and inclusive sport. Rowing and punting is carried out by the boat-house across Christ Church Meadow - the college is traditionally strong at rowing, having been Head of the River more times than any other. The college also owns its own punts which may be borrowed by students or dons.\nThe college beagle pack (Christ Church and Farley Hill Beagles), which was formerly one of several undergraduate packs in Oxford, is no longer formally connected with the college or the university, but continues to be staffed and followed by some Oxford undergraduates.\n\n\n== Christ Church references ==\n\"Midnight has come and the great Christ Church bell And many a lesser bell sound through the room; \nAnd it is All Souls' Night...\"\n\"The wind had dropped. There was even a glimpse of the moon riding behind the clouds. And now, a solemn and plangent token of Oxford's perpetuity, the first stroke of Great Tom sounded.\"\n\"I must say my thoughts wandered, but I kept turning the pages and watching the light fade, which in Peckwater, my dear, is quite an experience \u2013 as darkness falls the stone seems positively to decay under one's eyes. I was reminded of some of those leprous fa\u00e7ades in the vieux port at Marseille, until suddenly I was disturbed by such a bawling and caterwauling as you never heard, and there, down in the little piazza, I saw a mob of about twenty terrible young men, and do you know what they were chanting We want Blanche. We want Blanche! in a kind of litany.\"\n\"Those twins / Of learning that he [Wolsey] raised in you, Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him, \nUnwilling to outlive the good that did it; \nThe other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous, \nSo excellent in art, and still so rising, \nThat Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.\"\n\"By way of light entertainment, I should tell the Committee that it is well known that a match between an archer and a golfer can be fairly close. I spent many a happy evening in the centre of Peckwater Quadrangle at Christ Church, with a bow and arrow, trying to put an arrow over the Kilcannon building into the Mercury Pond in Tom Quad. On occasion, the golfer would win and, on occasion, I would win. Unfortunately, that had to stop when I put an arrow through the bowler hat of the head porter. Luckily, he was unhurt and bore me no ill will. From that time on he always sent me a Christmas card which was signed 'To Robin Hood from the Ancient Briton'\"\n\"There is one oddity; Rudge. Determined to try for Oxford, Christ Church of all places! Might get into Loughborough, in a bad year.\"\n\n\n== People associated with the college ==\n\n\n=== Deans ===\nCardinal College\n\n1525: John HygdonKing Henry VIII's College\n\n1532: John Hygdon\n1533: John OliverChrist Church\n\n\n=== Alumni ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nNotable former students of the college have included politicians, scientists, philosophers, entertainers and academics.

          "This is a great place to visit if you in Oxford, there is an impressive cathedral and student all around you. But if you like me like the Harry Potter movies this is where you will find the famous stares and also the great hall from the movies. The price of the ticket is \u00a315.",
          "Long queue as hall used for Harry Potter basis. \u00a315 too when other colleges are cheaper. Good shop. Love the hall and cathedral. Gladstone studied here which I liked. Lovely gardens too.",
          "My husband and I wished to pop in to light votive candles in the church- but not to have a complete tour. My husband is temporarily on crutches and the beadles could not have been more helpful, ushering us in through No Entry signs to avoid numerous steps. Very impressed with",
          "Entry to this college costs \u00a315 each. We decided to give it a go, but then was told the college would be closing in 30mins at 11:30am and wouldn't reopen until 2:30pm. We found most colleges in Oxford recommended to visit we're closed on Monday. It was term time. Oxford tourist",
          "We were being shown around several colleges in Oxford by our son who's doing a phd and is living there. Christ Church definitely worth a visit while you're in this lovely city. Amazing buildings with beautiful rooms that are breathing centuries of history. Many of these have",
          "We did the self-guided tour and it was well worth it. The building is incredible and well worth a look. We are not Harry Potter fans, but we still found it interesting. Certainly recommend that you put this on your itinerary.",
          "Yet another college you have to pay to wander the grounds but this one is well worth it, stunning on the inside and immaculate and well worth the wander around.",
          "Christ Church was the first Oxford college we visited and probably our favourite Beautiful grounds and stunning architecture",
          "\"The\" ideal way to visit Oxford is to sign up for a study program at this college. Wonderfully spartan student rooms, meals in Hall, drinks in The Buttery, and of course study (in our case \"Great Houses\" and \"Great Gardens\") travel to those various houses and gardens, meeting",
          "If you love history, architecture and/or movies this is a must see! The building and grounds are beautiful - so much history! The church itself is stunning. I could spend hours just looking. Something fun to do if you have kids (and even if not) they offer a search and find",
          "My husband and I enjoyed Evensong very much. We arrived at 5:45p.m. and went to the chapel. It was peaceful and people were very welcoming. We left when it was dark and saw the beauty of the quid. Very special.",
          "The ticket prices have recently changed and it is now pretty expensive if you just want to wander through the college (as some of the other colleges allow - free of charge). A real shame that there aren't different tickets to allow for different opportunities. We didn't want to",

          "Walking further along St Aldate\u2019s we arrive at Christ Church College, close to the city centre, the High Street, the Bodleian Library and other University departments. On the other side of the college is Christ Church Meadow with its peaceful river walks.",

          "An absolutely stunning visit. Beautiful atmosphere and gorgeous historic building. Definitely worth a visit if your in Oxford. A little pricey at \u00a315 for 1 adult and an extra \u00a32 to visit the gallery but the audible guide was great. Very packed as it was a Saturday so the queue",
          "We feel in love with Oxford, Christ Church and the libraries. It's a very wonderful experience to visit and to learn the history by using the audio aid. We admire students who are studying at Christ Church...it's like taking the time machine back to the past. Highly recommend",
          "this place has all the hype about harry porter shootings taking place. The ticket is pricy and i would not recommend spending money just to see one hall that was ever part of harry porter movies. The time i visited this place, there were exams going on, so we were not even",

          "Christ church is an amazing historic building that everyone needs to go see. Your tablet that you are given will give you a lot of information on the University up to 500-600 years ago. It is a great interactive experiance for the children too. You can choose between an adult",

          "An amazing place to visit, reflect and relax. The gardens are just precious. The artistic work is breath taking. And to top it attend the Evensong service.",
          "It only took me about 20 min to go through the tour, although the audio I was told is up to an hour. The main features are the dining hall that the movie Harry Potter was based on and some of the buildings. The ticket was 10 gbp I believe and it comes with an audio tour. Note",
          "This is a hidden gem ( literally, not easy to find) with a world class collection of mainly Italian Old Masters from the C14th to C18th. There are also sketches and drawings. Modest entry charge but free with an Art Fund Pass.",

          "Probably the college most set up to take guided tours around its famous college with full on audio and interactive tours available. However this does include numerous places along the way as well as giving an in-depth view of college life both in yesteryear and today. Well worth",

          "Really good audio tour. Amazing place to visit, can only imagine what it must be like to be at this College! We didn\u2019t book before turning up, bought our ticket/audio tour at the visitor centre (\u00a310 per person) and went straight in. The tour took us about an hour (there\u2019s about",
          "I was totally disappointed with the visit. For \u00a310 you don't get to see much, and it's very crowded which takes away from the experience. It's open very short, and in fact even shorter than the website states (so we were rushed through even though we had tickets bought in",
          "I am not inclined to write harsh reviews on this website but I do make an exception for this place which offers rude staff, long queues and poor value for money. I have visited three times and every time it is the same. As far as I can tell every other cathedral in the UK",
          "Tourist trap for Harry Potter fans - avoid and go to some of the smaller colleges to give you a better idea of college life. They all start looking the same after a while anyway. All have great halls and chapels and courtyards...",
          "We really picked the wrong day (first Sunday in October when the undergrads are welcomed) so the Hall was shut. The Quads and the Cathedral were open though and the audio guide was great. Well worth the admission price.",
          "We visited Christ Church College specifically to see the Harry Potter sites. The Dining Hall was so impressive as well as the stairs and cloisters. Must also see the Cathedral. Late afternoon we heard the organist practicing for Evensong. The handicap entrance at Tom Tower",
          "As an American visiting Oxford, getting an \u201cinside\u201d look at Oxford Colleges is quite the experience. This self-guided tour of the public buildings and its Cathedral is well done, with good signage and walking tour guide books in several languages. The Cathedral is spectacular,",
          "To all Harry Potter fans that want to see the famous dining hall... Go to New College instead of Christ Church. Both dining halls are very similar and Christ Church was an inspiration to the movie, the filming wasn't actually done there as it was too small for the film crew.",
          "Christ church was amazing, the stairs which was used in the Harry Potter movie, the main dining hall, with the walls covered in historical portrait art, was just a portion of everything else on offer, when you tour this colleague. So worth a visit",
          "Christ Church is the largest college in Oxford if your measure is the size of the buildings. It has a couple of quadrangles, the first of which made a member of our group gasp \u201cthis is what I came to see\u201d. The college also has a fine art gallery. I was very impressed to see",
          "Christ Church college is the largest and perhaps most impressive of the Oxford colleges! Definitely worth a hour of anyone time to wander round these stunning buildings",
          "There is a wealth of history to be seen and heard about. The tour is delivered by bowler-hatted and uniformed guides, who are very knowledgeable. However, get one with a loud voice as, in the buildings, there could be a lot of surrounding noise from other visitors/tours.",
          "I am part of the University of Oxford and often family ask me to take them around Oxford. Christ Church is always one of the colleges we visit as it is beutifully places in the centre of the city. Not only is it located in a great place but it has beutiful buildings and rooms to",
          "My review isn\u2019t solely about the college although that in itself would be a five star review. I stayed in Peck Quad, room 1:5 and I specifically asked for this room as it has a great deal of history attached to it. As to all the rooms in the college I suppose. This is the room",
          "You can happily spend a few hours here. We had a tour and then free time to wander, and were amazed at the history here. The picture gallery in particular held our interest and the stories of Charles Dodgson and Alice bought the place to life.",
          "For 10 pounds entrance, you get a day pass to visit the Christ Church college. IMO it's a great bargain. The buildings are magnificent, and there is the Hogwarts mess. Not to mention this was the birthplace of the story \"Alice in Wonderland\".",
          "I suppose if you're huge Harry Potter fan than you wouldn't mind paying \u00a310 for a walk through but for us it was little disappointing as few areas were also restricted and we were asked to pay extra to visit gallery! It's a beautiful place but there are many stunning cathedrals",
          "Very extensive college buildings and grounds with lots of history, including Alice in Wonderland connections. Beautiful gardens, great to visit.",
          "If you are on the hunt of Harry Potter film locations this is a must visit, although even if you are not into the films, the building is majestic, I would recommend finding a tour that includes tickets because there are many details that the local guides will point out and your",
          "I never went to university and don't feel like I have been deprived by this,however if I had a choice of college Christ Church would be the one. It is quite simply exquisite with layer upon layer of history and tradition.",
          "Interesting college to tour round. One of the more expensive college tours. A clear Mecca for Harry Potter fans so likely to be long queues. Also watch timings as the dining hall is often closed over lunchtime.",
          "We stayed at Christchurch College last weekend for a few days and we had a wonderful time. Right from the moment we arrived at the Porters Lodge we were made to feel very welcome. We were in the Meadows Building, right by the Masters Garden which we had all to ourselves on",
          "Iconic for a reason the college buildings are a sight to be seen. The grounds then run down to the river and open up the Oxford colleges in a way Cambridge has never dared to do.",
          "You can easily see the building and take a picture from outside. They hardly show you much inside the college and \u00a310 is not worth it",
          "The Christchurch tour allows you access to their great hall (which apparently inspired the Hogwarts great hall) and then through various quadrangles. It\u2019s a really pretty place with lovely architecture. I really enjoyed it - took about 30 minutes.",
          "This Is the most famous college of the university. Here we can recognize also location a of the Harry Potter movies. The iconic architecture and the world famous Oxonians paintings in the Great Hall. The visita Is worth the ticket",
          "Amazing architecture. Lots of areas you cannot visit due to various things such as exams. The cathedral was stunning but limited access. The Main Hall was very good. Worth a visit. Toilets inside but not very clean.",
          "Obviously the meadows are free and they are lovely my charge as a pensioner to see the church was \u00a39 which I thought was a bit steep this does include a visit to the dining hall which was closed when I was looking round the ticket is all day and I returned when the hall opened.",
          "I was very lucky to enjoy staying in Christ Church during the Summer - the college does B&B...where you can stay in one of the dorm rooms and enjoy a really nice tasty breakfast in the stunning location that is the Great Dining Hall - the inspo for Hogwarts dining hall. Walking",
          "Beautiful grounds but far too long of a line to wait in the go inside, however understandable due to it being a weekend day so expected it to be busy. All grounds very clean, no litter in sight.",
          "Visited Christchurch and was wowed by it's splendour. There was a small queue on the day we visited but the exterior and gardens leading to the entrance are so beautiful that a wait is a pleasure. The grounds and buildings are such historic places and it was wonderful to",
          "We went in to see the church and also see where some of the ideas for the Harry Potter movies originated from. The history of the church goes back a thousand years. The figures, stain glass and the great hall were amazing. People were buried here in the 600\u2019s! Amazing grounds",
          "Whatever else you do, get there early. Because the Hall was recreated in studio for the Harry Potter films, it is crowded all day. Arrive half an hour before opening and queue. The groups get in first but once you have your ticket you can overtake them and get to the hall",
          "I recently had the privilege of participating in a summer course called The Oxford Experience , at Christ Church College, the oldest college of the University of Oxford. The site dates back to a Saxon priory c.710 , which Cardinal Wolsey closed in 1524 and then founded",
          "What an experience to attend Evensong on a Sunday evening at Christ Church Cathedral. A beautiful architectural marvel, with full choir, made for a memorable evening in Oxford.",
          "My partner and I were looking forward to this visit and in terms of the premises, it was a great experience. My issue is about the lack of any obvious advice about stairs. As I am partially sighted and walk with a cane due to back and leg issues, I would have had real problems",
          "Very quick and simple visit. Nice to get a taste of real history with some Hollywood. If you are a Harry Potter fan you will get a real kick.",
          "If you want to see the idea to the meal moments and for the stairs of hogwarts...just go there it is amazing \ud83d\ude09",
          "We took advantage of at 6:05 pm Evensong service at Christ Church Cathedral and were moved by the venue and the music. This event is free.",
          "We had a walk around, though we could not access the Great Hall that inspired Hogwarts hall. So not much else to see, so we walked around twice with lots of \u2018no entry signs\u2019 and left saying \u201cit may be easier just to say where you can pass\u201d.",
          "We were on a day trip to Oxford and so lucky to have been able to experience the Sung Eucharist which is on a Thursday. Enjoyed the mass thoroughly as the choir sang. The church is beautiful with tainted glass inside and immaculate lawn outside. Real privilege.",
          "I was lucky enough to gain free entry to the college along with my friends as prospective students, however I must comment that the \u00a38 fee they charge is perhaps a bit steep (especially considering you can see the Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill for \u20ac12). The porter was",
          "Remember to book in advance to visit the dinning room. The gardens are quite big and beatiful. The dinning room is plenty of people so if you try to take a picture of you try hard! The stars are amazing. In my opinion of you are not a Harry Potter fan is not a place to visit",
          "Christ Church is worth visiting when you are in Oxford. The gardens are beautiful and so is the grand hall with the stairs leading towards it (which you might recognize from the Harry Potter films). It's 10 pounds per person, but in my opinion totally worth it.",
          "This is the first must-visit in Oxford. Stunning gardens outside the Christ Church and wonderful premises inside, a lot of halls and very delightful courtyards and internal gardens like all Oxford Colleges. It is the biggest college in Oxford !",
          "Well worth visiting this beautiful college that is steeped in history. My only criticism is the toilet facilities were cramped and dirty. Considering the number of tourists there, it wasn't ideal.",
          "Being one of the top attractions of Oxford, there can be enormous queues. When we arrived at 3pm on Sunday we decided to turn around and go back the next morning at opening. As such we beat the crowds; had we come 30mins later queues again were terrible. And to be honest: the",
          "Paid \u00a38.50 reduced entry fee as the church was closed. For this you could view the hall and a couple of quadrangles. Their was a further fee for the picture gallery. The hall is impressive but was so packed it was difficult to enjoy. We felt that the college cashes in on the",
          "You would think a cathedral-sized church could absorb hundreds of people without difficulty, but not in this case. I concede the city was busy on the day we visited, not only with tourists but also with graduation ceremonies, but our experience was not a good one due to too many",
          "Been to ChristChurch a few times and one of the best colleges in Oxford, if not the best. Lots of history here and you should also try and visit the Old Library where they have many old transcripts. Tom Quad and the Dining hall are impressive and definitely a must see for the",
          "Not the best college to visit in Oxford. Anyway probably you\u2019ll visit like me because of the popularity.",
          "If you are a respectful individual who would like to experience some calm and solemnity during your visit to Oxford, it's well worth going to an evensong at Christchurch and listen to the choir and organ in this majestic location. At 5:45pm they let people in, and to be honest",
          "Only discovered the expanse of Christchurch meadows a few weeks ago having lived near Oxford for 4 years. They are amazing and the perfect walk with an ice cream in the gorgeous summer weather.",
          "Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford doubles as the Colllege Chapel. One could easily spend a couple of days enjoying the.history as well as the peace and calm of the place. Founded by Cardinal Woolsey while his boss, King Henry VIII, was founding it's sister College, Trinity, in",
          "We went to this college because of the Harry Potter allure. There were a lot of people waiting to go inside but since we were not part of a group we slipped right in and despite the popularity of the location we enjoyed our visit. The huge dining hall is magnificent and",
          "It was cool to see this college. It all breathes the atmosphere of history, but it is still all used, like the eating room. I could smell the lunch flavors.",
          "Come here for Evensong. It is free and the choral music is spectacular. If you are lucky you can sit in the choral stalls.",
          "Harry Potter fans have a reason to visit this place, but even otherwise it is a beautiful place to see if you are in Oxford. Peaceful and quiet with lush green surroundings. Walking distance from the Oxford station, we bought the ticket at the church and it wasn\u2019t very crowded.",
          "Amazing awesum ...a sight to behold . The grounds and architecture was amazing. The buildings were stately. Absolutely beautiful....",
          "This really is part of our history, one of our oldest colleges, The tour really only comprised the grounds, the great dining room and the Church, but all were magnificent and well worth a visit, a real must on a visit to Oxford",
          "Took a self guided walk around Christ College including the church. You get to see a couple of places where Harry Potter was filmed and/or inspired by. I also attended Evensong. I highly recommend attending a service if possible. It was an incredible experience and everyone was",
          "After a day exploring Oxford and its colleges we arrived here at 4pm and were not sure if we wanted to spent \u00a38pp for just over an hour left till closing time. We are very glad we did decide to enter though. It was nicely empty at this time and the amazing dining hall with all",
          "Beautiful and with great history. Both teenagers and parents will love it. You can never take enough photos. The catholic feel is still there.",
          "Lovely church. We attended Evensong. The boys' choir was so good. Hauntingly beautiful voices. The person who spoke was visiting but her message was thought-provoking. I'm glad we could visit.",
          "Very interesting buildings, we found the Hall was great for Harry Potter fans. The Cathedral was amazing inside and very peacefull. The grounds within Christ Church are very well kept and reminded us of Inspector Morse series. Staff were very pleasant and overall cost to enter",
          "We waited until he queue for pre-purchased tickets, only to have a security lady pretty much ignore us for ten minutes and when she finally acknowledge us and I showed her the tickets, she responded \u201cgood job\u201d and walked away. Eventually, we managed to flag another lady and, on",
          "I went quite early and just bought a ticket, no queue but quite busy with pre booked groups. Spectacular as you would expect. Art gallery isn't open on a Tuesday which I didn't realise but it did give information on the board outside. Staff were friendly. Stained glass windows",
          "Makes you feel transported back to centuries gone bye with the history of its buildings and of famous people who studied in its cloisters. Used many times as backdrop for many movies and British tv shows. To get the most of your visit anywhere in Oxford, read up on its history.",
          "Lucky for us our guide managed to get us in free today to Christchurch College what a beautiful building. I felt like I had stepped back in time .... I find it hard to believe that traditions have lasted so long especially in this day and age ... it was incredible ... another",
          "We booked online and had a time but we arrived early and they let us straight in. the earlier you go the less crowds there will be. There is the famous Harry Potter dining room and the Cathedral, which has free guided tours. Doesn't seem much for the money but we enjoyed it.",
          "Visited at opening time,\u00a38 each to get in, but at least we could see the hall. The cathedral was not open, but staff made sure we knew this. Staff very helpful throughout. Do check the website to ensure the bits you want to see will be open as the hours vary considerably.",
          "If you visit Oxford, try to visit Christ Church College. It wasn\u2019t free but the interior of the chapel was very I impressive. I think Harry Potter movie had a scene from this chapel. It wasn\u2019t very busy when I went there so I just bought the ticket at the window. It had so",
          "The church is lovely but for me the highlight is the surrounding gardens. It seems that the current them is purple so the gardens are filled with lavenders and pale to deep purple annuals. Some beauiful Photo opportunities.",
          "Don't get me wrong, Christ Church is beautiful, but it also appears to be the most-visited place in Oxford. It was hard to really enjoy our visit due to the crowds. Personally, I enjoyed visit Magdalen College, the Bodleian library, and several of the smaller colleges, more",
          "A rushed visit with official Oxford guide. He made no allowance for people with mobility problems. I thought the cathedral was dowdy.",
          "We participated in a lovely service with music by the boys choir. We arrived early so that we had seats very close to the choir. It was a wonderful experience.",
          "Evensong isn\u2019t part of my religious background. I found the service to be spiritually relaxing and gave me a better understanding of the English culture. The chapel is beautiful and the ministers and choir members were wonderful.",
          "Stunning in every sense, beautiful architecture,so much to look at.A real feeling of atmosphere, you can almost feel the past.Could have spent hours just gazing at everything.The meadow is lovely really beautiful to wander through.",
          "If you come to Oxford then you have to visit a college and Christ Church with its huge dining hall and cathedral is well worth while. It was very busy when we went but we had time to see everything. You get a useful booklet to guide yourself. It is not cheap but the cathedral",
          "Nice seeing the cathedral (both college church and diocesan cathedral) and the Harry Potter locations. Just thought it was a bit overpriced for what you get to see, and I think it costs even more peak summer.",
          "Attended evening service where what I assumed was the full choir performed. The music was magical and only enhanced by the surroundings. The English do this kind of thing so well. Both impressed and moved by the experience.",
          "Be aware of times open to the public Beautiful choir area, impressive huge grounds. Really nice guides.",
          "This is my favorite location when visiting Oxford. Spend the time and the money for a tour. It is well worth it.",
          "I have visited nearly every cathedral in England, and I have to say I enjoyed my visit here least of all! That being said, I want to try to give a fair review. I join the tourist queue, and do enjoy the visit to the Great Hall. But I am really here to photograph the",
          "It really dont worth the 8\u00a3of entry ticket. We felt kind of ripped off and the entry officer was a bit rude with us. Moreover, do not trust the timetable at all as they decided to close on Sunday earlier without a reason.",
          "Visiting this college is surely a magical experience in all ways. Not only the English Gothic style here is amazing, this sight was also a filming location for some Harry Potter films - this is the best seen around the Harry Potter staircase and the Great Hall which also served",
          "Lots of history here, and the buildings are really beautiful. It's pretty pricey for the time it takes - I think 20 minutes is rounding up how long it takes to go through. However, it's an easy way to see inside one of the colleges briefly, and the Quad and Hall are quite",
          "Went in paid full price then get told that the Cathedral is closed and not knowing that was more than half the vist",
          "Visiting Christ Church (costs about 7 pounds I think) and walking in the meadows (free) is well worth it. It\u2019s a must do in oxford",
          "Recommend you visit early before the crowds descend. Worth the entrance fee, but you are not really allowed to explore many areas of the college. Highlight was the cathedral but parts of this were closed as they were rehearsing for Easter celebrations. A must-see when you are in",
          "We arrived about 5 minutes before opening, so we were 3rd in line. What was great about this was that it wasn't busy at all, but on our way out, there was quite the lineup! The dining hall is used for 3 meals a day, so make sure to visit between meals, otherwise you won't have",
          "This is a magnificent complex of 16th and 17th-century buildings in honey-coloured stone. The officials in bowler hats were very helpful towards visitors; one of them opened up the lift for my wife, who is disabled, and accompanied her up to the Great Hall. That is the sort of",
          "I was in town for the Easter weekend and decided to stop into the church on Good Friday for the evening service. OK, I get that the cathedral had to close to clean up in preparation for the service. But the staff forbade people to take pictures and, while waiting in line, I",
          "The architecture is lovely and well maintained. The large dining room is totally Harry Potter, and is amazing. The manicured lawn is pretty but you can\u2019t walk around it. The chapel was closed so what you could visit was limited and this information is not given when you pay your",
          "Whilst visiting Oxford on Tuesday 16th with friends they said they would like to visit Christ Church so we agreed to join them and overall I think it was overpriced at \u00a38.00 for what we toured. ( most people wanted to see the dining hall because of Harry Potter... we had not",
          "First time in Oxford we had to visit the college, there is history around every corner, every staircase and corridor. The dining hall is so full of history with a big smile thinking of Harry Potter and Hogwarts.",
          "Although we did enjoy the tour I do not feel it is worth \u00a38 each. It is steeped in history and enjoyable and it is quite odd to think it is a working college and that they all dine together in the hall twice daily. The hall with all the pictures of past Christ Church members is",
          "lovely to visit the chapel and the dining hall surrounded by portraits from the past. Used as a scene in Harry Potter ,,,great to see.",
          "For college yes its good as its under oxford university but as a visitor its over priced what you see. They should charge as per the trinity college there is not much to see either in it but that price seems reasonable.",
          "The place is magical, not only for Harry Potter fans :) Worth visiting even on a rainy day (another perk is no long queue!)",
          "Large, beautiful and a bit familiar as in The Golden Compass as well as the dining room provided idea for Hogwarts refectory. It\u2019s everything you expect of an Oxford college. Beautiful meadow. Shuts at lunchtime so students can eat.",
          "We attended the 11:00 worship service at Christ Church Sunday. It was a sung Eucharist. So very lovely. The church is incredibly beautiful!! It was so worth it. A wonderful experience.",
          "The church itself is lovely with an interesting history, but the services are captivating. There is scaffolding in part of the church until the summer 2019 but the choir and welcome from the chaplaincy are wonderful. There is famously the dining hall which was the dining hall",
          "This is an overhyped tourist attraction because of that silly guy with eye glasses called Henry Poster, or whatever it is. You pay 8 stirling pounds and see an ordinary university mensa and an ordinary church under reconstruction. Robbery!",
          "Such a lovely college to visit, and it's a real privilege to have a look around. Guides are very helpful and you get to see the Hall and Cathedral as well as the central quod.",
          "I planned this to be my first stop on a first visit to Oxford; a treat on my birthday. Following most of the exhilarating advice I found online about this college, my expectations were very high. To my disappointment though, I ended up completely struck by the very bad",
          "Amazing historical place with warm ambience, well maintained wall decoration with attractive paintings in all the walls , very delicious food varieties,",
          "An astoundingly excellent place for grandeur and reflectively place for a sense of presence and calm. Great architecture and stained glass. The choir stalls added to the atmosphere. The church sung sacred music was fabulous from the choir. All round fabulous.\ud83d\ude01",
          "What a fantastic place. The tour was so well signposted. The Hall and Cloisters straight out of Harry Potter, the Cathedral was fantastic. I could not recommend this highly enough.",
          "Possibly the most picturesque of the colleges, standing next to Christ Church meadow as a bonus feature. Featured in many episodes of Endeavour and Morse",
          "Beautiful stained glass windows in the Chapel - main dining hall very Harry Potter and similar to the one at Keble. If you see long queues and you are not travelling in a group go up to the ticket office as there are two ticket booths and you might find you can get ahead of the",
          "They misinformed us. We\u2019re informed that ALSO if we were underage (15 yes) we could enter into the Church. So me and my friends went there at 2 and tried to get in but they told us to call an adult, who was actually nursing a friend, so she couldn\u2019t come immediately. When she",
          "Lovely grounds. Some work being done but all the same. Heritage like this is spread all over the beautiful city!",
          "Please stop in Christ Church Cathedral while in Oxford. It is beautiful and thought-provoking, and with side chapel explanations of what you are seeking that make a self-guided tour very productive. This is the home of great music for worship, and if you can attend a service",
          "If you're in the city at 5:45 with nothing to do then Evening Prayer could be one of your better alternatives. It is a traditional Church of England Evening Prayer from the Book of Common Prayer. The night we went it was the Sentence of Scripture, a Congregational hymn,",
          "More expensive than a lot of the other colleges around there and not any better. Nice to see some of the historic buildings but would not be my first pick of colleges.",
          "Had a nice visit to Christchurch college and church. Our guide was good at not only pointing out the obvious movie set points, but also the smaller details that you may miss otherwise (alice's rabbit in the stained glass, etc). Well worth a stop for an hour or so.",
          "This is my favourite college in Oxford due to size, architecture, history and atmosphere. Absolutely recommended visit when you are in Oxford",
          "A stunning architectural College. The great hall was especially grand and Harry Potter fans will love it.",
          "We went to be able to admire some of the areas what inspired the Harry Potters films scenes . It is beautiful just for itself, really.",
          "Great place would recommend to anyone that asked lovely to look at from the distance in the sun :) :)",
          "We went on our own and paid individual entry fees in town so had to get our bearings each stop. But worked for us. Just follow the crowds! Can\u2019t imagine summertime . Dining hall was what I remembered from a visit years ago. Now it is so recognizable from Harry Potter.",
          "We came to Oxford exploring for a couple of days. We did a walking tour one morning but this didn't include Christ Church. We decided to make our own way there. Easy to find as it is sooooo big. We decided not to pay to go in as nearly everything was closed to the public.",
          "A stunning building with a long history. We thoroughly enjoyed wandering through tom's Quad, the Great Hall, the Cathedral and the grounds around the exterior. Don't miss it if you are in Oxford!",
          "As mentioned in other reviews, with the Cathedral undergoing renovations so therefore not included in visit this was a very expensive tour price should have been adjusted accordingly",
          "We stayed 4 nights at Oxford and was so excited to have the chance to go to the concerts at Christ Church. We hope we will have another concert when we go there this summer. Oxford is a place where we like very much and we will stay at Oxford as a starting point for our long",
          "We visited Oxford for my birthday for a city break.We saw the Jersey Boys on the Saturday night & left Sunday to explore the universities & architecture.Saturday night turned into Sunday morning & the inevitable lie in meant we only had time to visit Christ Church but really",
          "A highlight of our Christmas in England was being able to attend the Christmas Eve service at this formidable church. Though it was established in 1546, the acoustics during all of the Christmas hymns were incredible. What an amazing experience. I recommend attending a church",
          "What a lovely building this is, With nearly 500 years History is so much a good place to visit. It's a very big and Beautiful with some Lovely Views to see in the Church. I Recommend this visit very much.",
          "We visit this place today and nothing was mentionned at the entrance. We pay 9 pounds and we discover inside that 50% of the visit was cancelled the cath\u00e9drale is closed ...... this is may be brit humour but we do not appreciate at all Iwill post this information in french on",
          "Visited with my daughter. We both found Christchurch college very interesting both inside the buildings as well as the courtyard.",
          "You need to pick the timing right for this, as there can be plenty of visitors and overseas coach parties. I was impressed that the entrance fee was reduced as part of the university normally open to the public was not available that day. When visiting the Great Hall, there are",
          "Worth visiting, especially the hall where some scenes of Harry Potters were recorded. It is pity, though, that the cathedral was closed for visitors....",
          "Definitely worth a visit and a wander through the meadows. Very picturesque college with meadows full of cattle, squirrels and other encounters.",
          "On the edge of town overlooking the local fields, Christ Church is one of the original colleges and this age and prestige presents in the scale and form of the facade and surrounding grounds.",
          "One knew that the Hogwarts series was shot here, but being there on the weekend before term started gave one a more marked feeling of the same. Hordes of students trudging in with their luggage in trolleys and anxious parents standing around, was a scene straight from 9 3/4. A",
          "We were at the Cathedral for the Christmas carols which was just amazing. The architecture of the place is breathtaking.It is definitely a must visit site when in Oxford.",
          "I was surprised by how beautiful the buildings were on our visit. Well worth the admission charge. The great hall, the vaulted ceilings and the cathedral itself were very impressive. Also the staff on hand to assist you were very welcoming and friendly.",
          "I have not see any of the other colleges in Oxford, but this one was fantastic. The great hall was amazing, and not just because of the Harry Potter connection. The cathedral is very unique and we asked one of the men working in there a simple question and thirty minutes later",
          "Beautiful place to visit, one you have to go if in Oxford. Worth visiting the beautiful building as well.",
          "A must for Harry Potter fans, but also very beautiful. Guides are most informative and interesting. The great hall is fantastic, well worth a view.",
          "So we visited Oxford when college was out of session. This meant that many buildings were closed or scheduled for maintenance. Our child is studying SYA at St. Anne's College and our original plan called for a tour of the Bodleian Library. That not being possible, we chose the",
          "There is nothing new to see here. If you have visited a university campus and a big church then no need to go there. Also the staff was very boring",
          "Like most high churches, there was little participation from the congregation although one can always spend the time in quiet reflection and meditation. Beautiful setting of course in this glorious cathedral.",
          "Of all the Oxford colleges you should pay to visit, Christ Church college should be it. Whether you're a Harry Potter fan, hoping to stand on the steps that the cast of Harry Potter did, or a tourist hoping to see just how amazing and wonderfully kept the college is inside.",
          "It is a very awe inspiring place and it was good to be able to get inside and see the building, especially the cathedral.",
          "Unfortunately, I haven't been inside but the park surrounding gives a great excuse to just stay outside and enjoy the weather. The tickets are quite pricey and prepare yourself for a loooong que. That's the main reason why we gave up and just wandered around.",
          "Well worth the money to visit the historic college, halls and Cathedral. Such history here, the halls are not open between 10.00 & 14.00 because of the students but you can look at the rest then visit the halls last. It can get very busy in the halls. Would visit again.",
          "Another historic place in Oxford made famous by the Dining Hall setup in the Harry Potter movie. Place is clean and well maintained, the local guards or guides are also polite and kind. Christ Church is a holy place that is intricately built, showing the massive strength amd",
          "We visited Christ Church in Oxford on a Saturday afternoon situated just a couple of minutes walk from the high street, it is well worth a visit with stunning architecture, there is quite a queue to get in so be prepared to wait.",
          "I have lived in Oxford for a number of years now and this is the first time I have visited Christ Church, and it is not all it is cracked up to be. The architecture is boring, no better than a large number of other colleges. Yes, small bits of Harry Potter were filmed there, but",
          "Although it costs \u00a37 for seniors to visit here, it's well worth the admission fee. Being able to walk through such hallowed grounds is an experience. Unfortunately when we visited the students and tutors were having brunch, so we were unable to visit the Great Hall - although",
          "As a resident of Oxfordshire I've visited Christ Church college on a few occasions over the years. I've attended classical concerts in the cathedral as well as lectures given as part of the Oxford Literary Festival. My most recent visit was to play tourist for a friend",
          "We toured the area in the afternoon and really enjoyed the buildings and interiors. We talked to some of the students. Some of the kids from the states were quite thrilled to be going to school there. Pretty amazing place to go to school.",
          "Our guide took us to this college. She shared the history behind this college. We took the most scenic images here.",
          "What a beautiful place. Very much enjoyed the guided tour and even got to hear the boys' choir and adult choir rehearsing while we were there. Lovely experience.",
          "Oxford is a unique place, and visitors rarely get much of an opportunity to see inside the life of the university. Many colleges have open times yet all are different from each other so which one to visit? One of the best is Christchurch. Why? Well there\u2019s something for",
          "This was an Tuesday afternoon visit in November \u2013 highlights \u2013 the Dining Hall \u2013 Custodian Sue was very informative and helpful \u2013 the tables were laid against a background of history with its Founder Cardinal Wolsey and after his fall Henry 8 and Elizabeth 1 looking down on the",
          "We took a tour of this oldest college in Oxford and were totally enthralled by the architecture and the history attached! The grand entrance was thrilling for a Potterhead like me! The great hall used for dining is an experience in itself!",
          "Spent a wonderfully long morning wandering through this amazing building. Don't just rush through, take a look at the amazing portraits, architecture and gardens. Harry Potter fans will enjoy the dining room (I haven't a clue!), apparently it's a scene from the film. But it is",
          "Able to see great hall just before they closed it for students lunches....watch the time if you want to see! Joined a free tour of the cathedral with a most entertaining and knowledgable guide. Fascinating history.",
          "If you like Harry Potter, you must come and see the Great Hall !! It's amazing. Yet, I expected to see classrooms and I didn't. Actually, the visit doesn't last: you only see the Great Hall for a few minutes, then a kind of garden and the Cathedral. It's worth it, don't worry!",
          "A highlight of our recent trip to Oxford was worshipping with the officiant, organist and choristers of Christ Church Cathedral during their weekly choral evensong service. The music was sublime and, combined with the awe-inspiring setting, made for a memorable time of",
          "We loved this! A very kind staff member took us around the Cathedral and explained the history. Stunning!",

          "My family and I spent probably 30 minutes with one of ChristChurch's guides in the Great Hall. She was well informed and described to us the many intricacies of the ornate Hall. My husband and I enjoyed the details while my children (ages 11, 14) even perked up when she showed",
          "If you ARE a Hogwarts devotee, walking up the staircase and into the great hall is enough. If you aren\u2019t, then look at the Becket window in the chapel, the amazing ceiling in the staircase, and all the other beatiful details that made it so suitable for a magical backdrop in",
          "We initially went here on a lunchtime tour which was really informative. At the time the dining hall was in use by students so closed for tours so we went back after 2pm and had the hall to ourselves. Lovely to look around. This hall was used as the basis for the grand hall",
          "The buildings are of course stunning and the gardens set it all off beautifully, and Christchurch meadows is a wonderful place to switch off from the city in proper countryside, cows and all! Only a few minutes walk from the buzz of High Street.",
          "A friend who lives in Oxford took us on a tour of Christ Church. The grand stone passageways and meeting halls are beautifully decorated. Many areas are recognizable from the Harry Potter films. But even if you are not a fan of the movies, this beautiful compound is worth a",
          "We decided to visit here after reading some reviews on here and to be honest, whilst the buildings were nice (much as a lot of buildings in oxford are), we were a little disappointed. I don\u2019t think it helped that we had to wait nearly 25 minutes to get a ticket to get in whilst",
          "Christ Church will speak for itself. From the entrance to the old Tom Bell Tower via the dining hall to the cathedral. It's amazing. It has been used as a backdrop for many films and TV shows. Try to take a guided tour. The history of the stained glass windows are very",

          "Christ Church is the most prestigious attraction in the area and is the \"must do\" if time is short. We didn't really know what to expect, but it surpassed our most optimistic expectations. Everything about this place was to a high standard, and great to see real students around",
          "In my opinion the Christ Church is the first historical sight of Oxford to be seen. We were without guide and I do not think we missed anything. Of course the historical facts could be checked from literature or internet. There are also on-site personnel whom you can contact for",
          "This is the largest of the colleges at Oxford and it seemed that you could not escape as you were walking around the Oxford campus. The dining hall was the model for the main hall in the Harry Potter movies though no filming was actually done in the hall.",
          "Christ Church is unique in Britain in that it is the only diocesan Cathedral church that doubles as a college Chapel. The \"Tom Quad \" adds to the atmosphere , where once a year, various fast gentlemen try to get all the way round it while the clock is striking twelve, mostly",
          "I have toured Christ Church several times, the great room being one of my favorite things to see. I visited at Christmas and thought I was in a completely new place! The Christmas decor is beautiful, reverent and brings the place to life. I was overwhelmed with the beauty and",

          "This church is second best to The Duomo I\u2019d say with its beautiful glass paintings and peaceful atmosphere. Beautiful beautiful visit a must go to!!",

          "The entrance to the college and cathedral is at the far end at the bottom of the street through the meadows. There are toilets in the cathedral cloisters (no disabled sccess). Follow the numbered tour in the free guide just beyond the ticket office. TIP: be sure to see the \"No",

          "Visited this awesome place towards the end of our weekend in Oxford. Amazing architecture and the dining hall, featured in a Harry Potter movie, was very impressive. All in all well worth the visit and highly recommended.",
          "We had some problems finding the entrance, but the keepers of the exit was very friendly and told us the road to follow. Once we got there, we were lucky and did not find a queue to enter. The visit proceeded quickly throughout the signalled path. If you like the Harry Potter",
          "We booked our tickets online and I would recommend doing this as the queue on the day was massive and we were able to bypass this and go on in. We enjoyed seeing the Dining hall (wonderful entrance staircase and ceiling) and it satisfied the Harry Potter fans in our group. I",
          "A fascinating place to visit. The refrectory was used during Harry Potter filming, as was part of the Ashmolean. We found the various Guides well worth talking to; so much more information than in the guide book! Allow a good amount of time for the visit.",
          "I enjoyed touring Christ Church, but I did think the admission cost was too high. It didn't take long to go through the tour. I am glad I saw it, but it wasn't my highlight of Oxford.",
          "I can\u2019t rate our stay highly enough! Uni rooms can be rented during the summer holidays and become available 3 months before. Google university rooms to rent. We stayed in a double ensuite room in the Meadows building. Breakfast in the great hall (aka Harry Potter) was",

          "Both the interior and exterior of the buildings are beautiful. However \u00a39/\u00a310 is very expensive for a very short look around. I was surprised it was so quick - less than 1 hour. I was expecting more for my money and would have had to pay more had i chosen to see the artwork as",
          "Breathing in the history and beauty of the buildings and grounds, and getting to see some of the Harry Potter sites made the visit extra special",
          "Beautiful inside and filled with history. My wife lost a pouch of pills and got an email from the gift shop a couple hours later that they were available for pickup.",
          "We were glad we arrived fairly early as we got in without queue at the ticket office. We went in the Cathedral first, this has vibrant stained glass and some 700 year old tombs. The highlight of the visit was the main hall with panelled walls,a long dining table set for a meal",
          "Visit St Frideswide's Shrine & pray for the animals tortured and killed in the laboratories in Oxford. Ironic that Frideswide, who respected the sacred in our animal relatives, is a patron saint of the place.",
          "Having waited in line for 30 minutes we duly paid our entrance fee. We were aware the cathedral was closed but did not realise how much this would effect our visit as the price had not been reduced. Other than a look at the dining room the visit was just a walk along some paths",
          "I got online the week before our visit on the day that tickets are released therefore had no problem getting the timed ticket that we needed. It was not very obvious how to get in with my ticket (outside main entrance on left is a row for both tour groups and timed tickets),",
          "Quite an interesting site to visit especially if you are a harry potter fan. Do not miss the 2nd floor pathway which is where you will see the dining area which is like those of the famous movie. You may prepare 120 pounds to put your name in the chair. \ud83d\ude00",
          "My family\u2019s visit here was marred by the rude yelling of the staff. Twice we were herded like cattle against the wall. We are not Harry Potter fans, we just came to see the grounds and the architecture. Very little is accessible to the public, despite the 25 pound entrance",
          "A quite typical medieval build college in the heart of Oxford ideal for a short tour to get a sense of one of the oldest schools. Harry Potter fans might love the big hall at which a few scenes of a Harry Potter movie were filmed at. That\u2019s all.",
          "Very interesting place to visit, and so do quite a few others think as well. Fairly crowded. Harry Potter fans probably like the big hall.",
          "Didn't open to the public until 2.15 pm. We hadn't checked first so had to go back. Very busy and queue to get in. Cathedral included but not the picture gallery. That is extra cost.",
          "I wanted to visit one of the many beautiful colleges/Universities whilst I was in Oxford with my family. Trip advisor recommended this one. It was right We paid \u00a325 for a family ticket (2 adults, 2 children) and we had a fab time. The Hall is spectacular and I believe it is",
          "The college is beautiful and being a Harry Potter fan makes it even more enjoyable. On a nice weather, the broad walk is beautiful and pleasant. Would definitely recommend going to this if you\u2019re in Oxford.",
          "Staff could not be more accommodating to our visiting choir. The space was outstanding and the services moving.",
          "Beautiful building. We never bought fast track tickets ahead of our trip which is unusual for us. However we never queued for long. We was there just after 9.30am. However the queue to get into the dining hall (Harry Potter filmed here) was slow due to the photographs being",
          "I love the fact that they actually let you in where students live, eat and study. Of course none of the private area are available for visit. But the Great Hall and the staircase are a must visit in Oxford especially For Harry Potter fans. The gardens are simply gorgeous.",
          "36 pound for family of 5 . guides were sullan and unfriendly. Hall closed for main part of afternoon and no reduction given. Therefore we only got to see cathedral for most cities is by donation only. Not impressed go see the natural history museum instead much better.",
          "Christ Church is one of the many highlights of this beautiful town. It is definitely a must visit. A lot of the Harry Potter scenes were shot in this beautiful castle. If you are a Harry Potter fan, Christ Church is not to be missed.",
          "We dropped by Christ Church for a choral service in the cathedral (we visit enough cathedrals so why not drop by when something's on?). Entry was a breeze (free if you're attending a service) and visitors (of any denomination) are made to feel very welcome. On a dull, rainy day,",
          "If you love your history in a perfectly presented environment with lots of information and helpful custodians Christ Church should be a \"must do\" if you visit Oxford. The buildings are beautifully maintained, easy to navigate and ooze atmosphere. The site is busy with tours and",

          "Most of the colleges in Oxford share quite similar architecture and grounds, but Christ Church College is where Lewis Carroll wrote the famous Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. We mainly walked the grounds, a must for all visitors to Oxford.",
          "if you are the fans of harry potter and then its a dream place for you to visit where harry dine with his friends and there are many other scenes which is really worthy to pay ten ponds to get in",
          "Harry Potter fans will know all about the dining hall. However, it is much more than that. The grounds are beautiful. The history very interesting. Worth a visit when touring the University.",
          "Christ Church is stunning architecturally and the history and cathedral were incredible. I\u2019m unsure how much, if any, of Harry Potter was actually shot here, due to conflicting reports, but it was still impressive. Unfortunately, being school hols, the place was rammed. Luckily",
          "Visited Oxford with mum and sister July 18. Booked 3 single rooms in Christ Church Halls of Residence and wow what a great stay we had. The Liddell Building is a modern quad a 5 minute walk from the city. With out entry keys we were granted free entry to Christ Church through",

          "I think the reason why most people visit this place is because of how much of Harry Potter was shot in it (including the Great Hall!). There is so much to see and marvel at without the Harry Potter stuff (and CS Lewis for the Alice lovers). I couldn't give it a 5 star purely",
          "The College had been started by Thomas Wolsey, but Henry VIII took it over and called it Christ Church. The clock tower, called Tom Tower, was designed by Sir Christopher Wren. The College Chapel is also the Cathedral to the diocese, and it has a first-rate musical tradition.",
          "Christ Church is an absolutely gorgeous place! There are services held on Sundays as well as weekdays and all are welcome. Highly recommend.",
          "We walked all around Christ Church, the chapel is stunning, so much history in the chapel. The grounds of the church are very pretty, I believe it was worth going to.",
          "I visited twice: once for a Wednesday Evensong (which actually begins at 6:05 PM \"Oxford\" time) and again on a Saturday for a full look. This is one of the most popular destinations in town so prepare yourself for the crowds. The facility suggests a defined viewing path,",

          "I enjoyed my trip here, particularly the cathedral but I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the \u00a310 per person entrance fee!! I was out within the hour and that was taking my time as I walked round. It\u2019s stunning but there are equally stunning sights that you can access for free",
          "It's not cheap to do this tour but I felt it was value for money, especially having taken time to really look around the cathedral. The staff were incredibly friendly and took the time to point out extra items of interest. I was very impressed with their enthusiasm and way of",

          "We had an unguided tour and it was okay. Perhaps we had just seen too many beautiful buildings throughout the UK by the time we got here, but for the cost, you can go through it all pretty quickly if its not crowded. Less than an hour can cover everything, along with reading",

          "This is part of the University campus also where many movies have been filmed, including Harry Potter, so you can find the Great Hall from the films. Also if u want to get in for free you just need to ask kindly to any student around there and they can get you in for free!",

          "Plan on visiting - but you should plan. Be sure to check \"Opening Times\" on their website. Since this is a working college, not all portions are open on a given day and visiting hours are often limited. It would be a shame to go and not see the Great Hall, especially if you are",

          "Worth the wait, very long line up. We saw the cathedral which is a lot more than just a college chapel. The great hall is impressive and a must see for Harry Potter fans. The buildings itself are also very beautiful. I am glad that this college was open as all others we intended",
          "On our recent visit to Oxford, we were lucky enough to attend the evesong service. The service consisted of a typical Anglican service (very similar to a Roman Catholic mass) with the magnificent Cathedral Choir. From the website: \"There are twelve men and sixteen boys in",

          "Yes, you know this because of Harry Potter. But even just a little research will tell you about other amazing people associated with Christ Church. We spoke with the docent in the quad and he enthusiastically pointed out Lewis Carroll's rooms, Albert Einstein's rooms etc, and",

          "The quad, cloisters, hall and cathedral are nice to see. However, the 2pm opening of the hall on Saturday meant that there were over 200 people queued up outside to get in. Luckily we had already bought tickets so could avoid the queue but what bad organisation! I understand",
          "Great choir and organist made being in this amazing building even more special. Check their schedule to make sure you don't miss it.",
          "No wonder they selected this place for scenes in the movies. Very well known is the dining room from Harry Potter, but there are more and just as pretty other rooms and halls that are very pretty.",
          "This is a place that touches the soul of our country. So why or why do they have to milk the fact that some parts of Harry Potter was filmed there? It was set in a school not the greatest university in the land. I live near Bracknell and I don't see tourists being charged to",
          "Whether you are a Harry Potter fan or not, most everyone would enjoy spending some time at Christ Church college. We waited in line for probably 30 minutes to get in, but were glad we decided to wait. The dining hall is spectacular and the church has a very special vibe to it",

          "We did think the price a little high, but it was certainly worth every penny. The Great Hall and staircase leading to it were.magnificent. The amount of history in that room, with the portraits of so many men who became prime ministers is incredible. It was also the seat of the",

          "I think most people go here because the dining room was used in the Harry Potter films. However, it is so much more than that. The architecture is stunning, there is an amazing quadrangle, and the jewel in the crown is the fact that it has its own Cathedral! It really gives you",
          "If you have never been in such a school with centuries of history, 13 British prime-ministers in the curriculum and an amazing sort of architectural and art issues please don\u2019t miss this jewel and take some time to know this. The Hall where the Harry Potter meals scenes were",

          "Yes, this is the place where you see the Great Hall where the sorting hat sorts you and Hogwarts has its festivals. As soon as you enter the building, you are headed to the staircase where Harry walked up when he first arrived. The stairway is pretty fantastic. It really feels",
          "On this occasion, we wished to visit just the Cathedral building, but it is necessary to purchase a ticket for the college grounds and the college hall in order to enter the Cathedral. The cost is \u00a37 (for OAPs) plus 50p each booking fee, so not cheap. We had not appreciated",
          "Sadly the visit was all too short and we were not able to stay for Evensong. There was just enough time to enjoy the final moments of the Choir's rehearsal, admire the exquisite architecture, and to kneel in silent prayer for a while. The sidesmen were most accommodating and we",
          "We were blessed to hear a boys choir sing on a Tuesday evening. Arrive at the side gate at 5:45 to walk through the courtyard across to the main church. We arrived early enough to walk a bit inside the church. Sit in the first section as you walk in to be closest to the choir.",
          "We joined a guided tour and a lovely man called Michael took us around and pointed out things that we would have missed or not understood had we looked around on our own, he also showed us things that were not part of the tour but we enjoyed every minute, what a knowledgeable",
          "This building is imposing and beautiful at the same time. If you find yourself in Oxford just check on the internet that it is open to the public, checking for times etc. It is a working building after all. Walk up those Harry Potter stairs and walk around the dining hall in",
          "I popped here after finishing work. The place opens from 12- 5pm. Avoid 12pm as the ques are quiet long to get in. At 2pm there was no queing and yes it is worth a visit. The great hall looks amazing as do the grounds and the church. If you want to visit the art gallery they",
          "Amazing architecture! Really old buildings and great stairways to the famous dining hall. The ceiling in this hall is totally beautiful! The cathedral is just stunning with lots of stained glass and beautiful woodwork. The gift shop is worth stopping in for a look.",

          "A wonderful hidden gem in Oxford with its own charming art gallery. Well worth a visit when in Oxford, Christchurch college is situated on the bank of the Cherwell and has some lovely buildings, including Christopher Wrens Old Tom clocktower, and the Cathedral. You can walk",
          "We went to the church because I had information that an ancestor was buried there. We serached the catherdral, but could not find her, so we asked for assistance. One of the volunteers went into the back, then returned telling us that the ancestor had actually been buried in a",
          "Oxford is bursting with history and Christ Church is one of the beautiful old colleges. Most teenagers will hate you for dragging them into yet another old building but they will love this because not only was it the inspiration for the Harry Potter movie sets but some shots",
          "This is the smallest cathedral in Britain and forms part of the Christchurch university college. If you wish to see inside I suggest you book in advance",
          "Tours that included Christ Church were just more than I wanted to spend. I thoroughly enjoyed my self driven visit and the price was right. Be sure that all the areas are open though. I felt the extra 2 pounds for the art gallery was worth it.",
          "If you value being \"spontaneous\" over actually seeing some of the important stuff, go for it. You can see the lovely Christ Church War Memorial Garden and the Meadow \"spontaneously.\" But Christ Church College has other attractions that HAVE LIMITED HOURS ON LIMITED DAYS. If you",

          "Founded in 1525 by Cardinal Wolsey to train cardinals this college is the largest of all of the Oxford's colleges. The tower in the Tom Quad courtyard was designed by Sir Christopher Wren in 1682 and is the largest in the city. The bell in its tower is rung 101 times at 9.05pm",

          "If you only have time to visit one college in Oxford, make it Christ Church. Due to the rain, we confined ourselves to the Great Hall, the Quad and the Chapel, which is also the Oxford Anglican Cathedral. The visit is free. We had an excellent guide for the chapel.",
          "We visited here on a cold snowy day which added to the atmosphere. You were given a guide which we kept to and were taken to lots of places and rooms in the building. The dining hall with the real fires and the tree in the dim lights you were in with Harry Potter. You have to",
          "My son studied at Christ Church, so we got a bit of a personalized tour from a student's point of view. It is absolutely beautiful, rich in history, and we were just in awe of the buildings. We stopped in the Hall, the inspiration for Harry Potter's Dining Hall at Hogwarts. It",

          "The expansive acreage owned by Christchurch College at Oxford is worth a few hours of your time. Get ready to walk through beautiful sports fields and stunning gardens. The river flows beside the pathway and leads to the Oxford Botanical Gardens. The Church is surrounded by some",
          "A guided tour of the College by my son, who started as a fresher this year. Our tour was at night so the view across the meadow required some imagination. The buildings and cathedral all worthwhile.",
          "A fascinating church with an even more fascinating history. Guides welcome you on arrival and Will happily answer questions ( if they don't know I w the answer they will find out for you). Guided tours are frequent as the guides are eager to show and tell . Lovely visitors",

          "... you have to visit Christchurch. We immediately and aahed whether to visit as it is \u00a37 to enter but were pleased we went. The dining hall alone is amazing (Hogwort's was modelled on it) and the architecture of the whole place is incredible. Students who go there are oh so",
          "Ticket is reasonably pricey however you can spend a good 1.5 hours here wandering around the church and hall. the ticket is valid all day, so we visited the church in the morning and hall in afternoon. Get here early to avoid the queues.",
          "We didn't feel like we got value for money here. Its a beautiful place and we like historical buildings so were looking forward to visiting but it was a very quick visit as there were a lot of areas we weren't allowed to go to. I'm not sure if they're always blocked off or if",
          "Should be on the short list of stops for any tourist to Oxford, Harry Potter fan or not. Read up on it beforehand.",

          "Harry Potter dining room visit, which was interesting in that the University students still eat like they did hundreds of years ago. Step back in history. Plenty to see, well worth a visit. Enjoyed.",
          "Visiting a college is essential for any visit to Oxford and if you only visit one then it's said you should visit Christ Church. There is so much history here that it's worth a little bit of research before you arrive as Christ Church is arguably the college with the most",

          "We spent a couple of hours wandering around and absorbing the beautiful architecture and history of Christ Church in Oxford",

          "Set in lively grounds with impressive buildings it is not surprising that this is no 1 to see. Tip. Plan your trip to miss the meal times. They close the Main Hall at those times. The web site will have details. If you also want to visit the art gallery it\u2019s 1/2 price with the",
          "What better way to round off a day in Oxford than to attend Evensong. Walk through the quadrangle to the Cathedral which is a beacon of light in the darkness. Listen to the wonderful choir and admire the splendid stonework in the choir. And all free! Splendid",
          "I was told by Oxford family that Christchurch was the place to visit and that my sons would enjoy seeing the Great Hall that was used in the Harry Potter films. Sounded good so we took a walk down to the entrance area, on a beautiful sunny Sunday in October. The queue to get in",

          "The easiest way to see Christ Church quad is to attend Evening Prayer (Evensong) at the Cathedral. The choir of men and boys was accomplished and the setting beautiful. Be aware this is a formal church service and appropriate behavior expected.",
          "Chat with the people guarding the place - lots of good information. We went early on a non-busy day - would be quite crowded otherwise - lots of high school tours.",
          "A beautiful building. Very big. Lots of other visitors, though, you just follow the signs, go into the dining hall in one line and out another, and in every photo you take you're getting photobombed by somebody who's posing on the stairs or coming out of the rooms och just other",
          "The highlighting this self guided tour is undoubtedly the dining hall (as seen in the Harry Potter films). You can see how this setting worked well as Hogwarts school dining room. The cathedral within the grounds is worth a visit. You need an hour or perhaps 90 minutes to see",
          "This is magnificent. Built by Thomas Wolsey, Christ Church stands as a magnificent testament to Tudor period building. I had one of the great moments of my life here, I was called clever and intelligent by an Oxford Don. I valued his opinion.",
          "Some place huh? Harry Potter type place of learning. Mazing that ordinary, or not so, people get to go here.",
          "This visit was superb, such history. Beautiful grounds. Then to see the staircase, great hall and cloisters where some of Harry Potter was filmed was spectacular. We were very lucky to visit before lunchtime when the great hall would be closed to visitors as the Dons would be",
          "Stunningly beautiful and steeped in history. Really awe-inspiring. So many of the characters connected to this place are icons in British history. Very humbling to walk in their footsteps ..,",

          "Great college, lovely to visit. Dining area and chapel are great. Should not be missed when in Oxford.",
          "The entry cost was fair. The Cathedral was very impressive with many interesting features, eg the shrine and the Burne Jones windows",

          "While in Oxford this is a must visit. It is unique in that it is the only college/university chapel in the world which is also a cathedral so has a Bishop. It is smaller than many others but so lovely. If you are able attend a Sunday morning service and/or Sunday evening",
          "We paid a discounted entrance fee because the Grand Hall was closed. But all we got to do for our entrance fee was walk through the courtyard and out the exit. The church is free to enter anyway and you still had to pay an extra amount to enter the picture gallery. So all in",

          "Well just loved it, lots to see.. and well worth the admission price. The grand hall is amazing you can hardly believe it is a working dining room.",
          "I booked two nights here in the meadow wing. You can book the rooms out of term time. The rooms are clean and basic given it's student accommodation but the buildings are stunning. It's quite something to walk through so much history on the way to your room. Equally you have",

          "I toured the hall, grounds and chapel of Christ Church. It was used in Harry Potter, which was cool to see. It is a beautiful college and a great way to get a sense of what life might be like for students there.",
          "Very nice building, well maintained. But you really don't have to pay 8 pounds to get in unless you are a die hard harry porter fan. There really nothing much to see inside. Do come in the evening for the even song in cathedral and it is free!",
          "We spent some time here, and we enjoyed every minute. It is something special to come to classic sites in Oxford.",
          "I have been living in Oxford for ages but still, never actually been in Christ Church college. Visited the park numerous times but never in the building. It was a mistake. As this is actually part of Oxford University and it is a working school you cannot walk in whenever you",
          "If you have time to visit only one of Oxford's many colleges, this IS the one to your. It is teeming w history and is spectacularly beautiful. The Hall is where some of Harry Potter was filmed, the cathedral is full of history, and the grounds are spacious and interesting",
          "If you are in Oxford during August and want a taste of heritage, architecture and excellent lodging hospitality, then I can recommend Christ Church College as a great place to stay. Each summer vacation period they let out the student rooms to tourists and they do a great job.",
          "I visited recently with my grand-daughter who is a fan of Harry Potter and she thoroughly enjoyed it. It is very difficult to put a rating on it as the gardens are lovely, the architecture is breathtaking and the scenery all around is stunning. As a fan of Harry Potter, the",

          "My sister and I are Harry Potter fans, so of course we paid to take a self guided tour! From the entrance, to the staircase and quad, we easily recognized scenes from the movie. But seeing the great hall was amazing. The model for Hogwarts. Aside from Potter, the real history",
          "Christ Church will appear on every guide on Where to visit in Oxford and this is absolutely the case. The beautiful gardens and surrounding scenery is stunning, if you take a peek into the quadrant you feel like you are absorbing Oxford though your pores. The walk down to",
          "This college is where the scenes for the harry potter dining hall were filmed. also some of the corridor shots....it is well worth the visit. Beautiful outside photo ops and although it looks far on the map you follow, it is not that far to walk to.",
          "This college was founded by Cardinal Wolsey in the 16th century. The cathedral, a remodeled Norman church, was reduced in length to accommodate the quadrangle. That doesn't hurt the music, though! It has 5 Burne-Jones/William Morris windows and a few Renaissance era windows.",

          "It's hard to believe as you walk around, the history that has gone before and yet to come relating to Christ Church as the learning is still being done as the tourists walk around. From the chapel, to the main hall to the staircase that was used in different films and",
          "Setting aside its ties to Harry Potter...this is of such beauty! The best time to go is when you have access to all the buildings. They charge you less if you don't have access to something. It is worth the price and to my opinion 9 \u00a3 is not expensive. Don't forget to look up",
          "Founded by Henry VIII and has seen some of Britain's most famous scholars, from writers to members of Parliament. With a few Dukes thrown in for good measure. Lewis Carroll was associated with the college for 40 years, with a staine glass window dedicated to him and his book",

          "Walking around the Christ Church grounds is a must when in Oxford, although tickets are quite expensive it is well worth it! Unfortunately the dining hall and a few other parts were closed off due to a wedding taking place so would advise on checking before heading up to Oxford",

          "This is a decent place to visit, but only at this price. (\u00a39) Any more and I'd consider it too expensive for what it is! I'm sure it's a 'must' for Harry Potter fans, but check what time you are going to visit, as the great hall closes at certain times, for lunch!!",
          "\u00a39 to see a dining hall (apparently used to film Harry Potter) and a couple of quads and small cathedral, 25 mins at best. Best part was all the paintings of famous old Oxford pupils but you couldn't get close enough to read about them for all the Japanese/Korean tour groups",

          "I visited Christ Church and was slightly surprised by the price. Nearly \u00a310 if I remember correctly and thought that for that price there should have been a guide inside for people to saunter along with at will. There were guides around but they seemed to have prearranged",
          "An oasis of quiet in an otherwise frantic City Centre--------rooms basic -- (Meadows a better bet!) Kindly staff- best breakfast EVER at top table in the Great Hall. Evensong in Chapel (even for this agnostic) was restoring and calming with glorious music. This was my third stay",

          "For me and the wife it was too expensive (\u00a39 plus extra 50p \u2013 this was to avoid the queues) if booked online, however, when you walk through the garden you are confronted with two big queues no signing and one poor soul trying to organise everything and on the day we went",

        "wiki": "The Covered Market is a historic market with permanent stalls and shops in a large covered structure in central Oxford, England.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe market is located to the north of the High Street towards the western end between Cornmarket Street and Turl Street. To the north is Market Street. Most of the entrances are from the High Street and Market Street (with four entrances from each street). It is also possible to gain access from Cornmarket via the Golden Cross alley, with its small up-market shops.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Covered Market was officially opened on 1 November 1774 and is still active today.  It was started in response to a general wish to clear 'untidy, messy and unsavoury stalls' from the main streets of central Oxford.\nJohn Gwynn, the architect of Magdalen Bridge, drew up the plans and designed the High Street front with its four entrances. In 1772, the newly formed Market committee, half of whose members came from the town and half from the university, accepted an estimate of nine hundred and sixteen pounds ten shillings, for the building of twenty butchers' shops.\nTwenty more soon followed, and after 1773 meat was allowed to be sold only inside the market. From this nucleus the market grew, with stalls for garden produce, pig meat, dairy products and fish.\n\n\n== Today ==\n\nToday the covered market is still home to numerous traders, around half of which are food retailers, including traditional market shops selling fresh food such as greengrocers and butchers (including some who produce the distinctive, local Oxford sausage). There are also newer gift shops, bakeries and sandwich shops. Most of the shops now are quite a bit larger than the original stall sizes, and so the number of businesses in the covered market is smaller than in the past. It is a bustling area, especially on Saturdays.\nThe Covered Market may be accessed via the four entrances on the High Street, via Golden Cross (from Cornmarket), and from three entrances on Market Street.\nIn 2017, Oxford City Council, which owns the Covered Market, announced a \u00a31.6m investment in the fabric of the building, including roof repairs, improved public conveniences, external paving and new signage.In May 2017, the Covered Market received 'the Royal seal of approval' when it was visited by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.\n\n\n== Images of inside the Covered Market ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Oxford Covered Market\nBonner's Oxford, Greengrocer in The Covered Market since 1952\nVirtual Tour of the Oxford City Covered Market\nThe Covered Market, High Street, Oxford\nCovered Market Video Tour\nWalk the avenues of The Oxford Covered Market on Google Street View",

          "This place is a hidden gem well worth spending some time wandering around. A fantastic mix of little shops and cafes. Jewellers, Florists, Cake Decorators, Clothes, it has it all.",
          "The Oxford Covered Market is a great place to kill a few hours visiting interesting local shops that are not big chains. Some of the most interesting shops sell fresh meat and produce which sadly if you don't have access to a kitchen for cooking make you wish for access to a",

          "This is a great little market to potter around and do some window shopping, or indeed some real shopping, and there is tons to choose from; food, clothes, household, cakes, pies, crap, toys. Loved the place, think it's worth visiting just for a look about, but also a great",
          "Was directed to the market by a local who suggested it would be good to look around and how right they were. There are over 50 stalls and toilets just outside. You can find some places to eat and a great little bar. The mix of stalls is eclectic with florists, cheese shop,",

          "Your typical market with a variety of stalls. Plenty of history associated with the market. Worth a walk through.",

          "We found a bunch of really cool shops and places to eat at the covered market. Unfortunately we got there right after Christmas and many of the shops were closed from the 25th to the 29th. We definitely plan to go back.",
          "This is a surprisingly cool place! It's very well maintained, there's lots of nice independent shops, some fresh produce stalls, a couple of restaurants and a great pie shop. The specialty coffee house was jammed when I was there. And, if you are into award winning chocolates,",
          "Nice place with many cafe serving local fare like pies, fish & chips, pastries and full breakfast. There is also a Thai and Korean food place. Tried Thai - as good as it can be in Oxford (they even have chilli padi in fish sauce). Was thrilled to see real Christmas trees on sale",
          "There is a real diversity here, with lots of independent shops, from florists to butchers to clothes and gifts. I did quite a lot of Christmas shopping here and found some lovely gifts for people. We were very pleased.",

          "We read the reviews online of places to visit in oxford so we gave it a try . It\u2019s a nice place to have coffee, breakfast or lunch. They have a few coffee places .\u201d, Thai , giros, flower shop but our favourite was the Korean . Give it a try",
          "I went to this little cafe with my girlfriend one busy Saturday afternoon in Nov and I was starving hungry. ... perhaps I was hangry... I certainly was kinda angry when I left. I had a full English breakfast and she had guacamole on sourdough. I should\u2019ve listened to my",
          "Today's real autumn here, the air a little bit colder than yesterday. A walk along the Closed Food Market warms the body and spirit. Lots different shops selling many kind of foods and other goods. In autumn you can find and many sort of pampkins.Thanks to the beguiling that",
          "The Covered Market used to be one of the top attractions in Oxford - bursting with quirly independent shops such as butchers, fishmongers and delis that offered a different shopping experience. Alas no more - especially in the last year many of the interesting shops have closed",

          "I was in that shop last August while I was walking around Oxford. There are some lovely clothes, accessories and jewellery. I bought a beautiful skirt! Nicole and Lily are so kind and nice. If you go to the Covered Market and you have to \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb make a visit to Fresh! You will love",
          "We read up about this as an attraction,but it really wasn't worth the visit.Spend your time on something much more interesting in Oxford",
          "A visit (or, more likely, repeat visits, once you've worked out whether any of the stalls float your boat...) is well worth while for two reasons. The first is 'cos its a central (very!) part of Oxford's shopping experience and no visit to the city is complete without an hour or",
          "I lived close by for a number of years, returning to find a third of the shops closed, a shame! Fruit & veg, Main butchers, fish mongers, shoe shops all gone. What\u2019s going to happen to the Xmas displays of festive fare, wild boar, venison, un-plucked turkeys, game & pork festive",
          "Wandered around here to get out of the rain. They have a lot of varied shops and the food stalls (especially the savory take-away pies) all looked really good. I would absolutely visit again.",

          "Nice to visit some different and authentic stores in the shade this summer. Only ended up buying a cookie at Bens (average good cookie, but a bit over-hyped).",
          "A good range of small shops and cafes. Refreshing change from high street chains. Good place to duck out of the rain",
          "The Covered Market is easy to get to in Central Oxford, from the High Street, Cornmarket, or Market Street. When you walk in, you enter a different world, a lovely old wooden ceilinged building, first built in 1774, with some further work in the 19th century. There are a",
          "lots of lovely fruit and veg, right in the middle of the city. good butchers next to the veg stand, and wonderful value and freshness.",

          "So many diverse and different shops and stalls, some have stood the test of time and have been around for years. It was liking walking back in time, I found the whole experience fun. Surrounded by colour, textures, shapes, history, it was definitely worth a stroll. I couldn't",
          "This market has a very good range of shops, food stalls and cafes. We enjoyed wandering around taking in all the smells and the vibrant atmosphere. We decided to have a coffee at the Colombia Coffee Roasters and to be honest it was a bit disappointing as the service was slow",
          "Nice to walk through, queued for a wrap and it was worth the wait. Perfect and delicious with the chips added in the wrap it was more like a gyro than a standard wrap.",
          "Whilst the Covered Market is still a \u2018must see\u2019 in Oxford, the closure of many businesses and the boarding up of previously vibrant shops is sad to see. Nonetheless it is certainly worth a visit and there are plenty of quirky little stores for the curious shopper. Leather goods,",
          "Having been to a couple great markets in London, this was a little disappointing. We couldn't find any lunch there so we just walked through. The cake shop was fascinating to watch through their windows - I recommend checking it out. Maybe if we'd had more time to wander",
          "Very beautiful market indeed , after visiting you realise how ugly the other markets are. The main beauty is in the roof and matching shop fonts.",
          "I love all the handmade, Indian, cake, shoe, framing shops and caf\u00e9s. Small and very cozy little market with kind people in all the shops. Very variegated, so different than other markets. Just love it.",
          "Previous visits to this market, when in Oxfords have been enjoyable, The premises looked very tired and disheveled, and we could get out quickly enough. Shame as this used to be a place of charm. Need a big spruce up",
          "Not really a place to spend much time, unless you are hungry as there are mainly food shops and cafes here. had a stroll around but was expecting lots of fresh food stalls and artisan goods and there wasn't anything like that except for a fruit and veg stall.",
          "Lots of lovely little shops to visit that sell things you won\u2019t find on the high street. Great for gift buying! Also many places to chose from in terms of food, from Thai to ice cream to fresh fruit and cheese. Definitely worth a visit",
          "I live in Oxford and have visited this market for many years. My favourite places are the Cake shop where you can watch the decorators at work and buy mini cakes off the shelf. The cheese shop has a fantastic range of British and European cheeses and Fellers butchers have",

          "If you are in downtown Oxford, you need to stop at the Covered Market. So many fun shops and restaurants, you can easily spend a couple of hours wandering around. Most everything in the market closes in the afternoon so I recommend heading there in the morning right when it",
          "Many shops disappeared during the past few years but we still improve the sense of feeling three centuries ago in this unique and living site. Some shops are unmissable : the cakes shop with wonderful creations for all events; the groceries and the butchers of course too.",

          "Fun place to walk through. Fun shops, eats, drinks, and cookies! Ben's Cookies alone are worth a stop. Ask for the warm cookies! The shops are very eclectic, so you should find something that interests you. The overall area is not huge. Particularly good place to be if it's",
          "A wonderful little covered shopping centre in the heart of Oxford containing a mixtures of little shops and cafes selling a wide variety of goods. The market dates back to the 1770's and is clean and very well maintained with very pleasant store holders. There is a red post box",
          "This is one of Oxfords hidden treasures. A great mix of little shops and right near the ed of our visit to Oxford it proved to be the saviour (we were looking for a presents for my partners nephew and this came up trumps where many other places had failed). It's a very unique",
          "This is a very old covered market in the centre of Oxford - particularly beautiful at Christmas time - take time to find the red Post Box at the centre. Some brilliant shops with food being a real theme but not all that you will find - take time to visit Deli France for food,",
          "Love stopping at the Covered Market to have a browse and pick up some treats. Excellent, strong coffee at Columbia Coffee Roasters, good bargains at Next to Nothing, and lovely home scents at Oxford Aromatics. Also delish food at Alpha Bar! Definitely all worth a visit and",
          "It's hidden away but there are some real gems in here. Try Ben's Cookie's (my kids still talk about the cookies from this place), the Ice-cream/Chocolate shop (IS Cream), Sasi's Thai (great for lunch). There are some good quality organic butchers in here too (M Feller & Sons)",
          "This is neglected a bit, not many things here. Most of the things here, you can buy in any supermarket.",
          "Explored the market and enjoyed a late lunch here, picking up some produce for snacks on our travels. While iconic, I was a little underwhelmed. Though I did get quite excited to later see it featured in an episode of Lewis when I was able to identify specific shops we had",
          "The best place to shop if you want flowers, cheese cakes etc. A special mention to The Garden flower shop (and the very helpful David) who provided us with fabulous flowers for our daughter's graduation.",
          "The place is nice and some of the buildings seem to be very old. Yet it is clean and does not smell bad, like other covered places often do. The shops are okay and the food smells really great.",
          "There are interesting shops and an amazing array of food, so it's a great place to wander, rain or shine. We had the hardest time deciding what to eat, there were so many amazing food choices!",
          "Nothing special than all the other covered city markets. I expect that it will be better (scenic, bigger and picturesque) according to the unique beauty of Oxford. You will find there all kind of shops, cafes and food court. The market is in the heart of the city (High Str), so",
          "I love this market . Its been part of Oxford since time immemorial ! Recently it has become more for' boutique type' shops and less of the' practical type 'as it once was . Its still a very nice historic place to visit . Recently Ive noticed that it has many interesting cafes",

          "We visited here as part of an amble through the centre of Oxford. Plenty of small shops ranging from jewellers and baby clothes shops, through to a very large butchers and an Oxford FC shop. An eclectic mix!",
          "What a busy place this is with a variety of little shops all inside, so you can keep dry on a wet day! The fruit and veg looked delicious, there were handbags, shoes, places to eat, butchers, pie & cake shops, charming little boutiques... go and see the place for yourself!",
          "We came here on Sunday and not many places were open but you can still amazing places ! I recommend Columbian Toasters and a little stand with delicious raw vegan cakes (their chocolate and mint raw cake is absolutely wonderful!!!)",

          "Some very interesting shops; the chocolate shop aptly named Wicked carries several types and kinds of chocolate. All of them very tasty! Watching the cake decorators or the butchers in the butcher shop is quite interesting! There is a great Aromatic Shop which has lovely bath",
          "The covered markets date back to the 1770s and consist of permanent stalls set up in mini-shops within the market building. It is dark and the walkways very narrow, but the mixture of artisan shops within the market is great. As markets go, these are not the best around.",
          "A nice example of a traditional market with something for locals and tourists alike. A good selection of jewellery, bags and clothing plus cafes and food stalls. Definitely worth a look.",
          "Pretty much exactly what I expected from a covered market, except it was a lot bigger! Definitely recommend going for a browse :)",
          "Not worth visiting on a Sunday as very few stalls open. Returned on Monday but was quite disappointed. An eclectic mix of stalls. The cake makers/decorators at work was interesting to watch though.",
          "I am NOT saying that you will see them here. But I did, one weekday at noon in May. According to the Court Calendar, they were in Oxford on other business. Apparently, they ducked into the Covered Market because they knew a business owner there, according to someone in the crowd",
          "We were wandering around Oxford and had a quick look in here. It's very charming all the little shops in here. There's this cake shop with big windows and you can see how the cake being decorated. I find that very cute! There's some cafes, butchers, hat shop etc. We're glad to",

          "Definitely worth a visit when in Oxford. Lots of interesting one-off stores, I particularly liked the tea store. Plenty of variety if you are looking for something fun to take home as a gift.",
          "The covered market is lovely, it's less stall and more little retail units. The units range from cafe to barber and from butcher to celebration cake makers it really is an eclectic mix. It's quirky and definitely worth a look but it won't take you long to look round it.",
          "A very nice place to visit for an hour or so. Lots of nice little places to eat. Boutique butchers, pie shops etc.",
          "It's not like a northern market with lots of stalls selling cheap bargain goods. Here it is more a selection of shops selling good quality items with a few food outlets and the odd service such as a barbers. I wandered around late on Saturday morning and a number of the places",
          "The main attractions in this market are the small boutiques and artisanal shops scattered throughout. It's more like an arcade than a traditional covered market in that regard, and certainly worth wandering around to do some window shopping. Well placed in the centre but less",
          "Great place to walk around, especially at Christmas time. Loved coming here as a child and still coming back with my own family. A good selection of independent shops, cafes and food stalls, butchers and florists.",

          "We were members of a large tour group and we had been allocated 90 minutes of free time to have a look around central Oxford. We consulted a tour map and saw the Oxford Market highlighted on there. Consequently, we decided to take a quick look. The indoor market has a fascinated",

          "If you are in Oxford and looking for good coffee and tea or ice cream the covered market is the place to go. There are also good butchers there and some vegetable shops and a french cheese shop. There are also some places to eat and some clothes shops. Most of them offer high",

          "This was recommended by a friend but it's not great or unusual. Very few fruit and veg. Mostly expensive. shops that could easily be in the main high street . Not a real' market in my opinion. Markets should be vibrant, cheap , lively and full of characters on stalls. Don't",
          "I would guess that quite a few visitors to Oxford on a short term basis, manage to miss this gem of the city. It's been a part of me since my childhood, more than 60 years ago, and when I returned to Oxford to visit again recently, it still possessed all the sights, sounds and",

          "I always pay a visit here when in Oxford. it s not the most beautiful architecturally but is very charming and was established in 1774 as far as I can remember. It is a proper working market that is not too touristy with some great local businesses especially fruit and",

          "Yum! Lots of goodies here. We enjoyed the Cornish Pasties at the Meat Market...very reasonable and a quick, walk-away lunch! Bought some tea at the tea shop. One suggestion...if you're buying tea to bring home by plane make sure that it is package not loose!",

          "Oxford\u2019s 18th century covered market is slightly odd. A market will generally have some sort of theme - food market, clothes market, antiques market - but here it is rather a mish-mash of unrelated shops, and it is difficult to know who its regular customers might be. A visitor",
          "We took a trip there on Sunday, most of the shops were closed, but still there were some cafes and treat stores open, a chocolate and ice cream store seemed to be pretty busy, there was a long queue along a smoothie bar, there was also a very tiny Chinese restaurant, as well as",

          "Not what I expected. The covered market has an array of lovely stalls, restaurants and cafes., with a variety of shops. Different to the normal indoor markets in the UK, which are more akin to a car boot sale. This was different, clean, tidy and more like shops then stalls.",
          "This is an old facility with many shops inside. There are butcher shops, restaurants, bakeries, a cobbler, and many more shops. There are about three main aisles to go in and walk through to explore,all the shops.",
          "Take to time / opportunity to wonder around the Covered Market with it's varity of shops. Quite a few can be expensive but offer items not available in high street shops. Quite a few cafes that offer a vast aray of different foods that should appeal to all. It is a very popular",

          "I can only rate the market based on our personal experience, and for us visiting on a Sunday, it was totally lacklustre. The problem was with no advance warning or advice otherwise, we discovered the place was virtually deserted with less than half of the shops/outlets open. So",
          "This historic market was opened in 1774 and is still in operation today. Located in High Street, it is a large covered structure with most stalls selling food, greengrocers, butchers and also stalls selling souvenirs. There are also a couple of bakeries and cafes. Centrally",

          "If you're a Yank, you're accustomed to mega malls. This market's claim to fame is that it was established in 1774 \u2013 before our nation was established. So we Yanks have nothing on Brits as far as shopping goes \u2013 except our bazillion mega malls. You know where I'm going. This",

          "Whenever visiting Oxford I always try to visit this most interesting market and it is a good place to take shelter on a freezing or rainy day. As others have noted here there is a varied selection of shops/units. Most of what's on offer is of high quality; there isn't much 'tat'",
          "I love these covered markets, they have atmosphere, a range of shops as well as places to eat. I just wish I lived in Oxford to enjoy the fish, fresh groceries and meat, not to mention the cheese, on a more regular basis. It was hard to find a place to eat when I just wanted a",

          "I was fortunate to get to spend 5 weeks in Oxford this past summer with my family, and the Covered Market was a wonderful source of meals both there and prepared at home. There are several fantastic butchers and two great green-grocers, along with a french cheese shop that also",

      "name": "The Sheldonian Theatre",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Sheldonian Theatre, located in Oxford, England, was built from 1664 to 1669 after a design by Christopher Wren for the University of Oxford. The building is named after Gilbert Sheldon, chancellor of the University at the time and the project's main financial backer. It is used for music concerts, lectures and University ceremonies, but not for drama until 2015 when the Christ Church Dramatic Society staged a production of The Crucible by Arthur Miller.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWhat came to be known as the Sheldonian Theatre was Wren's second work and was commissioned by Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury. With the triumph of the Restoration and with it the Church of England, Dean Fell, Vice-Chancellor of the University, sought to revive a project proposed in the 1630s by the late William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury: a separate building whose sole use would be graduation and degree ceremonies.\nIn the past these increasingly rowdy occasions had taken place in the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, in the High Street. \"The notion that 'sacrifice is made equally to God and Apollo', in the same place where homage was due to God and God alone, was as repugnant to Fell and his colleagues as it had been to Laud\"; with this in mind they approached the Archbishop of Canterbury Gilbert Sheldon, for his blessing, his assistance, and a donation.\nSheldon was forthcoming with all three. He initially gave an impressive \u00a31,000 (\u00a3154,128 today) and pledged to gather the needed money from like-minded sponsors. He had little luck, however, and ultimately financed nearly the entire \u00a314,470 (\u00a32,230,228 today) himself, in an age where a mid-level craftsman's wage was typically between \u00a32 and \u00a34 per year.\nWren's initial designs for the Sheldonian probably included a proscenium stage that did not survive his revisions. The building that was constructed was a sharp, unmistakable break from the Gothic past. According to Wren's son, Wren designed the Sheldonian based on Serlio's sixteenth-century engraving of the D-shaped Theatre of Marcellus erected in Rome in the first century BC.Like any Mediterranean theatre of that time, the Theatre of Marcellus had no roof: the audience relied on a temporary awning for inclement weather. But 17th century Oxford was not ancient Rome, and the Theatre needed a permanent roof. The span of the D-shaped roof was over 70 feet (21 m). However, no timbers existed that were long enough to cross that distance, and Wren dismissed the obvious solution of a Gothic roof. Instead, he decided to use the \"geometrical flat floor\" grid developed twenty years before by Oxford professor John Wallis.\nIt involved\n\n... creating a series of trusses which were built up from shorter section[s] and held in place by their own weight, with help from judiciously placed iron bolts and plates ... [S]o effective [was the roof] that for nearly a century the University Press stored its books ..., and for many years it was the largest unsupported floor in existence ...\n\nIn 1720, surveyors inspecting the roof, following a rumour that it was no longer safe, were both surprised and impressed at what they discovered. Though sagging slightly from the massive weight of books, the inspectors pronounced that \"... the whole Fabrick of the said Theatre is, in our Opinion, like[ly] to remain and continue in such Repair and Condition, for one hundred or two hundred Years yet to come.\"In November 2008 a four-year project to restore the ceiling fresco was completed. The thirty-two oil on canvas panels originally painted by King Charles II\u2019s court painter, Robert Streater, were removed and conserved. As part of the conservation process, the panels had their linings replaced, holes in the canvas mended, and over-painting removed. The allegorical story depicted in the paintings shows Truth descending upon the Arts and Sciences and expelling ignorance from the University.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\nThe building has a prominent eight-sided cupola in the centre of the roof, which is accessible via a staircase leading to the dome over the main ceiling. The cupola has large windows on all sides, providing views across central Oxford, and is open to visitors.\nThe Theatre is used for music recitals, lectures (such as the annual Romanes Lecture), conferences, and for various ceremonies held by the University (such as graduation and matriculation). Handel conducted the first performance of his third oratorio Athalia here in 1733. Today, the theatre is home to regular performances by local groups, including the Oxford Philomusica and Stornoway. The latter were the first ever pop band to play in the space, joined by the student-led Oxford Millennium Orchestra for their first single launch in 2009, then again to celebrate the launch of their third LP, in 2014.\n\nThe building seats between 800 and 1000 people and is on the grounds of part of the Bodleian Library adjacent to Broad Street. To the left at the front is the Clarendon Building and to the right is the Old Ashmolean Building. Behind the Sheldonian is the Divinity School.\n\nThe Theatre features prominently in Max Beerbohm's 1911 novel Zuleika Dobson and was used as stand in for Harvard in the 1980 film Heaven's Gate.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHolywell Music Room\nOxford Bach Choir\nOxford University Big Band\nOxford Philomusica\nStornoway (band)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Sheldonian Theatre at Wikimedia Commons\n\nSheldonian Theatre website",

          "Awesome and beautiful inside and out",
          "Such a historic building it gives you goose bumps. Don't expect comfy seats - some sections have benches with no back, so your knees are in the person in front's back, but the view and acoustics are great. Try not to bring a large bag or big coat as there isn't much room. Make sure you look at the ceiling!",

          "Fantastic for its history and simply the tradition of the place. I would recommend against sitting anywhere but floor level if you're greater than 6 ft. The seating in the rafters is not designed for the modern day person.",
          "Nice venue, steeped in history.",
          "A bit disappointing and small, much like the Cambridge equivalent, the Senate House, and similarly policed by Jobsworths. Heating is distinctly absent...",
          "The building is interesting, old but not too glamorous or magnificent. The top tower has a nice view and that's it. The main room is simple and useful, not as a common theater. ",
          "Beautiful building, the acoustics worked well for the concert. On the downside, don't be 6'+  (or come very very early (well before doors) to get a floor seat) as leg room is tight (the row behind me had so little room it was hard to shuffle sideways along it when empty) - I was so jammed in I started to lose circulation.",

          "Wrens first building.",

        "wiki": "The University Church of St Mary the Virgin  (St Mary's or SMV for short) is an Oxford church situated on the north side of the High Street. It is the centre from which the University of Oxford grew and its parish consists almost exclusively of university and college buildings.\nSt Mary's possesses an eccentric baroque porch, designed by Nicholas Stone, facing High Street, and a spire which is claimed by some church historians to be one of the most beautiful in England. Radcliffe Square lies to the north and to the east is Catte Street. The 13th-century tower is open to the public for a fee and provides good views across the heart of the historic university city, especially Radcliffe Square, the Radcliffe Camera, Brasenose College, Oxford and All Souls College.\n\n\n== History ==\nA church was established on this site, at the centre of the old walled city, in Anglo-Saxon times; records of 1086 note the church as previously belonging to an estate held by Aubrey de Coucy, likely Iffley, and the parish including part of Littlemore.In the early days of Oxford University, the church was adopted as the first building of the university, congregation met there from at least 1252, and by the early 13th century it was the seat of university government and was used for lectures and the award of degrees. Around 1320 a two-storey building was added to the north side of the chancel \u2014 the ground floor (now the Vaults cafe) became the \"convocation\" house used by university parliament, and the upper storey housed books bequeathed by Thomas Cobham, Bishop of Worcester, which formed the first university library.When Adam de Brome became rector in 1320 the church's fortune became linked to what would later become Oriel College. In 1324 Brome founded St Mary Hall and appropriated the church's rectory house, including small tithes, oblations and burial dues for the college, an act confirmed in 1326 by the bishop, Henry Burghersh, after Brome had got Edward II's patronage to refound the college. Brome diverted the revenues of the church to his college, which thereafter was responsible for appointing the vicar and providing four chaplains to celebrate the daily services in the church. Early provosts of the college were inducted into their stall in the church, and until 1642 fellows were required to attend services on Sundays and holy days.St Mary's was the site of the 1555 trial of the Oxford Martyrs, when the bishops Latimer and Ridley and the Archbishop Cranmer, were tried for heresy. The martyrs were imprisoned at the former Bocardo Prison near St Michael at the Northgate in Cornmarket Street and subsequently burnt at the stake just outside the city walls to the north. A cross set into the road marks that location on what is now Broad Street, the nearby Martyrs' Memorial, at the south end of St Giles', commemorates the events.\nA section cut out of \"Cranmer's Pillar\" remains from the morning of Cranmer's death on 21 March 1556 when he was brought to the church for a sermon from Henry Cole, Provost of Eton College, who on Mary I's instructions, spelled out the reasons why he must die. Cranmer stood on a stage, the corner of which was supported by a small shelf cut from the pillar opposite the pulpit; withdrawing his recantations of his Reformed beliefs, he swore that when he was burnt, the hand which had signed them would be the first to burn.Until the 17th century, the church was used not only for prayers but also for increasingly rowdy graduation and degree ceremonies. This phenomenon, \"The notion that 'sacrifice is made equally to God and Apollo', in the same place where homage was due to God and God alone\" was repugnant to William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, who in the 1630s initiated the erecting of a separate building for these ceremonies. This project was cut short by the fall of Laud and the outbreak of the English Civil War, but after the Restoration it was revived and carried through by John Fell, Dean of Christ Church, who commissioned Christopher Wren to erect what became the Sheldonian Theatre. Thereafter, the church was reserved for religious worship only.\nDuring his time in Oxford, John Wesley often attended the university sermon, and later, as a fellow of Lincoln College preached sermons in the church, including the university sermon on \"Salvation by Faith\" on 18 June 1738  and the \"Almost Christian\" sermon  on 25 July 1741. Following his denunciation of the spiritual apathy and sloth of the senior members of the University in his sermon \"Scriptural Christianity\" on 24 August 1744, he was never asked to preach there again \u2014 \"I preached, I suppose, the last time at St Mary's,\" he wrote in his journal, \"Be it so; I have fully delivered my soul.\"In 1828 John Henry Newman became vicar and his sermons became popular with undergraduates. From the present pulpit John Keble preached the assize sermon of 14 July 1833, which is considered to have started the Oxford Movement, an attempt to revive catholic spirituality in the church and university. The influence of the movement spread and affected the practice and spirituality of the Church of England. By 1843, Newman became disillusioned with Anglicanism and resigned from St Mary's, later joining the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nIn the later 15th and early 16th century the main body of the church was substantially rebuilt in the Perpendicular style, but the oldest part of the present church is the tower, which dates from around 1270. The Decorated spire with its triple-gabled outer pinnacles, inner pinnacles, gargoyles and statues was added in the 1320s. Only one of the twelve statues is original, the others were by George Frampton and erected around 1894. The original statues can now be found in the cloister of New College. The tower is plainer, having long three light bell openings with intersecting tracery. The architect is unknown, though the master mason in 1275 was Richard of Abingdon.\n\nThe south porch was built in 1637 and was designed by Nicholas Stone, master mason to Charles I. It was a gift from Dr Morgan Owen, chaplain to Archbishop Laud. It is highly ornate, with spiral columns supporting a curly pediment framing a shell niche with a statue of the Virgin and Child, underneath a gothic fan vault. The style was too close to Roman baroque for the puritans of the day and the porch itself was used as evidence in Laud's execution trial, citing its 'scandalous statue' to which one witness saw 'one bow and another pray'. The gate piers are original and the wrought iron gates are early 18th century. The bullet holes in the statue were made by Cromwellian troopers.Around 1328 a chapel was added, now the outer north aisle, by the rector, Adam de Brome. The chancel was rebuilt around 1462 by Walter Hart, Bishop of Norwich, the nave and aisles were rebuilt around 1490 by the university with donations from Henry VII and several bishops whose arms decorate the nave. The north wall of de Brome's chapel and the congregation house were remodelled in the Perpendicular style around 1510, and new windows were added to match the others in the church. Around the same time, St Thomas chantry, now a vestry, was added. The nave and aisle windows have panel tracery and flamboyant battlemented parapets with gargoyles and pinnacles.\n\nThe interior space has six-bay arcades with shafted piers, between the clerestory windows are canopied niches with archangels holding shields. The roof has traceried spandrels, the chancel has transomed windows, the sedilia is decorated with cusped arches and a frieze of vine leaves. The reredos is 15th century and contains seven ornamental canopied niches containing statues of 1933. Restorations were carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1856-57 and 1861\u201362 and by Sir Thomas Graham Jackson in 1894, the parapet and pinnacles are mostly Scott's work. De Brome's chapel has a two-bay arcade with continuous hollow chamfered arches with Perpendicular windows. The tall arch in this aisle, connecting with the tower is a 15th-century remodelling of a late 13th century window.\n\nMonuments include a slab with indents of a brass cross and the Virgin and Child, thought to commemorate Adam de Brome, from 1332, though the tomb chest is modern. The wall monuments in the nave and chancel are from the late 17th century and 18th century. The floor slab to Amy Robsart, wife of Robert Dudley, is modern.\nThe church furnishings were refitted in 1826-28 with gothic pews and galleries, the canopied pulpit, the font and Chancellor's throne under the west gallery were designed by Thomas Plowman. The chancel has late 15th stalls, the panelling supporting Francesco Bassano the Younger's painting of 'The Adoration of the Shepherds' is late 17th century, the communion rail is from around 1675. The de Brome chapel has early 18th century panelling and Chancellor's throne.\nThere are remnants of 15th century stained glass in the tracery lights of the east window, and 17th century shields in the de Brome Chapel. The east window and second from east in the south aisle were designed by Augustus Pugin. The west window in the nave is from 1891 and was designed by C.E. Kempe, the memorial window to John Keble is by Clayton and Bell in 1866.\n\n\n== Organ ==\n\nThe church has a classical organ built by the Swiss firm of Metzler Orgelbau in 1986, one of only two by this esteemed maker in Great Britain. (The other is in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge.) This instrument was inspired by a previous instrument, originally built for the church by the famed organ builder \"Father\" Smith in 1676. Much altered over the years, the last remains of this original organ (besides some fragments of ornamental casework and, possibly, part of one stop) were destroyed by a fire shortly after the Second World War. The Metzler organ replaced this instrument's successor \u2014 an organ by J. W. Walker & Sons that was contained in the restored old case, originally by Smith but extensively rebuilt in a 'gothic' style in 1827 by Plowman. The pipework and case of this organ are now in St Mary's Church, Penzance, Cornwall.\nThe unstained oak case of the Metzler organ is based on the original Smith design and incorporates a few carved wooden pipe shades that remained after the 1827 case rebuild and later fire. It still lacks certain decorative carvings from the original design by Bernhardt Edskes, most notably the large scrolls beneath the pedal towers on the four corners.\nKoppeln: I/II, I/P, II/P\n\n\n== Present ==\n\nThe current vicar of St Mary's is the Revd Dr William Lamb. Revd James Crockford is the assistant priest. Robert Howarth is the director of music and the organist is James Brown. The churchwardens are Megan Roper and Nicholas Hardyman. The main Sunday service is at 10:30 am. During university terms services are enhanced by the choir of the University Church and by many notable visiting preachers.\nThe church is open to visitors throughout the year from 9:00 am \u2013 5:00 pm (July and August 9:00 am \u2013 6:00 pm), except on Christmas Day and Boxing Day when it only opens for advertised services. On Sundays the tower does not open until after the morning services.\nA German Lutheran service is held on the first Sunday of each month (except January and August).\n\n\n== List of Vicars ==\n\nThe following have served as Vicar of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin:\n\n1345-1348: Nicholas Misterton\n1349-1351: Robert de Tyrlington\n1351-1360: Nicholas de Bannebury\n1361-1379: Thomas Warde de Beronby\n1379-1384: John de Prestwold\n1384-1395: John de Ashfordeby\n1395-1413: John Treen\n1413-1438: John Plomer\n1438-1453: John Cothill\n1453-1461: William Scrivener\n1461-1466: Robert Careswell\n1466-1483: William Laughton\n1483-1485: Robert Offer\n1485-1487: Richard Ludwick\n1487-1488: William Westcott\n1488-1498: Clement Browne\n1498-1504: Edmund Wylsford\n1504-1527: John Roper\n1527-1434: William Appulby\n1534-1535: John Pitt\n1535-1551: George Sutton\n1551-1554: John Tonnery\n1554-1556: Hugh Hutchinson\n1556-1578: William Powell\n1578-1582: Stephen Rowsham\n1582-1583: Robert Cooke\n1583-1597: Simon Lee\n1597-1608: Richard Wharton\n1608-1622: John Day\n1622-1638: John Taylor\n1638-1639: John Horne\n1639-1646: Henry Eccleston\n1646-1648: John Duncombe\n1648-1650: James Tarren\n1650-1656: William Bragge\n1656-1676: William Washbourne\n1676-1693: Robert Kinsey\n1693-1700: William Walker\n1700-1720: Peter Randall\n1720-1754: Thomas Weeksy\n1754-1754: Charles Whiting\n1754-1758: Edward Blake\n1758-1765: John Trewen\n1765-1768: John Clark\n1768-1774: William Walker\n1774-1778: John Flemyng\n1778-1782: John Eveleigh\n1782-1790: Henry Beeke\n1790-1796: Daniel Veysie\n1796-1797: George Cooke\n1797-1800: James Landon\n1800-1810: Edward Copleston\n1810-1819: William Bishop\n1819-1823: William James\n1823-1828: Edward Hawkins\n1828\u20131843: John Henry Newman; later a Roman Catholic cardinal\n1843\u20131850: Charles Page Eden\n1850\u20131858: Charles Marriott\n1863\u20131875: John Burgon\n1876-1878: Drummond Percy Chase\n1878\u20131894: Edmund Ffoulkes\n1894\u20131896 : Cosmo Gordon Lang; later Archbishop of Canterbury\n1896-1905: Henry Lewis Thompson\n1905-1923: Charles Augustus Whittuck\n1923-1927: George Chatterton Richards\n1927-1933: Frank Russell Barry\n1933-1938: Frederic Arthur Cockin\n1938\u20131947: Dick Milford\n1947-1961: Roy Stuart Lee\n1961-1971: Philip Montague Martin\n1971\u20131975: Ronald Gordon; later Bishop of Portsmouth and at Lambeth\n1976\u20131985: Peter Raphael Cornwell; later a Roman Catholic priest\n1986\u20132016: Brian Mountford\n2017\u2013present: William Lamb\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe University Church of St Mary the Virgin official website\nPhoto and other information on OxfordCityGuide.com\nBritainExpress information\n360\u00b0 Panorama of interiors",

          "Well it is one of the landmarks of the city, and stands out in High St, but as churches go it's not so impressive. It's a solid stone building, but inside seems, well, average. Perhaps I am not comparing like with like - it's not impressive like Christ Church cathedral, but",

          "We got here pretty early to beat the crowds and glad we did, as the journey up (and it really is a journey) would be pretty terrifying with more people involved! You ascend a very narrow, very steep winding staircase until you reach the top of the tower which is also extremely",

          "It was a freezing day when we went, but this is well worth a visit. You can climb the tower for a view of the \"Dreaming Spires\", but it was in cloud and we did not. Amazing stained glass, organ, ancient original woodwork, woodworm and all. Go look, but pick a warm and clear day.",
          "I climbed St Mary's tower and was not disappointed. You will see amazing views of Radcliffe Camera, the University and Oxford itself. It cost \u00a34. I would go either early in the morning or before it closed to avoid queues though as the staircases are only wide enough for one",

          "This church is well worth a visit during your stay in Oxford. We didn't make it up the tower as the queue was huge, but walking round the interior was rewarding. Information boards (that may be a bit over-egging them) tell you about the Oxford martyrs, the development of the",
          "If you are able to climb all the stairs, this is worth it!! It has the most beautiful skyline view of the university.",
          "For a small payment you get to climb the tower ... but it is NOT for the faint hearted. Near the top the staircase is quite steep and very narrow so one at a time only! But you get spectacular views.",
          "The lure of this church was definitely the view from the top. It can get pretty crowded because the actual viewpoint is quite narrow, but if you're willing to wait a few minutes and fork over 4 pounds then it's worth it. Some amazing views of Oxford. I wasn't too enamoured with",
          "Probably best explored with the aid of a guide or a guidebook, this important yet small Church is a real \"hybrid\" of Church of England and Catholic traditions. Well worth a visit.",
          "A must do activity. For 1 pound, take the long narrow staircase to the top of the tower to get excellent views of the surrounds.",
          "I studied at Oxford fifty years ago and I am ashamed to say that I had never been to the University Church until this year. It is on the High Street behind the Sheldonian and it has the most wonderful tower. The church is spacious and airy and I can understand why it was full",
          "Not too strenuous climb. Very narrow stairs, must wait for others to come down before going up. Great views to take pictures of Radcliffe Camera in particular.",
          "I'm not a religious person but I can appreciate a nice little church. The craftsmanship is impressive and it has some fine artwork. We were a bit early so the tower wasn't open yet which was a shame but still worth a short stop when visiting Oxford.",
          "I didn't have long and just popped in here when I was passing, it is a very beautiful church and next time I am in Oxford I will be back to explore further and to climb the clock tower.",
          "It is very close to all colleges of the University of Oxford. Fantastic arcquitecture. One of the main points for turistic atraction in Oxford.",
          "Visited a week ago with hubby whilst touring Oxford. A beautiful and well looked after church. We happened to visit when an orchestral rehearsal was in progress and the sound was incredible. We climbed the Clock Tower and had stunning views across Sheldonian Theatre, All",
          "I adore this church. It's right on the High Street and so much history happened here. The trial of Cranmer, Latimer and Ridley is enough. Go up the tower too. There used to be a sign, but no longer, about Robert Burton, author of the Anatomy of Melancholy, who is buried here.",
          "Peaceful cathedral to spend some time in. Tower well worth the climb as it has the best views in Oxford. Friendly staff and great for photos.. Well priced cafe with outstanding coffees.",
          "Being a tad claustrophobic, the climb up the very narrow staircase and extremely tight corridors were a challenge for me, but in the end, with some deep breathing and an encouraging husband, the view over all of Oxford, the spires and courtyards, were worth the climb and yielded",
          "Oxford is of course full of history. Every building, each college vies for stories that each outdo the other. The University Church sits surrounded by some of the most historic and magnificent buildings that Oxford has to offer. But it is not to be outdone. It used to be the",

          "I wasn't all that interested in the church per se but climbing it's tower does offer an amazing 360-degree view of Oxford. The obligatory touristy photo of Bodleian library shall be taken on top of its tower as well. To climb the tower you gotta fork out 5 pounds. Reconsider if",
          "Very interesting church. Loved that we did not have to pay to get in and see it. Climb to the bell tower was fun! Stairway was very narrow. Great sites of Oxford from the top!",
          "The church itself is free to explore and it's really very beautiful. Worth a walk inside for the church alone but for \u00a34.00 per adult you can climb the tower. You don't need to be particularly fit but do need to be comfortable on a narrow circular stone staircase and with very",
          "A really interesting church which goes back hundreds of years. Fantastic blue ceiling with gold stars, although a modern addition it is lovely. The stained glass is spectacular. Certainly worth a visit.",
          "A visit to the University Church of St. Mary the Virgin is worthwhile on three counts. 1. Standing in a place where believers have worshiped for centuries is awe-inspiring. 2. The place of this church in the history of the English Reformation is noteworthy (Thomas Cranmer left",
          "Peaceful place to be. Nice to pray and have relaxing time from the busy road of Oxford. Oxford martyrs last Serman was given here",
          "Access to the church and shop are free, and there is a rather nice cafe, too. The highlight is definitely the ascent of the tower, which gives stunning views over the surrounding colleges. However, it comes at a cost - \u00a34.00 at the time of writing - to climb the tower, and you",
          "It is so beautiful and has so much history. The location is right in the middle of everything, so you don't have to make a special trip to visit. They often have events going on here. Simply beautiful - would highly recommend going in for a visit!",
          "One of my top recommendations on a sunny day is to climb the tower of St. Mary's. You will be rewarded by a wonderful view of the city and it is totally worth the 4 pounds entry and the 120+ steps. If you are mobile and not afraid of heights, this is definitely a must!",
          "The cafe next door is fantastic.we had soup, cheesy bread and a lovely salad. \u00a37.00. Good value ,you can sit in the church garden on a sunny day.",
          "... from the top after a short steep climb, which was well worth the effort. For a relatively small entry fee, you get to see key parts of the city from a very different perspective as my photos show.",
          "You can visit this beautiful old Oxford building for free but if you wish to climb the tower it will cost you \u00a34. Inside it's very typical of the Oxford architecture and worth a visit. I spent about 30 minutes walking around looking at the very old grave markers. Recommended.",
          "Climb the winding staircase to get the most breathtaking view of the city of dreaming spires. On a clear day you can see all of Oxfordshire.",
          "The church is pretty par for old churches. You have to visit the tower, however. It offers the best 360 views of all of Oxford. And if you can manage a non rainy day, do it.",
          "Beautiful old church, with terrific architecture and a charming cafe right on the grounds. Centrally located and makes a nice break wandering around among the colleges.",
          "This was an unexpected pleasure. The church itself was beautiful, however we were unable to fully tour the interior because of a rehearsal for an upcoming concert. We did sit and enjoy the music which included Handel's \"Zadok the Priest\". We wished that we could have actually",
          "We climbed the tower to get the view of Oxford, worth the climb but I,m not sure if it was worth the money.",
          "I visited on a weekend, by chance I attended the church choir rehearsal there, it was really lovely to know you are in 1000 years old place",
          "This church is quite something. Probably one of my favorite churches in Oxford it is definitely worth visiting.",
          "Took some friends around Oxford and it was suggested that we take a trip up this tower. I thought the \u00a34 charge was a bit expensive. The view from the top is very good but there was no information about what you could see, that was on another floor on the way up so you had to",
          "A very historic church but the best part is the view from the top of the tower. There is a charge of \u00a34.00 for the view but you can see the whole of Oxford city. It wouldn't be suitable who find it difficult climbing or suffers with heights but well worth the effort if you can",
          "Take time out of your busy day and take yourself back in time. This church is just stunning and has easy access. The stain glass will take your breath away.Take a seat for a while and take in this beauiful building.",

          "You can get great views and beautiful photographs from the top of the Holy Mary Church, you can pay and go up from the church store. Do not take long, is not heavy lifting and worth seeing Oxford from that point",
          "Fantastic views of the city from the top. Once you have navigated the many steep, winding stairs, with people coming down as you are going up (not fun), you can then walk around the four sides of the tower to get an amazing view of Oxford and the surrounding countryside. Cost",
          "Climb the tower for stunning views across the city. It's an experience just climbing the stairs as they wind up very steep and narrow!",
          "The church is in an ideal location, surrounded by traditional Oxford architecture. You can go up the tower to see the most incredible view of Radcliffe camera and the universities. It is a steep walk up though, be careful with young children/elderly. Regular tickets are \u00a34. The",
          "After a lot of stairs you finally get up the top of the tower, you receive gratitude for your resistance. The tower provides you with a beautiful view at Oxford in general, and in particular of the Radcliffe Camera. In my point of view, this tower gives you a nicer view than the",
          "You will find this church opposite the Radcliffe Camera. The steep climb up the 127 steps of the spiral stone staircase are worth the effort. The panoramic views from the top are jaw dropping. Gorgeous views of All Souls College and the Radcliffe Camera.",
          "The view from the tower made me cry. Exquisite and beautiful view of the All Souls College and perfect panoramic of all Oxford.",
          "Fantastic view! You'd have to climb up the tower, quite narrow and steep, don't be afraid, it only 124 steps up to the tower. The view is beautiful, you will see all the skylines and the spires too. One of things you must to do when you visit in Oxford.",
          "Loved climbing the spire. Brilliant gargoyles, awesome view.A must if you're on a short visit to Oxford.",
          "I decided to visit the church to take advantage of climbing the tower for the views of the university spires and Radcliffe Camera. The tower does do a student discount but only for students that attend Oxford or Oxford Brookes Universities. The stairs up the tower are quite",

          "It's one of the best places to climb and view Oxford and see its rising spires. I went winter time and it was oh-so windy and chilly, but I did not regret it. The church is also open for those who want to have a quiet spiritual time.",
          "My wife and I visited the church which has a lot of history for example a section has been cut out of the pillars opposite the pulpit to accommodate a stage for Thomas Cranmer who was brought to the church on the morning of his execution in 1556 to listen to a sermon on why he",
          "Interesting church and worth climbing up the bell tower for panoramic views over Oxford - the staircase is narrow and winding near the top so bear that in mind!",

          "This lovely Church allows you to climb up the steeple affording great views of Oxford including the wonderful Radcliffe Camera. The stairs are a bit narrow but well worth the effort, I live locally and this is one of the places I always take visitors, without exception they all",
          "Interestingly enough both the UC and UO university churches are dedicated to St. Mary (Great St. Mary and St. Mary the Virgin), and both towers can be climbed to have access to panoramic scenes. Wonderful! And on the afternoon I came, the choir was rehearsing. I wouldn't say",
          "Our enjoyment of this church was greatly increased buy the greeter who gave us lots of information about the church and its history. We spent about 1/2 hour strolling around it .",
          "For a small fee one can climb about 200 steps to the viewing point on the spire for a view in 4 directions over the city. Not recommended for those with vertigo,claustrophobia or with health issues - a bit of a tight squeeze towards the top and not too many passing places! Well",
          "Very interesting to visit this University Church. It is possible to go up the tower, although we decided not to on this occasion. Queues were forming even in mid February so must be very busy in high season. The vaults caf\u00e9 was sadly too crowded to sample.",
          "We found this church quieter and more peaceful than most other places in Oxford and had the place almost to ourselves. Most reviewers here concentrate on the climb up, and view from, the tower which I have done before and can attest that the views are spectacular. There is a",
          "The stairs are narrow and the landing at the top is also narrow, but the views are totally worth the climb! Best aerial views of Oxford! Go on a sunny day (if you can) and in the morning while all the students are in class so you can have the tower and stairs (mostly) to",
          "This a must-see place in Oxford. The church itself is lovely but the views from the tower over the colleges is amazing. Entry to the tower is very reasonably priced, although beware that is a steep, narrow climb up and a cramped viewing platform. Very 'personal' if you need to",
          "Make certain that you pay the three pounds to walk the winding narrow stairs to the lookout on top of the church. It provides a 360 degree view of Oxford and is spectacular!!!!",
          "Meandered around the church itself, saw the seats of the professors, and up the tower at sunset. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "I'm a huge fan of churches when it comes to traveling - they're usually warm, quiet, and great for taking a short reflective rest. Many of the more touristy churches and cathedrals aren't ideal for this, but University Church of St. Mary the Virgin is just the place! Not to",
          "I visited different universities on my day in Oxford . This is really nice. I liked it because I linked it to the Inspector Morse series. It\u00b4s beautiful anyway.",
          "Do go up the tower! It's worth it. Visited during December and the day was still bright and clear. (And the clockworks are very interesting too.)",
          "As someone who lived in Oxford for four years - this is one of my favourite views of the city. The entrance is via the church, you'll have to pay a few quid to enter and there are concessions for students/staff etc. The route to the top is winding and can be claustrophobic but",
          "Located in city centre, the church is a definite place to visit. Old and beautiful with a tall steeple. The church is free to enter but they charge to climb the steeple.",
          "Church full of history, including The Old Library and the Crypt (now The Vaults Cafe). Best views in town from the tower as seen from \"Morse\" and \"Lewis\" on TV. Very welcoming for Sunday Matins Service.",
          "Very important site in the English Reformation where one of the architects of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer was tried for heresy (and burnt at the stake further up the high street at Cornmarket). The 13th century church spire is considered to be one of the most beautiful in",
          "This is a very important church which lies at the heart of the evolution of this awesome University City and is usually admired in this context. Perhaps less well known to visitors is that within is a gem of a cafe. Sitting among its 14 century arches adds much to",

          "A beautiful church and we spent a very peaceful time here. We were going to climb the tower but it's way too expensive for a family of 4. Don't waste your time and do more of what Oxford has to offer for free.",
          "Lovely church with a great 12 voice choir. We were there for Matriculation Sunday so there was a procession on dons in gowns and beautiful music. Check their calendar to see what's happening on any given Sunday. The people were very friendly.",

          "In spite of all the clicking cameras it is a haven of peace in a busy city, with a welcome from everyone. It has the finest west window in the city - in fact I would say in the country. Its association with the troubled times of Bloody Mary is guaranteed to bring a shudder.",
          "The Church of St. Mary the Virgin on the High is the second largest church in Oxford. It's most striking features include the tower(c.1280), the spire(c. 1320) and the South Porch(1637). The exterior of the porch designed by Nicholas Stone in English Baroque style has twisted",
          "Visit this gorgeous church this am. The climb to the top is quite laborious but definitely worth all the effort. Despite an overcast sky, the view from the top is very spectacular and it is a great place to have a bird's eye view of the whole city!",
          "This I a remarkable church with a very Moving history. Good to see the daily recent memorial plaque to the martyrs on both sides of the sectarian divide. Delightful cafe, great service and an excellent menu. Busy and with a real buzz.",
          "A beautiful church in itself, but there are no shortage of these in Oxford. What sets this one apart for me is the tower, which you can climb to get magnificent views of Oxford, and the Vault and Gardens cafe underneath which serves up delicious food and drinks. Plus, there's",
          "This is truly a piece of outstanding architecture, the building is simply stunning, the highest viewpoint in the city, would recommend climbing up the tower.",
          "My husband and I visited the University grounds in July, and I remember most vividly the University Church. An attraction within an attraction, the entry fee (\u00a34) was a little surprising but we reasoned that it was worth the full experience to see the views. The upward",

          "Definitely the best view over the city, especially of the Radcliffe Camera and All Souls College. The steps are steep and tight, and you may have to squeeze past other guests climbing up/down the stairs so it's not for people who have trouble with enclosed spaces or heights. I",
          "This church has a lovely light, airy feeling to it. We mainly went for the tower - quite a climb but fabulous views from up there. \u00a34 is quite a lot to pay but if it goes to the upkeep of the building then I don't mind. The cafe round the back is another good reason to go,",
          "What a beautiful historic church - found a plaque of a girl who died in 1600's. Lots of stained glass windows & history of Oxford.",
          "There is no admission fee to the church, but for 4 GBP (3 GBP concession) you can climb the tower and this is an excellent idea. The stairs are steep and there is not much space - neither at the top of the tower. Not everybody in our group climbed the tower and I was happy that",
          "Did a guided walking tour of Oxford. Younger guider tended to be more enthusiastic and fun . Older were hurrying you along and grumpy",

          "Stunning. Really really gothic with all the pointy spires. A must-see. Again, no need to go in to appreciate the beauty. It is best experienced from outside.",

          "Climb up St Mary's Tower for a stunning view of the Rad cam and all soul's college- a must for all tourists wanting their Oxford snap- but popular with students as well as something cheap but nice to do for a quick trip out. I personally found this view prettier than the view",
          "Again, another one of those places in Oxford I visit on a regular basis. The church itself is beautiful and full of history, ie Cranmere, Robert Dudley's wife etc. and the glass windows are superb. Going up is great fun if you don't mind climbing into the nooks and crannies to",
          "Our first visit to this special church, which has unique and fascinating historical connections to Archbishop Thomas Cranmer who preached there not long before he was burned at the stake for heresy in c.1555, in nearby The Broad, to became one of the three Oxford Martyrs. We",
          "The climb up the tower alone is worth a visit to the church of St. Mary. For \u00a3 4 or \u00a33seniors you get incredible 360 degree views of the dreaming spires of Oxford. The stairs up are a bit steep and narrow but very doable by anyone in any reasonable shape. You get to look up",
          "An imposing building on The World's most beautiful street \"The High Street\" Oxford. Often church services are held here and there is now a restaurant to the the rear. Access to the tower is from inside and takes you up a winding tiny staircase, where the stone steps have seen",

          "A fine old church. The featured attraction is the tower, which you can ascend. I have a moderate fear of heights, and this tower was a challenge for me. The climb up is fine (fairly strenuous), but once you're up there, you are on a very very narrow walkway. It is almost",
          "We asked at the Tourist information which view was best from which tower. St Mary's won and you get a great view of the spires and the colleges. The climb is steep and the corridor narrow. I recommend chatting loudly to tell people you are coming as there are no real passing",
          "This church breathes history -- as far back as the beginning of tertiary education in England and up through Thomas Cramner's trial before burning and up to CS Lewis. History beautifully celebrated.",
          "Climb was steep but the view was great. My first opportunity to photograph gargoyles from above them. Don't do this unless you're young/good shape. We are late 60's...decidedly oldest up there. We're always the oldest.",

          "The climb to the top of the tower of St. Mary's is hard - the steps on the spiral staircase seem to get narrower - but it's worth it for the view over the city. The cafe in the crypt (and its garden) is also worth a visit. After climbing up and down (coming down is harder!) we",

          "Climb the tower! We were lucky that the weather was beautiful but the view of the surrounding colleges and buildings was well worth the climb and \u00a34 entry fee. The church itself was pretty but nothing to right home about.",
          "Unfortunately, they are remodeled the church with more open space so it no longer has the little cozy nooks it used to. The gift shop has been scaled down as well. Used to find all kinds of things there, ie jewelry, bookends, etc etc but this time only postcards. Oh well",
          "I was fascinated by this historic setting for the martyrdom of England's first 'reformed' preachers. To sit there and soak in the history of the place was a little overwhelming. This is not usually part of the walking tours, so make sure you visit this church before leaving",
          "Make sure that you get to the tower at opening time especially on weekends! The stair case to the top is VERY narrow so not suitable for those who are claustrophobic - especially if it's busy! We were lucky as we didn't meet anyone going up or down the stairs the opposite way to",
          "Particularily enjoyed walking up the stairs to the tower. The views were very impressive so bring your camera. It might be best to go in the morning or when it's quiet as I had great uninterrupted time to take photos but if there are many people it might be difficult as it is",

          "Had a weekend away with friends and paid to climb to the top. The views were just spectacular, really took my breath away, great views right round, perfect for taking photos. The church itself was lovely too, some great stonework. A word of warning - we went late on a friday",
          "Lovely views from the tower. Only \u00a34 to go up. Some very narrow steps near the top. Some very interesting history on the church clock.",
          "If you want to climb a tower to see the towers of Oxford this one is in the heart of it and has great views. There is a modest fee to climb it. The stone stairs are very steep and narrow but there is an iron rail to grip. I came down backwards as well. People can't pass on",
          "this is a very popular place, with a good range of sensible food, reasonably priced and service good despite the crowd.",
          "Although there are many towers in Oxford only three can be climbed and this tower affords the best views. The church itself (free entry!) is large and very interesting and it's well worth paying the small fee to climb the tower to get some amazing views of Oxford. There are",
          "Yes, it's just another church. It's lovely, the architecture is wonderful. Considering who was attended services in this building over the centuries is awe inspiring, and sets it apart from many of the other lovely churches in the UK>",
          "We saw people up on the tower and for some bizarre reason, thought it would be a good idea.. The steps are tiny and steep and the ramparts were extremely narrow but if you don't mind that, the views are fantastic!!",
          "A very impressive building with a great feeling of peace. Good interactive features. We were lucky to stop & listen to a very good Berlioz concert rehearsal.",
          "Great views of the city, though the Carfax tower has these too and was a bit cheaper when I went. The church itself is lovely to walk around, with some pretty impressive stained glass windows. I even saw Terry Wogan filming something outside, but I don't think he's a permanent",
          "This lovely church is situated on the High Street and has recently undergone a 5 million pound renovation. It's relatively small, very beautiful and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Four pounds will allow you to climb up to the belltower, with a view into an",
          "The church is beautiful and situated on the High Street. The staff in the shop were very friendly and chatty, very well informed. We climbed the tower and enjoyed amazing views across the city, well worth the climb. You have to get up close and personal on the stairs if there is",
          "This has to be the place to view Oxford from above. it costs \u00a34 each or \u00a312 for a family to climb to the top of the tower. Pay at the gift shop at the Radcliffe Square entrance. This is the place to buy your souvenirs. They are the best quality and are the cheapest around. On",
          "One of the best recommendations we had when visiting Oxford. \u00a34 each, only takes 20 mins or so and there is not much room, but a great way to see the beautiful city and get a look at the colleges and city from afar. Money well spent, even for the short amount of time it fills.",
          "I've been here twice: Summer (July 2014)/Spring (March 2015) - If planning to see this site in the summer, go early in the morning (i.e. when it first opens) to avoid the crowds. Overall: -\u00a34: reasonable cost - Great views of the city (especially the Radcliffe Camera) -Clock",
          "I visited in March 2015. Entrance fee to the viewing tower was \u00a34. Some of the steps to the top are quite steep so something to bear in mind, but the views from the top are really lovely. When I visited there wasn't any large crowds which made the experience far more",
          "I'm a visiting student in Oxford and I have been to this church many times as it is right outside the library. It has spectacular views of Oxford if you want to climb the tower; but just be warned that the spiral staircase can be a bit claustrophobic and there's not a lot of",
          "Inside of the church is very nice and free to enter but the real attraction is the tower. Price is a bit steep as are the steps but the views from the top are well worth it as it shows Oxford from a different perspective entirely.",
          "A fairly normal church but the \u00a34 to go up the tower for 360\u00b0 views above oxford is well worth the climb the steps start easy enough but the last spiral staircase is a bit of a workout but worth it for the great views.",
          "Very old and historic church, love historical churches anyway this was calming and spiritual. lovely.",
          "Climbing to the top of the tower, although hard work, is well worth it. The views over the city are terrific and seeing into many of the college grounds is a bonus. Not to be missed.",
          "Oxford University has history and heritage that has benefited the world. If you want to have a good viewpoint of Oxford University and environs, you can't go past St. Mary's Church Tower. Not only do you get a good view, but the church itself is full of history, including a",
          "Oxford has a couple of great viewpoints, but this one beats them all. This church is in the enviable position of being beside some of the most attractive buildings in the city. The \u00a34 required to climb the tower is well worth it. Up beside the multiple spires and gargoyles you",
          "This place came recommended to me, and with good reason! Excellent cafe, good tea and probably the best cake in Oxford!",
          "Our morning wander started from climbing something around 60steps in order to admire beautiful view over Oxford city centre :) well recommended !",
          "This history church should not be missed. A pamphlet inside the church marks the significance in history. Great stain glass window. There is an extra fee to go up to the dome. This gives one a great view of Oxford from all sides. The gargoyles up close add to the fun. Have your",
          "The history of this church is astounding. Elizabeth I visited here and it is where the University was born. No trip to Oxford should be complete without seeing this place. For a small charge you could climb to the top of the tower, however on the day we visited, we chose to sit",
          "If you are visiting Oxford for the first time then this has to be on your must list of things to do and visit. Oxford is awash with marvellous buildings that are steeped in history that our country has to offer. This church is perhaps in the centre of the great beautiful",
          "This church was an oasis of peace. Unfortunately when I visited I had to go and sit in the choir for that peace as some of the volunteers were having a good laugh amongst themselves which rather detracted from the atmosphere.",
          "The folks at the Visitor's Center recommended that I take the stairs to the top of the church steeple. The GBP 4.00 entry fee and the climb to the top give you a fantastic overview of Oxford University and the City of Oxford. You can see over the walls of the various colleges",
          "This church is interesting enough with all the history associated with it, and just outside it, displayed for avid history readers as soon as you walk through the doors. The view from the tower though is a must if you dont mind climbing the narrow spiral staircase. The",
          "We met a very nice volunteer guide in the church who explained all about the martyrs of Oxford, both Protestant and Catholic. I had been before and remembered the Cranmer pillar, but it was very thought provoking to see it again. What times they lived in!",
          "From the tower is beautiful view to Oxford university and all Oxford city. On the top goes about 130 stairs but the staircase is realy claustrophobic.",
          "A wonderful view from the tower, but does get rather crowded on a clear fine day. The stairs are narrow at the top, but worth the climb. Take your camera/phone.",
          "stunning views over the whole of oxford from the tower, not for those afraid of heights , the tower has a very very steep stone spiral staircase with just an old iron handrail, and no passing places",
          "Beautiful, historic church. Sometimes they are practicing for concerts to be held later. It also has a nice mini-gift shop & cafe in back.",
          "I was there with family for a memorial service. Beautiful surroundings and the service was very meaningful.",
          "Lovely old gothic church. Best bit is the small fee for ascending the clocktower and looking out over the sandstone colleges and green spaces of Oxford. not much space on the spiral staircase and balconies so go early.",
          "Church only reopened following some refurbishment. Lots of history in those walls and on the plaques on the walls! It's where the Oxford Martyrs were tried. Well worth a visit if you're strolling round the Radcliffe Camera/Broad St area of Oxford. No charge into church but",
          "Well worth the climb to the top. The views of the area are gorgeous. A clear, beautiful day made it all the better. The area at the top is small so they limit the number who can go up at one time.",
          "Beautiful church in a very central location. The view was 100% worth the 100+ steps. Very impressive views all over the city of Oxford. Despite the cloud and rain, I was still able to identify the famous landmarks in the city. Cannot wait to visit again and bring friends to show",
          "Beautiful old church and don't miss the walk up the staircase to the top to see the beautiful views.",
          "Many reviewers say they did not want to attempt the 120 steps up the tower to the view platform. They truly missed one of the best things in Oxford. The views are spectacular. You can almost see every major college, with beautiful bird's eye photo opportunities in each",
          "Beautiful church, steeped in a rich history. Located adjacent to a beautiful meadows. If time permits take an internal tour.",
          "Oxford has a plethora of churches and colleges, and we decided to visit St Mary the Virgin because of its history and lovely architecture and design. We also decided to spend the four pounds to make the climb up the tower to the walkway around the top, and it was a great small",
          "University Church of St. Mary the Virgin was just across the street from our hotel, the Old Bank, so it was super-convenient to visit. Kate, our Viking guide, gave us a great tour of this beautiful old church. I had already gotten a nice photo of that drop-dead gorgeous spire",
          "It is well worth visiting this lovely church whilst you're in Oxford. The main attraction for me was the trip up the 120+ steps to the top of the tower. The views over the city are superb. Luckily, the sun was shining and the colour of the stone colleges and spires was",
          "My friends went up the tower and saw the lovely views of Oxford from the top. Only trouble was that a plate they bought from this church shop was \u00a31.50 cheaper at the punt station shop at Magdalen Bridge.",
          "A great central position, you can climb the tower for views of the wonderful architecture surrounding you. There was a classical concert playing on Saturday afternoon when we visited, the church itself is old and historic, there is a popular cafe outside to the front entrance",
          "Beautifully maintained with lovely stained glass. Small fee to climb up the tower for a view of the Oxford spires but only if you're fit and healthy. The Vault to the side offers nice food and coffee.",
          "Once at the top you are treated to a 360 degree view across the roof tops for that classic 'dreaming spires of Oxford' scenario you see in all the guide books.",
          "It's worth going to the top of the tower and looking over Oxford, however it's definitely not one for those with a fear of heights (or claustrophobes for that matter). You have to go up a very tiny spiral staircase for a very long time. But the views are definitely impressive.",
          "I arrived and paid to go the roof, be warned there are some very narrow staircases to get to the top, but I enjoyed it. It does have the best views of Oxford I went at about 9.30am on a Saturday and it was really quite, not another sole in sight. The only thing was that it",
          "This is a beautiful old church in a quaint college town of Oxford. The Vicar was actually in the church answering questions. This church is located in the High Street and is quite easy to find.",
          "Those tiny circular stairs are treacherous, and when you get to the top, prepare to share a very narrow passage way with other tourists. The view is spectacular.",
          "Lovely church in the heart of Oxford and once you have climbed up to the roof, I think you can get the best views of the city.",
          "I am not a Christian but this is a wonderful place. The design is spendid with the peace of background music (organ) playing as we walked around and sat on one of the benches.",
          "My husband went up St Mary's tower; i did not, due to back problems, but this meant that after walking around this fascinating place so filled with history I was able to rest quietly in a pew, when a your music student came in and began playing the great organ. Amazing. Of",
          "I went up on the roof. The view of Oxford was very nice and clear. The way to go up is quite narrow but manageable.",
          "The view of St. Mary's Church was great, only the systems of going up or downstairs was a little scary... 'cause there came other people up or downstairs and than we had to look how to manage this. And there was no system od entrance, for the people who waited for going",
          "So nice for the church to be open for tours. For a price, you can climb up for superb views of Oxford and the countryside of Oxfordshire. Excellent place to wander.",
          "A beautiful old church in the middle of busy oxford. It is stunning inside, you can go right up to the top on the roof for a fabulous view of the city. There are guided tours if you want to join in.",
          "A lovely tranquil church open to the public on The High in Oxford. A short climb up to its clock-tower gives spectacular views across the rooftops of this city and into the surrounding prestigious university colleges. The cafe below serves great tea and ice creams to recover",
          "I've been up this tower before but a good 7 years ago now and took the boyfriend on his birthday weekend. The climb is not pleasant once you're in the tower bit as it's quite tight and on a very hot day it's quite stuffy. However, on a day with clear blue skies, the view is so",
          "This is a very old church which has interesting grave markers Some of which are from the 1600's There is a beautiful organ and many stain glass windows",
          "I love the food at this cafe - and outside seating gives lovely views. Service varies from extremely friendly to downright rude, which is such a shame as it is a great place.",
          "The tower is well worth climbing. There are excellent views around Oxford from the top, especially of Radcliffe Camera. Great for photography.",
          "Blew my breath away, choir was practising when we were there and the stained glass windows were amazing.",
          "Lovely old church - believe Peter Wimsey was married here. Has a nice caf\u00e9 with inside and outside seating.",
          "It is one of the oldest churches in England with magnificent interior full of light. What I liked the most is the13th-century bell tower of the the church: climbing to the top is really worth the effort. It is not a difficult ascent at all and a reward is something not to miss:",
          "What I liked about this place was that it was not only beautiful but had clearly been at the centre of things with religious who had been politically aware and were important in trying to generate equality",
          "This is a beautiful church and when we visited there was someone playing the organ which was very atmospheric. There is the option to climb up the tower, a small shop and cafe.",
          "A lovely church with some interesting pieces to see. Free entry and just a couple of quid to climb the tower. It's quite narrow and there is only one set of steps so it's the same route up and down the tower. I'd recommend getting there early, opens at 9.30 and trying to do a",
          "The Church was very interesting. My daughter and I enjoyed looking around the church and reading some of the history. The woman in the small gift shop was friendly.",
          "I was visiting Oxford with my friend. We entered the church and bought two tickets (I guess \u00a34 pp) to climb the tower. I was amazing on the top of the tower and you can see amazing Oxford view from there. But I feel that I have to mention that it is a bit difficult to climb the",
          "This tower is absolutely worth the visit. The views are most amazing. Being quite claustrophobic, I was very worried about this visit but I so wanted to see the views! At the entrance, I asked if was crowded up there but I was told it wasn't and was also shown the cctv cameras.",
          "St Mary's is worth a trip, it's amazing architecture inside the church is worth a look. The climb up the tower is also not too strenuous and you get amazing views at the top for the money it costs. However, the top is very cramped and you have to double back (not a full circle)",
          "Strolling round the Radcliffe, you can't help but find this Church. Well worth a visit - the craftsmanship of the Church is unbelievable.",
          "The only reason for three stars is the lack of organisation. The stairs are obviously very narrow and at times, with people coming up and down, it was a little worrying. People were very polite, and attempted to squash themselves into the wall but if you don't fancy pressing",
          "Here is a remarkable Church where many famous people have preached memorable sermons over the centuries. Its elegant architecture makes this a place of confident prayer and worship.",
          "An excellent view not to be missed. the second half of the climb is quite a narrow space and we had to squeeze through people once on top. Quite a challenge if you are claustrophobic but we lived through it and enjoyed it too..",
          "This church has been built for 1000 years, yet it is still beautifully preserved. The architectural design is very gorgeous. It is located in the city center, so it wont be hard to find when you go to Oxford. It is a must visit attraction when you are in Oxford",
          "The views from the church tower are fantastic. You can walk all the way around the tower for a 360 degree view of various colleges, Radcliffe's Camera and some really historic houses and shops. Well worth the climb. The church oozes history too and the curators were friendly",
          "I only went into the church and didn't pay the admission fee to the tower. Of all the churches that I visited that day, that one was the most memorable. It feels like a bit of a hodgepodge of architecture but is quite large. There was an organist practicing which was very",
          "Entrance to the tower costs \u00a34 but for the view from the top it is totally worth it! Oxford is beautiful and this is surely the best way to see it No tour as such but there is information available so you can take it in at your own pace My only suggestion sort our some sort of",
          "The food is well thought out and way above the standard of a tourist caf\u00e9. We had a delicious meal, in the very old University Church. Excellent value. Look forward to going back again.",
          "Brilliant views, get there early to avoid the queues. Nice coffee shop in the church grounds too. Not too many steps but the one's nearer the top get quite narrow. Well worth the \u00a34 entrance fee.",
          "Even though the title says it all, I can add that walking inside the church is free. Make sure you stop here.",
          "The church of St Mary the Virgin in Oxford, is situated at the historic heart of the City and the University of Oxford. There are entrances from the High Street and from Radcliffe Square. As far as churches go, yes it is a very beautiful one. There is no cost to enter the",
          "This is a lovely church which has had several additions over the centuries. The stained glass is beautiful. Free admission, there may be a charge to tour the tower, but we didn't find out.",
          "Praise the Lord, relish the history (Cranmer and Latimer, John Wesley, John Henry Newman, etc.), enjoy the best view in Oxford (from the spire) and contemplate that this elevated pulpit is where C.S. Lewis delivered the greatest (IMHO) sermon in history, known as \"The Weight of",
          "A special experience - beautiful building but also a reflective place where they pray for both Anglicans and Catholics alike",
          "The church itself is quite small but pretty but it's the view from the tower that is definitely worth a visit. It's extraordinaire, you can see the whole city with its imposing and grandiose building, which are basically everywhere. The good part is that it's not too high cause",
          "worth climbing to the top...not that far..but you don't want to be too large..as narrow! great views.",
          "The interior of the University Church of St. Mary the Virgin is beautiful and open free to the public. For \u00a34, you can climb the 127 stairs to the top of the tower. Note, the initial stairs are relatively easy, but the latter half is a spiral and you will need to squeeze past",
          "\u00a34 for a trip up the tower, take your camera. not a lot of room up and down the stairs. there's not much room for at the top. Single file around the top. The views are Fantastic, well worth the trip and squeeze once up there.",
          "There was a rehearsal taking place with local children for a performance related to Noah, so we felt we could not wander around. The staff seemed to be very busy so didn't find details of the tower visit nor could we see the original Oxford University teaching rooms",
          "I got the chance to go in on a beautiful October sunny morning and it was just beautiful inside. The pews are old and worn and transport you back in history.",
          "The view from here is not to be missed and is worth spending \u00a34 to climb the scary 167 steps. Be warned it is very narrow and steep and the same spiral staircase carries people up and down with almost no where to pass. Go when it opens 9.30am and you will be ok. It is",
          "St. Mary's can offer you an outstanding view over the dreaming spires from theirs, or give you a beautiful place to reflect while looking at their starry ceiling. One of our favorite lunch places in Oxford is served in their Vault Restaurant - great food and value. There is",
          "A pretty, quiet church - we enjoyed our visit to the church very much. Has interesting information regarding martyrs for the church, and also has a nice gift shop where I bought a very pretty rosary as a gift.",
          "The view justified the entrance for me. The steps are narrow and there is not a huge amount of room at the top of the tower, so if you are not one for crowds go early before tour buses arrive. I went here on my second day and it was nice to see Oxford from a different",
          "Worth the visit just to have a look around and sometimes you can hear the orchestra practising before the evening performance. Then pop across the road to the Old Bank for a drink!",
          "Visited the tower on a sunny day but was rather disappointed. Climb was easy as the tower is not very high, was charged 4 pounds for entry, not sure how they justified the charge. Views were only ok due to the lack of height, the panoramic map was located on the first part of",
          "Get there early to avoid the crowd, because the staircase is very narrow near the top. It is worth the entry fee to get a perfect panorama look at the City of Dreaming Spires.",
          "I planned to visit one of the Oxford Towers and look over the city. My lovely guide recommended this one as she said you could not find better view. Climb is rather easy except last part of your journey up to the tower when it becomes quite narrow and more interesting :) Would",
          "You can go to the top of the Church Tower and get a great view of Oxford. Cost \u00a33-\u00a34 and there's about 120 steps - some a bit narrow when you have people coming the other way. Worth the climb for bird's eye views.",
          "Church is free to enter, but the tower is \u00a33 or 4 to go up. Well worth it. View is sensational. Across Oxford with colleges, spires you can see into some of the grounds. Really nice.",
          "We stumbled upon this place on a day out in Oxford. The lure of the cafe at the bottom drew us to it and that in itself was well worth it. (See separate review). The church is free to enter and look around and has a great atmosphere with the inscriptions of 17th century",
          "The cloistered ceiling and ambience this is one of the oldest meeting places in Oxford,the food is always good and the drinks are good also it's very reasonably priced,the staff are all students and very competent.",
          "The views from the top of the tower are excellent. The church is situated on the High Street amongst some of Oxfords most interesting architectural delights. The views from the top of Exeter, Brasenose, Bodleian are great. Well worth the 15min wait when we went on what was",
          "it's for free to enter the beautiful gothic church. and then there is 3 or 4 gbp fee to enter 300 smth step to the top of the tower. there is very pleasant young men selling tickets, that also give great lunch/dinner suggestions. there is very limited space upstairs, so when in",
          "...you really should pop your head in at this church and have a look. It's not magnificent or fabulous but it has atmosphere and it's really nice to have a look around. For me, the highlight was the tablets in the church commemorating Oxford citizens from the last 300 years.",
          "Beautiful church with lovely views of Oxford from the tower. Nominal fee to enter the tower. Although not as formidable as Christchurch Cathedral, it's a lovely church in it's own right.",

          "Whilst on a visit to Oxford we noticed people at the top of the tower & went to investigate. The \u00a33 fee to climb the tower is well worth paying which also helps with the upkeep of the church. There is no health & safety overkill here as you make your way up the tower steps which",
          "A lot of people visit this church to climb the tower and/or visit the cafe, but if you just want to see the church there is no charge. It is a lovely grade 1 listed building with many points of interest and a fine musical tradition. Look at their excellent website for further",
          "We loved this Church, especially the trip to the top of the tower for stunning views of Oxford. Not good for those who don't like winding little steps and a bit of exercise, but it is worth it when you get to the top.",
          "We visited here mainly to pay \u00a33 per person to climb up the very tall tower for the views at the top. Brilliant. Totally worth it if you can manage the climb, which is arduous.",
          "We found a nice church with a rich history, especially regarding the Reformation martyrs. The climb up the steep, tight, spiral, staircase was well rewarded with panoramic views of the colleges and town.",
          "Although you had to cue to climb the tower it was worth it! Amazing views of the city, especially the Radcliffe Camera",
          "A combination of very reasonably priced and well cooked food in a medieval vaulted hall, a congenial atmosphere, several organic and vegetarian options, outdoor seating, and wifi. Coffee, lunch and tea only.",
          "It was well worth the ascent and good exercise (but not for the dimensionally challenged as there could have been a danger of becoming wedged on the spiral staircase) as the day was lovely- sunny and clear- so excellent view over the town.",
          "Happened upon this by chance. Luckily, the recital was just commencing. The students were playing on the organ and donations were to fund their travel to Italy. The church itself is fabulous.",
          "This is one of the tallest tower in the city. You pay 3gbp and they allow you to climb up till you reach the top. The view of the Radcliffe and new college is stunning. The stairs are very narrow. It is kind of fun climbing such a narrow stairs.. Only one person can pass. The",
          "Great View from the tower :-) of the 4 sides Narrow windy steps not to everyone's taste but nice view",
          "Truly worth a visit. Better still visit when there is a service to really get the atmosphere. For a small payment and a lot of energy you can walk around the roof - definitely do this for the splendid view from the top.",
          "The climb up the winding stairs is definitely worth it to get a panoramic view of the town. It is a tight squeeze as you have to go back down the same way you came up.",
          "For the very best views over the city. Husband went up, while I enjoyed a talk with one of the Welcomers (cannot do stairs very well any more). Really interesting, lovely cafe and well worth a visit.",
          "What a gem in the heart of Oxford. It only costs \u00a33 to climb the tower but you get the best 360 degrees of Oxford, especially the colleges. Don't miss",
          "The Church is nice, rather warm, with comfortable chairs. A good opportunity to relax a bit in the silence. Its tower is fantastic. A bit difficult if you are fat or tall. The view of the town from over there is really worth the 3 pounds-ticket. No elevator.",
          "We stumbled across this by accident but went up the tower and had an amazing view of Oxford. You can see right into the colleges and all the greens. Be warned it is a very narrow staircase and 127 steps to the top. Cost was \u00a3 3 each",
          "The University Church of St Mary the Virgin is along High St and it has one of the distinguishable spires in Oxford pictures. The climb to the tower is worth the effort and the entrace fee. From the tower, you have a view of the Radcliffe Camera which you see in postcards.",
          "In the centre of Oxford. Great for reasonablly priced tea and cakes. A welcome break from an afternoon shopping.",
          "Well worth the climb for a view of The High, quadrangles of All Souls and the Sheldonian lawns.It is a bit of a climb and there are no facilities for disabled to get up to the tower view point but to preserve the authenticity of the church that is a sad ommission",
          "...the view from the tower. It's worth the entry fee and the climb, even on a cold winter's day - in fact particularly on a bright blue sky cold winter's day!!!",
          "We were there during construction, and the construction stairs were a bit much, but the view from the top continues to astound. This is about my third or fourth visit to St. Mary's and it was a blast, again, as it always it. The views from every angle are amazing, and I am",
          "Undergoing major renovation (due to be completed by Christmas), but still worth a visit. The guide was excellent",
          "The climb up the tower is very rewarding with super photo opportunies across the city. Much better views than the Carfax tower. Only disappointment was that the tower and climb up the first section is shrouded in scaffolding for maintenance and cleaning work at present. The",
          "Currently under renovation so you can't see everything, more stars when the reservations are finished. However the view from the top of the spire is excellent. Also the cafe on the ground floor can be thoroughly recommended. Like the whole of Oxford it has a nice relaxed",
          "We stopped in for an early lunch and were greeted by surly service. The women at the counter were not at all helpful and downright rude. The food however was very good and reasonably priced. We had the soup which was very tasty. Would recommend the food but hopefully you won't",
          "This is a lovely church, and the view was stunning. However, the climb up to the tower could be be an unexpected adventure, especially for those who suffer from any level of claustrophobia! The stairs are narrow indeed, and then the crowds were not controlled so that we",
          "Beautiful church in an very central area! Shop is also great for souvenirs! The christmas and easter services are especially wonderful and very well prepared.",
          "We were only able to get into the church but there were extensive renovations which prevented the tour that we had hoped for to happen. Our tour guide, Don Rudalevige did tell us some of what he knew about this beautiful church. I do not remember when the church will be",
          "If you don't mind heights to tight places, I would totally recommend. The climb is no too far, but it is half on very open scaffold stairs (the church was under construction when I went) and half on very narrow stone spiral stairs. Not for little kids. Must be eight to go up.",
          "As other reviewers have advised, the church itself is undergoing significant restoration in 2012 and is virtually inaccessible, but the tower is still open. Be warned though, it is two way traffic on narrow spiral staircase and there is little room to pass other visitors up on",
          "A truly awesome building that is worth spending time in. The atmosphere inside remains with you. We loved the feeling of history and peace inside. Next door you can dine in the Vaults eatery -Veggie - and wonderful!",
          "The interior is beautiful but what I enjoyed the most was the view from the tower. It was wonderful to see the gargoyles up close and to enjoy the views of Oxford from above. If you don't mind heights and tight spaces it is definitely worth the climb!",
          "The steps up the steeple are old and sprial with few passing places. The views are fantastic when you get up there it has just finished being renovated so the stone is all bright and clean and details newly painted.",
          "You'll also find a nice little gift shop. But the main thing here, of course, is the tower. The building is under renovation in 2012, but go in anyway, and hopefully, by the time you're there, it's all open once more.",
          "We went in here warm welome they are doing building work inside but you get the feeling, a must is to climb the tower but not recomened for over weight peopleor people with heart or breathing problems",
          "We had a short wait to access the tower as only a few people at a time can actually be accommodated. The stairs are very narrow - only one person at a time but it is well worth the climb to see the amazing views all over the City. It was only \u00a33 each for the experience and",
          "Beautiful building,and you dont have to love religion to be amazed by the beauty of the building",
          "OK - quite a few steps to the top of the tower but well worth the view. You get to see all four compass points from the top. There is a gift shop at the the bottom of the tower.",
          "Climbing the tower is a must on a visit to Oxford. The climb itself is entertaining, though a little uncomfortable when busy.",
          "The church building is undergoing renovation at the moment and access to the tower is via a portakabin and temporary metal steps which initially go up the outside of the building. These are the first 60 or so of the c.120 steps to the top. The rest are on the inside of the tower",
          "There is an authenticity here which church/catherdral visitors may not always find nowadays. You don't feel that you have to pay as soon as you walk in! You CAN contribute, of course - and probably you will - but there isn't the Tourist Attraction atmosphere that can mar",
          "It is worth the climb of over 100 steps to get to the top of St. Mary's and see the views of Oxford. The church has lots of history and plaques that explain what has happened there over the centuries. We take most visitors there when doing the \"Oxford tour.\"",
          "Lovely clergy,but truly puzzled by tourist gift shop - felt a bit tacky. I know churches have to pay their way, but felt it lost something in the range provided. And tricky having to pay for disability access materials for a service myself as they couldn't afford the \u00a36.",
          "I used to go to St Mary almost every day when a student in Oxford, as I enjoyed the tranquil interior - it offered me some peace and quiet from the frantic student life. I also love the cafe in the church gardens - tasty, homely food at reasonable prices. Try to visit on a sunny",
          "Amazing to beagle to get so close to the stained glass windows,beautiful church and we were lucky enough to visit during rehearsal of passion of st John ,Bach such beautiful music and choir in the setting was awe-inspiring",
          "While you enjoy the church you can do picnic and sight seeing. You would meet bunch of student picnic with you in the park while sunny day.",
          "Very central but feels as if it could be a long way a way from the bustle - lovely cafe with amazing view of Radcliffe Camera from the tables outside (but currently - from 2012) a bit marred by scaffolding as tower is being refurbished",
          "as part of a guided tour, enjoyed the ambience and history of the church",
          "This is a must see when you go to Oxford. Very historic and beautiful! So amazing that it's still a church in use today. It was really awesome!",
          "what a surprise.. the first floor dining room was amazing and the church, well!!",
          "The Church, whilst historically interesting, is not especially beautiful. If I were only reviewing that I would give a 3. If I were only reviewing the view from the top though, I would give it a 5 as it is the most spectacular view I know of Oxford (and well worth the admission",
          "If you go, pay the fee to climb the bell tower. It is well worth it.",
          "Went to hear a recital of German Christmas lieder. Great acoustics.",
          "Fantastic view from tower ,but stairs not for the feint hearted nor on a busy day. Lady behind the counter in shop ,where you buy tower tickets extremely knowledgeable . Some excellent stain glass windows. Renovation work underway and more planned may spoil visit over next few",
          "Well worth the donation to get up the tower. The panoramic views make it clear why Oxford is known as \"The City of Dreaming Spires\".",
          "The stairway was very narrow with people on the way up/down calling out to warn that they were coming up/down which was a good idea. Strong arms needed to hang out of the ropes for banisters. Felt it a personal satisfaction to reach the Tower with two artifical joints!",
          "Well worth a visit as it has so much to offer with its history and arcifacts.",
          "The main reason why you must visit this attraction is the tower. Climb the stairs into the tower to get a superb view of the city and the surrounding area. Entry to the tower is only a few pounds and it absolutley worth it!.",
          "We went to Oxford for 2 nights. The climb up this Church tower was a brilliant idea and gave us a great view of Oxford. I believe the cost to go up is 5 pounds. Quite a reasonable price for about 45 minutes enjoyment. The climb is interesting and the architecture is great.",
          "Climbing the staircase and seeing great views of the immediate area from the stone gallery was a good experience. Gargoyles (rainwater spouts) above . Great photo spot. Modest charge applies.",
          "The University Church was a wonderful place to visit. The church itself was not as large as I thought and it certainly was full of character. A lovely quiet haven off the busy high street. We then went up the tower. A slight squeeze up winding staircases of 127 steps took us to",
          "Climbing the church tower here is well worth the small fee and the physical effort (but don't try it if you are not prepared to squeeze up a tight stone circular stairway or if you have heart troubles). You will see beautiful views of several colleges and Radcliffe Camera from",
          "One thing you should do when being in Oxford is to climb on the two big towers the city has. These are St Mary's tower or the Cairfax Tower. From both you'll have a great view over the city and the famous spires! Also you can peek into gardens and see places that are normally",
          "There is a lovely place to eat downstairs here in the Vaults, lots of expensive organic tasty grub, has a nice garden looking at Radcliffe camera or can eat inside and look at ye olde ceiling. If a bit pricey for lunch (~\u00a310ish), nice for a bit of tea and cake. The church itself"

      "name": "Bodleian Library",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Bodleian Library () is the main research library of the University of Oxford, and is one of the oldest libraries in Europe. With over 12 million items, it is the second-largest library in Britain after the British Library. Under the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 it is one of six legal deposit libraries for works published in the United Kingdom, and under Irish law it is entitled to request a copy of each book published in the Republic of Ireland. Known to Oxford scholars as \"Bodley\" or \"the Bod\", it operates principally as a reference library and, in general, documents may not be removed from the reading rooms.\nIn 2000, a number of libraries within the University of Oxford were brought together for administrative purposes under the aegis of what was initially known as Oxford University Library Services (OULS), and since 2010 as the Bodleian Libraries, of which the Bodleian Library is the largest component.\nAll colleges of the University of Oxford have their own libraries, which in a number of cases were established well before the foundation of the Bodleian, and all of which remain entirely independent of the Bodleian. They do, however, participate in OLIS (Oxford Libraries Information System), the Bodleian Libraries' online union catalogue. Much of the library's archives were digitized and put online for public access in 2015.\n\n\n== Sites and regulations ==\nThe Bodleian Library occupies a group of five buildings near Broad Street: the 15th-century Duke Humfrey's Library, the 17th-century Schools Quadrangle, the 18th-century Clarendon Building and Radcliffe Camera, and the 20th- and 21st-century Weston Library. Since the 19th century a number of underground stores have been built, while the principal off-site storage area is located at South Marston on the edge of Swindon.\n\n\n=== Admission ===\nBefore being granted access to the library, new readers are required to agree to a formal declaration. This declaration was traditionally an oral oath, but is now usually made by signing a letter to a similar effect. Ceremonies in which readers recite the declaration are still performed for those who wish to take them; these occur primarily at the start of the University's Michaelmas term. External readers (those not attached to the University) are still required to recite the declaration orally prior to admission. The Bodleian Admissions Office has amassed a large collection of translations of the declaration \u2013 covering over one hundred different languages as of spring 2017 \u2013 allowing those who are not native English speakers to recite it in their first language. The English text of the declaration is as follows:\n\nI hereby undertake not to remove from the Library, nor to mark, deface, or injure in any way, any volume, document or other object belonging to it or in its custody; not to bring into the Library, or kindle therein, any fire or flame, and not to smoke in the Library; and I promise to obey all rules of the Library.\nThis is a translation of the traditional Latin oath (the original version of which did not forbid tobacco smoking, though libraries were then unheated because fires were so hazardous):\n\nDo fidem me nullum librum vel instrumentum aliamve quam rem ad bibliothecam pertinentem, vel ibi custodiae causa depositam, aut e bibliotheca sublaturum esse, aut foedaturum deformaturum aliove quo modo laesurum; item neque ignem nec flammam in bibliothecam inlaturum vel in ea accensurum, neque fumo nicotiano aliove quovis ibi usurum; item promitto me omnes leges ad bibliothecam Bodleianam attinentes semper observaturum esse.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 14th and 15th centuries ===\n\nWhilst the Bodleian Library, in its current incarnation, has a continuous history dating back to 1602, its roots date back even further. The first purpose-built library known to have existed in Oxford was founded in the 14th century under the will of Thomas Cobham, Bishop of Worcester (d. 1327). This small collection of chained books was situated above the north side of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin on the High Street. This collection continued to grow steadily, but when Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (brother of Henry V of England) donated a great collection of manuscripts between 1435 and 1437, the space was deemed insufficient and a larger building was required. A suitable room was finally built above the Divinity School, and completed in 1488. This room continues to be known as Duke Humfrey's Library. After 1488, the university stopped spending money on the library's upkeep and acquisitions, and manuscripts began to go unreturned to the library.\n\n\n=== Sir Thomas Bodley and the re-founding of the University Library ===\nThe library went through a period of decline in the late 16th century: the library's furniture was sold, and only three of the original books belonging to Duke Humphrey remained in the collection.  During the reign of Edward VI, there was a purge of \"superstitious\" (Catholic-related) manuscripts. It was not until 1598 that the library began to thrive once more, when Thomas Bodley (a former fellow of Merton College, who had recently married a wealthy widow) wrote to the Vice Chancellor of the University offering to support the development of the library: \"where there hath bin hertofore a publike library in Oxford: which you know is apparent by the rome it self remayning, and by your statute records I will take the charge and cost upon me, to reduce it again to his former use.\" Six of the Oxford University dons were tasked with helping Bodley in refitting the library in March 1598. Duke Humfrey's Library was refitted, and Bodley donated a number of his own books to furnish it. The library was formally re-opened on 8 November 1602 under the name \"Bodleian Library\" (officially Bodley's Library). There were around two thousand books in the library at this time, with an ornate Benefactor's Register displayed prominently, to encourage donations. Early benefactors were motivated by the recent memory of the Reformation to donate books in the hopes that they would be kept safe.Bodley's collecting interests were varied; according to the library's historian Ian Philip, as early as June 1603 he was attempting to source manuscripts from Turkey, and it was during \"the same year that the first Chinese book was acquired\", despite no-one at Oxford being able to understand them at that time. In 1605, Francis Bacon gave the library a copy of The Advancement of Learning and described the Bodleian as \"an Ark to save learning from deluge\". At this time, there were few books written in English held in the library, partially because academic work was not done in English. Thomas James suggested that Bodley should ask the Stationers' Company to provide a copy of all books printed to the Bodleian and in 1610 Bodley made an agreement with the company to put a copy of every book registered with them in the library. The Bodleian collection grew so fast that the building was expanded between 1610\u20131612 (known as the Arts End), and again in 1634\u20131637. When John Selden died in 1654, he left the Bodleian his large collection of books and manuscripts. The later addition to Duke Humfrey's Library continues to be known as the \"Selden End\".\nBy 1620, 16,000 items were in the Bodleian's collection. Anyone who wanted to use the Bodleian had to buy a copy of the 1620 library catalogue at a cost of 2 shillings and 8 pence.\n\n\n=== Schools Quadrangle and Tower of the Five Orders ===\nBy the time of Bodley's death in 1613, his planned further expansion to the library was just starting. The Schools Quadrangle (sometimes referred to as the \"Old Schools Quadrangle\", or the \"Old Library\") was built between 1613 and 1619 by adding three wings to the Proscholium and Arts End. Its tower forms the main entrance to the library, and is known as the Tower of the Five Orders. The Tower is so named because it is ornamented, in ascending order, with the columns of each of the five orders of classical architecture: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite.The three wings of the quadrangle have three floors: rooms on the ground and upper floors of the quadrangle (excluding Duke Humfrey's Library, above the Divinity School) were originally used as lecture space and an art gallery. The lecture rooms are still indicated by the inscriptions over the doors (see illustration). As the library's collections expanded, these rooms were gradually taken over, the University lectures and examinations were moved into the newly created University Schools building. The art collection was transferred to the Ashmolean. One of the schools was used to host exhibitions of the library's treasures, now moved to the renovated Weston Library, whilst the others are used as offices and meeting rooms for the library administrators, a readers' common room, and a small gift shop.\n\n\n=== Later 17th and 18th centuries ===\n\nThe agreement with the Stationers' Company meant that the growth of stock was constant and there were also a number of large bequests and acquisitions for other reasons. Until the establishment of the British Museum in 1753 the Bodleian was effectively the national library of England. By then the Bodleian, Cambridge University Library and the Royal Library were the most extensive book collections in England and Wales.\nThe astronomer Thomas Hornsby observed the transit of Venus from the Tower of the Five Orders in 1769.A large collection of medieval Italian manuscripts was bought from Matteo Luigi Canonici in 1817. In 1829, the library bought the collection of Rabbi David Oppenheim, adding to its Hebrew collection.\n\n\n=== Radcliffe Camera ===\nBy the late 19th century, further growth of the library demanded more expansion space. In 1860, the library was allowed to take over the adjacent building, known as the Radcliffe Camera. In 1861, the library's medical and scientific collections were transferred to the Radcliffe Science Library, which had been built farther north next to the University Museum.\n\n\n=== Clarendon Building ===\nThe Clarendon Building was designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor and built between 1711 and 1715, originally to house the printing presses of the Oxford University Press. It was vacated by the Press in the early 19th century, and used by the university for administrative purposes. In 1975 it was handed over to the Bodleian Library, and now provides office and meeting space for senior members of staff.\n\n\n=== Twentieth century and after ===\nIn 1907 the then head librarian, Nicholson, had begun a project to revise the catalogue of printed books. In 1909, the Prime Minister of Nepal, Chandra Shum Shere, donated a large collection of Sanskrit literature to the library.In 1911, the Copyright Act (now superseded by the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003) continued the Stationers' agreement by making the Bodleian one of the six (at that time) libraries covering legal deposit in the United Kingdom where a copy of each book copyrighted must be deposited.\nBetween 1909 and 1912, an underground bookstack was constructed beneath the Radcliffe Camera and Radcliffe Square. In 1914, the total number of books in the library's collections breached the 1 million mark. By 1915, only one quarter of the revised catalogue had been completed, a task made more difficult by library staff going into the war effort, either serving in the armed forces or by volunteering to serve in the hospitals. In July 1915 the most valuable books had been moved into a secret location due to a fear that Oxford would be bombed, and a volunteer fire brigade was trained and ready, but Oxford escaped the First World War without being bombed. By the 1920s, the Library needed further expansion space, and in 1937 building work began on the New Bodleian building, opposite the Clarendon Building on the northeast corner of Broad Street.\nThe New Bodleian was designed by architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. Construction was completed in 1940. The building was of an innovative ziggurat design, with 60% of the bookstack below ground level. A tunnel under Broad Street connects the Old and New Bodleian buildings, and contains a pedestrian walkway, a mechanical book conveyor and a pneumatic Lamson tube system which was used for book orders until an electronic automated stack request system was introduced in 2002. The Lamson tube system continued to be used by readers requesting manuscripts to be delivered to Duke Humfrey's Library until it was turned off in July 2009. In 2010, it was announced that the conveyor, which had been transporting books under Broad Street since the 1940s, would be shut down and dismantled on 20 August 2010. The New Bodleian closed on 29 July 2011.\n\n\n=== Present and future of the libraries ===\n\nThe New Bodleian building was rebuilt behind its original fa\u00e7ade to provide improved storage facilities for rare and fragile material, as well as better facilities for readers and visitors. The new building concept was designed by Wilkinson Eyre Architects and the MEP design was undertaken by engineering consultancy Hurley Palmer Flatt. It reopened to readers as the Weston Library on 21 March 2015. In March 2010 the group of libraries known collectively as \"Oxford University Library Services\" was renamed \"The Bodleian Libraries\", thus allowing those Oxford members outside the Bodleian to acquire the gloss of the Bodleian brand. The building was nominated for the 2016 Sterling Prize.In November 2015 its collections topped 12 million items with the acquisition of Shelley's \"Poetical Essay on the Existing State of Things\". Thought lost from shortly after its publication in 1811 until a copy was rediscovered in a private collection in 2006, the Bodleian has digitised the 20-page pamphlet for online access. The controversial poem and accompanying essay are believed to have contributed to the poet being sent down from Oxford University.\n\n\n== Copying and preservation of material ==\n\nThe library operates a strict policy on copying of material. Until fairly recently, personal photocopying of library material was not permitted, as there was concern that copying and excessive handling would result in damage. However individuals may now copy most material produced after 1900, and a staff-mediated service is provided for certain types of material dated between 1801 and 1900. Handheld scanners and digital cameras are also permitted for use on most post-1900 publications and digital cameras may also be used, with permission, with older material. The Library will supply digital scans of most pre-1801 material. Microform copies have been made of many of the most fragile items in the library's collection, and these are substituted for the originals whenever possible. The library publishes digital images of objects in its collection through its Digital Bodleian service.\n\n\n== Treasures of the library ==\n\n\n=== Manuscript collections ===\nThe Ashmole Manuscripts (including the Ashmole Bestiary), collected by Elias Ashmole\nThe Carte Manuscripts, collected by Thomas Carte (1686\u20131754)\nThe Douce Manuscripts, donated to the library by Francis Douce in 1834\nThe Laud Manuscripts, donated to the library by Archbishop William Laud between 1635 and 1640\nThe letters of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley.\n\n\n=== Individual manuscripts ===\nThe Codex Bodley\nThe Codex Ebnerianus\nThe Codex Laudianus\nThe Codex Laud\nThe Codex Mendoza\nThe Codex Tischendorfianus III\nThe Codex Tischendorfianus IV\nThe Huntington MS 17, the oldest manuscript with complete text of the four Gospels in Bohairic (Coptic).\nThe Magna Carta (four copies)\nThe Song of Roland.\nThe Vernon Manuscript (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Eng. poet.a.1), the longest and most important surviving manuscript written in Middle English.\n\n\n=== Individual printed books ===\nA Gutenberg Bible, c. 1455, one of only 21 surviving complete copies.\nShakespeare's First folio, 1623\nBay Psalm Book, 1640. One of 11 known surviving copies of the first book printed in North America, and the only copy outside the United States.\nThe first book printed in Arabic with moveable type.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nThe Gough Map\nShikshapatri\nBakhshali Manuscript\n\n\n== Bodley's Librarians ==\n\nThe head of the Bodleian Library is known as \"Bodley's Librarian\". The first librarian, Thomas James, was selected by Bodley in 1599, and the university confirmed James in his post in 1602. Bodley wanted his librarian to be \"some one that is noted and known for a diligent Student, and in all his conversation to be trusty, active, and discreet, a graduate also and a Linguist, not encumbered with marriage, nor with a benefice of Cure\", although James was able to persuade Bodley to let him get married and to become Rector of St Aldate's Church, Oxford.In all, 25 have served as Bodley's Librarian; their levels of diligence have varied over the years. Thomas Lockey (1660\u20131665) was regarded as not fit for the post, John Hudson (1701\u20131719) has been described as \"negligent if not incapable\", and John Price (1768\u20131813) was accused by a contemporary scholar of \"a regular and constant neglect of his duty\".Sarah Thomas, who served from 2007 to 2013, was the first woman to hold the position, and the second Librarian (after her predecessor, Reginald Carr) also to be Director of Oxford University Library Services (now Bodleian Libraries). Thomas, an American, was also the first foreign librarian to run the Bodleian. Her successor from January 2014 is Richard Ovenden, who was Deputy Librarian under Thomas.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Novels ===\nThe Bodleian is used as background scenery in Dorothy L. Sayers Gaudy Night, features in Michael White's Equinox, and is one of the libraries consulted by Christine Greenaway (one of Bodley's librarians) in Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse novel The Wench is Dead. The denouement of Michael Innes's Operation Pax (1951) is set in an imaginary version of the underground bookstack, reached at night by sliding down the 'Mendip cleft', a chute concealed in Radcliffe Square.\nSince J. R. R. Tolkien had studied philology at Oxford and eventually became a professor, he was very familiar with the Red Book of Hergest which is kept at the Bodleian on behalf of Jesus College. Tolkien later created his own fictional Red Book of Westmarch telling the story of The Lord of the Rings. Many of Tolkien's manuscripts are now at the library.\nHistorian and novelist Deborah Harkness, set much of the early part of her 2011 novel, A Discovery of Witches, in the Bodleian, particularly the Selden End. The novel also features one of the library's Ashmole manuscripts (Ashmole 782) as a central element of the book.\nMedieval historian Dominic Selwood set part of his 2013 crypto-thriller The Sword of Moses in Duke Humfrey's library, and the novel hinges on the library's copy of a magical medieval Hebrew manuscript known as 'The Sword of Moses'.\n\n\n=== Location filming ===\nThe Library's fine architecture has made it a favourite location for filmmakers, representing either Oxford University or other locations. It can be seen in the opening scene of The Golden Compass (2007), Brideshead Revisited (1981 TV serial), Another Country (1984), The Madness of King George III (1994), and the first two Harry Potter films, in which the Divinity School doubles as the Hogwarts hospital wing and Duke Humfrey's Library as the Hogwarts library. In The New World (2005), the library edifice is portrayed as the entrance to the Royal Court of the English monarchy. The Bodleian also featured in the Inspector Morse televised spin-off Lewis, in the episode \"And the Moonbeams Kiss the Sea\", where a murder takes place in the basement.

A legal deposit library entitled to free copies of all books printed in Great Britain, the Bodleian is particularly rich in Oriental manuscripts and collections of English literature, local history, and early printing.Bodleian LibraryEntrance to the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford, Eng.Kaihsu Tai\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritannica Quiz\nWorld Organizations: Fact or Fiction?\nThe World Health Organization is a specialized branch of the United States government.\n\n\n\nA library was established at the University of Oxford by Thomas de Cobham (died 1327), but it was not completely secured by the university until 1410. Then Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, endowed the institution with books and money for a room between 1411 and 1447. Completed in 1450, the room is still in existence.With the impoverishment of the university, the development of printing, and the growth of college libraries, the university library declined in importance; and in 1550, Edward VI\u2019s commissioners withdrew what books were left. Soon after, the shelves were also dismantled. About 50 years later the library was restored by Sir Thomas Bodley (a collector of medieval manuscripts) and reopened in 1602. Bodley added new buildings, surrounding university buildings were taken over, and additions were made at various times up to the 19th century. A new building, connected with the old buildings by an underground way and designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, was opened in 1946.By agreement with the Stationers\u2019 Company in 1610 and later by the Press Licensing Act of 1662, the Bodleian was entitled to receive a free copy of all books printed in England. The library built up a collection of more than 4,200,000 printed volumes and 50,000 manuscripts. The Bodleian Library includes the Old Library, the Radcliffe Camera, the New Library, and four dependent libraries.Marco Polo sailing from VeniceMarco Polo sailing from Venice in 1271, detail from an illuminated manuscript, c. 15th century; in the collection of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, Eng.\u00a9 Photos.com/Jupiterimages\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\n ",

          "We visited as part of our walking tour around Oxford and our guide provided immense insight into the library over the years. It is one of the oldest libraries in Europe and currently contains over 13 million printed items. The buildings surrounding an inner quadrangle are superb",
          "We especially loved visiting the 15th Century Divinity School with its wonderfully detailed Gothic ceiling.",
          "Amazing building. I have heard and read about it but seeing it was even better. Expect lots of tourists about. I will definitely go there again.",
          "This library is free to visit, there is cafe area and toilets for all visitors. We decide to go to the library because it was the Tolkien maps for the lord of the rings and also CS Lewis map for N\u00e1rnia. We later found out there is also a copy of the Magna Carta there is only 1/4",
          "This is a building with immense history and our guide imparted a lot of knowledge in a short time and in a really fun way but not dumbed down at all.",
          "We only got to see the Divinity School hall, which was very impressive, and only \u00a32 entrance. Would have loved to been able to see more, even if it wasn't part of a booked-up formal tour.",
          "The Bodleian library offers several tours and its worth booking one before you arrive, some fantastic places to see that depending on the tour and your time offer great value, go try one and be amazed.",
          "The Weston Library is free access with exhibits in the foyer a great cafe, interesting shop and a changing range of specialist exhibitions. The Old Library Quadrangle (across the road behind the Sheldonian Theatre) is a magical place and then you find the Radcliffe Camera....",
          "Another must-see when visiting Oxford. The one-hour tour also a must - our American guide absolutely great.",
          "Right in the centre of Oxford and often featured in Morse To see the architecture both inside and out was terrific Most amazing stat is over 11 million books ! Worth visiting",
          "If you like Morse and endeavour you will recognise this place, architecture is what you expect - pure Oxford we did not have time to visit but the building was beautiful and close to the centre so worth a wander",
          "We did the 60 minute guided tour; our tour was led by a history don and was excellent. He was interesting and happy to answer questions. Highly recommended",
          "Me & a friend visited the library when we came to oxford. We were careful to book a tour online in advance to make sure we would be able to get in. Our tour guide was lovely but I sadly didn\u2019t get her name! Very informative. My only complaint is that the Gutenberg Bible which",
          "The majority of the grounds are free to enter. You will see historic classroom entrances with Latin inscriptions. The guided tours were sold out by 1pm on a Saturday so we just saw the inside of the Bodleian which was \u00a32 for entrance and features in the Harry Potter films",

          "My wife and I called into the Bodleian on a Monday afternoon. Not having reserved a place on a tour we arrived to find that all the tours were sold out for the afternoon. We were however able to pay \u00a32 each to see the Divinity School which is worth a visit to see the room where",
          "This place is so fascinating and to really get a sense of the history of the library you should consider the 90-minute tour. This guided tour gives you access to the Duke Humfrey Library, the interior of the Radcliffe Camera and the Gladstone Passage. At the end of the tour, you",
          "I have visited this beautiful site many times, in the snowy Winter, in the Summer, and there are always cyclists and tourists bustling about. It is worth finding, it is in the most beautiful part of the city. If you like architecture, you will be treated to an unforgettable",
          "The staff were very helpful, however the tours weren\u2019t running very frequently and as we were on a tight schedule, we didn\u2019t get chance to go on a tour and just looked round the public areas",

          "For most people the exhibition would be what you want to see and that does not involve the rigmarole of getting a visitor pass to the main part of the library. Interesting displays. I entered as a visitor so not able to borrow books but was allowed into the library as well as",
          "The round building dominates the plaza and you can walk all around it. The street is cobbled and so not easy for walking but it is so busy with tourists taking photographs you can't walk fast anyway.",

          "Don\u2019t miss it. It\u2019s a magnificent library - huge and beautiful - and you will be able to see an interesting part of it. You will certainly be impressed by the gorgeous medieval Divinity School - as well as the historic rooms of the Old Bodleian Library.",
          "We were so fortunate to visit on a beautiful crisp Winter weekend. We booked a tour around the old library and were not disappointed. The history and beauty inside is truly breathtaking.",
          "Our first stop in Oxford University is the Bodleian Libraries - a collection of 28 libraries that serve the University of Oxford in England, including, most famously, the Bodleian Library. The libraries collectively hold almost 13 million printed items, as well as numerous other",
          "So interesting, hearing the history, seeing the library with all the precious books. Silence, security, a real eye-opener. If you have time take the 1 hour tour. Our guide was very enthusiastic and very interesting.",
          "I really enjoyed this tour. We could have easily done this tour, without paying the fee for the audio tour. But, I feel, that I would probably not have got as much out of it as I did had I not paid for it. I think if we could have booked earlier I would have gone for one of",
          "This was a fantastic building and it is surrounded by others that are just as interesting. There is so much to see in this area and all of it a wonderment as to how well the buildings have survived and the amazing work that the builders put into these buildings",
          "We joined the guided tour to Bodleian Libary. By the way, it's the only way to access to Bodleian library for visitors. The tour was the most interesting library trip so far, the tour guide explained the history behind in a very well interesting and fun way! The sharing also",
          "As someone who loves libraries and books, I got tickets ahead to see this library. We took an hour tour on a Sunday which allowed us into the actual library (if you really want to see the books, make sure that is open). The docent was good but a bit rambling on with personal",
          "Get there early to avoid disappointment in seeing this. In a nutshell this is one of the largest libraries in the world! Whilst it has many kilometres of books on shelves, you unfortunately don\u2019t get to see all of it, but apparently there is a train service that is underneath",
          "We arrived at the Bodleian hoping for a tour and were faced with a long queue of people around the block waiting for tickets. So if you can, it is far better to book online in advance to avoid the queues, and also the possibility that the tour you would like is sold out. We were",
          "The architectures are just too cool in oxford. Worth it. Its walking distance to other touristic spots and quite easy to notice too. Can get crowded. Need to be sure of the opening timings, lunch and closing times as well.",
          "The collection of buildings and courtyards just cries out the history of acadmeia in Oxford with its Latin inscriptions of each section and its wonderful architecture and courtyards. As tranquil as a library ought to be. Of course, you may not enter the library itself unless you",

          "This was an amazing tour through the library. Very passionate and knowledgeable guides. We wished we had done the hour tour! Make sure you book in advance.",

          "Visited the library for a pre-booked 60 minute tour - what a thoroughly enjoyable & informative hour it was. The guide was brilliant (sorry can\u2019t remember her name, but she was a student studying history), the facts she gave us were amazing, plus the library itself was a joy - a",

          "This was a wonderful way to experience the library! We took the 90 minute tour which including going inside Radcliff Camera, highly recommend!! Our guide was very knowledgeable and she was witty as week. We thoroughly enjoyed it and learned so much more than we would have",

          "As a fan of the All Souls Trilogy, I knew I needed to visit the Bodleian Library when I visited Oxford, and I'm so glad I signed up for the 60 minute tour. Not only was the library just simply stunning, but I got the absolute BEST guide in the universe. Naomi was simply amazing.",
          "We had not planned this visit, but it was a very wet afternoon so we went in to get out of the rain. Wow, what a great surprise. We spent 3 hours and it was just amazing . So much to see and very educational. Lots of staff on hand for questions etc. It\u2019s Free, however they do",
          "Iconic building of the university and the towm itself. Best view is from the viewing platform.of the adjacent old church",
          "I could have stayed here all day and kept on looking at the historical grounds and buildings - Wish I had more time!",
          "We had first visited Oxford two years ago as part of a guided tour. On that occasion, our tour of the University of Oxford had been a \u201cwhirlwind\u201d affair and we really had not had the opportunity to see a great deal of the university. This time, we stayed in Oxford for a couple",
          "We were lucky enough to have a guide take us through this amazing library full of history as well as full of books! Obviously for the students but rich in its past, it\u2019s well worth a visit even if walking straight through the middle.",
          "Goblet of fire filming took place here Very beautiful architecture but not much time can be spent here without the children becoming restless",
          "First thing to note is that they dont run many 90 minute tours . Places come up two weeks in advance on line book then or you may be disappointed. We were told up front via e mail we could not do the full tour as there was filming on site which we later found out was the",
          "Really enjoyed a one hour tour around the library. Really special to see the oldest part of the library which is beautiful. Our tour guide, Lucy, was great - really informative as well as funny :)",
          "We very much enjoyed the short tour of the Bodleian library - of course our teenie appreciated most the Harry Potter references.",
          "Absolutely stunning. The atmosphere is magical especially during the golden light. The architecture is the main character of the scene. Second oldest and bigger library in the UK. It is not accessible to the public, unless student of Oxford University. It is worth a visit for",
          "This is a great little exhibition, free, at the Bodleian library which is the main research library for students of the Oxford university. But although the exhibition is in a small gallery, it\u2019s very detailed and if you have the time, I would look at only a bit at a time,",
          "Timed entry, so reserve your space and wander off. Half hour tour of the original library by a very-informed guide who pitched her delivery to include everyone in the group - young, old, English and foreign.",
          "Outstanding building that really stands out from the rest in Central Oxford both at street level and from above. Superb design and architecture.",
          "We did this as part of a wider tour: Absolutely awesome inside. Would come back and do the more detailed tour next time. Not to be missed!",
          "Don't miss this beautiful historic library if you are in Oxford. Our guide was engaging with lots of interesting stories and facts. The old books are amazing as well as the stunning architecture.",
          "We were time short so we visited the Divinity Room. It was only \u00a33 each for seniors. This whole area in the city is easy to walk and offers so much history, beauty and information for visitors.",
          "Book ahead for the tours or you will be disappointed. Well worth the visit, though the Divinity Hall is full of tourists dressed in Harry Potter clothing.... sigh. That in itself though is worth a photo...",
          "A lot of the time when you walk around Oxford you are walking over the Bodleian as it has underground chambers with tunnels connecting them. Check the website and book onto the 2 hour tour. Worth every penny.",
          "There are three tours, 30, 60 and 90 minutes. We took the 30 minute because it was all that was left (get to the booking office early for the best selection). Cost \u00a36 each and was great value. Guide was really knowledgeable and the library itself was really something to see.",
          "I had the 60 minute tour and it was amazing. Time flew by like it was nothing and It was super interesting. Some Harry Potter scenes where filmed in the divinity hall but there is so much more to it than that. The tour is a definite recommendation.",
          "Took the 60-minute tour with Elizabeth, and it was my favorite thing I did in 2 days of touring Oxford. She was absolutely incredible. Library is amazing and worth every pound to get in!",
          "Strongly recommend a guided tour. It\u2019s amazing and told with pride and a swelling heart! Harry Potter geeks get their treat as well!",
          "Very interesting hour long tour of the Bodlian library. Fascinating history, well presented information. Would highly recommend anyone with an interest in history to go, headphones were provided so hearing was not an issue.",

          "The Radcliffe Camera is probably one of the most beautiful and iconic buildings in Oxford. A must see for architecture buffs and photographers.",
          "It was amazing to see all these old books in such a beautiful building . Our guide was very informative. Shame it was only half an hour , but definitely worth doing.",
          "I admit we arrived late about 10 to 4 in the afternoon. The tours leave at four and then the last one at 4:30. We missed out on both tours. We were offered the alternative of viewing the Divinity school teaching room for 2 pounds each. What a waste of money! What do you get",
          "Very interesting history of libraries. Learned a lot about chained books and huge collection they have of all books! Strict security, can\u2019t even bring in your handbag. You only see one room, had hoped for more.",
          "What an outstanding tour of a historically beautiful building, Duke Humphrey library was the high point in what is a tour full of interesting facts and stunning architecture. What a wonderful place.",
          "This was one of our must sees, but it was closed to the public, but on the plus side there is plenty to see in this area so you don\u2019t get board",
          "We booked to go on the Tour that includes Duke Humphey\u2019s Library and the Radcliffe Camera. We had to be up early as it starts at 09.15 and we thoroughly enjoyed it and worth every penny. To my shame I have forgotten the lady who led the Tour but she was outstanding !",
          "Went with friends who had never managed to get into the library! Well worth the 100+ steps to get the view of all the Spires of Oxford",
          "A must visit when in Oxford and this world famous building is breathtaking, and a classic example of Oxfords ancient educational buildings.",
          "If I am completely honest... I went to see the Harry Potter film locations, but this place is full of so much history, our tour guide was very knowledgeable and a must visit! I would go as far to say a highlight of Oxford for me.",
          "Did the 9 pound tour for 1 hour. Got to see the Humfrey library and Divinity School which were wonderful. To be honest the convocation room was a bit meh, so if the 30 min tour covers both the Divinity school and and Humfrey library I would stick with that.",
          "We booked our visit two weeks in advance (the moment they are available on the library website), and were not disappointed. Both the Divinity School and the Duke Humfrey's Library are lovely, and the guided tour was worth the price. A must, not only for Harry Potter fans.",
          "To be clear the Bodleian library is an immensely impressive building with a phenomenal interior and historical significance. That said a visit there will most likely result in you being crushed against hundreds of tour groups to get a glimpse of the aforementioned building. The",
          "Visited on a lovely Sunday but been bothered waiting in line for the nonsense tickets for half an hour while only less than 30 visitors were queuing and many of them were in groups. The guy spent nearly average five minutes talking to each and this cost too much unnecessary",
          "We booked our tickets for the Bodleian library and the Humphrey library as soon as we arrived in Oxford, as they only sell them on the day of the tour. They weren't available on line due to graduation ceremonies. The tour groups are small (15 or 20 people) and you have to put",
          "If you only visit one place in Oxford, make it this one. I took the 60-minute tour and would have been glad for the 90. Really, the history and the glorious architecture are beyond imagining.",
          "I went on the 9.15 tour for 90 minutes and the time flew by. Our guiide was so knowledgeable and really brought the history to life. I am inspired to go away and get more details on the Divinity School roof and carvings. Higly recommended!",
          "All the library tours were booked so I didn't get inside, but just walking around the courtyard and seeing the Radcliffe Camera(?) - worth it! If you want a tour of the library, I suggest you plan/book ahead.",
          "The Bodleian libraries did not disappoint. As a lover of reading and history this had been a dream of mine and it did not disappoint. The history, the architecture or if you just love Harry Potter, this is a must see. Only downside is no pictures allowed in the reading rooms.",
          "Lovely building with an interesting history described well if you use the cheap audit tour which helps explain the building and its history. 40 minutes inside and out will cover it. The staff were very polute and helpful but the ticket queue system is laughable - 30 minutes plus",
          "The guided tours for this library book up days in advance so if its somewhere you want to go...then book!! I did the 30 minute tour which brings you into the Dimity Hall (you can go there for 2) or for 6 you are brough up to the world famous Duke Humfreys library that does fill",
          "Booked the 60 minute tour online and it was wonderful. The guide was excellent providing insightful facts and answering all our questions. Would recommend booking online as the tours were sold out on the day.",
          "Very impressive library. Tickets were gone very early. So it was good to book online early or line up at the ticket office before it opened for a ticket. But even the shortest tour (covering only the Divinity School) would be worthwhile.",
          "I wasn't aware that there was a fee to look around certain areas of the Library, I walked into such an area with my children & a rather enthusiastic tour guide bounded over to me and bellowed \"DO YOU HAVE A TICKET!?\", he didn't actually allow me to answer before he pointed over",
          "A must when visiting the Bodlean Library is the Divinity School, this medieval building in 1427 is the oldest surviving building that was built for study. Gorgeous long windows and the most spectacular fan vaulted ceiling it really is impressive",
          "The tour of this outstanding series of historical buildings is not to be missed on a visit of Oxford. The Duke Humphries library with its books dating to the 1500's is of such historical significance and is fascinating to view. Also the Divinity hall with its intricate ceiling",
          "The Bodleian wasn\u2019t at all what we expected- being a quadrangle with various subject libraries around it. We found it really helpful having a Guide because there\u2019s so much history associated with the Library that without this information, we\u2019d have missed a lot of interesting",
          "A wonderful tour in just 60 minutes of Divinity School, Chancellor's Court, Convocation hall and Dukes Library. Enthusiastic Martina was our guide - energetic and knowledgeable - wonderful o access these historic building and the magnificent Duke's Library = would have paid",
          "We went to Oxford every year during our 5 times visiting Oxford. But we could not get into this amazing, crowded and long lines of tourists who would like to visit this world's famous library in UK. Fortunately, this year while we were walking in front this library, we were",
          "The Bodleian was opened in 1602, bringing together various book collections which had been developed within the university since the 15th century. It holds over 13 million items, making it the second biggest library in the UK after the British Library. Public access to the",
          "Booked up to see 'Twelfth night' Shakespeare's play in the court yard of the Bodlian library at the end of July. Approximately \u00a370 for the two tickets and play performed by the Shakespeare players. What a brilliant night, weather permitting. Seating for approximately 100 people",
          "This building holds so much history and is completely different to the newlibrary. We visited the library whilst taking the free walking tour and it was well worth it.",
          "There are interesting buildings around every corner of Oxford and they are also all centrally located, which makes it easy to see everything on foot. This is a building that arouses great curiosity, perhaps most because one, as 'ordinary mortal', does not have access here ...",
          "I would totally recommend to visit this place if you love a bit of history, culture and perhaps books itself. We did the guided tour of 30 minutes, because only the guided tour shows you places that you can not visit on your own. We wanted to do the tour of 60 minutes, but that",
          "- We were in Oxford on a day trip and thoroughly enjoyed the Bodleian Library. - Oxford is a photographer's delight - Very impressive building",
          "On a day trip to oxford last week we popped in to the library as we were aware they had a lunar landing celebration event on. We stayed for a couple of hours and were thoroughly impressed by everything that was put on in celebration of the 50th anniversary. The story tellers,",
          "I enjoyed the \u201ctour,\u201d though we only visited two rooms. The guide was very knowledgeable and winsome. The headsets did not work well. Sound came in and out. But I did learn a great deal about the history of the library.",
          "Just beyond amazing and beautiful! For someone that loves this type of architecture Oxford is a dream come true.",
          "Was here last year to see the Tolkien exhibition at Bodleian library. The exhibition was awesome, if you can see it somewhere else in the world, I can recommend it. We did walk around at the place and it is truly amazing and beautiful. Love to go back there again one day.",
          "Informative and wonderful to see our history. There is a lot of standing and also stairs, so be aware. So glad we did this tour.",

          "If you are visiting Oxford on your own and not as part of any tour, would recommend to buy tickets to this place in advance. We went there on a Sunday, when it was closed for an event and only the library tours were allowed which were sold out for most of the day.",
          "Thank you Lucy for a very interesting 30 minute tour of the Bodleian Library. Your great sense of humour and depth of knowledge made for incredible enlightenment! I really enjoyed this wonderful insight into another world. I will definitely be back another time for the full tour!",
          "I went on one of the 60 mins guided tours of the Library - I've wanted to visit for a long time. Our guide wasn't English but spoke it well. My problem was that he spent too long downstairs showing court room etc before rushing us upstairs to the main part of it and expected",
          "I could've been here for ages! The atmosphere was staggering and the building very impressive! If you're never in Oxford, pay the visit!",
          "Stunning building, with lovely portraits and a magical feeling of stepping back into time. Be sure to look up at the carved ceilings! You can only book a tour with them, outside tours have limited entrance. Definitely a must-see when in Oxford",
          "We came on an hour\u2019s tour of the Bodleian and Duke Humphrey\u2019s Library. Our tour guide was called Tom and he was amazing. An ex- student (many years ago) and really informative. I could have listened to him for hours. The tour is great: you begin in the Divinity School (the",

          "No wavering - if you are in Oxford you must visit it, at least the 30 min tour you you are in a hurry or afraid to get bored. Better to book in advance. Otherwise it's easy not to find availability. I mean in high season.",

          "The Bodleian Library tour was the highlight of our Oxford visit. Of course many tourists come to Oxford and this library because of the Harry Potter filmlocations, but the library has such an interesting history itself, and there's so much to see, it's awe-inspiring. Our tour",
          "It is a wonderful piece of history. And worth seeing. We only could do the audio tour because tickets for a guided tour were sold out at the library. You can only see the old parts of the library if you have a guided tour. The audio gets you into the divinity room only. There",
          "If you visit Oxford, this should be one place in your list to visit. I took the 30 minutes guided tour and I was impressed. Please be ware that they will require all bags to be placed /Stored in a large bin, which will be locked. Everyone on the same tour will have their bags",

          "If you're in Oxford, this is a must see! The best way to get a good look and accurate information is to take one of the guided tours provided by the library in itself (instead of other walking tours). They offer 30, 60 or 90 minutes tour and whichever option you choose you'll be",

          "We saw this as part of our Visit Oxford Walk-in tour and we were the only 5 people in there at the time. A wonderful experience. A must for Harry Potter fans and those interested in History. The ancient chest and the chair made out of timber from The Golden Hind are amazing.",
          "1. If you want the long tour book it on line rather than queueing up -- you may be disappointed to find it was booked out online. We toyed with it but didn't want to organise our trip around visiting the library. We're glad we didn't. 2. You don't a lot in the 1 hour tour",
          "The guided tours are a bit of a shambles. Nothing on the ticket about meeting place and there were several different tours going on in different quads. Ticket office friendly but assume you know your way around. Very little signage and no announcements. Could do a lot better.",
          "The architecture of the building outside is beautiful, which is gated around the building containing greenery. Unfortunately we weren\u2019t allowed on this Saturday (no visitors) because it was only registered people. It was unfortunate because I\u2019ve seen pictures on google and looks",

          "This is probably one of the most famous buildings on the whole Oxford and a special place of pilgrimage for Harry Potter fans as some of the most famous scenes were filmed here. You can book to see the library as well",
          "You cannot come to Oxford and miss this visit, we went with the walking tour which was a plus when learning more about the library. The place is great, a lot of history inside. And of course, if you are a Harry Potter fan, it is a must.",

          "We signed up for the 30 minute tour of the Bodleian which included the Divinity School and Duke Humfrey's Library, which is the oldest reading room in the Bodleian Library. Both are very grand and one feels quite overwhelmed by the amazing architecture and history. There are",
          "We were on the 2hr Footprints walking tour (paid) and this includes entrance into the Divinity College. Simply stunning. Added bonus of it being used in several Harry Potter films. Definitely worth a look.",
          "I didn't get much out of my short guided tour here. It's a library. It's old. What more to say? Apparently a scene or so in a Harry Potter film was filmed here. Why should I care?",
          "Beautiful library. Very interesting and very informative tour included. Keep in mind, no pictures inside the library. Recommend visiting on Sunday when it is closed to readers and open to tourists only.",
          "We booked the longer tour as we wanted to see everything and it was so worth it. The guide was very knowledgeable and the tour just fantastic. You can only get into the Radcliffe Camera on this tour and that was also worth seeing. We visited many collages and museums in Oxford",
          "We have visited Oxford many times for trips and tours of Town, Colleges and Isis but on this wintry cold January day decided we needed to be in the warm and see the inside of the Library itself which this tour enable us to do. Around fifteen of us took this hour long guided tour",

          "The Bodleian Library is a place everyone should visit! Especially if you\u2019re a Harry Potter fan as scenes from the film were shot here, which makes it super exciting to be on one of the Harry Potter film locations! The library itself is absolutely beautiful inside and out, and",
          "It's all been said - just go and see it. The architecture and history is what makes this country unique.",
          "Visited this beautiful building as part of another tour and wish we had taken a specific Bodelian tour to see and learn more. Have always heard references to the stately library and was so nice to be able to actually visit it and see with my own eyes. If you like history and",
          "This is a wonderful building, and it was well worth taking a tour, the historic library is an amazing place to visit. Just a walk round the outside is well worthwhile",
          "Over 400 years old and with over 12 million books what's not to like - take in the historic architecture on the outside and then within and see if you can identify which films this amazing building has been featured in - well worth a visit!",
          "This is the second time I've been to the Bodleian and it is just as stunning this time around. The first time we went on the 30 minute tour which takes you up to the Duke Humphreys room. This time we did the 60 minute tour which also includes the Divinity school. Both are",
          "Very atmosphere place with great guides. And the place of Harry Potter movie shootings) Highly recommended for visiting!",
          "This library is the stuff of every book lover\u2019s dreams. We went on the 60-minute tour (book ahead!) which was alright. Our tour guide was a little spacey, but the history and look of this place makes up for it. Definitely check out the special exhibit in the West library, it\u2019s",
          "What a truly wonderful place-- like all of my childhood fantasies of being whisked away to hogwarts came true. Well worth it.",
          "We visited as a tour of the library and I would recommended doing one of these if you have the time. We went to the Divinity school room, the Duke Humfrey chained library, the Radcliffe Camera and more modern reading rooms. Highly recommended for anyone living in or visiting",
          "Stopped by early one morning for a tour in April 2018. Unfortunately, the schedule did not match what i read online and I did not have a chance to see Radcliffe Camera. I paid a few pounds to see the divinity school, then while I was leaving, I noticed they opened up a tour to",
          "We visited when Oxford was out of session and the Library not open for tours. We walked past the Radcliffe Camera and into the library courtyard, which unlike the Christ Church College courtyard is absolutely stunning and fascinating, with architectural and academic details.",
          "You get in by buying a ticket from the hall opposite. The hall is smaller than you think but more beautiful. It\u2019s ceiling are amazing and bring life the broader Oxford experience - easy to see how it sparked the imaginations of so many great thinkers.",

          "This was a birthday trip to see the Bodleian library. I had always wanted to see it as it has been used for many films. I was fascinated buy it architecture and history of the library. If you are ever visiting Oxford I highly recommend you book a visit to see this historic site.",

          "Wanted to get lost in its collected. Wanted to know more of the History. Wanted to explore, explore and explore. Am in awe. Wheelchair accessible with help.",
          "You can only see the Divinity School/hall by paying a fee; you can either join a small tour for a small fee, OR, if the Divinity School is all you'd like to see (or have time for), then you can enter by paying \u00a31. While there is not much happening inside, the place is magical.",
          "Worth getting a 1-pound entry ticket if you either can't afford the full trip or are simply running out of time in Oxford. The library is absolutely stunning and if you are a fan of Harry Potter, you will definitely recognize the hall :) :)",
          "We took the 1-hour tour on a Sunday (when Duke Humphrey's Library is fully accessible) and much enjoyed both seeing the building and hearing about its history from our knowledgeable guide. There's less atmosphere in the Divinity School but much to notice when it's pointed out",
          "We pre-booked directly with the Bodlian a 30 minute tour at the end of the day. It only cost around \u00a36 per person which I thought was very reasonable. We were shown around this stunning architectural and historical treasure and informed of the colourful history and some of the",

          "This place is simply magic, it's a gem of Oxford and it's a pity you can access just if you join a tour.",
          "We visited the Bodleian Library on a Saturday afternoon just before closing time it is only \u00a31 to get in and is well worth it.",
          "Sadly, unless you are studying a specific subject which cannot be studied elsewhere, you are not allowed membership so I cannot comment on the library itself although the occasional exhibition is always a treat. Tolkien a few weeks ago and the Suffragist Movement at the moment.",
          "We came to the library to visit the Tolkien exhibit. The library buildings are super cool. And they are a huge tourist draw. Get there early if you want fairly people free pix. The exhibit was amazing and really nicely arranged. The bodleian is really worth a visit.",
          "We didn't go into the Library itself, but, as part of a walking tour, were taken into the quadrangle where we learnt the history of the Bodleian & the various little doors around us. Next time we will do the tour inside.",
          "We booked our tour ahead of time and were so glad that we did. The guide was very knowledgeable and we learned so much about the history of the Oxford Universities and the library.",
          "Extremely interesting visit, made even more so by the enthusiastic guide. No lift so Visitors with mobility problems could find climbing the stairs difficult.",
          "Yes, you do have to take a tour of the Bod. And yes, it will be worth it. Got to love the ancient library with books chained to the walls. Harry Potter's ancestors lived here.",
          "Wonderful architecture. Visited on a walking tour. Would like to come back to take more time to wander.",
          "I love libraries and this one is very cool. I was unaware of the structure of Oxford and the colleges that form it. The tour was very nice and the library and its architecture were an interesting part of the tour.",
          "The Hall has provided backdrop for Harry Potter scenes \u2013 the sick bay and the one where Harry and Co. learnt to dance before the Ball \u2013 the space itself on the day we visited was full of autumn light and shadow that added to the atmosphere and the visit \u2013 pop in for a pound and",
          "We were quite excited to visit this place, esp my 7 year old, thanks to the Harry Potter mania. But it was disappointing to know that he wasn't allowed. The staff present there was unnecessarily rude and stiff.",

          "We visited whilst staying in Oxford. First think to note you need to book advance we got there at Saturday lunch time all tours sold out luckily they did have some space for a halve an hour tour on the Sunday . We came back for this next day and you need to arrive about five",
          "We booked a tour online - you can do this in advance. Our guide was excellent, knowledgable and personable. It has an interesting and amazing history and the rooms you visit are unique. Fabulous.",
          "As a librarian, I couldn't visit Oxford without doing this tour. We got to see inside the Divinity Hall and the Duke Humphrey's Library. A bit disappointed that our guide couldn't answer some of my library-related questions. Quite expensive for what we got to see.",
          "I don't believe the best is made of the escorted visit. We only spent 15 mins of a 1 hour tour in the library.",
          "Don't miss the free tour - Quite a nice historical library. Amazing the learn how many books are actually here and how many keep getting added. It is quite beautiful inside and so hard to believe that it is actually fully in use! A must-see sight. We probably needed to",
          "Guided tour was \u00a39 per person and lasted about an hour. Although given headphones unfortunately my husband being almost deaf couldn\u2019t use them, nor could he hear the guide as she obviously had to talk quietly as the library was in use, so it was a waste of money for us really.",
          "We just came to see the Tolkien exhibition in the Western Library. Very informative exhibition with lots of less known material. Do book before you arrive as tickets (free of charge) are limited.",
          "The library tour is recommended if you are a bibliophile. Beautiful building, well kept. If you are around during the Tolkien exhibition in the Western Library, don't miss it. Very informative, atmospheric experience. Do book before you arrive (it is free) as tickets are",
          "This was the main place I wanted to visit when I visited Oxford and we bought the \u00a31 ticket to get into the Divinity school which doubled as the Hogwarts hospital wing in the first two Harry Potter films and parts of the Bodleian have been in Inspector Morse series Lewis,",
          "Brilliant and informative visit. Staff extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Variety of options and prices for tours and access. Lots to see without paying .",
          "A lovely place to visit and spend some time. One of the jewels of Oxford. Great to see so many over-seas visitors taking an interest.",
          "The entrance to the Bodleian exhibition of J R R Tolkien is situated in Broad Street, Oxford. The entrance is easily spotted, there being a spacious entrance area beyond the main doors, a cafe and shop to the side. Oxford is not the easiest city to find a parking spot near the",
          "Before I went into the exhibition, I got chatting to a chap at the cafe. He said he had been in Oxford since 1961 when he came as an undergraduate to study English. His professor had been Tolkien, then at the end of his academic career. The chap explained that Anglo-Saxon",
          "We took the 30 minute mini-tour to the Divinity School (an original university building) and the Duke Humfrey medieval library (the original part of the Bodleian Library) above it. Our enthusiastic tour guide Jane made it easy to imagine the early years of the Divinity School,",
          "If you are a Tolkien fan then this visit is essential viewing. You will get to know the man behind the stories. The drawings provide a sneak preview of the books and films. Enjoy as magical.",
          "I wanted to see inside and the only way to do this was the 30minute tour. To be honest, it\u2019s quite steep in price and not being able to take photos to show friends the amazing history is a bit annoying. However history isn\u2019t always accessible so when it is, it is worth soaking",
          "Because of events that day, only the 30 minute tour was available. It is short, but interesting. You see the Divinity School room (the Hogwarts hospital in the movies) and the Arts end of the main library rooms. We didn't get to go into the Duke Humfrey's Library section",
          "The history, the architecture, the books--all amazing. I wasn't sure what to expect in my 90 minute tour, but a friend highly recommended it. I'm so glad I took this tour with the knowledgeable guide.",

          "Very worthwhile display for those of us who are interested in his work and life. Staff were helpful and knowledgeable.",
          "When I travel overseas I almost always find myself touring the local library. Sometimes the local library is truly special. Like Trinity College in Dublin, the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, or the Bodleian at Oxford. The book collections at the Bodleian are accessible",
          "So glad we entered the Bodleian library with its fascinating ceiling and history. We saw the Bodleian library as part of the Oxford University walking tour with our experienced and entertaining Trevor who is with Footprint Walking Tours in Oxford. Our walk was about 2 hours in",
          "Went with my daughter who is crazy about Harry porter. The library and the divinity school were totally worth it.",
          "Came here as apart of the Bodleian Library Tours! It is amazing, the architecture is to die for. The ceiling is so intricate with various animals on for example. Worth coming to. Plus.. filming location of Harry Potter. Ekkk.",
          "Another very popular destination in Oxford during peak periods but definitely worth seeing to take in the history. Another attraction worth seeing via the Walking Tour and gain access to the history of the attraction.",
          "We had the 30 min tour which was so interesting. We visited a couple of fabulous rooms. The guide was very knowledgeable and interesting. Would def go back and revisit.",

          "What a wonderful experience and one of great privilege. The guide, David, had such a wonderful voice and sense of humour. The history was fascinating and felt a little surreal. The library itself is a glimpse into something historical and special.",
          "I was travelling solo and unfortunately I was only able to see the divinity school (there is a fee entrance \u00a31) as I had to be in a tour guide group to visit the Duke Humfrey\u2019s Library",
          "I could spend months in here. Just bring me sandwiches now and again. Fabulous architecture, and oddly, a wonderful smell. Well worth a visit.",
          "Must-see stop for any Harry Potter fan. They know they are catering to Potterheads, because after the guides give the historic facts, they pull out laminated pictures of the Harry Potter movies and show which scenes took place in the building.",
          "The Bodleian and the Divinity School are amazing historical treasures that are still used for educational excellence as intended.",
          "We did the 90 minute tour which showed us pretty much everything. Margaret was a wonderful guide and brought the space and history alive. Each part was wonderful in its own way: - the architecture of the Divinity School - the wonder space and amazing books in Duke Humphry's",
          "The library is amazing & we had a fantastic guide who took us through with great patience answering questions and her quirky humour - whilst here one can actually imagine the Harry Potter scenes of flying books \ud83d\ude09 A must do!",
          "We booked an hour's tour which was excellent. We had a very knowledgeable guide, and so learnt a lot about the organisation and running of the university and library history. This is an absolutely beautiful place. I just loved the smell of the books.",
          "This was a guided tour full of interesting historical facts and the library itself was a wonder not to be missed. The architecture was impressive.",
          "Really pretty inside. Only \u00a31 to get in! The architecture is really nice. The harry potter films were filmed here (the hospital wing specifically)",
          "Great guided tour . Funny informative guide. Not a lot of time spent in actual library but well worth the visit.",
          "We drove a long way to visit this library and gave up a day of other sites to see on our trio but we\u2019re denied entry on a tour due to their arbitrary age cut off. We had read about Bodleian and seen footage and my well-behaved children who love medieval history and Harry Potter",
          "Beautiful building and a great gift shop......if you are a \u2018Potterhead\u2019....you\u2019ll love the place! It\u2019s near the centre of the Colleges and part of a wonderful walk......the White Horse pub is across the road if you fancy a tipple in an Inspector Morse drinking hole!",
          "Unmissable if visiting Oxford but needs to be booked in advance. Excellent guide for our 90 minute tour.",
          "The Bodleian Library is a working library, an institution that is part of Oxford University. The main sites are the Old Library complex around the Schools Quadrangle, the Radcliffe Camera in Radcliffe Square, and the Clarendon Building and Weston Library, facing each other",
          "Worth a visit even if you're not into the Harry Potter franchise. Interesting stories about the founder himself and the university.",
          "I was at the library on September 11 and they had an excellent free exhibition about Tolkien: Maker of the Middle-earth. Was very informative and full of unseen artworks, display of his paintings, drawings and illustrations. It was wonderful. I hope I can have a chance to visit",
          "I have visited before and thoroughly enjoyed viewing the Bodleian again. The issue was they had a guide from the Far East and her accent was too strong for most people to understand.",
          "What an amazing place, a guided tour is a must. Buy tickets at the Great Gate from \u00a36-\u00a312 - We went middle ground & were really impressed for the money...a very special place even for non academics!",
          "What an amazing collection of books in a beautiful original surrounding. The whole space is fabulous but can only be accessed with a tour guide. We only did the 1/2 hour tour as the longer ones are offered on different days. I would like to have done the longer tour to see the",
          "We did a 60 minute tour of the library. Our guide Patrica was very informative,telling us of the history of each of the rooms downstairs, then taking us upstairs to the old library. Best things were the ceilings & all the old books.",
          "We had tickets booked for the Tolkien exhibition on Thursday. Both my Husband and l found it a very good experience. It's always helpful to have allotted time slots as it stops over crowding. Tolkien's art work up close is incredibly intricate.The relief map showing the journey",
          "If research is your aim, then this is THE Library. Primary source documents and a willing staff that will help you find them.",
          "A very interesting tour given by a gentleman that is clearly incredibly knowledgeable. I would have preferred to see more deeply into the original library itself as they are pictures you see on the advertising for the tour, but you don\u2019t actually see that.",
          "Actually we live in Oxford but I always love to go there. The Divinity school is beautiful and I always love to work in the library. Moreover they always have excellent temporary exhibitions like the current one on Tolkien.",
          "Free entrance, but you need to book the tickets in advance as the gallery is small and it gets crowded quickly. The exhibition is amazing and very well curated. It shows the work and the life of the author beautifully, giving an insight on how they intertwined. The collection",
          "Go ! Just go here. The buildings are absolutely breathtaking!!! Even if you just go and stand in the main square it\u2019s somewhere you have to go if you are in Oxford !",
          "Its one of the most amazing things of Oxford, allow yourself to get lost in time and just indulge the greatness of this library.",
          "A free tour, you have to book tickets in advance though as it is a small space which gets very busy. The exhibition creates a picture of a man who from an early age was obsessively creative and absolutely dedicated to ensuring that his work was the best it could be, while at",
          "The Tolkien exhibition is small but exquisite. It felt like he was in the room. There were items from his work and personal life on display, such as his desk, chair, eyeglasses, numerous sketches, memorabilia, maps, artwork. Highly recommended.",
          "Really interesting exhibition about Tolkien's life and his work and how they intertwined, what aspects of his life that were brought into the books etc. Amazing drawings and maps of Middle-Earth as well as photos of the authors and items from his personal life. Very well curated",
          "The image shows the ceiling of the Divinity School, now used for functions, but with an important history. All three of Oxford's Reformation martyrs had a 'theological disputation here' - but really their trials were kangaroo courts. The library itself, founded by Thomas Bodley,",
          "Absolutely beautiful place to visit. Amazing architecture and attention to detail. Very contemplative.",
          "Excellent tour guide, very helpful and knowledgeable. Amazing place, simply stunning architecture. Wonderful",
          "I found it confusing to work out what was where yesterday. I was intrigued by the exhibition poster for curious cabinets, which I thought was in the Divinity School, but after queuing for a long time at the other end of the quadrangle to pay my \u00a31, found that the exhibition was",
          "Emmanuelle took us on our tour of the Library and it was a delight. What a wonderful place. Quite magical. Loved it",
          "Appreciating the talents of J.R.R. Tolkien, we visited the 'Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth' display. It showed not only the details of his books and writings but also what a brilliant artist he was. A Professor at Oxford Pembroke and Exeter Colleges, it detailed his life as",
          "My daughter and I were brought here to see the place where Harry Potter was filmed which was really beautiful. We also appreciate literature so seeing the amazing upstairs library and the very old books was a unique experience. What I didn't know is that the place has a very",
          "The tour guide was very informative with a lot of knowledge of the library. The library was beautiful and all the other rooms you get to see. Disappointed you couldn't take photos but it was worth a visit",
          "We did the 90 minute tour of divinity school, Duke Humphrey\u2019s library and Radcliffe camera. The decor was stunning and it was incredible to think Charles I read in the rooms we were standing in, looking exactly as they did, untouched from the 1600s. David was an excellent,",
          "a beautiful building but you need a lot of time to get inside and it was heaving with foreign tourist and summer school students. You can't get access to the books without a pass.",
          "Had a wonderful tour in the Bodleian, what an impressive library! With the outstanding explanation of our guide Csilla (historian herself) it made it all an unforgettable experience. Would definately recommend it!",
          "Very beautiful place and I'm happy to have seen it. But it's hard if you want a picture of the place without 20 other people in it.",
          "As we didn't book anything in advance, we were too late to get tickets for the library. Instead we paid for the audio tour, which explained the quadrangles surrounding the library and allowed us entry into the Divinity School. We found this was a great way to get a feel for the",
          "More books than you can shake a stick at! Its fascinating to see how these old establishments work. You can really imagine being an academic from the 18th century, scurrying across the cobbled courtyards like a scene from Harry Potter. The architecture is amazing and you\u2019re",
          "Another wonderful building - both the library itself and the Divinity School. Although you can wander round the courtyards you need to book a tour to see inside. Extremely busy - and quite expensive (like everything else in Oxford!) - but worth the cost as you get a lot of",
          "I had a free day so decided to finally make the trip to the bodleian, I have wanted to go for many years, I checked online and it said tickets can be brought at the door, I didn't know how long the journey would take so I couldn't pre book. I drove the 4 &1/2 hours and arrived",
          "Absolutely wonderful free exhibition. But you need to pre-book online. Full of fascinating artifacts and amazing artwork.",
          "It is well worth a visit. At present, the Bodleian has an exhibition of J.R.R Tolkien, showcasing his works. The library is open, inviting and friendly. They have a wide selection of books on offer, however you do need to be a member before you can rent any books.",
          "If you are one of the fans of harry potter you must visit bodleian library where potter wore his magical globe to search forbidden area in the lobrary the library is super famous and you must prebooked on line to get in with an experienced guide",
          "I spent a week in Oxford and the highlight of my trip was the Bodleian Library. I was with a program called Oxbridge for teachers and I attended a librarian seminar. The Duke Humphrey's library is just beautiful and it is where the Harry Potter library scenes were filmed. The",
          "We visited with the purpose of visiting the Tolkien exhibit. It was well laid out and contained many interesting facts. While there we visited the suffragette exhibit. It was very interesting to discover information about the suffragettes of Oxford as well as key women in rights",
          "Apart from the history of the place,the visit of the Library is most illustrative of the size and richness of Oxford University collection of books and publications. The visit also includes Divinity School which is a marvel inside the Bodleian Library.",
          "Beautiful place, superbly peaceful. We had arranged with a friend to see the Tolkien exhibit which I would definitely recommend and we were even able to see one on Women\u2019s access to vote. No pictures allowed though",
          "I loved the library. We took the hour tour and it\u2019s a beautiful building full of history. Reminds me of the library in \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 where some of the books are so valuable they are actually chained. If you love history, architecture or books it\u2018s worthwhile.",
          "The Divinity school was location for Hogwart's Infirmary in the Philosophers Stone. Not just a library as does stage Shakespeare in the quad occasionally, not in term time!",
          "The one hour tour inside the library is excellent. You will need to be able to walk up quite a number of stairs. The history is very interesting and the architecture is beautiful.",
          "This library is a must-see if you're a lover of books or culture or magic. The history of the library gives you an idea of the history of England. This was one of my favourite tours in the UK. It's almost sad that you're not allowed to take photos inside but quite",
          "I went to oxford specifically to see the Tolkien exhibition. I wasn't disappointed. if the exhibition was held in a larger room, whith the exhibits laid out in a more spacious manner, it would be n improvement. As it is, if it is busy, you will have to be patient to get to read",
          "OK, I'm biased, being a librarian, but the Bodleian is one of the most gorgeous libraries in existence. The architecture is stunning. Harry Potter fans should make a point of seeing an important location in the films.",
          "Exhibition of the man behind the books of Middle Earth. I've read The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, but there is much more of the man and his family which wants me to read more. The visual affects are fantastic and the maps and art work and research behind the books is",
          "We went on a short tour of the Divinity School and Duke Humphrey\u2019s Library. Excellent and informative guide. The vaulting in the Divinity School was special, and the account of the development of the this library (and libraries in general) impressed us. It is well worth having a",
          "A superb setting for Merchant of Venice, we have enjoyed this and other Shakespearean plays by the Globe Theatre Players in the magnificent Bodleian Quad over the last few years. With interval refreshments served in the atmospheric old Divinity School to add to the experience.",
          "We didn't have time to do the tour of the library but we did stroll around the Tower Of The Five Orders which is the main entrance of the library. Absolutely breathtaking! Next time, we are definitely setting aside time for the full tour. Highly recommend!",
          "Bravo! An amazing performance on a summer night in the most stunning location... Bodleian Library complex is quiet and beautiful - a lovely place to visit to escape the crowds of the high street",
          "Fascinating tour of one of the oldest libraries in the world. Ask for our tour guide, Lucy, as she added much more than the standard tour.",
          "I was totally overwhelmed with the age and vastness of this collection. Now when I think of libraries the Bodlelan comes to mind with its historic tomes chained to prevent theft.",
          "Anyone who loves Tolkiens Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit has to visit this excellent exhibition. To see some of the original manuscripts for notes in the margin was fascinating. Had the habit my father used, first write in pencil make your corrections after reading and then",
          "If you don\u2019t fancy walking round with a tour guide and a combo of other folks, try the audio guide. \u00a32.50, gets you a 40 minute tour around the mainly exterior of the Bodleian, but tells you a great deal of its history. Really worth the money.",
          "We went on a paid walking tour around Oxford university and visited tbe Bodleian library, a true masterpiece. It is very well kept and the history behind is breathtaking. Highly recommended.",
          "Bodleian library is very beautiful and old but the entry into the library is not that expensive.The tour was also no that expensive.",
          "I regret that we did not have enough time to take advantage of all the library had to offer. However the Tolkein exhibit was wonderful and will last till the end of October. I would definitely take the tour and any special exhibits.",
          "They had sold out of the standard tour. So I went on the half hour short tour. There was plenty of time to look around the School of Divinity before and after the tour. The tour itself around the library was very good. Probably just as well that you were not able to go through",
          "Booked the extended tour, it was a real insight. Naiomi is a gem of a guide, very much enjoyable and what a fantastic place to spend a couple of hours. Go! You won't regret it.",
          "We all know they have a great collection, but you can't really see much on the tour...staff seem to tolerate your tourist ($) presence",
          "One of the coolest things about the bodleian library is the entrance hall where you hear some of the stories about how students would defend their works for hours at a time. The library itself is small once you go upstairs, but there's a ridiculous amount of history inside. I",
          "We visited here on self guided tour. To be honest it was nice and great tv and movies had been filmed here. However the humfrey library wasn\u2019t in the self guided tour which was disappointing so we missed out. But it\u2019s lovely. They were showing the JRR Tolkien exhibition in the",
          "Standing in the square, inside the Bodleian is mind blowing. I hadn\u2019t realised the reaction I would have had. As a University of London graduate we were always joking about the students of Oxford, and Cambridge, being overprivileged. I could now see how lucky they were. Just",
          "We were in the happy position to make a last minute booking for the Radcliffe Camera and Bodleian Library Tour. Only with this tour you receive entrance to the Radcliffe Camera! A must see in Oxford!",
          "Historic library with lovely architecture and many interesting nooks and crannies. Exhibitions with various themes throughout the year.",

          "You have to take a tour if you want to see the Bodleian. Our tour guide was really good, we went to the divinity school which has a remarkable ceiling and the upstairs reading room. All the Harry Potter references were ticked, I hope the university made a good amount for letting",
          "Second time visiting this place. They always have a special exhibit on display that is free (requires ticket at desk for time to enter) as well as additional historical exhibit. You don\u2019t know what piece of history you will see. Educational and amazing.",
          "I was in Oxford for a few weeks, initially took standard tour but decided I would like to see more of the old library than a distant view from the librarian's desk so booked into the extended tour a few weeks later. Very disappointed because it was the standard tour padded out",
          "We went on the guided 30 minute (lasts a little longer than this). Fascinating place and history. A helpful & friendly guide took us around. (We're not Harry Potter fans but clearly a few people come here to see the film locations!). You leave your bag (and camera) in a locked",
          "I loved learning about the history of this library and smelling that 'old book' smell you only get from being around books that are 500+ years old. Loved it! Wish we could take photos, though.",
          "We did not pre-book and all they had available was a short 30 min tour that took us through the Divinity School and Duke Humphrey's library. This place is worth going to just to see one of the best examples of English Gothic architecture and one of the oldest libraries. I wished",
          "Glorious historical library which is a must see when in Oxford. Truly architectural delight. It\u2019s amazing the older books still are available for \u201creaders\u201d. I was quite troubled to learn from our guide they have no modern fire suppression system. This seems mindless risk for",
          "An excellent historical place in Oxford. It is one of the oldest libraries in Europe. The structure is awesome. Many forms of guided tour are available. Just choose the one which is suitable for you. If one is visiting the library, a guided tour is a must. There is a small shop",
          "We prebooked the extended library tour to explore the Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera. The buildings are beautiful and our guide (an American lady) was so knowledgeable and made the tour so interesting and informative. We got to see the original chained library, the Radcliffe",
          "If you want to see where Oxford University started, this is the place to visit. I used the excellent audio guide, which allows you to go around at your own speed, available from the ticket kiosk in one of the archways into the quadrangle. The whole tour took about 40 minutes,",
          "Wow! We paid \u00a36 each for a guided tour and despite not bein allowed access to all parts this was excellent value for money. The tour guide was knowledgeable and took lots of time to explain things aling with humouress anecdotes. I would definitely go back again.",
          "From J Boy of Derby Booked the extended tour that takes in the Radcliffe Camera and the Gladstone walkway which was an old railway line taking all the printed books to the library. We had Naomi an excellent guide who explained the history of the Bodleian in an impressive way",

          "For only \u00a38 we had a very interesting tour into 4 sections of the library\u2019s and access to the history with a very informative tour guide.",
          "We prebooked the upstairs downstairs tour online to explore the Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera. The buildings were beautiful, the guide well informed and friendly, and the wonder of seeing things like the first lecture hall of what would become Oxford University very real.",
          "We took a tour that lasted an hour. It was led by a very well informed and interesting guide who knew not only many small facts but presented an overall picture of the extreme importance of the library.",
          "We brought friends to visit and took a standard tour, one which we have done before. Whilst the tour guide was very personable and informative, and the building was excellent as always, we found the content with its liberal sprinkling of Harry Potter references shied away from",
          "My wife has this on her wish list and we did the hour long version of the tour. It covers the oldest parts of the building. Good guide and great history. Overwhelming to see such old structures and think of the past events that happened here. This requires tickets and they are",
          "Very old buildings and some used for bits in the Harry Potter fits, bit with a interesting and indeed intricate history. And now of course facing problems because so many books are published and there is such high demand. But it seems to be in good hands and working well. Plus",
          "So impressive to be in this historic building and hear how it came into being and has developed over the years. The guides were very knowledgeable. We then went over to the new museum (I can't remember they call it) to see the display items.",
          "We only had time for a brief look inside, but it's so beautiful and different - it's worth a look and there's an inexpensive ticket for that. You don't need to do a full tour if you don't have time, but I would guess you would get a lot of great information on the guided tour.",
          "I did the standard tour and the guide really knew her stuff. It was very in depth and interesting to see the library itself as well as the convocation room (like a mini houses of parliament), court room and the duke of Humphrey's library. I really wish that they let you explore",
          "Lucky enough to attend a lecture here on botanical art history. Enjoyed visiting one of the frequent temporary exhibits after the lecture which was also excellent. This also contains my favourite gift shop in Oxford selling very unique and tasteful items to commemorate your",

          "This is another place I have read about for year and I was so excited to visit this hallowed building. It was everything I'd hoped it could be. The people who have walked through the halls of the library is staggering. Every turn on the tour took my breath away but nothing beats",
          "Beautiful architecture downstairs in the old Divinity School Building, library above with collections of books several hundred years old, but still a working library. You can't check them out, but students and faculty can use these old resources on site. Two Harry Potter sites",
          "Weston library is always worth a visit - a) for nice coffee bar b) fort beautiful exhibitions of printed materials on diverse subjects (this time \"From Sappho to Suffrage\" - fascinating collection on women's writing and activism) c) a lovely shop!",
          "This place cost a fortune to just go in and look....it's a library!!! Was amazed they could charge so much",
          "Check the official website for tour timings so you can plan ahead because we were there after 2 pm and the standard tour had ended. We took the tour for the Divinity School only. Built in the 15th century, the school is the oldest surviving purpose-built building for university",
          "OK, I do enjoy Harry Potter and the Deborah Harkness-books. But nonetheless: this is a very beautiful building. Sure, The Divinity School was an infirmary and used for a dance lesson in the Harry Potter-movies, and some of the library scenes were also filmed here. But this",
          "I went to Oxford on purpose to visit the library. I'm not a Harry Potter fan, I am books' fan and love history. I must admit I was moved to tears on entering the place. Our guide didn't just tell us about the library: she took us back in time and led us throughout centuries. I",
          "One of the highlights of a beautiful town full of highlights. Amazing architecture, history, and collection. Our docent, Naomi, was outstanding and herself a treasure worthy of the finest library in the world.",
          "Make the time to explore this classic location and take in some stunning architecture. Wander and wonder.",
          "We took this tour just so that we could see the wonderful Duke Humfrey\u2019s library . It was well worth it for that alone , but the guide was brilliant: informative, self deprecating and funny, with a bit of a Harry Potter obsession.",
          "We didn\u2019t have long enough to wait for a guided tour but we did do an audio tour which took us around the buildings and into the Divinity Room. It was very informative and I\u2019d go back and do the guided tour when we have more time. It also inspired me to join the library through",
          "Our tour guide, Jean(?) was very knowledgeable and gave us a nice little historical summary of the Universities beginnings and some of its inner workings. Luckily for us it was made clear from the very beginning that this is a working library, and when you actually get to the",
          "We were in Oxford and had booked online a standard tour for the library. Our two main reasons we wanted to take the tour was to see the film sites for Harry Potter and to see Shakespeare's first folio. We were disappointed to learn that Shakespeare's book was no longer on",
          "You can only visit on a 30 minute tour but the guide we had was really engaging, and of course you learn more when you're with someone who knows the history! It's a fascinating glimpse at the history of this 600 year old library. Slightly disappointing that you don't see inside",
          "First time we turned up it was closed for an event. Fair enough but when we asked about opening times for the following day the staff on the desk could not have been more offputting and gave us one or two word answers in an unfriendly tone. I discovered later that we could",
          "The guided tour was fascinating and held our interest throughout. You really get a feel for the past with the beautiful rooms and the wonderful old books, shelves and furniture. Very atmospheric. It is lovely to think that scholars past utilised this facility as well as today's",
          "Took the standard guided tour and it was great and very informative. The history here is amazing and the buildings/rooms are beautiful.",
          "I did the one hour standard tour of the library. Our guide was very informative. You are not allowed to take photos of the upper floor with the books. They make you put your belongings in a safe during the tour. It was really interesting to learn about Oxford University and see",
          "Very good tour guide (Joan) who took great pride in the library. A fascinating tour with lots of history. The place is unbelievable and the shenanigans that went on surrounding its building and events that took place will stun you. A real piece of British history and yet still",
          "This tour was very good...lots of inside and the only way to see the old Divinity School and the first library. Love it all. Our tour guide was not a native english speaker so she was rather hard to understand, but she was extremely knowledgable. Worth doing!",
          "it is amazing and just so very beautiful, one could look at it many times and be happy with this building.",
          "Outstanding place where history is alive and you can feel it. If you love medieval architecture along with history, it is your place. Recommend walking shoes, and budget preparedness. Please, get the Library tour and visit the Taylor Institute. Walk around and find a coffee shop",
          "Awesome - do the tour.Just looking at the outer areas does not give you the real understanding of the history within the building and its significance. Do the full one hour tour.",
          "Walking in the main courtyard you see the statues and Latin inscriptions of the various departments of learning, Music, Philosophy, Medicine, the towering walls covered in sculptures is a beautiful monument to education-so glad it is free to enter here.",

          "Bodleian Library is such a really beautiful place to visit it was our first time visiting Oxford \nand we saw this . if we get to return anytime would call back here .",
          "Nice but not so visitor-friendly.",
          "A good historical place when you can look at books from a distance, but you\u2019re not allowed to read or even touch (if you are not a student). Kinda defeats the purpose. The library is closed to public, the exhibition is unimpressive.",
          "Amazing historical place, it would be nice to go inside but we don\u2019t have enough time to do that",
          "Would love to leave a review of the actual library but the is aimed at the information provided. Made the two and a half hour trip to Oxford primarily to visit the Bodleian Library only to find that despite the web saying it opened at 12 midday it in fact wasn't open at all. NOT HAPPY!",
          "The library tours are definitely worth it: you get the chance to sit in the old Divinity School, see the University court and the incredible reading rooms.  Go early and book your tour - they are very popular and difficult to get on at busy times.",
          "You can only see the Divinity School/hall by paying a fee; you can either join a small tour for a small fee, OR, if the Divinity School is all you'd like to see (or have time for), then you can enter by paying \u00a31.\n\nWhile there is not much \u2026",
          "The library is surrounded by old beautiful building, with magnificent architectures. I really enjoyed every bit of the tour in the library.",
          "Majestic place, though you do have to buy tickets to go inside now",
          "This is an astonishing place with long and complex history. I highly recommend the 30 minutes guided tour (6 pounds/person). Our guide, Niomi, was an excellent story teller, and her vivid explanation really took us back in time.",
          "My reivew and 5 stars are for the library tour (60m and 90 mins). \n\nWithout a doubt this has to be on the top of your list for things to do in Oxford. Harry Potter fan or not you get to start in the Divinity Hall (Sick Bay), the tour guide \u2026",
          "One of the highlights of a visit to Oxford. If you want to visit on your own you can only see the Divinity Hall. Otherwise you need to join a 30, 60 or 90 mins tour costing \u00a36, \u00a39 or \u00a312 which, depending on the tour length will gain you access to the rooms you can\u2019t see on your own.",
          "A magical place",
          "I paid a visit to the Bodleian Library during a visit to Oxford and was very impressed with it's architectural splendour. It is a truly wonderful building  that stands in the centre of Oxford and imparts a magnificent view to visitors to \u2026",
          "Make sure you look up the times of the tours, because you can\u2019t just look around the library without a guided tour, and the tours only run at certain times. Best to stop by in the morning, get your tour time, then come back. Lovely building, worth a visit if in Oxford",
          "Visited this beautiful building as part of another tour and wish we had taken a specific Bodelian tour to see and learn more.",
          "A must visit when in Oxford - such a great place for research - kinda puts wiki in its place!",
          "Bodelian library is the main library in the Oxford. Also the oldest library in the Europe. It is one of the few libraries in Britain to receives a copy of every book and magazine published.\n\nIt's a must visit in Oxford with old vintage \u2026",
          "Beautiful building to walk around with visually stunning period architecture. Excellent reference library.",
          "Go there only if you join their tour or want to appreciate the library from the outside most parts not open to public. Not really worth visiting. Go there as a tourist only if you happen to be in the area.",
          "The Tolkien exhibition is a great one to visit, with a mix of JRRT's own notes, sketches and drafts, interactive maps, his chair and pipe, and some 'fan letters'. If you are a fan, make time for this.\n\nTickets are free, but have to be booked in advance; we dropped in about 10:00 and got a pair for 12:30.",
          "WOW WOW WOW what a place. I booked into the 60min standard tour best time to go is definitely on a Sunday as the library has little to no students in the Duke Humpfrey library so the tour guide took us to the very bottom of the library a \u2026",
          "I loved this visit. Unfortunately I was only able to do the standart tour but even then O lived every second of it. I would advise you to invest on an extended tour (I believe it is worth it). Warning: buy your tickets online and before you get to Oxford or you'll be at risk of not being able to book a tour.",
          "A wonderful little gift shop. Sad they charge to see the inside of the library.",
          "Have been there today for an exhibition of Tolkien's drawings and maps - absolutely amazing!",
          "Even through the queue for buying the tour guide is long, this place is still one of the greatest libraries I have visited in the world. The tour guide and the staff were very knowledgeable and helpful. After the guide find out that I \u2026",
          "The magnificent Bodleian Library, the property of the Oxford University, was built in 1602 and contains more 12 million books. I would add that when I saw the building that houses it, I did not guess it was a library.",
          "I did the standard tour which was very interesting. Excellent tour guide and the buildings are just stunning. Would highly recommend a visit.",
          "Where the Intellectual elite go to get educated.",
          "J. R. R. Tolkien exhibition. Fantastic exhibition with many of his sketches and scribblings.",
          "We took the 1/2 hour guided tour and learnt so much about the history of the library. Our guide was knowledgable and enthusiastic. Beautiful buildings, would highly recommend.",
          "Very nice unbelievable. Or you can the best in the world you should see it",
          "Wonderful place for a visit and a guided tour, architectural design of the courtyard is amazing.",
          "Very quiet when we went. Beautiful ornate carvings.",
          "Didn't get to go inside but it is really beatiful even from the outside. You need to pay  tour to visit the grounds I believe. It's definitely not free.",
          "Wonderful library fantastic divinity school. Must do.",
          "it's worth to visit this place. for architecture, for design, for fantastic atmosphere ;)",
          "I'm an actual student at Oxford, and believe me, it's most certainly not the best library. How many libraries do you know that are closed on Sundays? For a busy researcher,  it's a ludicrous and detrimental situation to have to deal with \u2026",
          "It's a nice looking building but was close when we went.\nBetter check before coming to make sure it's open on the day.",
          "This has to be the quintessential University library. It feels like an honor just to be able to stand within this building knowing how much knowledge is contained therein and how influential it had been in the academic history of the world.",
          "I took the 60-minute tour and thought it was very good. The guide was very knowledgeable and gave a very informative tour of the library. This tour allows you to see places in the library that cannot be seen to the general public so that was really interesting.",
          "The five quid, 30-minute tour was definitely worth it. The library is beautiful. Wish more areas were accessible, but I completely understand why they are not.",
          "30 minutes of my life wasted on a dumb presentation about former Harry Potter movie sets. Avoid this tourist trap!",
          "Beautiful and huge library.",
          "Great library. Unfortunately it is not allowed to wander here by yourself. There is a short guided tour with some information about the times that Harry Potter scenes were recorded here.",
          "Great experience. Apart from the 'Harry Potter' experience, the library has more to offer in terms of an interactive guided tour about the history of the library. ",
          "One of the greatest libraries in the world. It is a pleasure to work in these beautiful buildings: almost everything I need to know is right here.",
          "The famous library of Oxford. Just walking in there leaves you with the impression of the rich history of the place.",

          "We was overwhelmed. Even the kids loved this visit. I would like to come as a reader. All this old books.",
          "I've been there for a school trip. It's a very magical place, especially if you love books and people who love them too, besides being one of Oxford most historical sites. The guide was friendly and answered to all our questions. It's definetly a worth-time experience!",
          "Beautiful location in Oxford and a must for any book lover in the world.  I would highly recommend the Extended tour of the Reading rooms, just the Duke Humphrey's Reading room is worth the price of entry.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Modern Art Oxford is an art gallery established in 1965 in Oxford, England. From 1965 to 2002, it was called The Museum of Modern Art, Oxford.\nThe gallery presents exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. It has a national and international reputation for quality of exhibitions, projects and commissions, which are supported by a learning and engagement programme with audiences in excess of 100,000 each year. Funded primarily by Arts Council England, all exhibitions and many events, activities and workshops are free for visitors.\n\n\n== History ==\nModern Art Oxford's premises at 30 Pembroke Street, Oxford were designed by the architect Harry Drinkwater and built in 1892 as a square room and stores for Hanley's City Brewery.The gallery was founded by architect Trevor Green in 1965. With funding from the Arts Council of Great Britain, the gallery survived as a venue for temporary exhibitions. It was widely known as MoMA Oxford, similar to other international modern art spaces such as MoMA in New York.It was renamed \"Modern Art Oxford\" in 2002. Adrian Searle of The Guardian commented, \"Perhaps the museum bit was only ever there to confuse tourists and convince gowny academic Oxford that modern art was worth taking seriously.\"\n\n\n== Directorship ==\nSeveral transitory directors oversaw the gallery until Nicholas Serota became director in 1973, with Sandy Nairne as assistant director. David Elliott replaced Serota in 1976.Elliott's programme focused on media that were often ignored by bigger public galleries at the time, such as photography, architecture and graphic design. Under Elliott's directorship, MoMA held photography exhibitions such as the Robert Doisneau Retrospective in 1992. Elliott introduced up-and-coming artists from Africa, Asia and the Soviet Union, and at various times also held major video art exhibitions. His contributions also included multiple gallery renovations. He resigned his position in 1996 to become the director of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, having served the longest term of any director in the history of the gallery.\nElliott's replacement, an American from Los Angeles, Kerry Brougher, preferred larger shows of American and European art, and, like Elliott, exhibitions focusing on film and media. In 2000, Brougher left to join the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C.\nBrougher was replaced by Andrew Nairne, who renamed the gallery, coordinated additional enhancements to the building, and donated the gallery's substantial library of art books and catalogues to Oxford Brookes University. He shifted the focus to exhibitions of contemporary artists, who have included Cecily Brown, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Tracey Emin, Gary Hume, Daniel Buren, Stella Vine, Sol LeWitt and Kerry James Marshall. Nairne left the gallery in 2008 to take up a senior managerial position at the Arts Council.\nMichael Stanley assumed the directorship in January 2009.David Thorp assumed interim directorship in October 2012 following the death of Michael Stanley.\nPaul Hobson was appointed Director in April 2013 and took up the post that September.\n\n\n== Notable exhibitions and shows ==\nArtists' exhibitions have included Richard Long (1971); Sol Le Witt (1973) Joseph Beuys (1974); Donald Judd (1995); Marina Abramovich (1995); Carl Andre (1997) and Yoko Ono (1997). Since the renaming of the gallery, notable exhibitions have included:\n\nTracey Emin This Is Another Place (November 2002 \u2013 January 2003) - marked the reopening of Modern Art Oxford by and was her first British solo exhibition since 1997.

          "This is a really good exhibition space in the city centre, depending what's on, it can turn into a very interesting visit (or a rather boring one). The admission is free so you can risk just going there but I would advise checking beforehand.",
          "The gallery is just over half a mile away from Oxford station on foot, close to both the Westgate shopping centre and the castle. The current exhibition is called I Am A Wanderer by Kiki Smith, a German/American all round artist. There are many small sculptures on view as well",
          "This is quite a small museum. When we visited it was just an exhibition by Kiki Smith. We found this to be quite interesting but your level of enjoyment and interest will probably depend upon what the exhibition is at the time. It is probably worth checking what exhibition is",
          "The old brewery has been transfformed into a very effective art gallery with spacious rooms and a surprising amount of light for a building at the back of other buildings. Lots of space inadequately filled by Kiki Smith. Unisex toilets in basement.",
          "Stunning entrance way leads into this small but perfectly formed gallery. Current exhibition features paintings by artist Claudette Johnson - an array of striking and thought provoking works of art. We very much enjoyed our time here this afternoon.",
          "We visited Oxford and walking through the streets heard some lovely music coming from this cafe. So we walked in through the open door, where the sign said \u2018welcome\u2019 and people who clearly worked there standing by the door said \u2018hello\u2019 to us. Then as we got to the bar the lady",

          "I'm not really very interested in modern art but a modern art gallery should provoke some sort of a reaction even if it is laughter at the nonsense some people regard as art. This museum didn't even do that, it could have been a school art exhibition. The cafe looked nice",

          "This is a fine building (originally a brewery) and has light, airy galleries. There is no core collection but instead it houses exhibitions. The offer when we visited in Feb 2017 was works by Lubaina Himid. We were not familiar with this artist but her works were well",
          "Recently visited the Kaleidoscope exhibit celebrating 50 years of all things Modern Art Oxford. It was not just out there art but progressive and unusual and abstract. It's stuff that gets the mind going. It's a great space to explore and the downstairs area features film",

          "A show by Anne Hardy was on...quite good really, nice use of the space by the artist, at least one super photograph. Caf\u00e9 and shop are pretty good as art galleries go and invigilators were helpful.",

          "Visited today with the family. I absolutely love modern art so had high hopes.. but i just didn't get this. Freedom by Josh Kline.. the doughnuts, the policemen, the 'sorry' people... Obviously this is my opinion and the art i love and enjoy others may hate. I suggest you visit",
          "There is an exhibit \"Lynn Hershman Leeson: Origins of the Species (Part 2) that is nothing short of spectacular. There is a film she has prepared, \"Electronic Diaries\" that is so moving and inspiring. It is lengthy but worth every minute. You do yourself an injustice by not",

          "The entrance is a bit intimidating - it looks like the back-end of a warehouse, but once I'd got through I found myself in a really friendly place with lovely staff. The exhibitions change regularly; what I saw was video art - finally got to see the re-staging of the Battle of",
          "interesting exhibitions such as the excellent recent Warhol/Morris, but reason enough to visit at any time is the good value caf\u00e9 in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Customers are a mix of gallery visitors, students and lunch time workers and shoppers, and the atmosphere",

          "Modern Art Oxford's current exhibition has received some negative press, however, I found the show both accessible and informative. The juxtaposition of Warhol's 1960s screen prints against William Morris's wallpaper designs was daring and the photographic comparison of their",
          "I have visited modern art oxford twice. The first time the exhibitions were bizarre and a bit of a waste of time. My last visit however was excellent! The Andy Warhol and William Morris exhibition is fantastic, I couldn't recommend it highly enough. What to take from all this?",
          "Answer: they are both extraordinary artists in their own right, and Modern Art Oxford have done an excellent job of curatorship here in linking them, and bringing their work together in the gallery spaces. I visited on a very wet Wednesday lunchtime with an excitable group of",

          "I visit Oxford at least once a year, always on a day coach trip. On this occasion, with only 4 hours available and having spent most of it in the Ashmolean Museum for the William Blake exhibition, there were only about 45 minutes available here. I'd never been here before and",
          "We spent a few hours in this place on Saturday. The Morris/Warhol exhibition was fantastic.I had never seen the link between these two unrelated artists but the exhibition gently takes you through the similarities with great examples of their work. I was even more mesmerised by",
          "I have been to a few Warhol exhibitions in the last few years, including the current one at Tate Liverpool, but this has been my favourite. If you like the design element of Warhol's work, which I do, then this exhibition is highly recommended. I also really like Morris' work,",
          "Visited over the festive period during a weekend away in Oxford. The gallery is free to get into, smallish but worth a visit. It had activities to keep children entertained as well as a cafe.While we were there there was a Warhol and Morris exhibition on, worth seeing.",

          "Current major \"exhibition\" is dreadful rubbish. So tired and pointless. The ideas expressed are adolescent at best - filling an entire gallery with (shock horror) words expressing how manipulative language can be. An insight! Then a video installation showing clich\u00e9d text about",

          "Cafe in the lobby is really nice for some coffee, chilling and working. The pastries are also good! Not exactly a place to go if you're looking for individual desks - it's more like sitting on picnic benches. Only giving a 4 stars as the \u2026",
          "Really nice art gallery hidden in the centre of Oxford. Voluntary entry fee and nice collection of art. We loved the concrete design of gallery.",
          "It always has good exhibitions, but I wish there was more everytime. The bookshop is small with some crafts that are beautiful in general.",

          "Interesting exhibit but not what expecting",
          "A really lovely gallery and cafe is really nice but it wasn't as child friendly as I expected.

          "Lovely small museum, free admission",
          "Variable in exhibition standard BUT always worth being on radar for an art lover.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology () on Beaumont Street, Oxford, England, is the world's first university museum. Its first building was erected in 1678\u20131683 to house the cabinet of curiosities that Elias Ashmole gave to the University of Oxford in 1677.\nThe present building was erected 1841\u20131845. The museum reopened in 2009 after a major redevelopment. In November 2011, new galleries focusing on Egypt and Nubia were unveiled. In May 2016, the museum opened new galleries of 19th-century art.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Broad Street ===\nThe museum opened on 24 May 1683, with naturalist Robert Plot as the first keeper. The building on Broad Street, which became known as the Old Ashmolean, is sometimes attributed to Sir Christopher Wren or Thomas Wood. Elias Ashmole had acquired the collection from the gardeners, travellers, and collectors John Tradescant the Elder and his son, John Tradescant the Younger. It included antique coins, books, engravings, geological specimens, and zoological specimens\u2014one of which was the stuffed body of the last dodo ever seen in Europe; but by 1755 the stuffed dodo was so moth-eaten that it was destroyed, except for its head and one claw.\n\n\n=== Beaumont Street ===\n\nThe present building dates from 1841 to 1845. It was designed as the University Galleries by Charles Cockerell in a classical style and stands on Beaumont Street. One wing of the building is occupied by the Taylor Institution, the modern languages faculty of the university, standing on the corner of Beaumont Street and St Giles' Street. This wing of the building was also designed by Charles Cockerell, using the Ionic order of Greek architecture.Sir Arthur Evans (1851\u20131941), who was appointed keeper in 1884 and retired in 1908, is largely responsible for the current museum. Evans found that the Keeper and the Vice-Chancellor (Prof Benjamin Jowett (1817\u20131893)) had managed to lose half of the Ashmole collection and had converted the original building into the Examination Rooms. Charles Drury Edward Fortnum (1820\u20131899) had offered to donate his personal collection of antiques on condition that the museum was put on a sound footing. A donation of \u00a310,000 from Fortnum (\u00a31.15 million as of 2020) enabled Evans to build an extension to the University Galleries and move the Ashmolean collection there in 1894. In 1908, the Ashmolean and the University Galleries were combined as the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology. The museum became a depository for some of the important archaeological finds from Evans' excavations in Crete.\nAfter the various specimens had been moved into new museums, the \"Old Ashmolean\" building was used as office space for the Oxford English Dictionary. Since 1924, the building has been established as the Museum of the History of Science, with exhibitions including the scientific instruments given to Oxford University by Lewis Evans (1853\u20131930), amongst them the world's largest collection of astrolabes.Charles Buller Heberden (1849\u20131921) left \u00a31,000 (\u00a345 thousand as of 2020) to the University, which was used for the Coin Room at the museum.In 2012, the Ashmolean was awarded a grant of $1.1m by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to establish the University Engagement Programme or UEP. The programme employs three Teaching Curators and a Programme Director to develop the use of the museum's collections in the teaching and research of the University.\n\n\n=== Renovations ===\n\nThe interior of the Ashmolean has been extensively modernised in recent years and now includes a restaurant and large gift shop.In 2000, the Chinese Picture Gallery, designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects, opened at the entrance of the Ashmolean and is partly integrated into the structure. It was inserted into a lightwell in the Grade 1 listed building, and was designed to support future construction from its roof. Apart from the original Cockerell spaces, this gallery was the only part of the museum retained in the rebuilding. The gallery houses the Ashmolean's own collection and is also used from time to time for the display of loan exhibitions and works by contemporary Chinese artists. It is the only museum gallery in Britain devoted to Chinese paintings.The Sackler Library, incorporating the older library collections of the Ashmolean, opened in 2001 and has allowed an expansion of the book collection, which concentrates on classical civilization, archaeology and art history.Between 2006 and 2009, the museum was expanded to the designs of architect Rick Mather and the exhibition design company Metaphor, supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The $98.2 million rebuilding resulted in five floors instead of three, with a doubling of the display space, as well as new conservation studios and an education centre. The renovated museum re-opened on 7 November 2009.On 26 November 2011, the Ashmolean opened to the public the new galleries of Ancient Egypt and Nubia. This second phase of major redevelopment now allows the museum to exhibit objects that have been in storage for decades, more than doubling the number of coffins and mummies on display. The project received lead support from Lord Sainsbury's Linbury Trust, along with the Selz Foundation, Mr Christian Levett, as well as other trusts, foundations, and individuals. Rick Mather Architects led the redesign and display of the four previous Egypt galleries and the extension to the restored Ruskin Gallery, previously occupied by the museum shop.In May 2016, the museum opened new galleries dedicated to the display of its collection of Victorian art. This development allowed for the return to the Ashmolean of the Great Bookcase, designed by William Burges, and described as \"the most important example of Victorian painted furniture ever made.\".\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\nThe main museum contains huge collections of archaeological specimens and fine art. It has one of the best collections of Pre-Raphaelite paintings, majolica pottery, and English silver. The archaeology department includes the bequest of Arthur Evans and so has an excellent collection of Greek and Minoan pottery. The department also has an extensive collection of antiquities from Ancient Egypt and the Sudan, and the museum hosts the Griffith Institute for the advancement of Egyptology.\nHighlights of the Ashmolean's collection include:\n\nDrawings by Michelangelo, Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci\nPaintings by Pablo Picasso, Giambattista Pittoni, Paolo Uccello, Anthony van Dyck, Peter Paul Rubens, Paul C\u00e9zanne, John Constable, Titian, Claude Lorrain, Samuel Palmer, John Singer Sargent, Piero di Cosimo, William Holman Hunt, and Edward Burne-Jones\nThe Alfred Jewel\nWatercolours and paintings by J.

The group in the painting are Prince Rupert, Colonel William Legge (Governor of Oxford) and Colonel John Russell (commander of the prince's elite Blue Coats). The painting was acquired for the nation through the Acceptance in Lieu scheme, administered by Arts Council England.\nIn 2017 the museum acquired a Viking hoard that was discovered near Watlington in South Oxfordshire in 2015. It is the first large Viking hoard discovered in Oxfordshire, which once lay on the border of Wessex and Mercia. The hoard contains over 200 Anglo-Saxon coins, including many examples of previously rare coins of Alfred the Great, King of Wessex (871\u2013899) and his less well-known contemporary, King Ceolwulf II of Mercia (874\u2013879).\nIn 2015 the Ashmolean raised the money needed to acquire a major painting by J. M. W. Turner. With lead support from the Heritage Lottery Fund, a grant from the Art Fund, and a public appeal, the fundraising target was met to secure Turner's only full-size townscape in oils: The High Street, Oxford (1810).

Valued at \u00a33 million, the painting has been described as an important work illustrating the transition from early to mature C\u00e9zanne painting. As the thieves ignored other works in the same room, and the stolen C\u00e9zanne has not been offered for sale, it is speculated that this was a case of an artwork stolen to order.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMuseums of the University of Oxford\nOxford University Museum of Natural History\nBate Collection of Musical Instruments\nChrist Church Picture Gallery\nDonation by Sultan bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSackler Library\nThe Griffith Institute\nVirtual Tour of the Ashmolean Museum, photography from 2003\nPowhatan's Mantle\u2014pictures, description and history\nWorks by or about the Ashmolean Museum in libraries (WorldCat catalog)",

          "Such wonderful collections. Whenever we visit Oxford, we try and fit in a visit. I find it best to do \" little and often\" to get the most from a visit. This time, we spent an hour in the European Art section, they have some wonderful \u2026",
          "My first visit here and not my last. Was so fascinating would even make a special trip to go again. I live 200 miles away. \nBeautifully presented exhibits. I went to see a special exhibition about food in the Roman period but ended up \u2026",
          "Free museum. It's a really big museum, it will take some times to visit all.",
          "What a fantastic museum. So much to see with every room crammed to the rafters with awesome antiquities and artworks. Plenty of kid friendly tours and treasure hunts. It would take many more visits to see it all, so we're definitely planning on returning.",
          "Great museum!! So much to see. Only down side is that it could be a bit more child friendly. Activities for them on more exhibitions would benefit",
          "Really great museum. Awesome selection of different types of work. Definitely the main attraction of Oxford, for me. Wish I could have taken pictures in the modern art section. Seems weird we couldn't... oh welll",
          "Amazing place. Highly recommended and it's free but please do donate whatever you can to keep it free for everyone. \nLovely decor and they have a huge array of items, including a mummy!\nRestaurant inside with toilets. It's on several floors but there are lifts available",
          "It is difficult to know where to start a review for such a house of treasures.  I'll start and end at the bottom.  The caf\u00e9 is worth a journey in itself with delicious snacks and strong, hot coffee.  Walk in through the main entrance, descend the stairs and enjoy a treat surrounded by antiquities.",
          "A world visits here. Yesterday it was the Rembrandt exhibition. Even a mini brass rubbing to do. Often abroad in places like Knossos, the guides say go here to see the best examples of the old world. Such a variety of articles to see. Brilliant guides.",
          "Amazing museum, great collection. Loved the classical antiquity the most. Overall a must visit when in Oxford. Take your time, if you want to see the entire museum it will take at least half a day up to a whole day.",

          "My advice is not to try to see everything in one visit. You will exhaust yourself. Pick a theme and look in detail. \u00cc pursued an interest in non-Roman ancient Italy: Etruscans, Greeks, Oscans etc. Then I relaxed a bit with the European art. The cafe serves good coffee.",
          "Great exhibitions here, just visited Last Supper in Pompeii, which was fascinating. The only reason I\u2019m giving 4, not 5, to the museum is that every time I\u2019ve come to a paying exhibition, it\u2019s been over crowded, despite timed tickets. I \u2026",
          "Fabulous. So much to see and try to understand.  Gorgeous building. I'll need to return many times to do it justice. Engaging for my children too.",
          "If you think that only British Museum in London can be interesting - you are mistaken! A lot of exhibitions related to history of various regions of the world. Spent half of day there manage to see only ground floor. Will be returning there definitely.",
          "What a fantastic museum. All the displays are excellent with lots of information and so much to observe. Free to see but \u00a35 donation is requested which still makes it teriffic value for money.",
          "Wonderful museum with oodles of interesting artifacts.",

          "The main areas as interesting as always but the Guston exhibition ill lit and not very well curated. The last few special exhibitions I have been to -Pompeii  the witches one and one on modern american art some time ago suffered in the same way. A pity since the subjects are usually potential interesting.",
          "Fabulous collection in this museum which is claimed to be the first museum to open it;s door to the general public in the world.Located oppsoite the Randolph Hotel, there is so much to see in this place. Nice Cafe at the top to enjoy some time out too.",

          "A great museum, 2nd largest in UK, just smaller than the British museum in London. A lot of to see, fewer visitors than London. Kids have place to play. A lot exhibits of Egypt, China and Roman. Entrance fee is for free, but a donation of 5 \u2026",
          "Truly amazing museum and art gallery. Disabled access throughout. Disabled access toilets too. Well worth a visit. Hard to go into how much stuff this place has in a review. The Pompeii exhibition is worth every penny and the rest of the gallery and museum is free. Stunning.",

          "One of Great Britain's Great Museums.  There is a mind boggling range of cultures represented with illuminating comment beside most exhibits.  The caf\u00e9 is pretty good too.",
          "A little gem in Oxford. Entry is free but they ask for a donation. It's nice and quiet inside so you will enjoy it. The artefacts are limited in most sections but still helpful to peak back at the human history and civilization. Has a cafe which offers good coffee.",
          "It's a mini museum about everything in our daily lives and the history, like textile, trading, etc. Give simple but interesting information about the history and lives for each era. A great exposure for the history of the ancient Egypt, \u2026",
          "This place is massive and...free! On par with the British Museum. I enjoyed the ancient civilization part and the Silk Road section. That's really all I had the energy to see. You can go back every day for a week and still see something new. Highly recommend it.",

          "comparatively small but Great place to visit. Great collection of Egypt mummies and  History of Buddhism.  Totally free entrance fee. Don't miss this place.",
          "I think can promote more tourists to oxford,but proper signage inside the museum would be very helpful otherwise it would be a maze.overall it's a good experience and I think a must place to visit for the tourist.",
          "The best in Oxford, the best in UK after the British museum. the ancient history section is specially good.",

          "Love this place. Fantastic collection and great exhibition. Worth a visit anytime you\u2019re in oxford. It\u2019s like a mini V&A museum.",
          "Wow. Just wow. You could walk around here for hours. The sheer amount of stuff they have is impressive on its own. A lot of ancient statues are copies, but that doesn't devalue the learning and general experience you get. They almost have any time period you can imagine.",
          "Friendly team, trails for the kids for different exhibits, really useful having lockers to put our stuff but could use a few more of them as they were pretty busy. Overall a great few hours looking round.",
          "Impressive collection of artifacts of ancient civilisations. At the same time, there is an interesting exhibition of art of the last century.",
          "Only OK rating because internal signage was so bad ie what exhibits were on what floor.  No handy guide you could get and take around.  Exhibits excellent not child friendly unless special events on.",

          "Not worth the travel, in total the whole journey took 2.5 hrs, 30 mins to drive in 1.5 hrs trying to find somewhere in this god awful city to park, just to eventually find somewhere after dodging cyclist's that overtake you on either side \u2026",

          "Hmmm... does Google really expect me to justify 5 stars? There aren't enough stars in the sky to 'rate' this absolute gem of a repository.",
          "Excellent display of our imperialistic spoils. Some of it was probably donated to avoid inheritance tax, but it looks like we nicked most of it to me. Still, at least we're taking good care of it - and hopefully we won't have to give it back after Brexit. My wife likes the caf\u00e9 too. Good cappuccino and carrot cake \ud83d\ude42",
          "I've come back to reduce my 5 star rating. I still love the mummies and exhibits, bit sadly this place seems to be going downhill. Today I went to the Pompeii exhibition which was not well displayed, with many items squeezed into small \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Oxford University Parks, commonly referred to locally as the University Parks, the Uni Parks or just The Parks, is a large parkland area slightly northeast of the city centre in Oxford, England.  The park is bounded to the east by the River Cherwell, though a small plot of land called Mesopotamia sits between the upper and lower levels of the river. To the north of the parks is Norham Gardens and  Lady Margaret Hall,  to the west the Parks Road, and the Science Area on South Parks Road to the south.  The park is open to the public during the day, and has gardens, large sports fields, and exotic plants. It includes a cricket ground used by Oxford University Cricket Club.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPart of the land on which the Parks is located had been used for recreation for a long time, and it formed part of the University Walks said to have been used by Charles II to walk his dog in 1685.  The land originally belonged to Merton College, and in 1853/1854, the University of Oxford purchased 20 acres (8.1 ha) from Merton College to build the parks. Over an eleven-year period a total of 91 acres (37 ha) of land was eventually acquired.  A portion of this land (4 acres) was set aside for the University Museum which was built between 1855 and 1860. Between 1912 and early 1950s, a further portion was used to build the Science Area, so the current site measures around 74 acres (30 ha).\nThe Parks was laid out in 1864, and the work supervised by William Baxter who was later appointed the first superintendent of the parks in 1866.  Parts of the Parks were designated to be used for sports and recreational purposes. 25 acres of the land had been set aside as the University Cricket Grounds, and the cricket pavilion was built in 1881. The Parks is also used for other sports such as rugby football, hockey, lacrosse, tennis and croquet. The rest of The Parks was designed as an arboretum, and the first trees were planted in 1865.  A number of other features have been added over the years.\nDan Winter has been superintendent of the Parks since 2017, replacing Walter Sawyer.\n\n\n== Cricket ground ==\nThe Parks has been the home ground of Oxford University Cricket Club since 1881. The cricket ground at The Parks was secured through the Master of Pembroke, Evan Evans obtaining a lease on 10 acres of land there in 1881. The pavilion was designed by Thomas G. Jackson, architect of many nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Oxford buildings, including the University's Examination Schools. The building has three gables, the central one containing the clock, and is topped by a cupola 'of almost absurd height' and weather-vane. The pavilion contains a Long Room.Before moving to The Parks, the University Cricket Club played on the Magdalen Ground and Bullingdon Green. The Magdalen Ground was used from the University Cricket Club's first match in 1829 to 1880 while Bullingdon Green was used for two matches in 1843.\n\nThe cricket ground is the only first-class cricket ground in the UK where spectators can watch free of charge as admission cannot be charged for entry into the Parks. The club has therefore occasionally taken major matches to three other grounds in Oxford. The most used is the Christ Church Ground, which hosted 37 matches between 1878 and 1961. Twenty-one of these matches were against the Australians, played between 1882 and 1961. The club also used New College Ground for two matches in 1906 and 1907 against Yorkshire and the South Africans respectively. One match in 1912 against the South Africans was played at the Magdalen Ground. The club has also played certain minor matches at the Merton College Ground, the St Edward's School Ground and the St Catherine's College Ground.The Parks has been, since 2000, home to the recently established ECB Oxford University Centre of Cricketing Excellence, a partnership between the University of Oxford, Oxford Brookes University and the England and Wales Cricket Board. Prior to the 2010 season the UCCE has been rebranded as Oxford Marylebone Cricket Club University (MCCU). The University Match against Cambridge is the only one in which a true Oxford University Cricket Club team takes part: i.e., composed entirely of current Oxford students.\nThe Parks has, since 2002, hosted the first-class Varsity Match in even-numbered years. The Parks also hosted two List A matches for the club and twenty-two matches for the Combined Universities in the Benson & Hedges Cup between 1973 and 1998.\n\n\n== Points of interest ==\n\nThe following features of the Parks are of special interest:\n\nCricket pavilion \u2014 the pavilion was designed by Sir Thomas Jackson. The cricket ground and pavilion are used by the Oxford University Cricket Club. The two ends of the pitch are the Pavilion End and the Norham Gardens End.\nSeven large giant sequoias planted in about 1888.\nA duck pond with water lilies and a small island, constructed in 1925.\nHigh Bridge, built in 1923\u201324 as a relief project for the unemployed. It is usually called Rainbow Bridge, because of its shape.\nGenetic Garden \u2014 an experimental garden established by Professor Cyril Darlington to demonstrate evolutionary processes.\nStyphnolobium japonicum, known as the Japanese Pagoda Tree. Planted in 1888.\nCoronation Clump, a clump of trees planted to commemorate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.\nParson's Pleasure, once used as a secluded nude bathing area, but now closed and forms part of the park.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nDame's Delight\nNorham Manor estate\nFenner's, where first-class cricket is played in Cambridge\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOxford University Parks website\nCricket in the Parks website (home of Oxford CC and Oxford UCCE)\nView of University Park Looking Towards New College, Oxford by William Turner (1789\u20131862) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City",

        "wiki": "The Story Museum is a museum in Oxford, England. It aims to encourage education and support community engagement by exploring all forms of stories. It is a registered charity under English law. As of 7 July 2018 the exhibitions of the museum were closed for renovation, although the cafe remained open. The museum was slated to reopen to the public on Saturday 4 April 2020, but the opening has been postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum was founded in 2003 and initially operated as a virtual museum with no premises of its own. It coordinated several projects and exhibitions, and worked and associated with authors and illustrators including  Michael Morpurgo, Terry Pratchett, Philip Pullman, Jacqueline Wilson and Quentin Blake.In November 2009, it was announced that the museum would move to premises at Rochester House in Pembroke Street, following a gift of \u00a32.5m from a private donor. The Museum is continuing to fundraise for its ongoing development to complete the refurbishment of its site. The Story Museum coordinates Oxford's Alice's Day, which is held on the first Saturday in July to celebrate the first telling of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The museum also hosts author events, children's activities and drop-in activities, as well as running outreach projects in schools in Oxfordshire and beyond.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nIn 2012 The Museum worked with then-artist-in-residence Ted Dewan to build a \"Storyloom\", a large scale piece of kinetic art with an in-depth fictional history. The Storyloom went on to be featured in the 2012 Cultural Olympiad.From 2016 until 2017, the Story Museum ran the exhibition 26 Characters featuring photography by Cambridge Jones, which was developed with the involvement of children's authors and illustrators, all of whom were asked to choose and then dress as their favourite childhood characters. \nThe participants included:\n\nTerry Jones as Rupert the Bear\nMichael Morpurgo as Abel Magwitch\nPhilip Pullman as Long John Silver\nTed and Pandora Dewan as Pod and Arriety\nBenjamin Zephaniah as Anansi\nKatherine Rundell as A Wild Thing\nCharlie Higson as Boromir\nTerry Pratchett as William Brown\nMalorie Blackman as the Wicked Witch of the West\nSteven Butler and Francesca Simon as The Mad Hatter and The Queen of Hearts\nShirley Hughes and Clare Vulliamy as Miss Prism and Lady Bracknell\nGeraldine McCaughrean as Bellerophon\nHolly Smale as the White Witch\nMichael Rosen as Till Eulenspiegel\nNeil Gaiman as Badger\nJulia and Malcolm Donaldson as The Owl and the Pussycat\nKatrice Horsley as Mary Poppins\nAnthony Horowitz as Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\nFrances Hardinge as The Scarlet Pimpernel\nJamila Gavin as Hanuman\nKevin Crossley-Holland as Merlin\nCressida Cowell as Peter PanFrom 2016 The Story Museum ran an exhibition called Animal, focusing on the role of animals as characters in texts including Watership down, Fantastic Mr Fox, Wallace and Gromit, Maus and the works of Aesop.In 2017 The Story Museum ran an exhibition called Wild About Colour featuring a number of pieces by Brian Wildsmith alongside works by contemporary illustrators who had been influenced by his use of colour. The exhibition was curated by Helen Cooper and displayed the work of Shaun Tan and Korky Paul amongst others.\n\n\n== Renovation ==\nThe museum closed for renovation on 7 July 2018. The renovation is anticipated to cost \u00a36 million. They received a \u00a31 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2015, and a \u00a32 million grant from Arts Council England. The renovation is anticipated to be complete by the spring of 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoald Dahl Museum and Story Centre\nSeven Stories\nList of books about Oxford\nSociety for Storytelling\nMinistry of Stories\n826 Valencia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Story Museum website",

          "I really want to like this - the concept is great and innovative. I've taken my children a couple of times and it's been quite good but overall it's a bit meh. I am on the mailing list and I understand a revamp is underway so I am hopeful.",
          "This was a perfect day out with my nephews who absolutely love books. They especially loved the story throne where they could dress up and walk up to the throne where it announced their arrival. For young, early readers this is an ideal place. We then spent hours in rooms either",
          "My kids were a bit too young to really appreciate this venue. I would say from about 8 years upwards, once they have really started to enjoy reading and will know some of the books featured in the museum. We enjoyed a story reading session (the secret garden), which was set up",
          "Many thematic rooms. One in which there were many costumes kids could use to play, other with many books, other with a huge bed...would definitely visit again soon.",
          "Great place to go if you like story telling and reading . Fantastic day out and take some sandwiches with you as you could be in there for a very long time as there is lots to see and do here. Ideal for schools to visit too",
          "I\u2019ve used the Story museum as a corporate event space and I\u2019m so glad that we have been able to use the facilities. It is a fantastic space to bring a team together and everyone loves going there. Jess and the team at the Story Museum take the stress out of the pre-event",

          "This hidden gem is fabulous for younger kids. You can have stories on the huge bed, you can make movies and you can dress up. There are lots of interactive displays that the little ones love, but it\u2019s not overwhelming. Imagination is strongly encouraged here, with opportunities",
          "Not for adults! Very very basic, unclean & just generally disappointing. Expensive for the 30 mins we were in there, parts we had read about online appeared to be missing & most of the interactive parts broken or too clunky to use",
          "Very fun if you have kids. All kinds of colourful activities such as bed time stories and board games. Won't advise adults to go for themselves that being said",
          "Sadly did not look at reviews first, and as others, paid the \u00a320 for us to go in. We even turned up late to be told normally it takes 2 hours but ask the staff inside !!!! So much for the rabbit hole and through the wardrobe to Narnia ............. Under renovation !!!!!!!!!!!!",
          "This place is a little gem, glad to see it's working out. Excellent programme for children, occasionally something for adults too (wish they did more of that)",
          "This was fun and while it is a work in progress, it's still well worth going to. I enjoyed it as an adult, especially because of displays for Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials, Art Spiegelman's Maus and George Orwell's Animal Farm.",
          "This place is only value if it is free, went with my wife and 2 kids, 6 and 8 year olds. Was assured by staff it is good. We paid \u00a320 for all of us. We entered a dirty and messy building with amaturish Teenagers working there. Even my kids felt embarrassed my wife walked out",

          "We visited last weekend with our two boys (age 3 and 7) it was \u00a320 for our family to enter and it was absolutely brilliant, we were in there for over 2 hours and only left because we had a reservation at a nearby restaurant . The storytime in the big bed was lovely the boys got",
          "Lovely place for families. Both, kids and adults, will have so much fun. There are plenty of stories to listen, read and discover. Lots of things to see and do. There is also little cafe available for those who got tired after all these activities. Highly recommended ;)",

          "What a lovely find! This place does not have marble floors but it's clear that people have put their heart and soul into developing the exhibits/ interactive rooms and have a massive amount of creativity and artistic ability to back it up. My children (3 and 6) were here for 2",
          "I did not visit the museum but I really enjoyed my full English Breakfast in the cafe. The portions were very generous and a good price too at \u00a38.95. The caf\u00e9 was quite quiet as it is off the beaten track in Oxford but I was very happy with my \"find\". I did not have to wait long",
          "Wow, we loved this place! Travelling with three generations from age to to 60-something we all loved this museum. Interactive, fun and for readers of all ages. The day we visited they also had a bug/ snake roadshow thing which was a fantastic addition. We loved the Narnia room",
          "Turning off along one of Oxford's cobbled streets, you enter through a gift shop and cafe into a pretty courtyard with a secret garden and pushchair parking. To fully describe the interior of the Story Museum would be unfair as it would rob you of the opportunity to discover",
          "Stopped to have a look and a refresh at this innovative little place. Grub fair enough, up to Oxford prices certainly, and a nice haven of tranquility from tourist hell.",
          "Had a fabulous morning here with 5 year old and 7 year old, and a baby in tow. So much to see and do, we didn't have time to do everything. The secret garden story was fabulous and the woman who led it pitched it perfectly to the ages of the children. All the staff were",

          "Superb day out the kids. Was expecting to spend only an hour here but three hours later we were still finding things to do. If your kids love reading you could probably spend the whole day here. The \"Changing Room\" was our favourite room, simple but just brilliant.",

          "This is such a wonderful place, and as an adult it was just as bit as amazing as it is for children! There are themed rooms and we were allowed to join in with collecting the stamps as we visited each room. We also got to sit crossed legged and listen to a chapter of Peter Pan",
          "This is an odd one. I visited as an adult because I am interested in stories, so when I walked past a Story Museum, I had to go in. You enter a cafe and bookshop, buy tickets, then cross the courtyard to the museum. As others have said, it's a bit tatty; I know they know that,",

          "Mixed feelings - it's a reasonable size and a lot of good ideas have gone in to it, but a lot of it feels a bit tatty and somehow unfinished. We went with young children who enjoyed looking around but weren't really enthralled by anything \u2026",

          "I'm so glad to find such a good place to go out in the weekend with my baby. The best thing is that we can sit outside in the sun and there is none smoker around, i don't think i can find another better spot to have lunch in town.",

        "wiki": "Oxford Castle is a large, partly ruined Norman medieval castle on the western side of central Oxford in Oxfordshire, England. Most of the original moated, wooden motte and bailey castle was replaced in stone in the late 12th or early 13th century and the castle played an important role in the conflict of the Anarchy. In the 14th century the military value of the castle diminished and the site became used primarily for county administration and as a prison. The surviving rectangular St George's Tower is now believed to pre-date the remainder of the castle and be a watch tower associated with the original Saxon west gate of the city.\nMost of the castle was destroyed in the English Civil War and by the 18th century the remaining buildings had become Oxford's local prison. A new prison complex was built on the site from 1785 onwards and expanded in 1876; this became HM Prison Oxford.\nThe prison closed in 1996 and was redeveloped as a hotel and visitor attraction. The medieval remains of the castle, including the motte and St George's Tower and crypt, are Grade I listed buildings and a Scheduled Monument.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nAccording to the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis (Abingdon Chronicle), Oxford Castle was built by the Norman baron Robert D'Oyly the elder from 1071\u201373. D'Oyly had arrived in England with William I in the Norman Conquest of England and William the Conqueror granted him extensive lands in Oxfordshire. Oxford had been stormed in the invasion with considerable damage, and William directed D'Oyly to build a castle to dominate the town. In due course D'Oyly became the foremost landowner in Oxfordshire and was confirmed with a hereditary royal constableship for Oxford Castle. Oxford Castle is not among the 48 recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, but not every castle in existence at the time was recorded in the survey. D'Oyly (d'Oilly)'s Oxford holdings are, however, mentioned in the Domesday Book as \"Meadow 30 acres. 1 mill, value 0.5 [pounds].\"; the mill mentioned is presumably the Castle Mill, formerly adjacent to the still surviving St. George's Tower, rebuilt in 1781 before eventually being demolished in 1930.D'Oyly positioned his castle to the west side of the town, using the natural protection of a stream off the River Thames on the far side of the castle, now called Castle Mill Stream, and diverting the stream to produce a moat. There has been debate as to whether there was an earlier English fortification on the site, but whilst there is archaeological evidence of earlier Anglo-Saxon habitation there is no conclusive evidence of fortification. Oxford Castle was an \"urban castle\", overlying a portion of the Saxon town wall, but it remains uncertain whether local buildings were demolished to make room for it. Poore et al. (2009) give a suggested street plan of the town in late Saxon times (their figure 4) showing the then town wall with its north, west, south and east gates; at the north gate is the Saxon tower now associated with the church of St Michael at the North Gate, while the west gate is occupied by the apparently Saxon tower of St. George's, which is now believed to have subsequently been incorporated into the fabric of the later Norman castle.\n\nThe initial castle was probably a large motte and bailey, copying the plan of the castle that D'Oyly had already built 12 miles (19 km) away at Wallingford. The motte was originally about 60 feet (18 m) high and 40 feet (12 m) wide, constructed like the bailey from layers of gravel and strengthened with clay facing. There has been debate over the sequencing of the motte and the bailey: it has been suggested that the bailey may have built first (thus utilising the pre-existing St. George's Tower as the first keep) which would make the initial castle design a ringwork rather than a motte and bailey.By the late 12th to early 13th century, the original palisade walls and wooden keep had been replaced in stone. The new curtain wall incorporated St George's Tower, which is built of coral rag stone, 30 by 30 feet (9 m \u00d7 9 m) at the base and tapering significantly toward the top for stability. This was the tallest of the castle's towers, and is now believed to be a survival from late Saxon times (c. 1020) as a watch tower associated with the west gate of the Saxon city. Evidence that this tower is Saxon in origin and thus pre-dates the castle itself is presented in Poore et al. (2009), who comment that \"a single, massive stone tower does not seem to belong within the outer defences of an earth-and-timber castle\", and other sources have concurred on architectural grounds, also noting that its orientation does not match that of the remainder of the castle, and that its height would have originally afforded an extensive view over the city, but which would have been superseded (and in fact, blocked) with the construction of the castle motte. The date of the remaining towers is uncertain although the southernmost, round tower, of which the base still remains, is dated to 1235 in various documentary sources, including Woolnoth's The Ancient Castles of England and Wales of 1825; in at least one source, it is referred to as \"Henry III's Tower\".Inside the walls the buildings included a chapel with a crypt attached to St. Georges Tower, which may be on the site of a previous church. The chapel originally had a nave, chancel and an apsidal sanctuary. It was a typical early Norman design with solid pillars and arches. In 1074 D'Oyly and his close friend, Roger d'Ivry had endowed a chapel with a college of priests, which is presumed to be the structure in question; at an early stage it acquired a dedication to Saint George. As detailed below, the crypt of this chapel still survives, albeit in a new location within the castle, having been moved and reconstructed from its original materials in 1794.\nThe ten-sided stone shell keep, 58 feet (18 m), constructed in the 13th century to replace an earlier wooden structure, closely resembled those of Tonbridge and Arundel Castles. The keep enclosed a number of buildings, leaving an inner courtyard only 22 feet (7 m) across. Within the keep, stairs led 20 feet (6 m) down to an underground 12 feet (3.7 m) wide stone chamber, with an Early English hexagonal vault and a 54 feet (16 m) deep well providing water in the event of siege.\n\n\n=== Role in the Anarchy and Barons War ===\n\nRobert D'Oyly the younger, Robert D'Oyly the elder's nephew, had inherited the castle by the time of the civil war of the Anarchy in the 1140s. After initially supporting King Stephen, Robert declared his support for Empress Matilda, Stephen's cousin and rival for the throne, and in 1141 the Empress marched to Oxford to base her campaign at the castle. Stephen responded by marching from Bristol in the Autumn of 1142, attacking and seizing the town of Oxford and besieging Matilda in the castle. Stephen set up two siege mounds beside the castle, called Jew's Mount and Mount Pelham, on which he placed siege engines, largely for show, and proceeded to wait for Matilda's supplies to run low over the next three months. Stephen would have had difficulty in supplying his men through the winter period, and this decision shows the apparent strength of Oxford Castle at the time.Finally in December, Matilda responded by escaping from the castle; the popular version of this has the Empress waiting until the Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage in the snow, being lowered down the walls with three or four knights, before escaping through Stephen's lines in the night as the king's sentries tried to raise the alarm. The chronicler William of Malmesbury, however, suggests Matilda did not descend the walls, but instead escaped from one of the gates. Matilda safely reached Abingdon-on-Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day. Robert had died in the final weeks of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney for the remainder of the war. At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D'Oyly, Robert D'Oyly the younger's son, in 1154.In the Barons' War of 1215\u201317 the castle was attacked again, prompting further improvements in its defences. In 1220 Falkes de Breaut\u00e9, who controlled many royal castles in the middle of England, demolished the Church of St Budoc to the south-east of the castle and built a moated barbican to further defend the main gate. The remaining wooden buildings were replaced in stone, including the new Round Tower which was built in 1235. King Henry III turned part of the castle into a prison, specifically for holding troublesome University clerks, and also improved the castle chapel, replacing the older barred windows with stained glass in 1243 and 1246. Due to the presence of Beaumont Palace to the north of Oxford, however, the castle never became a royal residence.\n\n\n=== 14th\u201317th centuries ===\n\nBy 1327 the fortification, particularly the castle gates and the barbican, was in poor condition and \u00a3800 was estimated to be required for repairs. From the 1350s onwards the castle had little military use and was increasingly allowed to fall into disrepair. The castle became the centre for the administration of the county of Oxford, a jail, and a criminal court. Assizes were held there until 1577, when plague broke out in what became known as the \"Black Assize\": the Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire, two knights, eighty gentlemen and the entire grand jury for the session all died, including Sir Robert D'Oyley, a relative of the founder of the castle. Thereafter assizes ceased to be held at the castle.Ralph Agas's map of Oxford in 1578 shows that by then, while the curtain wall, keep and towers remained, the barbican had been demolished to make way for houses. Hassall, 1976, states that by 1600 the moat was almost entirely silted up and houses had been built all around the edge of the bailey wall, although this is contradicted by the castle's appearance in John Speed's map of Oxford, 1605. In 1611 King James I sold Oxford Castle to Francis James and Robert Younglove, who in turn sold it to Christ Church College in 1613. The college then leased it to a number of local families over the coming years. By this time Oxford Castle was in a weakened state, with a large crack running down the side of the keep. A map of the castle prepared for Christ Church College in 1615 shows the keep on its mound, St. George's Tower with associated buildings and sections of the curtain wall remaining to the north and south, and the next tower to the south, plus a single remaining tower to the north-east, as well as the Castle Mill and a southern entrance to the castle complex; according to this map, by 1615 houses and their gardens had been built up to over half of the Castle Ditch or moat, which appears to still contain water.\nIn 1642 the English Civil War broke out and the Royalists made Oxford their capital. Parliamentary forces successfully besieged Oxford in 1646 and the city was occupied by Colonel Ingoldsby. Ingoldsby improved the fortification of the castle rather than the surrounding town, and in 1649 demolished most of the medieval stonework, replacing it with more modern earth bulwarks and reinforcing the keep with earth works to form a probable gun-platform. In 1652, in the third English Civil War, the Parliamentary garrison responded to the proximity of Charles II's forces by pulling down these defences as well and retreating to New College instead, causing great damage to the college in the process. In the event, Oxford saw no fresh fighting; early in the 18th century, however, the keep was demolished and the top of the motte landscaped to its current form.\n\n\n=== Role as prison ===\n\nAfter the Civil War, Oxford Castle served primarily as the local prison. As with other prisons at the time, the owners, in this case Christ Church College, leased the castle to wardens who would profit by charging prisoners for their board and lodging. The prison also had a gallows to execute prisoners, such as Mary Blandy in 1752. For most of the 18th century, the castle prison was run by the local Etty and Wisdom families and was in increasing disrepair. A view of the castle published in 1769 in the work \"England Displayed\" by P. Russell and Owen Price is of interest in that it shows the appearance of the chapel attached to St George's tower prior to its demolition in 1794, as well as the motte and some then-surviving portions of the curtain wall including an arch or gateway in the wall immediately to the north of the tower. The chapel and/or associated buildings are also shown, from a range of angles, in views by other artists including Samuel and Nathaniel Buck's Antiquities (drawing dated 1729), a 1773 engraving included in Francis Grose's Antiquities of England and Wales, 1786, a painting by Michael Angelo Rooker dating from 1779, and a view by the artist John Baptist Malchair dating from 1784. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard visited the castle several times, and criticised its size and quality, including the extent to which vermin infested the prison. Partly as a result of this criticism, it was decided by the County authorities to rebuild the Oxford Prison.In 1785 the castle was bought by the Oxford County Justices and rebuilding began under the London architect William Blackburn. The wider castle site had already begun to change by the late 18th century, with New Road being built through the bailey and the last parts of the castle moat being filled in to allow the building of the new Oxford Canal terminus. Building the new prison included demolishing the old chapel attached to St George's tower and repositioning part of the crypt in 1794. The work was completed under Daniel Harris in 1805. Harris gained a reasonable salary as the new governor and used convict labour from the prison to conduct early archaeological excavations at the castle with the help of the antiquarian Edward King.In the 19th century the site continued to be developed, with various new buildings built including the new County Hall in 1840\u201341 and the Oxfordshire Militia Armoury in 1854. The prison itself was extended in 1876, growing to occupy most of the remaining space. The inmates included children, the youngest being a seven-year-old girl sentenced to seven days hard labour in 1870 for stealing a pram.  In 1888 national prison reforms led to the renaming of the county prison as HM Prison Oxford.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nToday, the remains of the Saxon St.George's Tower, Motte-and-Bailey Mound, the Prison D-Wing and Debtor's Tower make up the Oxford Castle & Prison tourist attraction. \nThe prison was closed in 1996 and the site reverted to Oxfordshire County Council. The Oxford Prison buildings have since been redeveloped as a restaurant and heritage complex, with guided tours of the historic buildings and open courtyards for markets and theatrical performances. The complex includes a hotel in the Malmaison chain, Malmaison Oxford, occupying a large part of the former prison blocks, with cells converted as guest rooms. However, those parts of the prison associated with corporal or capital punishment have been converted to offices rather than being used for guests. The mixed-use heritage project, officially opened on 5 May 2006, won the RICS Project of the Year Award 2007.The full extent of the original castle is somewhat obliterated today, especially with the intrusion of the newer County Hall into the eastern side, while New Road runs over the location of north-east portion of the curtain wall with its two square towers; nevertheless the position of its outer perimeter moat is approximated by portions of New Road, Castle Street and Paradise Street (refer map at right), while the remains of the original Barbican lie underneath the modern Westgate shopping centre. Since 1954 the two oldest parts of the castle have been Grade I listed buildings: the 11th-century motte with its 13th-century well-chamber, the circa 11th-century St George's tower (listed as Norman, but now generally believed to be Saxon), the relocated crypt chapel, and the 18th-century D-wing and Debtors' Tower. The site is protected as a Scheduled Monument. As at 2018, guided tours of the surviving medieval and 18th century portions are available to visitors via a commercial operator, Heritage Projects (Oxford Castle) Ltd, with opening hours and pricing available via their website.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCastles in Great Britain and Ireland\nList of castles in England\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nAmt, Emilie.

          "Who would\u2019ve known that this small castle and prison set up would be so famous in Oxford! Please note that you are not allowed to wander on your own accord, they insist that you take the guided tour, but this is an absolutely fabulous thing for them to offer as part of this",
          "It is amazing to be wandering the winding streets of Oxford to come across the amazing Motte and this wonderful piece of history. Amazing to walk through something 1,000 years old and hear the history of Oxford, the Castle and its use as a prison. Do not miss!",

          "My husband and I took the tour and the young woman--Becca--our guide was outstanding! She made the visit not only informative but also a delightful piece of theater. For Becca this is not a job but a pleasure or that is what she portrayed. Well worth the visit. Sad to say both",
          "Nice way to spend time in Oxford, especially when the weather's not the best. At first it seemed our tour guide Robin was a bit tired and wanted to be anywhere else but there, but during the tour he \"got it going\" and he did his part nicely. Tour itself was interestingly put",

          "Very good and interesting, but if you suffer from vertigo, do not go up the tower, I found it terrifying, very narrow and steep spiral staircase. Harder coming down! Other than that brilliant \ud83d\ude01",
          "Quite interesting museum but most of the castle is now a hotel which is a bit disappointing. There is a great view from the mound but they charge you a pound to climb up it which seems a bit mean",
          "Engaging guide (Becca) delivered interesting tour, relating the castle and prison's history, along with a few spooky tales. A great day trip from London. Note: Stairs could be a challenge for some.",

          "Decided to do the tour and wasn't sure what to expect. While the guide was informative and fine, in truth, there isn't much to see other than climbing the tower and seeing some cells. I thought for the money charged, it wasn't value for money. Not sure I'd recommend it for",
          "I and another adult took my grand children aged 5 and 7to visit the Oxford Castle. We arrived earlier than our booking and we able to join an earlier tour. The guide, Robin, was excellent and held the interest of the children but at the same time didn't tell them anything too",
          "We decided to do the lantern tour of the castle and prison as although local to the area we had not visited previously. It was a most enjoyable visit and this was helped greatly by our guide Alistair who was entertaining and informative. This is a tour that would appeal to all",
          "We went whilst visting Oxford in December for the Christmas market and after coming away was so glad we did. The tour itself is informative and entertaining at the sametime and the guide takes you through all the years of the castle from when it was first constructed in the 11th",
          "We enjoyed the tour, our tour guide Becca was funny and informative and made sure our sons and other children were involved to make it interesting for them too. Great view of Oxford from the top of the tower and good value for money!",
          "We found that even though the toor guide Robin was very good, the content overall was quite poor and definitely not good value for money. Not really worth visiting.",
          "The tour of the castle and the jail was very informative and interesting. The site itself is worthy of lots of great photos. The motte was easy to climb, and is worth visiting. Well worth the visit.",

          "We were a big group but Alistair managed nicely. He gave us a lot of information. I even impressionned my colleagues with my knowledge during our dinner in Malmaison. Due to Christmas season, guides were in costume. The decorations were nice and the sound scary. We could walk",
          "We were booked on for 12am tour but arrived early and were able to swap to 11am no problem. Alistair was a great tour guide and told us lots of information about the history of the castle/prison. Tour was about an hour and then you a free to explore yourself and walk up the",

          "We had the 3pm tour. Phil was an excellent guide and was exceptionally knowledgeable. He dealt with all of the group really well and was very patient. The tour was interesting and great to see the prison. Time to read the information boards would have been my only point to",
          "My husband and I went on this tour with our 21 year old son. Alistair was our guide and he relayed an incredible amount of facts, stories- some true!- with a great sense of humor. We left with a much better sense of the reality of earlier history of the castle, Oxford history",
          "Visited this place with guided tour. One of the packed history-telling of the building. Generous information and actual props which could be spent roughly 2-2.5 hours. Don\u2019t forget to purchase a medieval mug.",

          "Nice castle transformed into a prison, though quite small and not very unique or architecturally beautiful. One must arrive with at least half an hour before the next tour starts, or risk not finding a place in the group.",
          "We had Alistair as our tour guide and he was absolutely brilliant. Friendly, welcoming and very informative. He knew so much about all aspects of the castle and prison and delivered it in such a way that it was easy to take in and understand. It\u2019s definite worth the visit, it\u2019s",

          "We had a lovely visit with Rowan, who was funny and informative about the history of the castle and prison. The museum which follows after the tour was also fab! Thank you",
          "Nice way to spend an hour or two. Excellent guide, friendly staff, nice little cafe on site (discount on hot drinks with your entry ticket). Interesting, fun.. would like to be able to see inside the hotel though, as that was the most recent part of the prison proper and a part",

          "I felt this site was well worth the visit. it's a guided tour that includes the prison and bell tower. Our guide, Alister, was very informative and made the tour come to life with his audience participation style. The bell tower is a climb, about 100 steps in a circular",
          "Bought tickets on the door rather than in advance and the next tour was in a couple of minutes they run every half hour for 1 hour! Robin was our fantastic guide who was informative but made it fun also! We walked around and learnt so much about the castle and prisons history!",

          "Great and informative tour, but odd given the use of we/us pronouns given the strong American accent. Clearly not a son of Oxford....",
          "We took a tour on the spur of the moment as we were browsing in the gift shop with time on our hands, and the tour was about to start. Our guide was Bekka, and she was excellent - first class attention to health and safety on the tour, knowledgable, amusing and personable. We",
          "First visit to this attraction. Fascinating and significant history of England, brought to life in an amusing and memorable way by Alastair, our guide. If you can do the steps to the top of the tower you will have panoramic views of the dreaming spires and Oxfordshire. Not to be",
          "A really interesting place to visit if you have an hour to spare for the tour. (You can only access the castle/prison if on one of their tours - you can\u2019t go around by yourself.) Our Victorian prisoner tour guide was great fun and we learnt a lot!",

        "wiki": "The Headington Shark (proper name Untitled 1986) is a rooftop sculpture located at 2 New High Street, Headington, Oxford, England, depicting a large shark embedded head-first in the roof of a house.\n\n\n== Description and location ==\n\nThe shark first appeared on 9 August 1986, having been commissioned by the house's owner Bill Heine, a local radio presenter.  The sculpture, which is reported to weigh 4 long hundredweight (200 kg) and is 25 feet (7.6 m) long, and is made of painted fibreglass, is named Untitled 1986 (written on the gate of the house). It took three months to build.The sculpture was erected on the 41st anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki. It was designed by sculptor John Buckley and constructed by Anton Castiau, a local carpenter and friend of Buckley.  Heine said \"The shark was to express someone feeling totally impotent and ripping a hole in their roof out of a sense of impotence and anger and desperation... It is saying something about CND, nuclear power, Chernobyl and Nagasaki\". The structure is in deliberate contrast with its otherwise ordinary suburban setting.For the occasion of the shark's 21st anniversary in August 2007, it was renovated by the sculptor, following earlier complaints about the condition of the sculpture and the house.On 26 August 2016 Heine's son Magnus Hanson-Heine bought the house in order to preserve the Shark. The property has been run as an AirBnB guesthouse since 2018.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nCreated by sculptor John Buckley, the shark was controversial when it first appeared. Oxford City Council tried to have it taken down on grounds of safety, and then on the grounds that it had not given planning permission for the shark, offering to host it at the local swimming pool instead, but there was much local support for the shark. Eventually the matter was taken to the central government, where Tony Baldry, a minister in the Department of the Environment, who assessed the case on planning grounds, ruled in 1992 that the shark would be allowed to remain as it did not result in harm to the visual amenity.\n\n\n== Media appearances ==\nThroughout the early 1990s, updates on the controversy surrounding the shark were regularly featured on As It Happens, an interview show on CBC Radio.\nThe unexpected shark appeared in a 2002 newspaper advertising campaign for a new financial advice service offered by Freeserve. The advertisement, designed by M&C Saatchi, featured a photograph of the house with the caption \"Freedom to find the mortgage that's right for you\".Heine wrote a short book about the shark, which was published in 2011.In 2013, the sculpture was the subject of an April Fools' Day story in the Oxford Mail, which announced the establishment of a fictitious \u00a3200,000 fund by Oxford City Council to support the creation of similar sculptures on the roofs of other homes in the area.In 2015, the sculpture was featured in the Channel 4 programme Damned Designs, which focuses on properties that have not followed planning permission.\nDuring 2019, it was also featured in a YouTube Video by the British group, the Sidemen. It appeared during their $10,000 vs. $100 Road Trip video.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCardiff Kook\nThe Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living, 1991 shark-based artwork by Damien Hirst\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHeine, Bill (2011).

          "It\u2019s pretty cool to see a shark sticking out of a roof, a great photo opportunity :) super easy to find as it\u2019s on a residential street.",
          "Not the sort of thing I would want in my roof, but a reminder of its original owner Bill Heine. We passed it on our walking tour, and it is worth a detour to see simply because of its uniqueness.",
          "Its certainly unique and is something of a piece of local pride. A classic piece of English eccentricity. Its certainly worth seeing if you happen to be in Headington and can make a diversion from the high street, but I wouldn't think it would be work a special trip for, for",
          "I did not know about this attraction when I first visited Oxford. I remember sitting half-asleep on a bus from Heathrow, looking out of the window, registering \"house\", \"nice house\", \"Tesco\", \"shark in a roof\", \"house\", ... wait, what?? I thought it was my imagination at first.",
          "Being in Oxford for a few days I googled what to see and this was one of the attractions. Very different from anything I have seen before and if you read into the reasons for it this is fascinating stuff.",
          "It's hard to imagine such a massive fish sticking out of the roof of a terraced house - you have to see it to believe it. it is bigger than you imagine.",
          "My children are half Indian and learned the word for fish from this monument. It really is a massive machhali (fish). You have to see it to believe it.",
          "For 35 years I've been visiting Oxford and as long as I can remember mber the big sharks diving into the roof Oxford wouldn't be Oxford without the shark",
          "Read about this before going out to see it, and the original homeowner's ideas about the statement he was trying to make. Besides being a hilarious sight, the backstory is really worth your time.",
          "My husband could not believe I was taking him to see a shark. We found it very easily and loved it. Took a picture and sent it to friends!",
          "Somewhat of a let down once it is seen in person. Heard stories and saw pictures, just not that impressive.",
          "Worth seeing just for the strangeness; probably wouldn't go and see it again. Easy to find, though the one-way streets can elongate a visit.",

          "Bill Heine sadly died early April 2019 so what of the future of the shark? It may not be there for too long now. But Thanks Bill, for this brilliant bit of humour. What would be even more brilliant would now be for the council to list the shark after your struggles with them",
          "If you want to know why and how this came about? To the best of my knowledge the clue here is Not The Moulin Rouge (aka a cinema with a similar installation).",
          "We drove down this residential road after visiting the Pitts River Museum. Its funny to see a huge shark sticking out of the roof of a standard terraced house. English humour and ordasity at its best !",

          "The giant plastic shark diving into someone\u2019s house is a must see if you\u2019re in the area. It\u2019s been there years and has fought off calls to remove it. You can drive into the street it\u2019s on, snap a quick pic and be on your way \ud83d\udc0b\ud83d\udc2c",
          "Don\u2019t know how long this plastic shark has been sticking out of the roof but you can get a great view of it from Headington High Street",
          "Why and how I am going to have to find out! Surreal and impressive. Aparrently one can rent the house, children would love it. There were quite a few taking photo's when we stopped to see it as staying just around the corner. So want there to be the sharks head crashing through",
          "Just being refreshed with scaffolding around it. Bit of a tart up going on. I live in the area so pass it quite often on my way to the shops. Great fun and glad its being preserved.",
          "Don't go out of your way way to go see it, it's literally just a shark in a roof. Look at the photos.",
          "I had heard about this some years ago, and forgot all about it. Geocaching brought us here, and it came back to my memory. Sadly with scaffolding around it at the mo, but we could still see it!",
          "You probably have to know where to look otherwise you would be rubbing eyes in disbelief. Not a student prank!",
          "This shark has to be seen to be believed! Really impressive structure and amazing that it is actually someone\u2019s home. Really great to have such a unique feature as this in headington.",
          "Really, what you see is what you get, but the thrilling tale of council defiance is worth the trip up the hill!",
          "My favourite alternative tourist destination - in a fairly nondescript street near the centre of Headington, this should be a must see for anyone who visits Oxford. It's a shark diving through the roof of a terraced house. What's not to like about that?",
          "Just walking back from dinner and you see this random huge shark tail sticking out of someones house! Found out later it was an artist's art project. Very cool to see!",
          "I took a taxi out there from city center. The shark is NOT real. Great disappointment but despite the faux character is still makes a statement for the neighbors. I thought it was a \u201cshark tornado\u201d",
          "Took a detour here on our way somewhere. Worth a visit and makes you appreciate the workmanship gone into it.",
          "Worth the trip to Headington. It's been there for decades now. It's fun, mad, brilliant and probably loathed by neighbours and council.",
          "Missed it at first thinking it was on the main road in Headington but it's actually tucked down a side street. Wouldn't necessarily go out of the way to see it but if you're in the area, it's worth a quick visit if not just to appreciate how odd it looks.",
          "I just found this rather sad, destroying the house underneath outdid any other feelings. Certainly weird and definitely worth a look if you are passing nearby. You can park for free for 2 hours in nearby roads and there are coffee shops and pubs nearby,",
          "It is cute, but not worth a trip from somewhere else. We were staying in Headington, so saw it as we walked to bus. There is another shark on top of another building nearby (not crashing through). Don't know what the Headington thing is with sharks.",
          "I like that we have this fun a quirky house in Oxford. Don\u2019t think I\u2019d like the attention on my own living quarters but it\u2019s a great talking point .",
          "i dont so much notice anymore after seeing this so often it was quite a surprise at first a strange addition to a normal terraced st although some people think its an oxford icon now",
          "Worth seeing if you're in the area, but not to make a special trip. Is rather fascinating as to why someone would do this.",
          "This is just a remarkable place to visit - a massive and completely incongruous shark diving into a roofin the middle of a quiet Headigton Street, but it for me a must se place if you are visiting Oxford and well worth the detour.",
          "As a US Expat living in the Uk, I make frequent trips back to the family in the States.....The trips are long, tiring, but important...so is returning ....home....Just as in anyone who is homeward bound (insert Simon & Garfunkle) there are various landmarks to my journey in both",
          "Not sure if this a landmark but a 20 foot shark sticking out of a residential house roof is something that should make you laugh. This was erected in 1986 and is a plea to help look after our planet. Great for a photo and a laugh. Top marks to Mr. Heine.",
          "Worth seeing if you happen to be around Headington. If not you will be fine without it ;) Totally expresses British sense of humor.",
          "What must the neighbours think!? We saw this by pure fluke as we left Oxford City and as i approached it to take a photo,a few other people were doing the same. Not something worth trying to find but it gave us a little laugh. Visited 14th jan 2018.",
          "I walk or cycle past the shark a few times per week; it never fails to catch my eye and generate a smile.",
          "Drove past here,and saw a few times.just saw a shark in the roof,don't think you can go into the house",
          "The picture sort of says it all - a shark sticking out of the roof of an ordinary terraced house. Worth a look if you are in Headington, but probably not worth a special trip from Oxford center",

          "If travelling this way, take a look. It's not worth a special trip, but look up Headlington and it is worth a short detour if you are going into/out of Oxford. There's council carpark nearby and some local places to eat, so you can get a coffee or a meal - take a break from the",
          "This is a must see if you visit this part of Oxford you don't see a shark in the roof of a house every day",
          "I was curious to see this. As I was staying nearby and had time to kill . I thought I'd pop to the local shops and then remembered this was near . It really is just what it states .And quite a sight It certainly is not discreet.. lovely to see kids faces seeing it . Long may",
          "We actually drove a fair bit out of our way to see this after reading about it in a local guide book.",
          "We came upon this yesterday, quite by accident. It is hysterically funny but does have a serious message against nuclear war.",
          "Like most, when I first saw this, I wondered why? And then why not? There in the middle of an off main road terrace is a gigantic model shark sticking out of the roof of a Victorian? house. Genius. Thank you for the smile this gives me every time I see it",
          "The story behind how this art installation moved from being vilified to being a local cultural icon (there's even a toddler group nearby called \"Little Sharks\") is fascinating. See it on a clear evening with the subset behind it, and it's quite something - but it is what it is:",
          "a local landmark and quite famous. good for a quick stop if you are in the area and makes a good selfie but I would not go out of my way to find it unless you happened to be in Headington",
          "This is just wonderful - it epitomises outsider art and it should be part of anyone's visit to Oxford.",
          "Drove past as a passenger and saw this and laughed. Dare to be different is what we say. Would I go out of my way to see it? Probably not. Would children enjoy seeing it? Yes, because it is funny. It also prompted a long conversation with my teenagers who said people should",
          "My favourite place to take visitors to Oxford, and a fabulous example of British eccentricity. The pictures really don't do it justice, so go and take a look for yourself!",
          "had to be done! the famous Headington Shark, geocache. i'd been here before but had to come back to this brilliant location.",
          "haying lived with the shark since its fitting, from my point of view it is quite ordinary, however if i was a visitor i think it would be much more of a novelty",
          "The Headington Shark is a quirky attraction and is now as much of the fabric of Oxford as the dreamy spires. For years the council tried to have it removed but common sense win through.",
          "If you are in the area this is a must see for those wanting to be surprised by just how far modern art can go.",
          "A very unusual sight to see!! A 20ft shark diving into the roof of a house!! Very effective, you have to see it to believe it!! Catch the number 8 or 9 bus from centre of oxford, approx. 20 minute journey. East to find on New High Street.",
          "Absolutely mad but I am glad it's there. Read the history and the controversy. If you are in and around Oxford go find it and perhaps pluck up the courage to install your own insane idea. Love it.",
          "it was about 30 years ago when this one first appeared in a residential house in oxford. owned by a local radio host. when Jaws first sank his teeth in to the roof the controversy and attempts to get it removed did nothing other than to mark its place in oxfords history. be",

          "A surprise! In a normal residential street a shark in the roof of one of the houses. My husband says it has been there for many years. Well, it made me smile, and wonder why?",
          "We love a bit of street art, its exciting when a council permits crazy or beautiful art to adorn their streets. The shark in the roof is an amusing point of interest to drive by an see if you are in the area....but don't attempt to park! All of the streets in the area are permit",
          "I was a student in Oxford when the shark first appeared and I well remember the controversy and the attempts to get it removed. 30 years later it seems like it's been there forever and people seem to have stopped moaning and just got on with letting it be there. If you're",

          "Bill Heine interviewed me on BBC Radio Oxford once in his own inimitable style and gave me a hard time, but I won't hold it against him - up until 2016 this was his house (it's now owned by his son Magnus) and it's had a shark in the roof since 1986. Designed by sculptor John",
          "Look, it's a shark on/in a roof. What's not to like? We had decided we were going to find this while we were in Oxford. Found it easily and parked up, got out, took a few photographs and that was the end of our roof shark experience. So glad we stopped by. Out of all the sharks",
          "There is something comforting in knowing that shark has always been there for us. We have been traveling to England for 24+ years and we go and see the shark every time. We go and look and giggle......and know all is right in our world at that moment.",
          "I suppose familiarity means I don't find the Shark exciting anymore but I suppose if you have not seen it it is something to tick off in Oxford although there are plenty of better things to see",

          "Now looking a bit sorry for its self, needs renovation urgently. Not exactly a 'must see' but if you are in Headington, tak a peek",
          "I still don't know why people are coming all the way to see this shark on top of a building. Really doesn't match British culture. There is nothing special to see unless you wanna make fun of the person who thought about this.",

          "We were visiting an escape room in Headington and drove down this road to see the shark on the way home. I had not mentioned it to the kids, just slowed and waited opposite it for a minute ;-) And the kids were \"mum... can we go... Wait! WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT!\" I also",
          "Quite funny to see, but not sure that I would travel for it. You can't go inside (it's someone's home), and there is nothing around to explain the story behind it.",
          "Shark dive bombing a roof .... what more do you want from life? What happens when it rains though? Parking tricky nearby, but glad I saw this sculpture!",
          "Rather fun. Walked past it as it was near where we were staying. Quite a surprise! You do wonder how it works.",
          "If you are in the Headington area of Oxford you have to take a look at the shark in the roof, its funny and a well known local landmark. you probably never see anything like it again!!",
          "Sadly looking a bit neglected these days, looks like it has fallen out of the sky, and plunged into the roof.",
          "It's a shark, sticking out of a house... what's not to like? I hope the artist buys up the street and puts a different sea creature in every roof!",
          "I had to go and see this for myself after having seen the photo of it on the wall of the breakfast room at the Red Mullions. It was just a bit weird to see a shark sticking out of the roof of a terraced house but I can tick that off my bucket list now!",
          "An inane has- been- the shark i mean. Who dreamt it up, probably not the shark. Living next door to this must be hideous aesthetically and financially. Was planning permission needed! Visitors - dont waste your time, the city rats are more entertaining",
          "Just something nostalgic to look at and to take tourists for fun, if you can't find something to talk about; this will get the conversation flowing.",
          "The Headington shark is a classic landmark that all visitors to Oxford should make a special effort to visit. It is exceptionally unusual.",
          "I wouldn't travel just to see it. But it's fun if you're in the area. It has been there a long time, as locals mentioned their children remembering it from 50 years ago.",
          "I see this sculpture at the end of our garden every day when I wake up. I just love it. It gives a great sense of focus to the view. Because of its location and ours, we are the only house that has such a good view across a garden.",
          "Absoluately brilliant, quite a sight! Well worth the trip, as location is a little way from the centre of Oxford.",
          "Luckily didn't go out my way to see this as its funny to see but after about 2 mins the funs over.theresnot much to say but don't go out your way to see this",

          "It is just a private house in a little ally, but if you pass by... it is well worth a picture for sure!",
          "Visited over a week ago with hubby when in Oxford for the day. Have to say never seen anything like it. Erected in August 1986 this rooftop sculpture was renovated in August 2007. Apparently it's saying something about CND, Nuclear Power, Chernobyl & Nagasaki. Certainly",
          "Heard of this unusual sight but no actual substitute for seeing it. Very bizarre and no doubt a great topic for discussion both locally and afar. Very amusing unless you happen to live. Next door to it perhaps but I s certainly different.",

          "this is a strange thing to have on the roof of a terrace house - but why not !! The owner has fought to complete and retain this with the council and others, thank god for excentric Englishmen.",
          "Just go see it. If you have time and are headed down Headington Road, just do it. It's the weirdest thing and it's well worth the picture and the story when you get home.",
          "Not often do you easily find an iconic location for a photo shoot. Just a block off the main drag bus stop in town. Very different.",
          "Can be seen from he main Headington Road / London Road but worth a close up view from that is a relatively quiet residential road notwithstanding the road name",
          "This is a shark diving into a roof. The people who put it there said something like this: \"The shark was to express someone feeling totally impotent and ripping a hole in their roof out of a sense of impotence and anger and desperation\u2026. It is saying something about CND,",
          "Now well past its sell-by date. Someone had this done - and what a waste of time. Nothing much else to say - it broke all the planning regulations - but that's ok, if you're a minor radio celebrity. Now it just looks silly. It's like a constant student rag week stunt or someone",
          "I dragged my friends here and did not tell them why, they were all \"wow\" when they saw it, as it's so unexpected. could do with another refurbish but it's fun anyway. only a short distance out of your way out of Oxford by car so worth a quick visit. parking a nightmare of",
          "If you park in the Britannia Pub you can see this attraction from the car park. Very strange, and weird but fun too",

          "As a planning lawyer I always have to pay homage to the Headington shark when passing through this part of Oxford. It demonstrates the English planning system at its quirky best.",
          "We stopped here during a school half-term family day out to Oxford (it's about a 12-15 minute drive from Oxford Centre) as thought it would be fun to see a giant great white shark sticking out the roof of a house... And it was. You only need 5 minutes here to observe this",
          "I cycle past this regularly and it always attracts the curious. Its weird but people love it. If driving through Headington its a short detour",
          "This drive-by attraction is a bit away from the city center in Oxford, but certainly worth seeing on your way in or out of the city. Where else will you see a shark jutting out of a roof?",
          "This iconic landmark is in desperate need of lick of paint , would hate to see it removed but it does look slightly tired",
          "It was novel at the time, but I think the joke has worn thin. I don't know if Bill heine is still there, but the house looked as if it was not regularly used. It is out of proportion to the houses and the neighbourhood, and the shark should be moved to a more appropriate",
          "Hats off to local journalist Bill Heine for 1) have the guts to stand up to Oxford City Council who fought him for years to take it down, and 2) for having the brainwave for doing it in the first place! Now, as a piece of 'art' (yes, you can debate that if you wish to waste your",

          "Having finished in the centre of town I wanted to surprise my daughter with this slightly different art piece. As it was night time I managed to get quite close to the house with out her seeing it. Having got her out of the car she was very surprised to see the body of a shark",
          "Really odd piece of local architecture created by local journalist Bill Heine. Looks great and can be seen from either side of the house. Check the Royal Standard for a beer dedicated to The Shark!",
          "In spite of Oxford City Council trying to have it removed over a number of years the shark remains and long may it be so on a street that would otherwise be unknown.",
          "After seeing this odd scene I new there must be a story behind it. True or not, I heard the owner of this house/shark wanted to out do his neighbor, and truly he did. Now everyone is talking about his shark on the roof of his house. Very odd.",
          "I saw the shark from the window bus when I arrived in Oxford from London. I was very surprise, it's a scene very unusual and so decided to go there to take a look closer. Firstly I thought it was a fish shop, but when I was there, I saw the shark on the roof of a house. Nothing",
          "If you are in the area this is deffo worth a visit. My children thought it was amazing. It is very random but worth the visit, even if its just so you can tell people you have seen a shark in a roof of a house.",
          "A strange experience which one can only describe as surreal. To be standing in the middle of Oxford looking at this is, well wierd!",
          "I would'nt make a special trip to see this, but if you're in the area then its an interesting site to see! Worth reading up on before you see it for context.",
          "The shark is very popular and well known around Oxford. It's a fantastic thing to see every time you go past. If your a tourist it's well worth a visit as there are some shops you can visit nearby.",
          "Quirky and fun...has become a land mark. You can see it from the Thornhill Park and Ride bus...look down a street to the left just after the traffic lights at Headington shops.",
          "I'd heard about the shark way before I move to oxford and pass by every couple of weeks now and it still raised a smile. It's like an unofficial landmark but can't tell if the house is occupied, it was looking rather shabby but the shark is just great, I want one",
          "This appears to be embedded in somebody's roof. It appears that it has been there for over 30 years! The house is located off the main road in Headington, Oxford and can be seen if you pop to the shops for supplies. You \"double take\" when you first see it, and there generally",
          "You have to go and see this! No matter how many photos you see online nothing beats being there in person. It's enormous and the detail is brilliant! A real fun thing to see. Very easy to get to! I wonder if you can see its face from the inside or whether it's a headless",
          "If there can be a 'Snake in my Boots', why can't there be a 'Shark in my Roof'! Yee haa! Love it!! I saw this years ago just after they did it. Presumed they were forced to remove it. So pleased to find it still there. Only in 'Blighty'!",
          "Great to see that this shark is still here after almost 30 years. It livens up an otherwise ordinary street in Headington just south east of Oxford. You can walk here from Oxford city centre, it will take about 40 minutes and is up hill all the way. Alternatively the 280 bus",
          "On our day coach trip to Oxford our driver made a detour especially to show us this. This has been here since 1986 and is a sculpture by the 'artist' John Buckley. It was unveiled on the 41st anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki. It was commissioned by the",
          "So surreal it has to be seen. Looks a lot bigger in person than any photos I've seen. Really adds character to the area and easy to get to",
          "It's a shark. Sticking out of a roof. Mad! Definitely worth a look see if you're in the area. Can't parking easily though.",
          "It's a massive shark, sticking out of the roof of little red brick house, in an ordinary street. And it's free to see. What can anyone dislike about that? If you don't like slightly surreal stuff, quirky curios and the like, don't bother. Otherwise, enjoy.",
          "Don't forget to pay a visit to this that was once a protest to make people aware of environmental issues. It's quite impressive from a short distance!",
          "Make sure to read the information on why this shark suddenly appeared on the roof of this Headington home. What a way to make a statement. Worth the view and a few pictures!",
          "If you are passing by the area, the sight of a shark sticking out of the roof of a terraced house is mildly amusing for a minute or so. It is worth taking a look if you are in the area, but it is not worth making a big effort to get to.",
          "If you're in the Headington Shops area, and happen to walk by, it's worth a quick look; however, do not go out of your way to see the Headington Shark. It is a shark sticking out of the roof of a building - cool and different, but entertaining for less than a minute.",
          "One of those random things I wanted to see on my visit to Oxford simply because it was local and unique. Thankfully, I mentioned it in passing during a conversation with our chauffeur during the drive from LHR to Oxford. He detoured by so my husband and I could have a quick",
          "Not worth the fuel to get there. Just a pathetic fish tail from a roof. Lots of lovely buildings in Oxford so tour around there instead.",
          "I can remember all the years ago when this shark first made it's appearance, poking out of the house roof!! It was a novelty back then, and is somewhat more of a famous (or infamous lol) novelty now! I seem to remember the council trying to get this removed many moons ago...",
          "Such a fantastic British quirky cool installation! Have followed this and the other 'sculptures' made by the artist, for many years! So glad we finally saw it last week, didn't even realise it was around the corner from a company I'd been dealing with for few years! Ooops!",
          "Lovely incongruity. Completely ridiculous, in a delightful way. And then.... enquire and discover it was actually created in memory of the nuclear bombs dropped on Japanese cities. Best sort of art there is.",
          "Nothing other than a shark sticking out of a roof but for sheer novelty value and the ability to take a rare picture, it surely has to be a must for tourists! Treat yourself!",
          "Not worth a special visit but quite amusing if you are in the area. The best thing is that the council weren't able to force its removal as they were being killjoys.",
          "... that made it half-way through the roof. It makes you look & smile if you pass it. If you ever go to Headington have a look otherwise don't bother.",
          "Lived near here for a year, it is very much a local feature but I am glad I never made an effort or tried to persuade someone out to Headington to see it. Bus fares are expensive and it's just a fish.",
          "Most people don't believe me when I say there is a giant shark just casually smashed through the roof of a house in a small street in Headington, Oxford, so it is with delight I get to often surprise them by showing this fantastic little statue just there, proudly showing the",

          "The local chip shop recently suffered a fire and in the course of renovations, the owners incorporated a rather large shark above the shop front. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then the real Headington Shark must consider itself flattered. However, with the new",
          "Wow. All I can is wow. That's dedication after almost 30 years to still have that sticking out of your house. Read about it in a book in my hotel room and asked a cabbie to take me over there. Must see.",
          "You need to walk to see this or stop outside in the car. It's a very odd thing, not a lot else to do other than stare at it for a few minutes but worth a look and a photo if you are passing.",
          "If it's on your way, take a look/photo :) It's a shark (as if fallen from Sky) on a roof ... cool, right?",
          "I live in headington and walk past it daily but even so it's nothing special to come out of your way just to see. It has an interesting story behind it tho!",
          "Makes me smile every time I see it, and it's also refreshing because it's not the flippin' 'dreaming spires' and nothing to do with the university.",
          "I got the opportunity to see the famous Headington Shark in Oxford because it is on the street where my friend lived and I stayed at her place for couple of days. At first, I found it funny and kept asking \"what's the point?\" :) Later when I searched on internet,turned out it",
          "Still a wonder to behold. I pass it on the bus whenever I go in to town, but I still chuckle every time.",
          "A cool thing to hunt down if you're in Headington, though not exactly something to travel out specifically for the pleasure of seeing.",
          "Didn't hear of it until I checked on here and wandered out of the nearby pub to see it up against the skyline - well weird! Drop by just to witness it, take a photo and head off. It's not that interesting, more a curiosity and a photo opportunity.",
          "The guy was obviously very unhappy with something and so wtuck a massive shark into his roof and locked the place up. years later the house is derelict and the shark is still sticking there. If you are in the area you have to see it otherwise it is up to you if you want to go",
          "I was walking past the street the shark lives in and had to have a double take to make sure I wasn't just seeing things! Some fins up in Oxford!",
          "The shark in the house is fun but probably not worth a special visit. A good place to see it is from the upper deck of buses that pass along the main road including the Thornhill Park & Ride bus. For the best view sit on the left side when heading into the city.",
          "Thats it. You can stand outside, take a photo, then go. Having said that, it's worth 2 minutes just for the novelty alone.",
          "And a classic example of English eccentricity, except that it was installed by an American (Bill Heine - who is DJ on radio Oxford). Well worth a look if you're wandering around Headington.",
          "Good little sight to stop at in Headington but only takes a minute.",

          "Seen one shark and you've seen them all! You can see it from the Coach on the way in to Oxford, otherwise probably not worth the effort going to see it unless you are visiting the local pub, the Butchers Arms in Perrin Street - an excellent pub with first rate real ale.",
          "what more is there to say about this famous landmark in Oxford and its radio presenter owner............",
          "When you know the full story of the Shark by Bill Heine, you will love it even more. I was impressed as it was, but having met Bill and invited him to the Funky Art Exhibition at The Jam Factory, Oxford. You will defo love it even more :)",
          "The unique Shark in the roof house in Headington is currently available for rental, so you could live in a piece of Oxford history! Even if you don't want to move it's worth a look if you're in the Headington area.",

          "Pretty weird; it fascinates young children. I've always wondered how the owner hasn't wrecked his house with a big hole in the roof or what effect it's had on his neighbours. Although there's no plaque explaining why he did it (a planning dispute with the council I believe)",
          "I would hardly call it an attraction. It is a big shark protruding from the roof of a house in Headington. You can see it by walking down the road, which is a very bizarre sight. It is 100% free as the only view is by the roadside. It is an interesting sight, but don't"

      "name": "Magdalen College",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Magdalen College ( MAWD-lin) is a constituent college of the University of Oxford. It was founded in 1458 by William of Waynflete. Today, it is one of the wealthiest colleges, with a financial endowment of \u00a3273.2 million as of 2018, and one of the strongest academically, setting the record for the highest Norrington Score in 2010 and topping the table twice since then. It is home to several of the University's distinguished chairs, including the Agnelli-Serena Professorship, the Sherardian Professorship, and the four Waynflete Professorships.\nThe large, square Magdalen Tower is an Oxford landmark, and it is a tradition, dating to the days of Henry VII, that the college choir sings from the top of it at 6 a.m. on May Morning. The college stands next to the River Cherwell and the Oxford botanic garden, and within its grounds has a deer park and Addison's Walk.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nMagdalen College was founded in 1458 by William of Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor  and named after St Mary Magdalene. The College succeeded a university hall called Magdalen Hall, founded by Waynflete in 1448, and from which the college drew most of its earliest scholars. This first Magdalen Hall was suppressed when the college was founded; though the name was revived by a second Magdalen Hall, established in the college's grounds around 1490, which in the 19th century would move to Catte Street and become Hertford College. \nAlso established by Waynflete on the college site was a Grammar School, now Magdalen College School, an independent school located nearby on the other side of the Cherwell. Waynflete was assisted by a large bequest from Sir John Fastolf, who wished to fund a religious college.Magdalen College took over the site of St John the Baptist Hospital, alongside the Cherwell, initially using the hospital's buildings until new construction was completed between 1470\u20131480. At incorporation in 1458, the college consisted of a president and six scholars. In 1487 when the Founder's Statutes were written, the foundation consisted of a President, forty fellows, thirty demies, four chaplain priests, eight clerks, sixteen choristers, and appointed to the Grammar School, a Master and an usher.The founder's statutes included provision for a choral foundation of men and boys (a tradition that has continued to the present day) and made reference to the pronunciation of the name of the college in English. The college's name is pronounced like the adjective maudlin because the late medieval English name of Mary Magdalene was Maudelen, derived from the Old French Madelaine.\n\n\n=== English Civil War ===\nOxford and Magdalen College were supporters of the Royalist cause during the English Civil War. In 1642, Magdalen College donated over 296 lbs of plate to fund the war effort - the largest donation by weight of any Oxford college. Magdalen College, commanding a position on the banks of the Cherwell that overlooked Magdalen Bridge and the road from London, had tactical significance for the King's forces. Royalist ordnance was parked in the Magdalen's Grove, and Prince Rupert is thought to have quartered in the college. During the first Siege of Oxford, Charles I surveyed the battle from Magdalen Tower.\n\n\n=== Expulsion of the Fellows ===\n\nDuring the 1680s, King James II made several moves to reintroduce Catholicism into the then Anglican university. In 1687, he attempted to install Anthony Farmer as president of Magdalen. The fellows rejected this, not just because Farmer was reputedly a Catholic and had a tarnished reputation, but also as he was not a fellow of the college, and therefore ineligible under the statutes. The fellows elected instead one of their own, John Hough. James eventually offered a compromise candidate in the form of the moderate Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Parker, but he too was rejected by the fellows as they considered the role filled. Parker was admitted by force and the fellows and demies (scholars) who had defied the king were expelled, replaced by the king's choice of Catholics or moderate Anglicans. Parker died in 1688 and was replaced by Bonaventure Giffard, a Catholic under whose tenure the Chapel converted to Catholicism. The expulsion of the fellows marked a turning point in the University's relationship with the Crown: Brockliss writes, \"the royalist and Anglican University established at the Restoration had had to make a choice and it had chosen Anglicanism.\" James' interference with the college fed resentment in Anglicans who used it as evidence that his rule was autocratic. On 25 October 1688, shortly before the Glorious Revolution and overthrow of James II by William of Orange, James' appointments were reversed and Hough and the expelled fellows were restored to the college. This event is marked every year at a special banquet, the Restoration Dinner, for Magdalen fellows, demies, and academic clerks.\n\n\n=== 20th-21st centuries ===\nMagdalen's prominence since the mid-20th century owes much to such famous fellows as C. S. Lewis and A. J. P. Taylor, and its academic success to the work of such dons as Thomas Dewar Weldon. During World War II, RAF Maintenance Command was headquartered at Magdalen.Magdalen College owns and manages the Oxford Science Park to the south of Oxford, a science and technology park home to over 100 companies. The Oxford Science Park opened in 1991, with Magdalen as part owner. The college acquired the rest of the ownership in 2016.Like many of Oxford's colleges, Magdalen admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979, after more than half a millennium as a men-only institution. Between 2015 and 2017, 47.2% of UK undergraduates admitted to Magdalen were from state schools; 12.2% were of BME (\"black and ethnic minority\") heritage and 0.7% were black. Of the 300 undergraduate offers made by Magdalen between 2017 and 2019, 25 (one in twelve) went to pupils from Eton College or Westminster School. In 2015, Magdalen topped Oxford's Norrington Table of college undergraduate examination results, and its average score over the 2006\u20132016 period is the best among the colleges.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\nThe college grounds stretch north and east from the college, and include most of the area bounded by Longwall Street, the High Street (where the porter's lodge is located), and St Clement's. The college features a variety of architectural styles, and has been described as \"a medieval nucleus with two incomplete additions, one from the eighteenth and one from the nineteenth century\".The college is organised around five quads. The irregularly shaped St John's Quad is the first on entering the college, and includes the Outdoor Pulpit and old Grammar Hall. It connects to the Great Quad (the Cloister) via the Perpendicular Gothic Founders Tower, which is richly decorated with carvings and pinnacles and has carved bosses in its vault. The Chaplain's Quad runs along the side of the Chapel and Hall, to the foot of the Great Tower. St Swithun's Quad and Longwall Quad (which contains the Library) date from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and make up the southwest corner of the college.\n\n\n=== Original buildings ===\nThe college is built on the site of St John the Baptist Hospital, which was dissolved in 1457 and its property granted to William of Waynflete. Some of the hospital buildings were reused by the college, and the kitchens survive today as the college bar, the Old Kitchen Bar.New construction began in 1470 with the erection of a wall around the site by mason William Orchard. Following this, Orchard also worked on the chapel, hall, and the cloister, including the Muniment and Founder's Towers, with work completed around 1480.\n\n\n=== Cloister ===\n\nThe Cloister or Great Quad is the \"medieval nucleus\" of the college. It was constructed between 1474 and 1480, also by Orchard, although several modifications were made later. Access to the Cloister from St John's Quad is via the Founder's Tower or Muniment Tower. The chapel and the hall make up the southern side of the quad. It is also home to the junior, middle, and senior common rooms, and the old library.\nIn 1508, grotesques known as hieroglyphics were added to the Cloister. These are thought to be allegorical, and include four hieroglyphics in front of the old library that represent scholarly subjects: science, medicine, law, and theology. The other hieroglyphics have been assigned symbolism relating to virtues that should be encouraged by the college (e.g. the lion and pelican grotesques in front of the Senior Common Room representing courage and parental affection) or vices that should be avoided (the manticore, boxers, and lamia in front of the Junior Common Room, representing pride, contention, and lust). In 2017, repair work was undertaken to restore the severely damaged boxers statue.In 1822, the north side of the Cloister was knocked down, ostensibly due to disrepair. This decision was controversial, provoking protests from the fellows and in the contemporary press, and it was rebuilt shortly afterwards.In the early 1900s, renovations were performed, and it was returned to a more medieval character. Student rooms were installed in the (very large) roof space in the 1980s.\n\n\n=== Chapel ===\n\nThe chapel is a place of worship for members of the college and others in the University of Oxford community and beyond. As a High Anglican chapel, its tradition is influenced by the Catholic Revival in the Church of England. Said and sung services are held daily during term. The choir sings Choral Evensong or Evening Prayer every day at 6:00 pm except on Mondays. On Sundays, a Sung Eucharist is offered in the morning at 11:00 am, whilst Compline (Night Prayer) is sung several times per term. Mass is also sung on major holy days.The chapel itself is a grade I listed building built between 1474\u20131480. The roof, giving the impression of a stone vaulted ceiling, is in fact a facsimile made from plaster added in 1790 by James Wyatt. Wyatt's redevelopment of the chapel included a number of modifications to make it more Gothic in character, but other than the ceiling, Wyatt's contributions were removed during a later redesign in 1828.The stained glass windows facing St John's Quad feature a grisaille depiction of the Last Judgement. These windows, dating from 1792, are a reconstruction by Francis Eginton of an earlier 17th-century window that was destroyed in a storm. It had been uninstalled during World War II to protect it from damage, and was only restored in the 1990s. Much of the glass had been thought lost, until it was rediscovered in the ventilation tunnels under the New Building.\n\n\n=== Magdalen Tower ===\n\nConstruction of Magdalen's Great Tower began in 1492 by another mason, William Raynold. It might have been intended to replace an existing bellfry remaining from the hospital, and probably was originally envisioned to stand alone. By the time it was completed in 1509, additional buildings had been built either side, creating the roughly triangular Chaplain's quad between the chapel and the High.The tower contains a peal of ten bells hung for English change ringing. They were cast at a number of different foundries and the heaviest, weighing 17 cwt, was cast in 1623.The tower is 144 feet tall and an imposing landmark on the eastern approaches to the city centre. It has been the model for other towers, including Mitchell Tower of the University of Chicago, Manhattan's First Presbyterian Church, and All Saints' Church in Churchill, Oxfordshire. It forms the centre of the May Morning celebrations in Oxford.\n\n\n=== The New Building ===\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, there were numerous attempts made to redesign the site to better suit the College's needs. The New Building began construction in 1733 as a part of Edward Holdsworth's designs from 1731. It is built in a Palladian style, and features a colonnade.\nIt was conceived as one side of a new \"Great Quadrangle\", and in anticipation of this the building's ends had been left unfinished. However, Holdsworth's full vision was never completed. The idea was revisited several times by later architects, including by architects James Wyatt\u2014who plans (never realised) included partially demolishing the existing, Medieval quad (the Cloister) and refinishing the neoclassical New Building in a Georgian Gothic style\u2014and John Buckler. In the 19th Century, John Nash and Humphrey Repton both submitted designs for new, open quadrangles that incorporated the New Building.Ultimately, the idea of integrating the New Building into a new quad was abandoned, and the ends of the building were finally completed in 1824 with two returns designed by Thomas Harrison. Today, it stands apart from the Cloister, overlooking four croquet lawns on one side and the Grove deer park on the other. It is used for accommodation for undergraduates and fellows, including historically Edward Gibbon and C. S. Lewis, and also houses the wine cellar.\n\n\n=== Daubeny laboratory ===\n\nOpposite the main college site and overlooking the Botanic Garden is the 19th century Daubeny Laboratory.The Garden had been established between 1622 and 1633 as a physic garden (that is, a garden to study the medicinal value of plants) on land inherited by Magdalen from St. John's Hospital. The Daubeny Laboratory, and neighbouring Professor's House, were founded by the polymath and Magdalen fellow Charles Daubeny after he was appointed to the Sherardian Chair of Botany in 1834.Daubeny set about a number of additions to the location, erecting new glasshouses and in 1836 creating an on-site residence for the Professor of Botany. This replaced an earlier residence that had been demolished in 1795 when the road was widened. The new residence was an extension of the library, which had been created out of a glasshouse by an earlier Sherardian professor, John Sibthorp, to house the Sherard herbarium. After Daubeny's death, this was assimilated to house the growing collection. Later, it became accommodation for graduate students, the Professor's House, while the Sherard Herbarium is now part of the Fielding-Druce Herbarium held in the Department of Plant Sciences.Daubeny, who was also the Aldrichian Professor of Chemistry, had found the chemistry laboratory in the basement of the old Ashmolean Museum, what is now the History of Science Museum, to be \"notoriously unworthy of a great University\" and desired a better science facility. He petitioned the College to be allowed to build one, and the Daubeny laboratory was completed in 1848. The Daubeny Laboratory was preceded by the anatomy school and laboratory at Christ Church which opened in 1767, and would be followed later in the century by other college laboratories including the Balliol-Trinity Laboratories. Daubeny's laboratory was a two-storey room with benches and cupboards encircled by a gallery, and became the principal chemistry lab for the University. In 1902, due to growing student numbers and poor ventilation, the laboratory trappings were removed and it was refitted as a lecture hall. In 1973, most of the Daubeny Laboratory building was reconfigured into graduate student accommodation. The Daubeny lab itself is now a conference space.\n\n\n=== St Swithun's quad ===\n\nIn 1880\u20131884, the college extended westwards onto the former site of Magdalen Hall. The hall was an independent university hall that developed from Magdalen College School, not the earlier Magdalen Hall founded by William Waynflete. Most of Magdalen Hall's buildings were destroyed by fire in 1820, though the Grammar Hall survived and was restored by Joseph Parkinson. The hall moved to Catte Street in 1822 and was incorporated as Hertford College in 1874.The new construction, St Swithun's quad (sometimes given as St. Swithin's quad), was designed by George Frederick Bodley and Thomas Garner in keeping with the Gothic style. They had originally designed three sides of a square, though only the south and west sides were built. In 1928, Giles Gilbert Scott extended the building north and westwards, forming the adjacent Longwall quad.\n\n\n=== Modern buildings and acquisitions ===\n\nSeveral new additions to the college were made in the late 20th century. The Waynflete Building, which is located across Magdalen Bridge from the main college site, was designed by Booth, Ledeboer, and Pinckheard and completed in 1964. Magdalen has a number of additional annexes near to the main site for accommodation, including in Cowley Place and Longwall Street.\nThe Grove Buildings, located north of Longwall quad between Longwall Street and the Grove, were built in 1994-1999 by Porphyrios Associates. They are home to accommodation, Magdalen's 160-seat auditorium, and the Denning Law Library. During term time, the auditorium hosts film screenings organised by the Magdalen Film Society.Along Addison's Walk is the Holywell Ford site, where most of the graduate accommodation is located. Holywell Ford house was built by Clapton Crabb Rolfe in 1888 on the location of an older mill, and was acquired by Magdalen in the 1970s. Additional blocks of accommodation were built in 1994-5 by RH Partnership Ltd.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nIn addition to the University's central and departmental libraries, Oxford's colleges maintain their own libraries. The original college library, the Old Library, is located in the Cloister and accessed via Founder's Tower or the President's Lodgings. It contains a large collection of manuscripts from before the 19th century. Consultation of material is typically by appointment, although the Old Library itself may be visited by the public during certain exhibitions.In 1931, the New Library, now called the Longwall Library, was established in the former Magdalen College School building in Longwall Quad and became the college's main library for students. It was opened by Edward VIII when he was a student at Magdalen. It was renovated between 2014 and 2016 by Wright & Wright Architects and reopened by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge.In addition, the college maintains the Denning Law Library in the Grove building, a reference library for Magdalen's law students, and the specialist Daubeny and McFarlane collections of 19th century scientific works and medieval history works respectively. Items from the Daubeny and McFarlane libraries may be brought to the Longwall Library for consultation on request.\n\n\n== Grounds ==\n\n\n=== The Grove ===\n\nThe Grove or deer park is large meadow which occupies most of the north west of the college's grounds, from the New Building and the Grove Buildings to Holywell Ford. During the winter and spring, it is the home of a herd of fallow deer. It is possible to view the meadow and the deer from the path between New Buildings and Grove Quad, and also from the archway in New Buildings.\nIn the 16th century, long before the introduction of the deer, the grove consisted of gardens, orchards, and bowling greens. During the Civil War, it was used to house a regiment of soldiers. At one point in the 19th century it was home to three traction engines belonging to the works department of the college.  By the 20th century it had become well-wooded with many large trees, but most of them were lost to Dutch elm disease in the 1970s.\n\n\n=== Water meadow and Addison's Walk ===\n\nThe water meadow is a flood-meadow to the eastern side of the College, bounded on all sides by the Cherwell. In wet winters, some or all of the meadow may flood, as the meadow is lower lying than the surrounding path. All around the edge of the meadow is a tree-lined path, Addison's Walk, named for the fellow Joseph Addison (1672-1719), which connects to Holywell Ford and the Fellows' Garden.Addison's Walk is popular with College members and visitors. C. S. Lewis wrote a poem about the walk, Chanson d'Aventure or What the Bird Said Early in the Year, which is commemorated on a plaque near the gate to Holywell Ford.Thanks to the frequent flooding, the meadow is one of the few places in the UK that the snake's head fritillary, Fritillaria meleagris, may be seen growing wild. These flowers grow in very few places, and have been recorded growing in the meadow since around 1785. Once the flowering has finished, the deer herd is moved in for the summer and autumn.\n\n\n=== Bat Willow meadow and the Fellows' Garden ===\n\nFurther east of the water meadow are Bat Willow meadow and the Fellows' Garden. They are separated from the water meadow and each other by other branches of the Cherwell, and may be accessed from Addison's Walk. Bat Willow meadow features Y, a 10 metre high sculpture of a branching tree by Mark Wallinger, commissioned for the College's 550th anniversary in 2008. Due to their age and infection with honey fungus, the willow trees were cut down in 2018 and replanted, and the wood used to make cricket bats.The Fellows' Garden is located further north along the bank of the Cherwell than Bat Willow meadow, directly behind the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies. This long and narrow garden follows the Cherwell to the edge of the University Parks. In spring, the ground is covered with flowers. In summer, there are some flowers, many different shrubs, and the varied trees provide dappled cover from the sun.\nFurther north is Magdalen's sports ground.\n\n\n== Choir ==\n\nMagdalen is one of the three choral foundations in Oxford, meaning that the formation of the choir was part of the statutes of the college, the other choral foundations being New College and Christ Church.The choir consists of 12 academical clerks, or choral scholars, who are students at the college, and 16 boys aged seven to thirteen (some of whom stay on until age fourteen), all of whom have scholarships at Magdalen College School. The school was founded for this purpose but has long since become an independent public school.\nThe choristers' day begins at 7:30, with an early morning practice before school. There is further practice immediately after school, followed by Choral Evensong six nights a week, in term; the Tuesday service is sung by the boys only, and the Friday service only by the Academical Clerks. On Sundays there is a practice at 9:30 am followed by Eucharist, then a further afternoon practice followed by Evensong which ends at 7:00 pm. As of September 2010, the choristers no longer sing on most Saturday evenings following the formation of the Consort of Voices, a mixed voice choir which sings on most Saturdays in full term.\nThe choir records regularly. In 2005, it was nominated for a Grammy Award for its CD, With a Merrie Noyse, of music by Orlando Gibbons. Other recent works include the BBC's The Blue Planet and Paul McCartney's classical piece Ecce Cor Meum. The choir has numerous college duties as well as a recording and touring schedule. Traditionally the choir sings at college Gaudies and at other special events throughout the year, as well as performing on social occasions such as Carols by Candlelight before Christmas and the famous May Morning.\n\n\n=== May Morning ===\n\nAnnually at 6 a.m. on 1 May, the choir perform Hymnus Eucharisticus from the top of Magdalen's Tower to crowds below on Madgalen Bridge and the High Street. This tradition dates back 500 years, and forms the central event in Oxford's May Morning celebration.\n\n\n=== Organists ===\n\nThe choir has had many well-known organists, such as Daniel Purcell, Sir John Stainer (1860\u20131872) and Bernard Rose (1957\u20131981). Among the other notable former directors and masters of the choir, who hold the title of Informator Choristarum, are John Sheppard (1543\u2013c.1552), Sir William McKie, Haldane Campbell Stewart and the composer Bill Ives (1991\u20132009), possibly better known as a former King's Singer. A disc of his music, Listen Sweet Dove, is amongst the choir's releases.\nThe current Informator Choristarum, since January 2017, is Mark Williams. He succeeded Daniel Hyde, who had been organ scholar at King's College Cambridge, following Hyde's appointment as Organist and Director of Music of Saint Thomas Church, New York.Past organ scholars include Dudley Moore, Matthew Martin and Paul Brough. Past academical clerks include John Mark Ainsley, Harry Christophers (founder and director of The Sixteen), James Whitbourn, Robin Blaze, Roderick Williams and conductor/composer Gregory Rose.\n\n\n== Student life ==\n\n\n=== Accommodation ===\n\nUndergraduate students of the college are guaranteed accommodation during term for their entire degree, typically in the Waynflete building in their first year and \"inside-walls\" in the Cloister, St Swithun's Quad, the New Building and so on in subsequent years. Graduate students are guaranteed at least two years of accommodation. Unlike undergraduates, graduates are not required to move out between terms and typically live \"outside walls\", including in Holywell Ford, the Daubeny Laboratory, and Professor's House.Accommodation charges are inclusive of heating, power, and internet access, and weekly cleaning by the college scouts (housekeepers), but does not include catering. Three cafeteria style meals a day are served in the hall, and other food is available in the Old Kitchen Bar.In addition to a dinner cafeteria service served in the hall, three Formal Halls are held a week during term time. These are three course sit-down dinners and require college members to wear their gowns. Additional banquets commemorate special occasions, including the Restoration Dinner.\n\n\n=== Events and societies ===\n\nThe body of undergraduate and graduate students are known as the junior and middle common rooms (JCR and MCR) respectively. They each elect committees of students annually to organise welfare events, socials, and banquets.In addition to clubs and societies associated with the Oxford University Student Union operated at the university level, Magdalen members may also participate in several college societies. The Atkin Society and the Sherrington Society are two subject-specific societies, for law students and medicine students respectively. They organise talks and social events. The Atkin society is named for lawyer James Atkin, Baron Atkin, a former demy at Magdalen, and also organises an annual moot court. The Sherrington Society is named after Nobel laureate Sir Charles Scott Sherrington, former Waynflete Professor of Physiology. The college also has a poetry discussion forum called the Florio Society, named for 16th century college alumnus John Florio.A number of other societies put on events throughout the year.

These include King Edward VIII, who attended while Prince of Wales from 1912\u20131914, after which he left without graduating; Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the king of Bhutan, who read for an MPhil in politics in 2000; and Crown Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah, first in line to the throne of Brunei, who enrolled in the Foreign Service Programme (now known as the Diplomatic Studies Programme) in 1995 under an assumed name.Among the political figures taught at Magdalen was Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who studied theology. He graduated at 15, uncommonly early even for the time, but remained in Oxford for further study and eventually became a Fellow of Magdalen. Wolsey rose from humble origins to become Lord Chancellor and the Archbishop of York, obtaining great political power and becoming adviser to King Henry VIII. Wolsey left a lasting legacy in Oxford by founding Cardinal College, which Henry VIII would complete and refound as Christ Church after Wolsey's fall from power.More recent Magdalen alumni to become politicians include Malcolm Fraser, former Prime Minister of Australia, and John Turner, former Prime Minister of Canada. Many members of the UK Parliament have been alumni of Magdalen. In the current House of Commons sit alumni Jeremy Hunt MP and John Redwood MP.

He is known for his play Cato, a Tragedy based on the life of Cato the Younger at the end of the Roman Republic. Popular with the American Founding Fathers, the play may have served as a literary inspiration for the American Revolution.The 19th century poet, playwright, and aesthete Oscar Wilde read Greats at Magdalen from 1874 to 1878. During this time, he won the University's Newdigate English Verse Prize and graduated with a double first. After his time at Magdalen, he became famous for his works including The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Importance of Being Earnest.\nWilde began an affair in 1891 with Alfred Douglas, who was then himself a student at Magdalen. The disapproval of Douglas' father over Wilde's relationship with his son led to Wilde's prosecution and conviction in 1895 for \"gross indecency\", that is to say, homosexual behaviour, and a sentence to two years hard labour. Wilde described \"the two great turning-points in my life were when my father sent me to Oxford, and when society sent me to prison\". After his release from prison, Wilde moved to France and spent the last three years of his life in poverty. He was posthumously pardoned in 2017.The prolific author Sir Compton Mackenzie OBE, who wrote over one hundred novels, plays, and biographies, read modern history at Magdalen. He is known for his fiction, including Sinister Street\u2014which features St. Mary's College, Oxford as a stand-in for Magdalen\u2014and Monarch of the Glen. Compton Mackenzie co-founded the Scottish National Party and was knighted in 1952.C. S. Lewis, writer and alumnus of University College, was a Fellow and English tutor at Magdalen for 29 years, from 1925 to 1954. Lewis was one of the Inklings, an informal writing society that also included J. R. R. Tolkien and would meet in Lewis' rooms at Magdalen. Under Lewis' tutelage was the future Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman. Though Betjeman failed the maths portion of the entrance exams, he was offered a place to read English on the strength of his poetry, which had impressed the President of Magdalen and former Professor of Poetry Sir Thomas Herbert Warren. Lewis and Betjeman had a difficult relationship and Betjeman struggled academically. Betjeman left having failed to obtain a degree in 1928, but was made a doctor of letters by the university in 1974.Seamus Heaney, who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995, was a Fellow of Magdalen from 1989 to 1994.\n\n\n==== Theatre ====\n\nThe director Peter Brook CBE is both an alumnus and honorary Fellow of Magdalen. He was described in 2008 as \"our greatest living theatre director\". Fellow director Katie Mitchell OBE read English at Magdalen, and is known for her collaborations with Martin Crimp. In 2017, she received the President's Medal of the British Academy for her work in contemporary theatre and opera, and she has been described as British theatre's \"king in exile\".\n\n\n==== Music ====\nIn 1957, the organist and composer Bernard Rose OBE was appointed Magdalen's Informator Choristarum, choir master. Among his students were Harry Christophers CBE, a composer and an artistic director for the Handel and Haydn Society who was an academical clerk and later honorary Fellow at Magdalen; and Dudley Moore CBE, comedic actor and jazz musician, who studied at Magdalen on an organ scholarship.Andrew Lloyd Webber, Baron Lloyd-Webber, composer of musicals including Evita and The Phantom of the Opera, studied history at Magdalen for a term in 1965, before dropping out to pursue music at the Royal Academy of Music. Andrew Lloyd Webber has received a number of awards for his work, including a lifetime achievement Tony Award.\n\n\n=== Humanities ===\n\nHormuzd Rassam, the native Assyriologist, studied at Magdalen for 18 months between accompanying archaeologist Sir Austen Henry Layard on his first and second expeditions. When Layard retired from archaeology, the British Museum appointed Rassam to continue on his own. Rassam made several important discoveries: in 1853 at Nineveh, Rassam discovered the clay tablets that contained the Epic of Gilgamesh; in 1879 he discovered the Cyrus Cylinder in the ruins of Babylon; and in 1880-1881 he uncovered the city of Sippar. He was the first Middle Eastern archaeologist, but his contributions were dismissed by some of his contemporaries and by the end of his life, his name had been removed from plaques and visitor guides at the British Museum. Layard would describe him as \"one whose services have never been acknowledged\".The economist A. Michael Spence attended Magdalen on a Rhodes Scholarship, and graduated with a BA in mathematics in 1967. In 2001, he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on information flows. He is an honorary fellow at Magdalen.Philosopher A. C. Grayling CBE read for his DPhil at Magdalen, completing his studies in 1981. In 2011, he founded the New College of the Humanities. An analytic philosopher, Grayling is known for his criticism of religion, including in his 2013 book The God Argument, and his arguments for voting reform, as in his 2017 book Democracy and Its Crises.\nNiall Ferguson, a well-known historian, also studied at Magdalen.\n\n\n=== Sciences ===\n\nMagdalen counts among its alumni several recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Sir Howard Florey was an Australian pharmacologist who studied at Magdalen on a Rhodes Scholarship, graduating in 1924. He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 for the development of penicillin. Sir Peter Medawar CBE read for a BA in zoology at Magdalen, receiving a first, and later for a DPhil, supervised by Florey. His research into tissue grafting and immune rejection led to the discover of acquired immune tolerance and became the basis of organ transplantation. For this work, he shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.Like Florey before him, Australian neurophysiologist Sir John Eccles also came to Magdalen on a Rhodes Scholarship, where he read for his DPhil. He was taught by an earlier neurophysiologist who received the Nobel in 1932, Sir Charles Scott Sherrington, who held the Waynflete Professorship in Physiology at Magdalen. In 1963 Eccles received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research into synapses. Eccles was also known for his contributions to philosophy, writing on the mind-body problem and becoming an honorary member of the American Philosophical Society.Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe held the Nuffield Professorship of Clinical Medicine between 2003 and 2006, and is still a supernumerary fellow at Magdalen. He shared the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the oxygen sensing of cells. Other former Nuffield Professors of Clinical Medicine include Sir David Weatherall, who founded the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine in 1989, and Sir John Bell GBE, who is also an alumnus of the college. The current holder of the chair is Richard Cornall, who was appointed in 2019.Two Fellows of Magdalen have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics: Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in 1933, while he was a Fellow; and Anthony James Leggett KBE in 2003, who had been a Fellow from 1963 to 1967.Due to Magdalen's close relationship with Oxford's Botanic Garden and as the home of the Sherardian Chair of Botany, Magdalen has been associated with many accomplished botanists. Historic Sherardian Professors include John Sibthorp, in whose name the Sibthorpian Professorship of Rural Economy, later known as the Sibthorpian Professorship of Plant Sciences, was founded; and Charles Daubeny, who also held the Aldrichian Chair of Chemistry and founded the Daubeny laboratory. The Sherardian Chair has been held since 2009 by Liam Dolan, who studies the emergence of land plants.Likewise, many distinguished scientists have held Waynflete Professorships at Magdalen. These include the mathematician J. H. C. Whitehead, who held the Waynflete Professorship of Pure Mathematics between 1947 and 1960. During this time, he was also the president of the London Mathematical Society, which established the Whitehead and Senior Whitehead prizes in his honour. He is remembered for his fundamental contributions to topology. The chair was held from 1984 until he retired in 2006 by Daniel Quillen, who received the Fields Medal for his work in algebraic K-theory. It is currently held by Ben Green.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nVirtual Tour of Magdalen College\nWebsite of Magdalen College Choir\nFletcher's History of Oxford: Magdalen College\nA history of the choristers of Magdalen Chapel, Oxford\nWebsite of Magdalen Middle Common Room",

          "Ok. I admit that I am not in Oxfird as a tourist versus a chaperone for my children while they attend some summer camps. In fact, one of the things I find annoying about Oxford overall is the high concentration of tourists in such a small town. Just walking down the sidewalk is",
          "This place gave me a throwback, it was a mixture of emotions: from aside, I felt like I were a young student attending the college premises, from another side, I was stunned by the historical aspect of the building well maintained, the hall, the chapel and the breathtaking",
          "Visited this college one Sunday afternoon to get away from the invasion of tourists in Oxford in spite of the \u00a37.00 entrance fee. The grounds are beautifully kept, the white hydrangeas around the cloister gardens are magnificent, the chapel divine and the buildings truly",
          "I was actually staying at Christ Church's annex on St Aldates but did not get to visit the college itself as it always looked too busy although you can stroll around CC's meadows area along with the crowds! So I enjoyed a stroll down the ancient High Street and popped into to",
          "After Christchurch College, the most expensive in Oxford at \u00a36 pp even for pensioners. For this price one should expect free access to the Hall and Chapel like New College. Unfortunately no. The chapel needed to be view through a glass door, and the Hall visit was restricted to",
          "Check opening times and costs. Lovely to stroll around - they have a deer park with the river running through it. It is pronounced Maahdlin (not Mag-da-lin) the old English way. Tours tell you about the buildings and former students - CS Lewis, Oscar Wilde etc.",
          "Lovely day at the college. The entrance fee was totally worth it, as you are left to stroll at leisure through the lovely gardens and enter the grand dining hall. Don't miss the Deer Grove!",
          "The visitors entrance to Magdalen College is located across the street from the entrance to the Oxford Botanic Garden. The college\u2019s tower is an easy landmark to recognize. In addition to the tower, you can visit five quads, stroll through the extensive gardens, visit the deer",
          "Magdalen College was my favorite of the 4 colleges we visited while in Oxford. It is spacious and absolutely beautiful, but MUCH less crowded than Christ Church College. Give yourself a good 45 minutes to an hour to explore and relax outside if the weather is cooperating.",
          "Not everybody's choice I know but if choral and liturgical music is what you like, this chapel is small and atmospheric- highly recommend it",
          "Having visited ten years ago and done the full C. S. Lewis tour, it was wonderful to come back again for evensong. This is one of the most beautiful colleges in Oxford, and evensong is one of the best ways to experience it. The perfect acoustics and the exceptional talent of",

          "Our favourite college during our trip to Oxford. Access to the buildings is limited but you get a great taste of the college architecture. The gargoyles and stone figures are some of the best in Oxford. The chapel is stunning and we were lucky enough to hear the choir practising",
          "The Magdalen College is a beautiful example of the architecture of the period. Its set in lush green gardens that were just starting to show its spring colours. Its worth time to take a long walk and finish with a coffee. The buildings are well maintain and its location is",
          "Worth walking along the waterway, seeing the deer park and the Palladian second stage of the building...super grand.",
          "As an Oxford student, I was pleased to learn that I could enter the college without charge. I enjoyed wandering around and seeing the college, which was rather pleasant on a rainy and dull day. The deer were especially pleasing.",

          "Staff at entrance were so friendly and helpful. Building wonderful and the gardens and deer park lovely to walk round. We did attempt to go into the hall and were stopped with an explanation that it was currently in use and would be open at 2pm, we went back to find it locked.",
          "Such a beautiful piece of history. Amazing gardens so neat. I really enjoyed the atmosphere there...",
          "I went last night. Left after 15 minutes. Costs \u00a38 per ticket. No candles. Electric lights directly i my eyes. Couldn't see a thing. No view of anything going on at all. Waste of time and money",
          "I was witness to some nice architecture, atmosphere and deer. I can't really say any more. I walked into a place I shouldn't by accident (a library or something) and was treated nicely which I appreciated.",
          "Six quid to get in. Worth every penny. Breathtaking architecture, lovely grounds and the deer were in the park. Go here!!!",
          "We showed up just before closing time. We wandered the buildings and grounds and found them lovely. We had a chance to speak to an American student who told us he was still amazed to be studying is such an old, beautiful place. We attended evensong in the chapel. Just beautiful.",
          "Not sure we could have gained access without knowing a student who was willing to give us a tour, but this is my favorite of the Oxford Colleges. it has its own deer park! Lovely museum, cathedral, dining hall. See it if you can. If not, at least walk around the outside.",
          "The grounds, the buildings, the flowers, and the deer park all make this one of the best choices you could make to see what an Oxford college looks like from inside the walls. The entry fee is nominal, and you can stroll through and just feel the history. I highly recommend",
          "Visit the Chapel, the quadrangle, the New Building and the deer park. All are stunning and it is easy to imagine oneself living here. No need to pay for a guide - the Porter gives away a very helpful little pamphlet which gives a map and some history.",
          "Typical of the Oxford university colleges set around a quadrangle and college chapel. Well worth a visit",
          "We spoke to 2 members of staff who gave that extra time to share the experience of Magdalen College with us. We felt very welcome and the views and buildings are stunning!",
          "This is a must see when in Oxford. Beautiful buildings and gardens. Perfect against the autumn colours.",
          "We visited Magdalen College in mid afternoon and did not find it crowded. The buildings around the first quadrangle were interesting but we found the picturesque cloisters the high point of our visit. The deer park is a great asset for the college but it didn't do much for us.",
          "E hearMagdalen College is a very pretty College, with a stunning chapel and cloisters, lovely riverside walk along Addisons Walk and a deer park providing a fantastic haven in the heart of the city.",
          "This college is going to be a home for next 4 years for my child. It is an honor to be part of this beautiful place. I had a quick visit last week which I thought would not happen after interview visit last year. I am really looking forward to seeing more of this college and",
          "Not to be missed is the chapel and other buildings around the entry courtyard as well as additional buildings to the rear and the two meadows across the river. In the monastery see the Dining Hall and library on the 2nd floor where occasional exhibits are shown.",
          "Even if you have to pay - Oxford alumni don\u2019t - this is excellent value. Generous access to most parts of the college, a bar/deli facing the river, huge deer park leading to fellows garden and all so quiet and calm just one minute from the bustle of High Street. Combine this",
          "What a fabulous place. A real sense of history and learning. The grounds, park, and the buildings are all stunning. Loved the white stag in the deer park and the glimpse of Magdalen Bridge. Wonderful.",
          "The university area was our place to stay for two days with our gropup of 20 people staying in student quarters. Everythin is well organised and it is located in the centre of town",
          "Everything and more we expected to see in a Oxford college. Well worth the admission fee. Spend a lot more time than we planned on the grounds, lovely!",
          "Even on a rainy day it is great to get a sneaky peek at the privileged life of the public school kids - though I think occasionally they let state school kids in the Uni these days? That aside, this is a beautiful building and gardens, wonderfully maintained and a great to",
          "This was our first visit to Oxford and we happened across Magdalen College. We were unsure what to expect but the lure of a deer park in the city centre convinced us to part with our \u00a36pp. The collage grounds are beautifully kept and the walk around the deer park was very nice.",
          "Beautiful buildings, chapel and quad. The college is on the banks of the river and you can sit on the cafe terrace and watch the punts under Magdalen Bridge, or walk in the extensive grounds along the river bank and round the deer park. Well worth a visit.",
          "On previous visits to Oxford I've only managed to get a glimpse of the college quads through an open door or locked gate. This time it was nice to go inside and explore the cloister, chapel and surrounding grounds of one of them (entrance fee \u00a36), and read about when the",
          "My husband and i thought it was free to view along with the deer park so we were a bit disappointed after waking around Oxford all day doing numerous things to find there was a charge at the door of about \u00a36, I'm sure it would be worth it but we didn't budget this, but may have",
          "Magdalen College is particularly noted for its large grounds, which are nothing short of pleasurable to stroll through on a fine day. The chapel is well worth a visit, but don't miss out on the deer or the magnificent plane tree!",
          "Pay the 6 pounds to enter then got to the cafe and watch the boats. Well worth it and for a great college.",
          "This is my favorite college. The grounds are beautiful and the college filled with history. The student lead tour permitted us to understand this method of learning as well as the life of students.",
          "We were visiting Oxford University for Open Days and stopped into Magdalen College. Beautiful grounds, architecture and chapel. Worth the detour if you are nearby!",
          "What a truly stunning college. The grounds are immaculate with beautiful plants and architecture. Lunch on the balcony overlooking the river is just idyllic.",
          "I\u2019m not sure why you would pay for a tour of this college at Oxford University.\u2014maybe if you\u2019re a history buff. There was a \u00a35 admission fee to get in, but you can easily walk these grounds yourself. The college is square with a large open green in the middle. There is a gate",
          "If you're in Oxford, please make sure that you take this tour. The gardens are truly remarkable and it is so peaceful to just walk around the place. There's a small deer park but don't expect to see one up close.",
          "At \u00a35 just for a stroll around the college, it is quite expensive. The stained glass windows in the chapel are worth looking at as is the garden.",
          "This College is situated on the Cherwell River, which is a tributary of the Thames. The buildings, particularly the Chapel, are well worth seeing, as is the lovely garden.",
          "Pleased to find this College open as advertised. Although access is limited to certain aspects, we found there was a lot to see, and the grounds were beautiful, the College even has its own herd of fallow deer.",
          "Beautiful grounds, gorgeous buildings, lovely cup of coffee on the terrace watching people trying to punt. Really worth a visit.",
          "I'd been advised to visit one of the quads whilst I was in Oxford and this one was on the High Street so an easy choice. Entrance was \u00a36 and it was nice to just wander round the grounds and look at the architecture and gardens.",
          "We fancied a cup of tea on the terrace overlooking the bridge and the punts, but in order to achieve this aim you have to access through Magdalen College, and that costs \u00a36 per head. That said it is a lovely building set in manicured grounds with lovely walks along the river.",
          "After touring the college take the Addison Walk, smooth level trail with river views and a deer park.",
          "Nice water meadow and riverside walk. Dear park etc Great to get away from the crowds. Nice Buildings as well. did not find a gift shop or caf\u00e9 but did not look that much.",
          "This is a great place to take a walk, as it's an oasis of peace and calm, and full of interesting things to look at in the summer.",
          "Magdalen is one of the biggest and most beautiful colleges in Oxford. As you enter from the High Street near Magdalen Bridge, you cross into another world of ancient buildings and well kept gardens and meadows. It has a beautiful old chapel, and ancient quad, with dining hall",
          "Beautiful college buildings, and as an added treat take a hike along Addison's Walk. As C.S. Lewis stated (when he taught here), you will not know you are right in the middle of a busy town.",
          "this is a special school,with its pond garden birds deers,food,nothing much to say about it go and stay as much as the permit you,it was an unforgettable experiance for me just upon entering hearing classical music played in the chappel and so on,have a beer for me",
          "Around every corner of the endless seeming corridors is another architectural gem or gloriously kept garden.",
          "We had organised to stay in The School House, part of Magdalen accmomodation. Our rooms quirky but comfortable. Having breakfast in the great hall surrounded by students was fun and interesting. Exploring the grounds and parts of the college open to the public on a beautiful",
          "The organ music and choral works were performed beautifully. It is such a privilege to be allowed to share in this beautiful Service.",
          "It was a pleasure to be able to see where someone we knew had lived and studied. A beautiful college with lovely grounds and great ambience. Well worth a visit",
          "If possible go inside the college grounds ....they have a lovely area of parkland. Lovely college and situated actually on the river - Addison\u2019s walk was lovely especially with the trees etc all in bud. One of my favourites",
          "Be sure to walk Addison\u2019s Walk. See the flowers and dear, listen to the bird\u2019s song and take a break by the reflection pool.",
          "My son was just accepted so it was an amazing sight to see. The Cloister and deer were incredible. To walk where CS Lewis had trod...",
          "One of the prettiest schools in the Oxford area. The chapel was beautiful, the choir was practicing while we were there, making it a magical experience.",
          "Well worth a visit for an insight of what Oxford Colleges are from the inside rather than seeing them on Morse or Endeavour on TV. A Sunday visit to the chapel is also worth while the singing is always of top quality",
          "The visit to Magdalen College, you will be informed how it is prnounced, was every thing I was told about. When in Oxford make time to visit, you will not be disappointed.Jeff. Lewis",
          "The highlight of the college is Addison\u2019s walk, which is on the right upon entry. The chapel is worth visiting as well.. the courtyard is lovely and gives the impression of a literary masterpiece.",
          "This must be a contender for the most beautiful college in Oxford with its 15th century quadrangle and high bell tower (1508) and set in a deer park with the river Cherwell flowing by. Easily found at the end of the high street in Oxford. Every May day at 6am, the college choir",
          "Wonderful place to visit in Spring when the fritillaries are in flower in the meadow by Addison's walk",
          "Even though there is an entrance fee this place is worth a visit. There is a huge garden where you would get to lie down and enjoy sunshine (if you are lucky to visit on the sunny day :)",
          "The architecture is world class and a stroll thru the Deer Park and along Addison's Way is heavenly. Our guide pointed to a lamp post that was a inspiration for C.S. Lewis' work",
          "The grounds and buildings were beautiful - well-kept and majestic. The Tower stands as it did in the 16th century, the Cloisters were serene, and the Chapel is still in operation. The highlight for me was Addison's Walk. Imagine: both CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien strolled here,",
          "For a few pounds you get a basic guide book and are allowed to wonder among the beautiful gardens, the grounds adjacent to the colleague and enter some of the buildings on your own. One of the few colleges that seems to welcome tourists. (Our visit to Oxford coincided with most",
          "Colleges in Oxford all have their historical, impressive old buildings, but Magdalen's grounds are quite unique. A walk in the Deer Park and along Addison\u2019s riverside is something every visitor to Oxford should try to make time for. Tranquil and beautiful.",
          "Visited Magdalen College on Open Doors Day. It was interesting to see and imagine life here in Oxford as a Student. The Deer park was wonderful and so was the grounds, well worth a visit. The Chapel was just beautiful too.",
          "This is a beautiful college. It cost a few pounds to get inside if you're just a regular non-student tourist, but it's very calm and peaceful and there's a nice, big park to walk in, with deer in a fenced-in area in the middle. Not crowded at all. This is probably one of my",
          "Being a long term lover of Morse and Lewis I have always wished to get to this famous college, also my children went to a school of the same name in a local town. On my visit - I was lucky that the students were off - so I was able to look around in peace. Its strange walking",
          "As with a number of Oxford colleges Magdalen College is nearly invisible from the street. A door in a high wall leads you to the Porter's Lodge where an entrance fee is payable. You are then free to enter some of the College buildings and also most of the grounds. Both the",
          "This might be my favourite out of all the colleges here. Residents can visit for free and the beautiful gardens seem to go on forever. Even past the field with the deer there is a bridge that leads to another garden and at the end is a beautiful, small pond. It was great to",
          "You can go around the college, freely, without guide and with less people than other places, so you can have a better feeling of this old college and students life. The park is beautiful.",
          "We were given a lecture and an a dinner here and it was beautiful. I don't recall the food, so it must have been average. We came early and took pictures and ogled the architecture.",
          "It costs about 5-6 pounds to go in. It is old, and you get a free guideon entry. The gardens are especially wonderful, and you can walk around the deer park, and you are now allowed into the fellows park and lake. We wanted to see where my 7th GG lived and worked for almost 7",
          "Approaching Oxford from the North I would suggest using Park and Ride at Peartree. \u00a32.00 to park and additional \u00a34.80 return for a couple to City centre. Hop off at Magdalen street walk down Cornmarket street and hang a left onto High Street and 500 metres to Magdalen College.",
          "What a place! We were lucky enough to get in for free on an open day but it's just fantastic - rather like a beautiful tardis hidden behind stone walls. It's absolutely huge, including a massive and beautiful deer park, the famous tower and loads of beautiful buildings. A must",
          "C.S. Lewis was a tutor here for 29 years. It is, arguably, the most beautiful college in the Oxford University system. Those who cherish Lewis writings will enjoy seeing where he lived, where he strolled with JRR Tolkien, where he dined, and where he worshipped daily. That the",
          "Oxford is extremely expensive but there is a way to make it more affordabl - stay in the universities. Magdaleni is steeped in history with superb buildings and grounds. I stayed in the new building with a good sized ensuite room. Nreakfast was served in the Great Hall/ - a",
          "This was a highlight of our first day in Oxford. The gardens are breathtaking and the buildings classic in design. The reproduction of the last supper mural in the chapel is excellent and the small entrance fee is money well spent.",

          "I was lucky recently to walk through the grounds and buildings of this college - it is a beautiful place. I was very impressed.",
          "So being a fan of Tolkien and Lewis, I had to walk the grounds of this famous college. Addison's Walk is within the college grounds so you must pay a small fee to enter. It was so worth it, to tour the college and take the walk where Tolkien, Lewis, and Dyson discussed so much",
          "I stayed at the college as part of a large conference. There are certain things that business people expect from a conference hotel. Magdalen didn't bother with most of them. Double beds? Nope. Single. Irons for clothes? No. Not even in the laundry rooms. Hairdryers? You",
          "This is one of the classic old colleges of Oxford and is a treasure of the Oxford Universities. Look out for the well kept gardens and lawns. It is just lovely place and stunning setting.",
          "The buildings of Magdalen are even more beautiful than Christ Church, escpecially the court yard. A Little less crowded here too. A fine garden and you can stroll in the grounds over to an island in the river.",
          "Worth visiting just to wonder at what it must be like to study in a college that has its own deer park. Everything you expect to find at an Oford college can be found here with cloisters, old-fashioned dining halls, quads, gardens, river walks...oh and deer. \u00a36 entrance.",
          "This is yet one more grand college of the university. The grounds are beautiful and the buildings steeped in history. Well worth a visit.",
          "Magdalen College is well worth its money (we paid \u00a36 per person). We visited the Chapel (never seen brown stained glass windows before), loved the enchanting Cloisters (even on a rainy day), the Hall, Holywell Steam Bridge, the gardens, the stroll along the river to The Grove,",
          "This Oxford college is in a wonderful position...close to the river, the water meadow and deer park and it's an architectural gem. Entrance costs \u00a36 with concessions and a very informative leaflet is made available. Follow the route described in the leaflet and you will see",
          "Popped in for a quick look around as I did with various other colleges but as it happened Magdalen offers a guided tour at 5pm daily in summer (\u00a38). Great stroke of luck as it's a comprehensive & very interesting tour lasting 90 minutes or so, conducted (on my visit at least)",
          "Dating back to 1458, sat on the banks of the River Cherwell boosting its own deer park and walks. A stunning building that lends itself for great photos of a beautiful backdrop for a picnic with family. There is a strategically located supermarket over the bridge if you need",
          "This is a fairy tale coming to life. It was the delicate towers and gardens that gave me the unreal impression. I personally love the forest walk. However, I do hope that the colleges control the number of tourists in order to protect the serenity.",
          "You pay the entrance fee at the porter's lodge, pick up a brochure and out the door into the cloister, an oasis of calm and quiet. You see a green courtyard of neatly mown grass bordered with shrubbery and flowering climbers framing the arched openings. Following the walkways,",

          "I really feel walking round one of the old colleges like this one gives you a sense of the true Oxford. The architecture is just beautiful with peaceful cloisters to wander round, leading to the magnificent New Building, then over a little bridge to a walk by the river with deer",
          "Wanted to walk the grounds and take in all the sights that one sees and hears about but to see and experience it in person is truly a must todo. The buildings are classic and the grounds regal. When you enter the courtyards and grounds it is like entering another world and",
          "Beautiful buildings, gardens and grounds, with a herd of deer in the larger garden area in the back. The chapel is beautiful and a quick peek at the dining hall was well worth it! Do not miss Addisons Walk, along the Cherwell River. The grounds are so peaceful and beautiful.",
          "The architecture is wonderful and I was astounded by the chapel. The grounds are so peaceful after the noise and bustle of the city centre. There is also a walk along the river bank. As an added bonus there were no queues to get in.",
          "Awful place to stay, the room has a shared bathroom, one per floor, it is also for both men and women. The furniture is really old and rusty...certainly not recommended especially for the Price you are paying. The building is outside the beautiful magdalene campus... so you",
          "Not as crowded as Christ Church and equally interesting. Plus gardens are beautiful and you get a nice walk around a meadow with deers around as well. Well recommended!",
          "Great history, views, grounds, buildings. Really fun to see and be a part of this great academic town and area.",
          "This wonderful college was founded in 1458 and is thus steeped in history and stories of its past. The buildings are truly magnificent as are the famous grounds which are amongst the most beautiful in Oxford. The chapel is very special and the tower a great landmark of the town.",
          "We spent some time walking around the buildings and gardens. It has a beautiful chapel and cloister. The garden is full of peace.",
          "Beautiful authentic building, fantastic chapel, renovated library and amazing tower. The small restaurant inside has great value with excellent food. Must see.",
          "This was the favorite college I visited in Oxford. The windows in the chapel are astonishing. Great grotesques around the quad walls. I walked around the meadow and was surprised by a red deer which stared at me from behind the bushes. I recommending an hour or more here.",
          "Magdalen College's bell tower presides over the eastern access to Oxford's city centre. At 6am on Mayday morning the college choir sings from it. Students jump off Magdalen Bridge into the Cherwell hoping to escape injury, or worse, rustication. Magdalen is one of Oxford's most",
          "This was the last stop on our C.S. Lewis tour, and it was special to follow in his footsteps on his famous Addison's Walk. The grounds were well-groomed and it was very quiet during our tour. There's more emphasis on Lewis Carroll in Oxford, these days. Bring back information",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the few hours we spent looking around Magdalen College. The buildings just ooze history and the gardens were beautiful and in some parts quite stunning!",
          "This is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford and was founded in 1458. Located beside the River Cherwell, it has within its grounds a deer park and Addison's Walk, which is a picturesque footpath around a small island in the River Cherwell. The large square",
          "While staying in Oxford we had a chance to visit the Magdalen College campus. The grounds & gardens are lovely. The building is quite unique and give one the feeling of the agelessness and history of this campus.",
          "Magdalen College has a wonderful permanent art gallery, with temporary exhibits that are well worth a visit. The tour of the College dining hall is also quite remarkable and popular. However,, during the high season, the lines are so long that the tour becomes a tedious shuffle",
          "One of the many beautiful colleges that make up the Oxford University. This college was established in 1458 and has majestic building, beautifully manicured grounds, and a huge cathedral sized chapel. To add to its beautiful, the college is located next to the River Cherwell",
          "It is a nice college with magnificent buildings. But this is something you can find all over the place in Oxford. So I'm not sure if that's worth paying an additional fee to enter the college, while many other colleges can be entered for free, including equally nice dining",
          "Set on the river this is a beautiful college. There were also far fewer visitors here than at Christ Church. You can see some of the Cloister, dining hall, chapel (if open - it was not when we were there), old kitchen, and a walk around the river and marsh. You must pay",
          "Magdalen College is one of the most oldest and beautiful places in Oxford The dining hall is big and pretty",

          "I toured quite a few colleges in Oxford, but this one was by far the most beautiful. They have a field of deer and a nice walking area. You can retrace the steps of C.S. Lewis, one of the most famous faculty members of this college. Definitely a must see in Oxford!",
          "Beautiful setting, very 'traditional British' which was a great success with our international party. We dined in the New Room and the service and the meal were excellent - food was well presented and of a high quality. Would recommend.",
          "Went here during our visit to Oxford to see the deer park and gardens. Well worth a visit if you're in Oxford and want to see a college. \u00a36 for adults and worth the entrance.",
          "This is a really interesting visit and informative. Unfortunately I visited on my own and not part of a guided tour which if possible would be much better, however in the dining hall which was one of the sets used in the films of Harry Potter in the Hogwarts Hall scenes. There",

          "Magdalen is historic and extraordinarily beautiful - both the buildings and, even more so, the meadow and deer park. Well worth the modest cost of admission.",
          "I studied at one of the smaller, more modest Oxford colleges and spent my days there seriously envying friends who were at Magdalen for having such a beautiful, spacious place to call their home. Most of the colleges are open to the public - hours are quite restricted - and",
          "Spent the weekend in Oxford wandering around the city and it's many colleges and gardens. This one was probably my favourite, just so beautiful and well kept. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "The college is beautiful. The cloister is ancient, the dining hall very impressive. Try and go in term time in the afternoon (generally closed in the mornings) and see the students milling about. It will remind you that this is also a living place, not just a sight-seeing",
          "My coworker and I visited Magdalen College in the afternoon of our trip to Oxford on March 25. It wasn't busy. After having spent the morning at Christ Church, I was fairly burned out on colleges. I think I would've enjoyed it more had I visited it earlier in the day. It's",

          "Magdalen college is a very beautiful place but my interest is in it's connection with C S Lewis. He was a Tutorial Fellow in English from 1925 to 1954. Addison's walk is a path within the grounds. On that walk, in September 1931, Lewis walked with J R R Tolkien and Hugo Dyson.",

          "The main grounds of the college are very pretty, one of Oxford's most impressive colleges. But when you book online, what Magdalen do not tell you is that many of their rooms are NOT in the main college grounds. Rather they are in a dismal building on Cowley roundabout, 5-10 min",
          "The college buildings are lovely especially the chapel, but the real highlight is the park and meadows accessed from the back of the college. Don't miss the herd of roe deer which is amazing to see right in the centre of the city. At this time of year the gardens are full of",

          "The title says everything. This is my favourite college in town. The garden with roe deer is beautiful!",
          "Our first visit to Magdalen College and what an experience! The most beautiful building and grounds. The chapel is particularly spectacular as it has a number of black and white stained glassed windows. There were plenty of roe deer in the meadow. A magical place.",

          "Lovely walk, lovely buildings and as I live in Oxford - it's free!!! But, I would pay if I wasn't a resident! Would urge all visitors to Oxford to visit Magdalen.",
          "We visited on a cold afternoon in November. The cloisters kept the rain off then the sun came out. Not only a rainbow, but perched on a tree branch by Addison's walk was a kingfisher clearly visible and resplendent. You might not see him, but you will see a herd of deer and some",

          "We only had time to tour one of the colleges in Oxford, and I chose this one due to the fact that C.S. Lewis had taught here, and my guide book said it was the most beautiful. It did not disappoint. So gorgeous! All the landscaping and espaliered fruit trees, the canal, bridge",
          "Small on the outside, Magdalen College is huge inside, especially the grounds. Walking around the water meadows and deer park makes you feel you are in the middle of the country, not the middle of a major city! Medieval cloisters, Hall, Chapel with wonderful Last Supper after",
          "The college is beautiful and so are the grounds! But what I want to write about are the chapel services. They are absolutely superb! The evening service at 6pm with the choir - great music, dimmed light - amazing. Such a different experience after a day at work. Stepping into",
          "We were staying in Oxford for the first time and being shown around the colleges by a friend who was a student here several years ago. St Magdalen's was a \"Must see\" and we decided to go to Evening Song and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",
          "Magdalen College is a real treasure, and worth a visit as much as the more famous Christ Church. From its gorgeous cloisters and beautiful chapel to its expansive and tranquil gardens, which include a DEER PARK, Magdalen is perfect for taking a romantic/relaxing/meditative walk",

          "My favorite college to visit. Absolutely the place to go if you want to avoid the crowds. The buildings are astonishing and the path around the little meadow-ish thing is really pretty. There is a very calm atmosphere and there weren't many people around either of the times I've",
          "This college is not as touristy or grand as Christ Church, but worth a visit. It has a deer park, and you can spot them roaming around and it is also connected to the Water Meadow, which if you have time, is great for walking around. But make sure you have good shoes on as it",

          "This college was recommended to us as the most beautiful college in Oxford and we can see why! Definitely worth a visit as it has lovely rooms, really beautiful grounds, a shop and tearoom, and wonderful history. On the negative side though I don't think the public toilets",
          "Luxurious gardens, they even have their own deer enclosure, very fascinating. The chapel and cathedral are a must-see, entrance fee is 4 pounds, so not as expensive as Christ Church, but definitely more to see (and not such a rip-off because Harry Potter wasn't shot there!).",

          "Collage was amazing, i cant find the words to define. Streets around the collage was also fantastic. Walking around this place made me feel like i was walking in a historical era. Buildings very well preserved.",
          "Returned to visit this college with one aim in mind, the copy of Leonardos' Last Supper. It has recently been cleaned and the colours are vibrant glowing high up on the wall. It is a beautiful little church with stunning carvings of the altar. The dining Hall is also worth",
          "When I have guests visiting Oxford I always take them to Magdalen College. Beautiful college with lots of history (don't forget to visit the chapel!) and beautiful park. Deers (you can find them in the park) are one of the highlights!",
          "We visited this beautiful college on a day when it was not open. Fortunately we came across an extremely helpful man at the entrance who let us go thru to view the court yard and grounds. My Grandfather had attended the college so we were very grateful to have the opportunity",
          "A lovely college and grounds to walk round,to sit having lunch by the river watching the punts and rowing boats coming and going,lovely walks watching the deer in the park and around the river.",
          "My alma mater so I am biased but the weather was great and the college looked at its best. Despite work on the new library in Longwall quad the grounds were splendid. I cannot remember seeing Addisons Walk and the Water Meadow looking so good and the snakeshead fritillaries",
          "You will be asked to pay for the visit, but it worths. The architecture inside as well as their parks and lowns are great. unfortunately the objects accessible for tourists are no so many...",
          "The college buildings are well worth seeing, though there are many others as worthwhile in the centre of Oxford, but the extensive meadows are beautiful and a walk along the banks of the Cherwell is relaxing and rewarding. There were literally thousands of fritillaries in the",
          "We weren't sure about visiting Magdalen due to the cost. We had originally wanted to visit the deer park as this seemed on the map to be a separate attraction. Turns out it is part of the college grounds but is included in the admission price. We were greeted by a friendly",
          "On some of the maps in the city, it seems the deer park is its own attraction. This is not the case as it belongs to Magdalen College. As such the only entrance to visitors is through the main gate of the college itself. Visiting the deer park is included in the price of",
          "We visited this beautiful college and were thrilled to walk on the famous trail of the Tolkien / Lewis Addison walk! A quaint and lovely visit!",
          "visited on Easter sunday as not much else open...was excellent. historical and pretty and educational. lovely grounds and a nice walk,unfortunately we didn't see the deer.",
          "The chapel is really nice, the cloitre as well but what we preferred was the walk along the river, as there were flowers absolutely everywhere on the way. The deer park was also on the way",
          "This was a haven of peace after visiting the hectic city centre. Take a picnic and head to the Addison's walk at the back. Deer, beautiful photography and serenity. The cost is \u00a35 per adult. There was no charge for the teenagers with us. There is cheap parking at \u00a31.50 an hour",
          "By far my favourite college in Oxford. Visited it over 5 times now and still not done with it. My highlight is the hallways around the centre square; beautiful in al its simplicity. Especially in the sunny weather, which seems to give these hallways some extra. Don't be afraid",
          "The park is so beautiful (there are also deers) that alone it makes the visit to the college worth it. I didn't see the hall as it was closed but I really liked the college itself, I found it to be very different from the others",
          "Apparently the courtyard statues inspired C.S. Lewis' descriptions of the the White Witch's castle. Even if that's not true, it is a gorgeous place to visit.",
          "Really good place to visit as the outside grounds are extensive. Also worthy of note is that it is a location in Inspector Morse and Lewis",
          "I loved this college, beautiful architecture and history. Due to my timetable I had only 30 minutes here and would have liked double that. I recommend that you visit when the weather is warmer, it was at near freezing when I visited, as there is a lovely walk adjacent to the",
          "In summer this must be a haven from the city, although in winter it was still good and very interesting. The guide notes weren't as easy to follow as we hoped and some areas were out of bounds but there was still plenty to see.",
          "I haven't been to all of the colleges in Oxford, but I do daresay that this is the nicest one as I cannot imagine there could exist a nicer one. You can experience a lovely walk in Magdalen college and you can even see deers!",
          "I attended a service at Magdalen College on a Sunday morning in the chapel. The famous choir is amazing and it is a, beautiful place to experience the Anglican choral tradition. You can tour the grounds after church at no cost. The sermon the day I was there was by an expert in",
          "Wonderful interesting Title Deed office here with property dating back to 12th Century been given to encourage education within these fascinating Halls. The Chapel has fabulous carved backdrop, fascinating stain class windows and painting of the Last Supper with Mary Magdalene",
          "Lawns, buildings, canals - must spend about 90 minutes here however, this college demands an entry fee to look around. Oxford does have many colleges that allow free entry. But this college is more of a checklist item since it features on the lonely planet to do list :)",
          "Immediately you enter, for a small charge, you back in time amongst building, quads, walks,rivers, gardens and the deer park. A special place and a must visit. Check opening times as students still live here there are some restriction when they are up and exam times.",
          "The college provides a brochure telling you about some of the history. There is also a small cafe located along the river but they charge visitors extra. Beyond the college, you also have access to the deer meadow and some of the college grounds away from the quad.",
          "Don't miss the chapel, the deer park, and scenic Addison's walk with stream, ducks & punters. You can take a picnic & try to punt yourself, or rent a punter.",
          "very nice view good garden and nice people but parking is not very good ........................................",
          "The guide you are given on entry is not always completely clear but good enough. Walking round the buildings and cloisters gives a feeling of tranquility, I've seen plenty of stained glass windows but none in sepia tones before. On a better day they walk round the meadow would",
          "Deservedly reputed to be one of the prettiest colleges at Oxford; don't miss the beautiful floral quadrangle.",
          "The history of that place is amazing. And once inside besides a very well conserved 17h century architecture you can also see some delighting scenery in the university's own garden. It also Has a small caffe place inside where you can relax a little bit. I must say, when",
          "Besides the college, which is lovely, Magdalen has a huge garden, including a deer park. It takes 20-30 minutes to walk around, and the flowers change with the seasons. A quiet oasis in a busy town.",
          "I visited several colleges on a recent trip to Oxford, and found Magdalen to be my favorite. Picturesque grounds complete with a large field where you can watch the deer frolic! I really enjoyed walking around this college.",
          "We stayed at the college for three nights, in the 'new building', built in the 1730s. The suite would normally be used for second or third year students and was quite spacious. Toilet and shower was shared (and very basic) but there was never a wait. The room was almost",
          "This college is my favourite in Oxford, it is a stunning piece of architecture and has a warm feel to it. We were fortunate to be able to visit on a Saturday and as well as looking around we had a light lunch in the Riverside restaurant on the river terrace overlooking Magdalen",
          "A very good college to get to grips with the divide between town and gown. Magdalen has massive grounds all in the centre of the city",
          "Magdalen is open every day 12-6 and certainly makes visitors far more welcome than most colleges. Entry is \u00a34 for adults and it's superb value as you get to wander as long as you like in the deer park as well as seeing the buildings gardens - and maybe finishing with tea and",
          "We visited Magdalene late one afternoon. For 5 pounds you get to see one of the great centers of learning! It's a self-guided walk with a guide book, so you can take your time. Lovely grounds, beautiful buildings and a great sense of history. We enjoyed walking \"Addison's",
          "The cost of entering the college grounds were \u00a35 for adults and given the size of the grounds and buildings it is well worth the admission price. The deer park is quite lovely and the cloisters are beautiful. On entrance we were given a pamphlet to help us have a self-guided",
          "I am biased but for me this is the best College within the University. It is beautiful too with a superb chapel, grounds and buildings. IF you stay there (you can do a B&B there ) - ask for \"Inside the Walls\" so that you get that true feel.",
          "I'm sure that if the guided tour had been available on the day I went, I would have enjoyed my visit to Magdalen (pronounced maud-lin, for my fellow Americans or others who assume it's pronounced like Mary Magdalen) much more than I did. I studied abroad at Oxford but had never",
          "Despite having studied at Magdalen, I am sure that I am completely impartial in judging it to be the best of the Oxford Colleges. The tower is a landmark, of course; and the rest of the architecture, from the ancient cloisters to the (old) New Building, to the newest lecture",
          "Beautiful buildings, immaculate gardens and wonderful to take in the views whilst taking a stroll around the deer park on Addisons walk.",
          "I was a student at Oxford and I think Magdalen is one of the MOST BEAUTIFUL colleges. Wear walking shoes and bring your camera. Take a moment and say hi to the deer for me.",
          "I wish I could have come here to study! It was a very nice place to visit, especially the dear park.",
          "Cannot think of other colleges in Oxford or Cambridge that can boast a deer park within the grounds, but Magdalen is famous for this and it adds to the lustre of the beautiful grounds.",
          "The history immerses you at Magdalen. The unique aspect here is the combination of an historic college with many many famous alumni; the incredible gardens and park behind (worth a visit in itself), and the Botanical Gardens opposite. Very friendly people on the gate and in the",
          "This is a nice college to visit. It is more expensive compared to others but the grounds are extensive. The chapel and courtyard are lovely, the buildings are great and you can also venture in to the gardend and the adjacent deer park. Well worth the visit.",
          "Just returned from Magdalen college, staying in the Grove building as part of a painting course. Had a large on-suite single room with dinner and breakfast. It was a wonderful opportunity to be surrounded by the lovely buildings and grounds for five days. It is a real haven",
          "Lovely trip around, sadly missed out on some of the areas because of graduation ceremonies (must check diary!!) but just to walk in the deer park and roam the lower corridors made it all worth while.",
          "A \u00a35 entrance fee, but worth every penny. The grounds are beautiful, the College spectacular. I love old buildings and these do not disappoint. The river side walk is very peaceful. There is a Tea Room in the grounds and if the weather is nice, (it was hot and sunny for us ) you",
          "Gentle income, soft atmosphere, quality visit; vist the chapel and read the historic explanation. Walk around and into the garden; open doors where it is not forbidden and explore!",
          "This is the most peaceful and gracious college in Oxford. The chapel is lovely, but the most amazing part is the college grounds and deer park. It is so nice to relax there after a long walk and watch the punting on the canals, students playing cricket on the lawn, and graceful",
          "Only go here if you are on a mission to tour as many colleges as possible. This is one of the starker ones but its proximity to the Botanical Garden may warrant a quick 10 minute look around. I wouldn't go especially.",
          "Magdalen college grounds are (like the grounds of all colleges) worth visiting. It lies next to Magdalen bridge on Oxfords high street. Walk into the chapel entrance, look up, and see the ceiling of the portal, the chapel itself and after visiting the chapel walk to the",
          "This is one of the most historical and beautiful chapels in the world I think. Small but exquisite. My fianc\u00e9 studied here so every time we come back to Oxford, we try to have a nice walk in the deer park! Absolutely beautiful and idyllic. Highly recommend!",
          "We did the walking tour of the college, and the guide brochure was informative and clear. It's a lovely site, and you get to see buildings and outdoor areas--including the college's herd of deer.",
          "What an elegant campus! The gardens are gorgeous and the people so friendly. In spite of a chilly drizzle we quite enjoyed our visit.",
          "In a city with tons of walking tourist, this college was quiet and nearly empty. We had plenty of time to wander, walk in the adjacent deer park (Dyson's walk). Beautiful architecture and the time to enjoy. Amazingly quiet inside the walls.",
          "Thought it was certainly worth the visit. The Hall and Chapel were very interesting and we were lucky enough to happen on a private recital in the Chapel which added the icing on the cake. The grounds, meadows etc were beautiful and most restful. The college is open to the",
          "We were only allowed to see the outside of the buildings. This was definitely not worth the entrance fee. We also ate at the small cafe with riverside seating. The seating area was nice, and the food was okay. I would not bother.",
          "We visited Magdalen College in early April. I believe the students were on break so unfortunately we were not able to see any wearing their robes. The buildings were beautiful but my favorite part was the meadow. All the Spring flowers were in bloom, including a rare Snakes Head",
          "Excellent,we went late afternoon when we had the place to ourselves,the very friendly chap on the reception told us what to look for and we spent a fantastic hour wandering round with nobody bothering us,the most friendly college we have visited",
          "The College dates from 1458 not 1448. Could Tripadvisor please amend? Not a major issue but accuracy is all!",
          "We came there a bit late. So the friendly staff let us go in for free and even showed us the way to the Chapel. Its a very peaceful atmosphere. We chose to see this college because the Narnia writer C.S. Lewis had stayed and worked there.",
          "We saw the terrace of The Old Kitchen overlooking the river when we were hiring a boat earlier in our visit. After exploring how to find this terrace to have lunch we discovered it was the cafe if Magdalen. \u00a35 to get in, \u00a33.85 for a wonderful salad bar! Great great value and",
          "Definitely worth a visit - cloisters, chapel, Great Tower, lots of beautiful architecture and a very peaceful atmosphere. Also interesting gardens and meadows. Next time we will try and attend a service to hear the choir.",
          "One of the most beautiful colleges in Oxford. A must see !! The cloisters are impressive, the chapel is beautiful - though partly closed. The grounds and the deer park are just wonderful. You have to go for a nice walk round the park and appreciate the romantic views. You should",
          "My partner and I have visited Oxford on many occasions including a few of the other Universities as part of Official walking tours however this time over the recent Easter weekend on the Easter Saturday we decided to visit to Magdalen College not normally visited on waking tours",
          "This is - as all the older Colleges are - classical architecture at its finest. The sense of space and grace is marvellous! and behind/beyond the College is a Deer Park... The College is beside the river, and the nearby bridge is Magdalen Bridge where the exuberant students",
          "After having the pleasure of working here last year, I thought it was time to show the rest of the family. Like most colleges it maintained by devoted grounds persons, but this one is somewhat more special. From the grounds to the buildings it's well worth a visit. Only downside",
          "This is our favourite college - it has the lot - fab cloisters, chapel , deer park, fascinating past undergraduates and grounds down to the punts on the small tributaries around the Thames. On May day morning get up early and go to Magdalen Bridge to hear the choristers",
          "Well worth a visit. You have to see inside these buildings to appreciate them. A lot to see inside and out, Christ Church College shows why Oxford is considered to be amongst the finest educational cities in the world. The buildings, gardens and grounds are very well",
          "After strolling through the wonderful old cloisters of Magdalen College, it was delightful to stroll through acres grounds covered in Wood Anemones, Daffodils and Snake's Head Fritillary. The river snaked through the grounds and we crossed over it to find ever more carpets of",
          "This college is further out than most, in fact it is the only college outside the old city walls, but probably the most beautiful. The buildings are stunning (as are many in Oxford), but there is so much to take in that it is well worth going the extra (half) mile. Keep your",
          "Really like Addison's Walk - great views of the water meadow, the deer and the buildings. The cafe was really good valued even to \"non-members\" - you almost make you entrance fee back if you are hungry - simple fare but really nice and very cheap by Oxford standards.",
          "A beautiful college, the grounds are lovely with the added bonus of a deer park in the centre of Oxford! Lovely cafe with river view. Definitely worth a visit",
          "Not only are the college buildings beautiful, including the chapel and hall, but it's not every day that you can visit a college with its own deer park",
          "A nice place to visit during daytime. Vegetarian menu served in the college hall during the dinner was not really good. The dessert was nice though.",
          "Walking through Magdalen was like stepping back in time. Though the school was closed for Christmas break, you could definitely get a good feel for college life at Oxford. The chapel and grounds were worth the time to wander and explore. Very nice indeed.",
          "I teach on the life and writngs of C.S. Lewis. My admiration of this truly great man makes Oxford a pilgrimage for me. Magdelen College and Lewis home, The Kilns, are at the top of the list of essential Lewis sites. This college is the most beautiful in Oxford and the tour is",
          "The architecture is very pretty but when you pay 6 \u00a3 to enter you would expect something more. In the end all you get to see is the hall and the library, and only standing by the door as entrance is forbidden to both. You join the line, wait your turn to take a brief peak at",
          "Just to wander around and marvel at the history of the place is a joy. A great mix of architecture spanning the centuries. Walk along the river to the deer park.",
          "A deer park in the centre of Oxford was not what we expected but that is what you get at Magdalen college. The grounds are peaceful and provide a lovely setting for a walk in the winter sun. Magdalen college was founded in the 15th century and has a very impressive quad.",
          "And it is beautiful. Do you know the story of the atheist CSL going on a walk with Tolkien and Hugo Dyson along Addison's Walk in this college? They convinced him that the myth of the dying, returning god he had always loved was in fact true. Thus, Narnia, and Perelandra, and",
          "We have previously been during the summer where the punts ply their trade close to the college and within sight of the cafeteria. After looking at the stunning architecture the visitor may then enjoy the solice of a circular walk around the substantial grounds and what a",
          "I visited several colleges during my stay in Oxford including Christ Church. Magdalen was the best. Highlights are the outstanding chapel where there is an undamaged 15th century copy of da Vinci's Last Supper plus some outstanding stained glass work. The grounds are huge and",
          "One of the oldest colleges in Oxford and the site is bursting with history, ambience and awe.The buildings sit smugly, almost arrogantly, defying a criticism that never comes. The quad (on which you must not tread) is beautiful. Go on a sunny day and close your eyes and let your",
          "The buildings and grounds are beautiful . Walking through the gates from the busy High Street is like stepping back in time. Its so peaceful inside the college walls and the whole place oozes history. A walk through the deer park is a must as is a visit to evensong (6pm) in",
          "Our favorite college of the visit. The grounds are beautiful and the deer park makes for a wonderful walk. Even though it was raining the path is tree-covered and quite sheltered. Good stop for C.S. Lewis fans also",
          "Magdalen is a great college on the side of the river with plenty of space including a deer park and beautiful buildings. I have always imagined myself sitting reading a book on the mound, but sadly, when young, opted for somewhere else to study. If only!",
          "A little further out than many of the tourist will go without the crowds of Christ's. A New Building, that's 300 years old with the Amien's Plane planted nearby and arch typical quad. A beautiful chapel, organ and choir with adjacent Bell Tower where May Morn is sung in. The",
          "Magdalen College is indeed very impressive and majestic -- you can see that from outside, but inside there is nothing special, the same green lawan (off limit!), ancient stone buildings etc, many places are off-limit to visitors, then what's the point to get people paying to",
          "We visited Magdalen College as part of our whistle-stop visit to Oxford. It is a beautiful college set in glorious grounds. We enjoyed visiting the dining hall, walking through the gardens and coming across the deer, grazing in the fields. We also visited Balliol College but,",
          "Another beautiful college at Oxford. It is located near the centre of the city, it is a very huge college and the garden is excellent full of beautiful flowers that give a touch of colour to the landscape..after a first garden it is possible to walk in another one that is also",
          "The college is very nice. It is quite incredible to see the buildings. The problem I had was that a lot of the rooms were marked as private and we were not able to see much apart from the main quad and a couple other small rooms. Even some rooms and gardens marked on the visitor",
          "This college has a interesting chapel. The front wall is covered with statues to the ceiling very unique only one other chapel at All Souls has a similar wall. A must see because it is very difficult to see the chapel at All Souls College",
          "As soon as you enter the grounds it is like being in another world. The buildings are attractive but mainly shut to the public. The walk around the Deer Park is lovely. It is easy walking with several seats for admiring the view. The river is on one side; the park on the",
          "Fantastic walking the steps of Tolkien and Lewis (Addison's Walk, along the Cherwell), watching punters on the Cherwell. A perfect afternoon's activity.",
          "This collage is a beautiful place with a lovely quiet park with deer living there but the admission is quite expensive ( Adult \u00a35) for what it offers. The collage itself is an interesting and worth visiting. There is a coffee shop with some tables on the terrace with the view",
          "Magdalen College deservedly has a reputation as one of the most beautiful colleges in Oxford, combining historical architecture with peaceful gardens. Entering through the Porter\u2019s lodge into St John\u2019s Quadrangle, be sure to look up and take in the numerous creatures decorating",
          "Being a member of Oxford University and having visited all the colleges, I can assert that Magdalen is one of the richest, biggest and most beautiful colleges, with fantastic Gothic architecture and a large number of different buildings, including a beautiful chapel. In",
          "This is an old, old place. After gawking at the chapel, sneak out the back and see the vast fields, gardens, gates and more. Magical.",
          "We strolled around the rounds after enjoying a leisurely punt along the river. Time stood still as we admired the ancient honey-coloured buildings, the many and varied beautiful flowers and people playing croquet on the manicured lawns. A gentle walk took us past the deer park",
          "Magdalen is one of my favourite colleges to visit. The deer that roam there give it a very special draw. Well worth a visit.",
          "A beautiful college with wonderful grounds that are well kept and even have deer on the premises! Take your time and look at all the details the buildings have to offer! So much historical eye candy!",
          "Given a choice this is the place I would have loved to have studied at, but, paradoxically I am sure if I was a student a Magdalen, I would have studied very little: the large bays of the new students hall, the perfect green of the lawns just call for a good book on a summers",
          "This place was pretty cool. Scenes from Harry Potter were filmed here and C S Lewis attended here-although there is no info on that unless you already know it. The place was empty when we walked around and its very small to see as a tourist. The buildings are beautiful and",
          "After the noise and crowds of Christchurch it was lovely to wander through this peaceful college and visit the hall and chapel. Worth a visit for the tranquility. Admission was through a proper porters' lodge too.",
          "A wonderful place to wander in-we were impressed by the sepia-toned stained glass in the chapel. We will especially remember the warm welcome we received at the Porter's Lodge!",
          "I don't know if it was because it's the start of the spring season and hasn't been a very good spring here but our visit to Magdalen College started off great but ended horribly. The weather had just warmed up and the sun eas shining, it was a really beautiful day to enjoy the",
          "Lovely area, great place to unwind and just have a nice walk. The grounds and buildings a well worth seeing.",
          "Magdalen is one of the larger colleges within Oxford University and it shows in both the extensive grounds and the impressive buildings on display. There is a small admission fee of \u00a35 for adults (\u00a34 for concessions) to enter the college, among the more expensive admission fees",
          "A perfect setting for a walk on those rare sunny Summer days. Very Oxford, very tranquil. Cross the High and carry on through Christ Church Meadow for a longer walk, continue down the river and stop off for a drink at the Isis pub along the tow path - a quintessential Oxford",

          "Very good tour with senior student, saw various parts of the college and extensive deer park at the back. Handy for Oxford Botanic Gardens across the road. Recommend Cafe Cucina in St Clements for something to eat",
          "Magdalen Bridge strides from Oxford's High Street to The Plain and on to roads for to Headington, Cowley and Iffley. Looking north from the bridge usually provides a view across to the deer park, but at the moment it's a large lake that catches the eye on account of the record",

          "Magdalen College deer park is open most days, from 1pm all year round, and is a must for anyone interested in Oxford Colleges. The buildings are fascinating, reminiscent of a cathedral cloister, but the grounds are well worth a walk, too. They lead through a deer park and",
          "It has everything that Oxford can offer; beautiful college, great gardens (they have a deer garden that is worth a visit, and also an important site w/certain types of rare plants); great rooftop (yes, it is possible to get there if you know the right people); and an amazing",

          "In my opinion, this is one of the prettiest colleges in Oxford, and a lovely spot to sit and listen to the bells. I spent loads of time looking at the gargoyles: a whole bestiary of mythical and hybrid animals, along with whacky and scary personages looking down at you!",
          "it was not a good day to visit as there was a lot of work going on so we did not see as much of the collage as we would have liked to have seen ,but obviously this has to be done out of term time ,but will go again",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Shotover Park (also called Shotover House) is an 18th-century country house and park in Wheatley, Oxfordshire, England. The house, garden and park are Grade I-listed with English Heritage, and 18 additional structures on the property are also listed. The house is privately owned. The surrounding parkland is open to the public as Shotover Country Park, and is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest under the name Brasenose Wood and Shotover Hill.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe source of the name Shotover is uncertain. One suggestion is that it comes from Ch\u00e2teau Vert (\"Green Castle\"), a French Norman Royal hunting lodge on the site. Novelist Robert Graves was a proponent of this theory, mentioning it in his classic book A Wife for Mr Milton.Another alternative is the Old English Scoet Ofer (\"upper spur\"). Shotover Hill is located 3 miles (4.8 km) to the east of Oxford, which rises to 557 feet (170 m) above sea level.  In the Domesday Book of 1068, the location was identified as Scotorne. Up through the 13th century, patent rolls of King John and Henry III refer to Shotover variously as Scotore, Shotore, Shothore, and Shottovere.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Shotover Lodge ===\nThe land encompassing Shotover Park was part of the Wychwood royal forest as far back as the Domesday Book. There was an \"ancient\" house on the site, celebrated as the location that Queen Elizabeth I selected for her reception to close her visit to Oxford in 1566. Oxford orator Roger Marbeck delivered a speech about Oxford University and the queen's valuable support for the university. The queen is recorded as saying upon her departure from Shotover, \"Farewell the learned University of Oxford, farewell my good subjects there, farewell my dear scholars; and pray God prosper your studies.\"\n\nShotover came into the possession of the Tyrrell family after a freak hunting accident early in the 17th century. The story is that Timothy Tyrrell, Master of the Royal Buckhounds, was holding a dead stag for the teenaged Henry, Prince of Wales, eldest son of King James I. According to a chronicle of the unfortunate accident: \"By his employment, [Tyrrell] held the Buck's head for the Prince to cut it off, in doing which His Highness cut the Master of the Buckhounds across the hand, which disabled him of the use of it forever.\" In compensation, the prince granted the rangership of the Forests of Shotover and Stow Wood to Tyrrell.In 1613, following Prince Henry's death in 1612, King James confirmed the rangership by letters patent for the duration of the lives of Timothy Tyrrell and his two sons, Timothy (Master of the Buckhounds to King Charles I) and William. On 29 August 1624, King James knighted the elder Timothy Tyrrell at Shotover while attending a sporting hunt. He died in 1632.Originally from Oakley, Buckinghamshire, the Tyrrell family grew extremely powerful in the 17th century. The royal forest in Oxfordshire extended over Headington, Marston, and parts of 10 other parishes. However, ongoing fighting among the local population, as well as trees felled by the Royalists during the English Civil War, caused the forest to fall into such disarray that in 1660 the woodland was disafforested \u2013 no longer subject to royal forest laws.The Tyrrells lived in a house known as Shotover Lodge or Shotover House, although it is unknown if it was the same house visited by Queen Elizabeth or a different building. Historian and political theorist James Tyrrell, grandson of Sir Timothy the elder, grew up at Shotover before moving to Oakley in 1670 after his marriage. Tyrrell divided his time between Oakley and Shotover. Tyrrell was a close friend of John Locke, whom he met at Oxford in 1658. Locke was a frequent guest at Shotover in the late 1670s and early 1680s, and he stored papers and books there for safekeeping when he was forced to flee to Holland in 1683. Tyrrell eventually sold Oakley and moved back to Shotover after James II forced him out of local governance in Buckinghamshire for refusing to sign the Declaration of Indulgence in 1687.\n\n\n=== Shotover Park ===\n\nSir Timothy the younger died in 1701. The construction of the current Shotover Park began circa 1714\u201315 under his son James, and was located approximately 200 metres (660 ft) east of the site of the house visited by Queen Elizabeth. In 1717\u201318, he built a Gothic temple at Shotover. The temple, with corner turrets, arcaded loggia, and battlemented gable, is possibly the first intimation of the Gothic Revival architecture in England. James died the following year and the construction of the building was continued under his son, Lieutenant-General James Tyrrell, an Army officer and MP.The architect of the new house commissioned by Sir Timothy is uncertain, but Shotover Park is believed to have been designed by William Townsend (or Townesend; 1676\u20131739), an Oxford architect and mason who worked on many buildings at Oxford University, and who was the son of Mayor of Oxford John Townesend. Sir Nikolaus Pevsner  wrote in the Oxfordshire edition of his Buildings of England series that Shotover Park has strong similarities with The Queen's College, Oxford, linking it to Townsend. Construction was likely completed by 1720; the date 1718 does appear on rainwater heads. The design of the elder James Tyrrell's Gothic temple has been attributed to Townsend or to James Gibbs.Shotover Park was constructed of colour-washed limestone ashlar with a roof made of Westmorland and Welsh slate with stone stacks. The house is built to a double-depth plan, consisting of two storeys, plus a basement and attics. The initial house featured a seven-window front. In 1855, it was extended to 15-windows with two wings added on either side in a renovation by Joshua Sims. The Ionic pedimented porch, the arched front doorway and flanking arched windows are likely from the mid-19th century additions. The windows on the ground and first floors feature floating cornices, moulded architraves and sills supported on consoles.\n\nEarly outbuildings and features at Shotover Park included three stables, a  coach house, a granary, a barn, dairy, work house, a brewhouse, gardener's cottage, several gardens and nurseries with young trees, and six small fishponds. The formal garden on the site dates to 1718, which includes a Grade I-listed walled kitchen garden.\n\nIn addition to the Gothic temple built for Sir Timothy, the garden includes a large obelisk and another temple designed by William Kent circa 1735. The obelisk was built to honour the visit of Queen Elizabeth and stands on the site of the ancient house she visited. The Kent temple was badly damaged in the 1980s by falling trees, but it was restored in 1988 with assistance from the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission.James Tyrrell died in 1742 and left the estate to the family of his friend, the Baron Augustus Sch\u00fctz, a Hanoverian favourite of King George I, who became Master of the Robes to King George II. It passed to his son, George Frederick Schutz, who was Groom of the Bedchamber to King George III, and in turn to his son, Thomas James Schutz.When Thomas died, Shotover Park passed into the hands of the Drury family through his youngest sister Mary, who married Sir George Vandeput, 2nd Baronet. They left only one heir, a daughter Frances, who married Richard Vere Drury. Shotover passed to their son, George Vandeput Drury, who died without an heir in November 1849.In 1850, George Gammie (later Gammie-Maitland) bought Shotover, reportedly with the proceeds of the sale of property he owned in Australia. (His business partner, William Gilbert Rees, named Shotover River in New Zealand for Gammie.) Gammie-Maitland went bankrupt in 1871, when the estate was sold to Colonel James Miller. It stayed in the Miller family until 2006, owned by Alfred Douglas Miller and his son Sir John Miller, Crown Equerry and friend of Queen Elizabeth II. The royal family were frequent visitors to the estate; Princess Anne suffered a broken nose falling off a horse while riding at Shotover at age 15.\n\n\n== Today ==\nShotover Park has been held in a trust since the death of Sir John Miller in 2006. Sir John's nephew, Sir Belville Stanier, 3rd Baronet, is one of the trustees; his son, Alexander James Sinnott Stanier, lives in a wing of the house. The park and estate cover 2,000 acres (810 ha). 117 hectares (290 acres) of forest, known as Shotover Country Park, is open to the public and managed by the Oxford City Council.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Listed buildings ==\nGrade I: Shotover Park\nGrade I: Shotover park and garden\nGrade II*: Gothic Temple\nGrade II*: Obelisk\nGrade II*: Octagonal Temple\nGrade II: Oxford Gate\nGrade II: Oxford Lodge\nGrade II: Eastern Pier of Gateway\nGrade II: Home Farm, South Range\nGrade II: Home Farm, Central Range\nGrade II: Dovecote\nGrade II: Stables\nGrade II: Steps\nGrade II: Garden Seat\nGrade II: The Grove\nGrade II: Garden Walls and Gardener's Cottage\nGrade II: Ornamental Wellhead\nGrade II: Western Pier of Gateway\nGrade II: Stable Court\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade I listed buildings in South Oxfordshire\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShotover House Auction Catalogue, 1855 - List of the entire contents of the mansion, which were sold at auction over seven days, pursuant to an order in Chancery (Spickernell v.

        "wiki": "Cutteslowe Park is a public park in Cutteslowe in North Oxford, England. It was \nestablished in 1935 when Oxford City Council acquired land of the former Cutteslowe Manor farm, whose house still stands at its centre. More land was acquired in 1937. The original manor house dates from at least the mid-17th century, being shown on a 1670s map by Michael Burghers.In 2006 Oxford City Council united the park with Sunnymead Park, just to the south and of the Oxford Northern Bypass. The two parks now form a single administrative unit called Cutteslowe and Sunnymead Park.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nCutteslowe Park has herbaceous borders and despite disease damage during 2009-2012 there remained many horse chestnut trees, until most of them were removed in 2017 by the City Council's order on the allegation that after a disease their branches could possibly become fragile and pose danger. Until further disease management in 2010 and early 2011, the park also contained some superb examples of White Willow trees.The park has a children's pool, crazy golf, small aviary, duck pond, and tennis courts. There is a miniature steam railway run by the City of Oxford Society of Model Engineers.Purchases of farmland by the City Council in 1937-8 gave the park a large recreation ground on its east side, used for football and rugby in autumn and winter. The increased size of the park enabled the creation of a \"Peace Mile\": a running circuit that encompasses most of the perimeter of the park, inaugurated in 1985 by world harmony advocate Sri Chinmoy and the then Mayor of Oxford. The peace mile is popular with runners and in summer short running races are held around it by Sri Chinmoy Athletics Club.  The park has also been the location of the Oxford parkrun since November 2011.\nA public footpath cuts diagonally across the lower recreation ground, originating on the line of an ancient drovers' path, part of which is still visible at its southern extent for about 100 yards (91 m), bisected by the A40, the Northern Bypass. This linked Water Eaton and Oxford, and a short section of this path (at the bottom of Harpes Road, Islip Road and Victoria Road in North Oxford) is called Water Eaton Road. Further south this becomes a footpath from Lonsdale Road, and it emerges near the Cherwell School.\nTo the north and east the park is bounded by farmland, while it is bounded to the south by the Oxford Northern Bypass Road, and to the West by 1960s\u201370s housing developments of Cutteslowe.\n\n\n== Community interest ==\nOn 21 February 2007 the Friends of Cutteslowe and Sunnymead Park was formed \"to promote the access, positive management and enhancement of the park and its facilities for the benefit of the local community and wider general public\".\n\n\n== Wind turbine proposal ==\nIn November 2009 a City council proposal to lease an area of the park to an energy management company for the construction of a wind turbine was challenged by the Friends, who felt that fuller community engagement should first be sought. The proposal was eventually defeated owing to concerns about impacts on RAF flying on the approach to Brize Norton airbase, to the West of the area.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFriends of Cutteslowe and Sunnymead, own site.\nFriends of Cutteslowe and Sunnymead from the Oxford City Council.\nCutteslowe Park Miniature Railway\nCutteslowe Park Management Plan information from Oxford City Council (PDF).",

          "Local to Oxford. I live opposite the park. I learnt how to ride my bike here. Ice cream van, mini golf, playground and vintage trains.",
          "A lovely place to spend the day. The water play and the sandpit were great. Sadly we went on a day when the train wasn\u2019t running, but had fun feeding the wildfowl. The parking was plentiful but longwinded as I had no cash. Otherwise all was good, loads of space for a picnic",
          "We spent the afternoon at this park with 2 kids aged 5 and 7. Positives: Great open space, lots of places to explore, good play areas, enjoyed feeding the ducks, kiosk was fast moving despite being incredibly busy, steam train was a sweet novelty, inexpensive parking Negatives:",

        "wiki": "Alice's Shop is a shop at 83 St Aldate's, Oxford, England. With 82 St Aldate's next door it is part of a stone-built 15th-century house that was remodelled in the 17th century. It is now a gift shop selling gifts, souvenirs and memorabilia, all based on Alice.\n83 St Aldate's has long been a shop. In the Victorian era its customers included Alice Liddell, daughter of Henry Liddell, who was Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, which is opposite the shop. Alice, who used to buy sweets at the shop, was the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its 1871 sequel Through the Looking-Glass.\n82 and 83 St Aldate's were built in the 15th century. Early in the 17th century they were remodelled. 83 St Aldate's has a gabled front with a 17th-century bay window on the first floor. On its north side 83 has a blocked 17th-century window. Together 82 and 83 St Aldate's are a Grade II* listed building.\n\n\n== The Old Sheep Shop ==\nLewis Carroll featured the shop as the Old Sheep Shop in his 1871 novel Through the Looking-Glass. One of John Tenniel's original illustrations for the book shows the inside of the shop. Carroll used it as a setting in Chapter 5 of the book (Wool and Water) and is owned by a sheep in the story:\n\n\"She looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in wool. Alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again. She couldn't make out what had happened at all. Was she in a shop? And was that really \u2014 was it really a sheep that was sitting on the other side of the counter? Rub as she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little dark shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her was an old Sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and then leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles.\"\nThe shop is characteristic of the dream-like qualities in the Looking-Glass world, in that every time Alice tries to focus on a specific object on its many shelves it changes shape and shifts to another shelf. At another point the shop itself vanishes and Alice finds herself outside with the sheep in a boat, having been given a pair of knitting needles which turn into oars in her hands. The sheep herself continues to make scornful, personal remarks and then finally, on appearing back in the shop, sells Alice an egg, which promptly turns into Humpty Dumpty.\nOn leaving the shop at the end of the chapter, Alice says:\n\n\"Well, this is the very queerest shop I ever saw!\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlice's Shop Oxford",

        "wiki": "The Oxford Martyrs were Protestants tried for heresy in 1555 and burnt at the stake in Oxford, England, for their religious beliefs and teachings, during the Marian persecution in England.\nThe three martyrs were the Anglican bishops Hugh Latimer, Nicholas Ridley and Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe three were tried at University Church of St Mary the Virgin, the official church of the University of Oxford on the High Street. The men were imprisoned at the former Bocardo Prison near the extant St Michael at the Northgate church (at the north gate of the city walls) in Cornmarket Street. The door of their cell is on display in the tower of the church.\nThe men were burnt at the stake just outside the city walls to the north, where Broad Street is now located. Latimer and Ridley were burnt on 16 October 1555. Cranmer was burnt five months later on 21 March 1556.\nA small area paved with granite setts forming a cross in the centre of the road outside the front of Balliol College marks the site. The Victorian spire-like Martyrs' Memorial, at the south end of St Giles' nearby, commemorates the events.  It is claimed, notably in the early part of the novel 'The Negotiator' by Frederick Forsyth, that the scorch marks from the flames can still be seen on the doors of Balliol College (now rehung between the Front Quadrangle and Garden Quadrangle).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nChristian martyrs\nJames Brooks, one of the papal sub-delegates in the Royal Commission for the trial\nList of Protestant martyrs of the English Reformation\nMartyrs' Memorial, Oxford\nOxford Movement\nReligion in the United Kingdom\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Oxford Guide information\nThe Oxford Martyrs article\nThe martyrs' cross, Broad Street, Oxford",

        "wiki": "Carfax is at the junction of St Aldate's (south), Cornmarket Street (north), Queen Street (west) and the High Street (east) in Oxford, England. It is considered to be the centre of the city. The name \"Carfax\" derives from the Latin quadrifurcus via the French carrefour, both of which mean \"crossroads\".  The Carfax Tower, also known as St. Martin's Tower (it is the remaining part of what was the City Church of St. Martin of Tours) is a prominent landmark and provides a look-out over the town.\n\n\n== Tower ==\n\nSt Martin's Tower, popularly called \"Carfax Tower\", is on the northwest corner of Carfax. It is all that remains of the 12th-century St Martin's Church and is now owned by Oxford City Council.  It was the official City Church of Oxford, where the Mayor and Corporation were expected to worship, between about 1122 and 1896, when the main part of the church was demolished to make more room for road traffic and All Saints Church in the High Street became the City Church.\nThe tower is 74 feet (23 m) tall, and no building in central Oxford may be built higher than it. It is a Grade II listed building.The tower still has a ring of six bells: five recast from the original ring by Richard Keene of Woodstock in 1676 and one cast by Keene two years later. They are rung on special occasions by the Oxford Society of Change Ringers.\nThere is a clock that chimes the quarter hours on a pair of bells cast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough in 1898. The clock's current dial and surroundings were designed by Sir TG Jackson and installed in 1898. In 1938\u201339 the clock mechanism was replaced with an electric one made by Gents' of Leicester.It is possible to climb to the top of the tower for a view of the Oxford skyline. The tower is open 10am\u20135.30pm Easter to October, and 10am\u20133.30pm October to Easter.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\nThe St Scholastica Day riot of 1355 began with an altercation in the Swindlestock Tavern (now the site of the Santander Bank on the southwest corner of Carfax, between St Aldate's and Queen Street) between two students and the taverner.\nIn 1865 William Henry Butler, who had been Mayor of Oxford in 1836, was buried in St Martin's churchyard in the grave of his first wife Elizabeth Briggs and their two infant daughters. In 1900 the church was demolished to make way for road improvements and as a consequence the grave and tombstone were forgotten.  It is probable the tombstone was made by either John Gibbs of Oxford (father of Butler's second wife) or one of Gibbs's employees.  The tombstone is still in situ and can be seen behind the tower. There is a campaign to protect the tombstone for posterity.\n\n\n== Role in legislation ==\nComparable to St Mary the Great for the University of Cambridge, Carfax plays a role in the disciplinary legislation of the University of Oxford over its students.  For example, the University requires some students to reside within six miles (9.7 km) from Carfax.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCarfax Conduit\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources and further reading ==\nBeeson, C.F.C.

      "name": "Merton College",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Merton College (in full: The House or College of Scholars of Merton in the University of Oxford) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England. Its foundation can be traced back to the 1260s when Walter de Merton, chancellor to Henry III and later to Edward I, first drew up statutes for an independent academic community and established endowments to support it. An important feature of Walter's foundation was that this \"college\" was to be self-governing and the endowments were directly vested in the Warden and Fellows.By 1274, when Walter retired from royal service and made his final revisions to the college statutes, the community was consolidated at its present site in the south east corner of the city of Oxford, and a rapid programme of building commenced. The hall and the chapel and the rest of the front quad were complete before the end of the 13th century. Mob Quad, one of Merton's quadrangles, was constructed between 1288 and 1378, and is claimed to be the oldest quadrangle in Oxford, while Merton College Library, located in Mob Quad and dating from 1373, is the oldest continuously functioning library for university academics and students in the world.Like many of Oxford's colleges, Merton admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979, after over seven centuries as an institution for men only.Notable alumni and academics past and present include four Nobel laureates and writer J. R. R. Tolkien who was Merton Professor of English Language and Literature from 1945 to 1959. Merton is one of the wealthiest colleges in Oxford and held funds totalling \u00a3272 million as of July 2017. Merton has a strong reputation for academic success, having regularly ranked first in the Norrington Table in recent years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and origins ===\n\nMerton College was founded in 1264 by Walter de Merton, Lord Chancellor and Bishop of Rochester. It has a claim to be the oldest college in Oxford, a claim which is disputed between Merton College, Balliol College and University College. One argument for Merton's claim is that it was the first college to be provided with statutes, a constitution governing the college set out at its founding. Merton's statutes date back to 1264, whereas neither Balliol nor University College had statutes until the 1280s. Additionally, Merton was also the first college to be conceived as a community working to achieve academic ends, rather than just a place for the housing of scholars.Merton has an unbroken line of wardens dating back to 1264. Of these, many had great influence over the development of the college. Henry Savile was one notable leader who led the college to flourish in the early 17th century by extending its buildings and recruiting new fellows.\n\n\n=== St Alban Hall ===\n\nSt Alban Hall was an independent academic hall owned by the convent of Littlemore until it was purchased by Merton College in 1548 following the dissolution of the convent. It continued as a separate institution until it was finally annexed by the college in 1881.\n\n\n=== Parliamentarian sympathies in the Civil War ===\nDuring the English Civil War, Merton was the only Oxford college to side with Parliament. This was due to an earlier dispute between the Warden, Nathaniel Brent, and the Visitor of Merton and Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud. Brent had been Vicar-General to Laud, who had held a visitation of Merton College in 1638, and insisted on many radical reforms: his letters to Brent were couched in haughty and decisive language.Brent, a parliamentarian, moved to London at the start of the Civil War: the college's buildings were commandeered by the Royalists and used to house much of Charles I's court when Oxford was the Royalists' capital. This included the King's French wife, Queen Henrietta Maria, who was housed in or near what is now the Queen's Room, the room above the arch between Front and Fellows' Quads. A portrait of Charles I hangs near the Queen's Room as a reminder of the role it played in his court.\nBrent gave evidence against Laud in his trial in 1644. After Laud was executed on 10 January 1645, John Greaves, one of the subwardens of Merton and Savilian Professor of Astronomy, drew up a petition for Brent's removal from office; Brent was deposed by Charles I on 27 January 1646 and replaced by William Harvey.Thomas Fairfax captured Oxford for the Parliamentarians after its third siege in 1646 and Brent returned from London. However, in 1647, a parliamentary commission (visitation) was set up by Parliament \"for the correction of offences, abuses, and disorders\" in the University of Oxford. Nathaniel Brent was the president of the visitors. Greaves was accused of sequestrating the college's plate and funds for king Charles. Despite a deposition from his brother Thomas, Greaves had lost both his Merton fellowship and his Savilian chair by 9 November 1648.\n\n\n== Buildings and grounds ==\n\nThe \"House of Scholars of Merton\" originally had properties in Surrey (in present-day Old Malden) as well as in Oxford, but it was not until the mid-1260s that Walter de Merton acquired the core of the present site in Oxford, along the south side of what was then St John's Street (now Merton Street). The college was consolidated on this site by 1274, when Walter made his final revisions to the college statutes.\nThe initial acquisition included the parish church of St John (which was superseded by the chapel) and three houses to the east of the church which now form the north range of Front Quad. Walter also obtained permission from the king to extend from these properties south to the old city wall to form an approximately square site. The college continued to acquire other properties as they became available on both sides of Merton Street. At one time, the college owned all the land from the site that is now Christ Church to the south-eastern corner of the city. The land to the east eventually became the current Fellows' garden, while the western end was leased by Warden Richard Rawlins in 1515 for the foundation of Corpus Christi (at an annual rent of just over \u00a34).\n\n\n=== Chapel ===\n\nBy the late 1280s the old church of St John the Baptist had fallen into \"a ruinous condition\", and the college accounts show that work on a new church began in about 1290. The present choir, with its enormous east window, was complete by 1294. The window is an important example (because it is so well dated) of how the strict geometrical conventions of the Early English Period of architecture were beginning to be relaxed at the end of the 13th century. The south transept was built in the 14th century, the north transept in the early years of the 15th. The great tower was complete by 1450. The chapel replaced the parish church of St. John and continued to serve as the parish church as well as the chapel until 1891. It is for this reason that it is generally referred to as Merton Church in older documents, and that there is a north door into the street as well as doors into the college. This dual role also probably explains the enormous scale of the chapel, which in its original design was to have a nave and two aisles extending to the west.A new choral foundation was established in 2007, providing for a choir of sixteen undergraduate and graduate choral scholars singing from October 2008. The choir is directed by Peter Phillips, currently also director of the Tallis Scholars, and Benjamin Nicholas, a former director of music at Tewkesbury Abbey. In 2013, the installation of a new organ, designed and built by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders, was completed. The chapel is famous for its splendid, ethereal acoustics.\nA spire from the chapel has resided in Pavilion Garden VI of the University of Virginia since 1928, when \"it was given to the University to honor Jefferson's educational ideals.\"\n\n\n=== Front quad and the hall ===\n\nThe hall is the oldest surviving college building, but apart from the door which has medieval ironwork almost no trace of the ancient structure has survived the successive reconstruction efforts, first by James Wyatt in the 1790s and then again by Gilbert Scott in 1874. The hall is still used daily for meals and houses a number of important portraits. It is not usually open to visitors.\nFront quad itself is probably the earliest collegiate quadrangle, but its informal, almost haphazard, pattern cannot be said to have influenced designers elsewhere. A reminder of its original domestic nature can be seen in the north east corner where one of the flagstones is marked \"Well\". The quad is formed of what would have been the back gardens of the three original houses that Walter acquired in the 1260s.\n\n\n=== Mob Quad and library ===\n\nVisitors to Merton are often told Mob Quad, built in the 14th century, is the oldest quadrangle of any Oxford or Cambridge college and set the pattern for future collegiate architecture, but Front Quad was enclosed earlier (albeit with a less unified design) and other colleges, for example Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, can point to their own older examples.\nThe old library occupies the upper floor of the south and west ranges of Mob Quad, and the original archive room is still in the north-east corner; it houses one of the most complete sets of college records in Europe.\n\n\n=== Fellows' Quad ===\n\nThe grandest quadrangle in Merton is the Fellows' Quadrangle, immediately south of the hall. The quad was the culmination of the work undertaken by Sir Henry Savile at the beginning of the 17th century. The foundation stone was laid shortly after breakfast on 13 September 1608 (as recorded in the college Register), and work was complete by September 1610 (although the battlements were added later). The southern gateway is surmounted by a tower of the four Orders, probably inspired by Italian examples that Warden Savile would have seen on his European travels. The main contractors were from Yorkshire (as was Savile); John Ackroyd and John Bentley of Halifax supervised the stonework, and Thomas Holt the timber. This group were also later employed to work on the Bodleian Library and Wadham College.\n\n\n=== Other buildings ===\n\nMost of the other buildings are Victorian or later and include: St. Alban's Quad (or \"Stubbins\"), designed by Basil Champneys, built on the site of the medieval St. Alban Hall (elements of the older fa\u00e7ade are incorporated into the part that faces onto Merton Street); the Grove building, built in 1864 by William Butterfield but \"chastened\" in the 1930s; the buildings beyond the Fellows' Garden called \"Rose Lane\"; several buildings north of Merton Street, including a real tennis court, and the Old Warden's Lodgings (designed by Champneys in 1903); and a new quadrangle in Holywell Street, some distance away from the college.\n\n\n=== T.S. Eliot lecture theatre ===\nA new lecture theatre named after T.S. Eliot, a former member of the college, was opened in 2010. It has a bust of the writer by Jacob Epstein, presented by Frank Brenchley, a former member and Fellow of the college. Brenchley presented his collection of Eliot first editions and ephemera to the college, which is believed to be the second largest collection of such material worldwide. The foyer is illuminated by a lighting display representing three constellations that were visible on the night of 14 September 1264, the day the college was founded.\n\n\n=== Gardens ===\nThe garden fills the southeastern corner of the old walled city of Oxford. The walls may be seen from Christ Church Meadows and Merton Field (now used by Magdalen College School, Oxford as a playing field for cricket, rugby, and football). The gardens are notable for a mulberry tree planted in the early 17th century, an armillary sundial, an extensive lawn, a Herma statue, and the old Fellows' Summer House (now used as a music room and rehearsal space).\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Student life ==\n\nMerton admits both undergraduate and graduate students. It admitted its first female students in 1980 and was the second former male college to elect a female head of house (in 1994). Merton has traditionally had single-sex accommodation for first-year undergraduates, with female students going into the Rose Lane buildings and most male students going into three houses on Merton Street. This policy was abandoned in 2007, with all accommodation now mixed by gender and course.\nUndergraduate admission to the college, like other Oxford colleges, is based solely on academic potential. In 2010, it was (incorrectly) reported that Merton had not admitted a black student in the previous five years. A university spokeswoman commented that black students were more likely to apply for particularly oversubscribed subjects. The university also reported that Merton had admitted at least one black undergraduate since 2005.\n\n\n=== Reputation ===\nSince the introduction of an official Norrington Table published by the university in 2004, Merton occupied one of the top three positions every year (often coming in 1st), until 2012 when it dropped to 14th. In 2014, it regained the first position, preserving its status as one of the most academically successful colleges of the last twenty years. Due to its academic success, Merton is often humorously referred to as \"the place where fun goes to die\" by members of the other Oxford colleges. \n\n\n=== Traditions ===\nAt the 'Time Ceremony', students dressed in formal academic dress walk backwards around the Fellows' Quad drinking port. Traditionally participants also held candles, but this practice has been abandoned in recent years. Many students have now adopted the habit of linking arms and twirling around at each corner of the quad. The alleged purpose of this tradition is to maintain the integrity of the space\u2013time continuum during the transition from British Summer Time to Greenwich Mean Time, which occurs in the early hours of the last Sunday in October. However, the ceremony (invented by two undergraduates in 1971) mostly serves as a spoof of other Oxford ceremonies, and historically as a celebration of the end of the experimental period of British Standard Time from 1968 to 1971 when the UK stayed one hour ahead of GMT all year round. There are two toasts associated with the ceremony, the first is \"to good old times!\", or \"to a good old time!\", whilst the second is \"long live the counter-revolution!\"\nMerton is the only college in Oxford to hold a triennial winter ball, instead of the more common Commemoration ball. The most recent of these was held on 30th November 2019.\n\n\n=== Societies ===\n\nMerton has a number of drinking and dining societies, along the lines of other colleges. These include the all-male Myrmidons, the female-equivalent Myrmaids and L'Ancien R\u00e9gime.\nMerton is host to a number of subject-specific societies, the most notable being the Halsbury Society (Law) and the Chalcenterics (Classics). Other academic societies include the Neave Society, which aims to discuss and debate political issues, and the Bodley Club, founded in 1894 as a forum for undergraduate papers on literature but now a speaker society.\n\n\n==== The Bodley Club ====\nThe Bodley Club is a speaker society at Merton College, Oxford. Founded in 1894 as a forum in which undergraduates delivered academic papers on literature, the Club has changed form over the years, and was reformed in the 1980s as a speaker society. All members of the College, and usually members of the university as a whole, are invited to their events.\nThe Club began on 19 May 1894 (though it was not christened 'The Bodley Club' until June). The initial constitution contained a rule (Rule 7) which stated that 'a written paper is preferred, but any member may speak on any literary subject instead or may propose that any literary work be read at the meeting.' It was not long before this provision was required, as the minute-book reveals in its entry for 19 October 1894: 'Owing to unpardonable slackness on the part of members, the four months of vacation proved insufficient to collect coherent ideas on any particular subject...However an agreeable and instructive evening was passed in reading Tennyson's 'Maud'.' From early years the Club has maintained a troubled existence, and the Secretary noted on 1 November 1900 a motion of censure 'against a person or persons unknown who were responsible for the undoubted blackness which is creeping over the Bodley Club.' Nevertheless, the Club has continued in one form or another to the present day.\nAmong the notable papers delivered to the Bodley Club are those by Frederic Harrison, Harold Henry Joachim, Henry Hamilton Fyfe (brother of the Secretary, William), Northrop Frye, Sir Alister Clavering Hardy, and Ronald Knox. Several of the Club's first members went on to become significant figures, including Herbert George Flaxman Spurrell and William Hamilton Fyfe.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nMerton has a long-standing sporting relationship with Mansfield College, with the colleges fielding amalgamated sports teams for many major sports.\nIn rowing, Merton College Boat Club has been Head of the River in Summer Eights once; its men's 1st VIII held the headship in 1951. Merton's women have done better in recent years, gaining the headship in Torpids in 2003 and rowing over to defend the title in 2004.\n\n\n== Grace ==\nThe college preprandial grace is amongst the longest in Oxford, and is always recited before formal dinners in Hall, usually by the senior postmaster present. The first two lines of the Latin text are based on verses 15 and 16 of Psalm 145.\n\nRoughly translated it means:\nFor the relevant verses of the Psalm, the Authorized Version has:\n\n15. The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.\n16. Thou openst thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.In contrast, Merton's post-prandial grace is brief: Benedictus benedicat (\"Let him who has been blessed, give blessing\"). The latter grace is spoken by the senior Fellow present at the end of dinner on High Table.\nAt the University of Cambridge, a slightly different version of the Latin text of these verses is painted around Old Hall in Queens' College, Cambridge, and is \"commonly in use at other Cambridge colleges\".\n\n\n== People associated with Merton ==\n\nMerton alumni (Mertonians) and fellows have pursued careers in a variety of disciplines.\n\n\n=== 1264 to 1900 ===\nAmong the earliest people that have been claimed as Merton fellows are William of Ockham and Duns Scotus, outstanding academic figures from the early 14th century (however, these claims are disputed). Other early fellows include the Oxford Calculators, a group of 14th-century thinkers associated with Merton who took a logico-mathematical approach to philosophical problems. Theologian and philosopher John Wycliffe was another early fellow of the college.\nFounder of the Bodleian Library, Thomas Bodley, was admitted as fellow in 1564. Another significant figure, Henry Savile, was appointed Warden some years later in 1585 (held the position until 1621) and had great influence of the development of the college. William Harvey, who was the first to describe in detail the systemic circulation, was warden from 1645 to 1646. Lord Randolph Churchill, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons (and father of Winston Churchill), matriculated in October 1867, while Max Beerbohm, an English essayist, parodist, and caricaturist studied at Merton in the 1890s and was Secretary of the Myrmidon Club.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 1900 to today ===\nMerton has also produced notable alumni in more recent times. In science, Merton is associated with three Nobel prize winners: chemist Frederick Soddy (1921), zoologist Nikolaas Tinbergen (1973) and physicist Sir Anthony Leggett (2003). Other Mertonians in science include Canadian neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield, mathematician Sir Andrew Wiles who proved Fermat's Last Theorem, computer scientist Tony Hoare, chemist Sir George Radda, economist Catherine Tucker, geneticist Alec Jeffreys and cryptographer Artur Ekert.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nNotable Mertonians within the field of literature include poet T. S. Eliot, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948, and author J. R. R. Tolkien who was Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton from 1945 to 1959.Former students with careers as politicians include British politicians Reginald Maudling, Airey Neave, Jesse Norman, Ed Vaizey, Denis MacShane, Elizabeth Truss and Sir Peter Tapsell, while international alumni include Bob Krueger, former U.S. Senator from Texas, and Arthur Mutambara, former Deputy Prime Minister of Zimbabwe.\nIn business, former Director-General of the BBC and current CEO of the New York Times Company Mark Thompson, CEO of Stonewall Ben Summerskill and former CEO of Sony Sir Howard Stringer are alumni. In law, Henry Litton served as one of the very first Permanent Judges of the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong (Hong Kong's court of last resort), while Brian Leveson is currently both President of the Queen's Bench Division and Head of Criminal Justice.\nOther alumni include the composer Lennox Berkeley, actor and singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson, mountaineer Andrew Irvine, RAF pilot Leonard Cheshire, former athlete Roger Bannister, journalist Tanya Gold and Naruhito, Emperor of Japan. \nThe current Warden of the college is Irene Tracey, who was elected in succession to Sir Martin J. Taylor, former Professor of pure mathematics at the University of Manchester on his retirement in 2018.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Women at Merton ===\nJust like the other ancient colleges of Oxford, Merton was originally an all-male college. It admitted its first female students in 1980 and became the second former male college to elect a female head of house when Jessica Rawson was appointed as Warden in 1994.Alumnae of Merton include British Conservative Party politician Elizabeth Truss, writer Leana Wen and Princess Akiko of Mikasa.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBibliography\n\nBott, A.

          "This is a lovely college, dating back to 1276 and is one of the smaller colleges. If you get a chance to get on to one of the conducted tours, make sure you visit the Upper Library. Merton has one of the oldest English libraries in continuous use ( built around 1373). I",

        "wiki": "The Weston Library is part of the Bodleian Library, the main research library of the University of Oxford, reopened within the former New Bodleian Library building on the corner of Broad Street and Parks Road in central Oxford, England.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFrom 1937 to 1940, Sir Giles Gilbert Scott worked on the New Bodleian Library, in Broad Street, Oxford. It is not generally considered his finest work. Needing to provide storage for millions of books without building higher than the surrounding structures, Scott devised a construction going deep into the earth, behind two elevations no higher than those around them. His biographer A. S. G. Butler commented, \"In an attempt to be polite to these \u2013 which vary from late Gothic to Victorian Tudor \u2013 Scott produced a not very impressive neo-Jacobean design\". A later biographer, Gavin Stamp, praises the considerable technical achievement of keeping the building low in scale by building underground, but agrees that aesthetically the building is not among Scott's most successful designs. Nikolaus Pevsner dismisses it as \"neither one thing nor the other\".The building was constructed of Bladon stone with Clipsham dressings and was opened by King George VI. The Rockefeller Foundation donated 60% of the \u00a31 million cost for the new library building. It included administrative and reading rooms, together with an 11-storey bookstack beneath the building. This was connected with the original Bodleian Library underground by an conveyor belt system for books. It is still possible to walk underground between the Radcliffe Camera and the new library building.\nIn the early 21st century, the building was rebuilt internally behind its original fa\u00e7ade to provide improved storage facilities for rare and fragile material, as well as better facilities for readers and visitors. It reopened to readers as the Weston Library on 21 March 2015. Richard Ovenden (Bodley's Librarian) awarded the Bodley Medal to Professor Stephen Hawking and Sir David Attenborough as part of the official opening ceremony.\nThe transformed library has been generally well-received, being described as a \"hey presto moment for the city\" by The Independent newspaper.In July 2016, the building was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize for excellence in architecture.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nBodleian Library\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

Broad Walk is at the northern edge with Merton Field to the north and Merton College, dominated by the tower of Merton College Chapel, beyond that. \n\nChrist Church Meadow is owned by Christ Church, and is thus the private property of the college, however access is allowed during the day. Access starts very early to allow rowers to go to the boathouses. Eights Week and Torpids, Oxford University's two main rowing events, and Christ Church Regatta are held on the Thames here. In past times, ornamental wooden barges were moored on the river here to store boats and house spectators. However these have all now been replaced by boathouses.\nThe meadow can be accessed from St Aldate's to the northwest via Broad Walk through the Christ Church War Memorial Garden, from the north in Merton Street via Grove Walk and Merton Walk, and from the eastern end of the High Street via Rose Lane near the Oxford Botanic Garden to the northeast. There is also lesser used access from near the Head of the River public house by Folly Bridge on the River Thames to the southwest, connecting to Poplar Walk (created by Henry Liddell in 1872) and the path by the river. All entrances are via railinged gates that are locked at night.\nJames Sadler made the first ascent in a balloon by an Englishman from the Meadow on 4 October 1784. The balloon rose to a height of around 3,600 feet and landed six miles away near the village of Wood Eaton near Islip to the north-east of Oxford. A plaque notes the event. The Meadow was also the location where the medieval royal pretender, John Deydras, claimed to have been persuaded by the devil to impersonate Edward II in 1318.Postwar development planned for central Oxford included a relief road passing through the meadow and joining the district of St Ebbe's. The proposal was finally defeated in 1971 after vigorous opposition.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nE.G.W.

          "I missed touring Christ Church College, but ambled around the meadow -- maybe a mile and a half. I met the cows with big horns and was rewarded with views of the college across the meadow. Part of the path travels along the Cherwell (ducks, punts, etc.) You may encounter brainy",
          "If the weather is good and you enjoy a good walk, this is the one to do. The path follows the river and you can see the towers of Christ Church across the fields and herds of cattle. The flowers were also blooming beautifully!",

          "The meadow and Christ Church itself is full of bus loads of international students in summer. Their interest, unsurprisingly, is more in themselves than in any sight seeing they are supposed to be doing. Be warned!",

          "We wandered around the meadow rather than visit the college as the entry fee to the latter of \u00a38 seemed a bit exorbitant. A pleasant break from the very busy city centre, but probably not at its best in May? Perhaps it will have come into its own when we return for a free tour",
          "As part of a walking tour either one you organize yourself or hire it done and as part of a larger tour its very good. Wife and I had the advantage of having a friend getting her PHD there in Oxford town, so we had tours with her, shortcuts, and suggestions as to restaurants.",

        "wiki": "The Pitt Rivers Museum is a museum displaying the archaeological and anthropological collections of the University of Oxford in England. The museum is located to the east of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, and can only be accessed through that building.\nThe museum was founded in 1884 by Augustus Pitt Rivers who donated his private collection to the University of Oxford with the condition that a permanent lecturer in anthropology must be appointed. Museum staff are involved in teaching Archaeology and Anthropology at the University even today. The first Curator of the museum was Henry Balfour.  A second stipulation in the Deed of Gift was that a building should be provided to house the collection and used for no other purpose. The University therefore engaged Thomas Manly Deane, son of Thomas Newenham Deane who, together with Benjamin Woodward, had designed and built the original Oxford University Museum of Natural History building three decades earlier, to create an adjoining building at the rear of the main building to house the collection. Construction started in 1885 and was completed in 1886.\nThe original donation consisted of approximately 22,000 items; this has now grown to 500,000 items, many of which have been donated by travellers, scholars and missionaries.\nOn March 17, 2020, the museum shut indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Organization ==\n\nThe museum's collection is arranged typologically, according to how the objects were used, rather than according to their age or origin. This layout owes a lot to the theories of Pitt Rivers himself, who intended for his collection to show progression in design and evolution in human culture from the simple to the complex. Whilst this evolutionary approach to material culture is no longer fashionable in archaeology and anthropology, the museum has retained the original organisation of the displays.  The display of many examples of a particular type of tool or artifact, showing historical and regional variations, is an unusual and distinct feature of this museum.\nThe museum has a high density of objects on display, and the displays are changed periodically.\nAt 11.36m high the Haida totem pole is the largest object on display in the museum. From a Haida community, it originally stood outside Star House in the village of Old Massett (Haida name Uttewas), on Graham Island, in British Columbia, Canada. The house was built around 1882 and belonged to chief Anetlas (c.1816\u20131893). The pole came to the Pitt Rivers Museum in 1901.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Expansion ==\nIn 2004, the museum received \u00a33,700,000 from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to build a research annex adjoining the museum. Building work was completed in 2007, bringing the academic staff of the museum back to the site, and providing a laboratory for conservation of the specimens. The annex will not affect the Victorian displays of the museum.\nThe second phase of development began on 7 July 2008 necessitating the closure of the museum and galleries.  The museum reopened on 1 May 2009. In this work, the 1960s exhibition gallery was dismantled, restoring the original view through to the museum's totem pole. Original display cases were returned to their original place at the front of the museum. The space upstairs vacated by these cases provides additional space for a Clore Duffield Education Centre. A new entrance platform allows visitors to enter on the same level as the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and improves access for wheelchair users and parents with pushchairs. The entrance platform provides re-located shop and reception areas. An environmental control system has also been installed.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe Pitt Rivers Museum, along with the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, won The Guardian newspaper's award for Family Friendly Museum of 2005.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nLike many museums, the Pitt Rivers has struggled with the origins of many of the items in its collection.  The museum is working on \"cultural decolonisation,\" such as meeting with originating communities to address errors and gaps in the information it stores, and to discuss repatriation.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAugustus Pitt Rivers\nAnthropology\nMuseums of the University of Oxford\nOxford\nOxford University, of which the museum is a department\nAshmolean Museum\nOxford University Museum of Natural History\nMuseum of the History of Science, Oxford\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBaumgarten, Lothar.

          "A stunning museum set within the Museum of Natural History (which is impressive enough in itself). There are numerous cased items which look very impressive on arrival. We only had a short time in Oxford and didn`t really have time to do it justice - there is so much to see",
          "I had for some time wanted to visit the Pitt Rivers Museum not really knowing what to expect, it is certainly interesting with its vary varied collections, i did find it a bit of a jumble, not the easiest museum to find your way round, i am glad i did it as part of a visit to",
          "This was a very interesting museum, even though it was hard to move around because of the narrow isles and so many people. Worth of visiting though",
          "Really liked this quirky museum full of artefacts to showcase different cultures. Would have loved to explore more but was tired after a long day. If I go back to Oxford I\u2019ll certainly be back to spend longer here. The only bit of feedback I\u2019d give is that we happened to arrive",
          "This place is stunning . The amount of stuff on display is incredible. You can't fail to find something interesting. The building itself is a work of art. You will need more than one visit.",
          "The Museum is excellent and contains an enormous amount of artifacts in the space provided. Plan on at least full day to take it slow and try not to miss any of the items crammed into every space available.",
          "I\u2019ve lived in this city a decade and this is still my favourite museum to visit. Simply excellent, so much to see!",
          "My favourite museum. A unique place with such interesting exhibits - you see something different every time you visit!",
          "A very interesting place to visit-lots of fascinating exhibits to look at and enjoy (including the famous shrunken heads!). A quirky and off beat museum with something for everybody. However, the signage to the pitt rivers entrance is poor. The entrance lies at the back of the",
          "We only explored the ground floor. So very much to see and enjoy, admire or frankly cringe at. Highlights for me were the musical instruments and the American exhibits. Most fun was the hands-on table with an amazing expert allowing us to play with seven very varied",
          "Came here with my sister and Mum, just looking for something to do before our trip ended. We were in awe when we arrived, the building alone was beautiful. As we walked in we couldn\u2019t believe what a cool place it was! There was no way we could do it all properly in a day and had",
          "This is possibly one of the best and most informers and compact museums I have ever been to! You actually start in the natural history museum and then walk through to the Pitt River museum. Which had 3 levels and thousands of artefacts covering numerous regions in the world",
          "We called here again because there is so much stuff to take in. I actually missed a whole floor at the last visit. If you come to Oxford it goes without saying, visit here, put it in the top 5 things to do.",
          "I went there with my wheelchair-bound Dad, husband and teenaged kids and it was a gold plated review from every member of the party. We all enjoyed the way the artefacts are displayed thematically and the Victorian sense of the place. One of the party really enjoyed the Noh",
          "Incredible museum, filled to the brim with all sorts of quirky things from around the world. You could spend hours in here!",
          "We are one man with his wheelchair couple You have side entrance for wheelchairs and pushchairs it\u2019s signed it\u2019s some kind of back entrance bit confusing but we got there. We came for Pitt rivers that is a wonderful collection of everything and more You could spent days in",
          "On a wet half term Wednesday, my two kids and I loved this place, it was an absolute treasure trove of items from across the globe from outfits, charms, model ships and masks to clay pots, devotional and Egyptian antiquities and curiosties. Well worth a visit as it is attached",
          "So oddly fascinating, not for the faint hearted, definitely for the curious and quirky. Very interesting and could easily lose a whole day here, and actually get lost on the way round",
          "An amazing place to wander around, so many items from history from across the globe. Fantastic. One staff member had the bulldog chewing a wasp look about them but the others were great, helpful and engaging. The exhibits are so varied it\u2019d peak the interest of all age",
          "Free entry \ud83d\ude42 to an absolutely brilliant museum.Any family with children into dinosaurs, it's a must.Dinosaur bones,full skeletons,big section on insects, stuffed birds interesting but \ud83d\ude12the actual building is stunning, could have wandered round for days.",
          "I loved visiting this place...I love the way that all the artefacts are crammed together by theme, and it's so colourful and all about exploring. I picked up one of the treasure hunt pages for kids and me and my mother really enjoyed doing it! It meant our visit had some",
          "The Pitt Rivers is a must-see in Oxford. It is one of the most unusual museums you will ever visit, snuggled in the back corner o f the Natural History Museum (which is also very good!). Together, you could easily entertain your children for several hours on a rainy day quite",
          "The collections are arranged by type, rather than geography, in order to demonstrate and encourage cross-cultural comparisons. As with the adjoining Museum of Natural History, there is far too much to take in on one visit, so I recommend selecting just a couple of galleries and",
          "One of the best places to visit in Oxford. Jam packed with items from all over the world. I was taken back in time on my visit. There is so much to see. I especially liked the SE Asian display cabinets. Facilities are good too. I highly recommended visiting this jem in oxford.",
          "To wish that this amazing collection were better ordered and laid out with more space, big informative placards and bright lights is, very sadly, to miss the point, the pleasure and the purpose of this wonderful, endlessly fascinating collection of things that human beings make",
          "I've visited most major History / Natural History museums across the UK, but this one is my favourite. Unlike the big museums of London, Oxford is smaller but not any less educational. Its beautifully laid out and all in all a fantastic place to visit.",
          "There was a lot of recommendations to see this place before I left Oxford. I was not impressed as it felt like I was looking at random collections that were in no particular order. To make matters worse they keep the lights dim. This makes reading the history and descriptions of",
          "What a surprise! This place is packed with fascinating artifacts from all over the world. You will need several hours to get through it all, but really quite interesting.",
          "No surprise that this listed for museum of the year. Attached to the Natural History museum. Rather dark but has densely packed cabinets of remarkable and thought provoking artefacts from all ages and cultures. Too much to list, too much to see in a single visit",
          "This is one of my favourite places to visit, before you even walk in you are met with incredible architect of Gothic Influence. Walking in always makes me gasp, the wonderful high ceiling, pillars of ornate stone and iron and the amassing roof line. NOT to mention being",
          "We spent a few days in Oxford (Thursday 25th \u2013 Monday 29th April) and visited the Pitts River museum on Friday 26th April. Rather a confusing situation, the museum is adjacent to and is accessed through the Natural History museum. Quite an incredible display of all sorts of",
          "We went as four adults and 6 children. The children were under 4 and didn't show great interest in the items.",
          "This place is wonderfully \"Oxford\". Hidden away at the back of the Natural Museum, it has lots of ethnological exhibits. Nothing interactive or computerised, you wonder around the displays, exhibited behind glass, you read the labels - and it is all wonderfully captivating. A",
          "We were told about the Pitt Rivers museum by a couple of young students my wife and I got talking to in a pub. We were so glad we took their recommendation as it was fascinating. You get to the museum via The Museum of Natural History, it's a door at the back of the main museum.",
          "I loved this place. If you've been to the Horniman museum in London, it's similar in that it's a collection of different wonders from around the world. There's loads of stuff at ceiling level so don't forget to look up...I could have spent hours here if I hadn't arranged a timed",
          "Omg, don't about the place but I took some great pics! The light was a little bit dark tho, but I recommend it ;)",
          "i loved all the information given to me about all these different collections. the guides were useful in telling me a lot about each and every piece.",
          "A lovely museum connected to the History Museum. Very interesting and informative. A good few hours can be spent here. A good place to go if weather is bad. Staff very knowledgeable and eager to talk to you.",
          "I simply loving visiting The Pitt Rivers museum and feel enormously privileged to live so close to this amazing museum. It is a treasure trove of fascinating artefacts that never gets boring no matter how many times you visit. Don't visit Oxford without a stop off here.",
          "We didnt have much time but the museum is great to roam around and discover strange objects. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This museum is wacky, weird and absolutely wonderful! So many hidden treasures for adults and children alike. It's hard to describe but you have to see it! Highly recommend.",
          "Fab fun for all the family. So interesting. The shrunken heads are a real pull for interested children haha",
          "Absolute gem of a place. Best museum visited. Feel like I\u2019ve been around the world! Very helpful gentleman who guided us to the grass hat!",
          "A really interesting collection of fascinating (and weird!) objects from all over the world, helping to explain the history of human civilisation. A nice old school feel to it, you can really feel the history of the museum as you walk around. As a result it's quite a",
          "Went with my son who is in the anthropology business and fascinated. We were too. You just wander round gazing at new, weird, curious, illuminating and extraordinary examples of what humans do and make. Allow plenty of time.",
          "So many interesting things stuffed into the display cases, you could spend the whole day wandering around here! Absolutely the best place I visited in Oxford. Staff were nice and friendly too. Definitely recommend!",
          "Good large room full of strange and interesting items. Worth a wander around while in Oxford. Better for older kids and adults.",
          "Discovered by chance, brilliant museum free entry(donation advisable), several floors of world artefacts through the ages. Excellent to see many artefacts that you may have only seen in books or tv. Well worth a visit if you're in Oxford",
          "Oh just go, you will be amazed, confusing and intriguing in equal measure and you have to avoid dinosaurs to get in!",
          "A family visit to Oxford wouldn\u2019t be complete without a trip to the Pitt Rivers and nature history museum. Plenty to see and do there.",
          "What a fantastic museum, so much to look at, left, right and above the glass cases are jam packed with curious from around the world. Free entry through the natural history museum.",
          "Called in here to pass a few hours before going home. There are so many artifacts and interesting information, we just did not have the time to take it all in. Great for children as there are lots of interactive things for then to do. Well worth a visit, and as it has free",
          "Very nice time! Was quite full as it was easters break, I assume. However, really nice time! We will be back to see next part of the musem as we had time only for one half...",
          "I love the Pitt Rivers museum - I'm an Oxford local and go all the time. It's a wonderful, eclectic, strange mix of historical bits and bobs. Weapons, armour, tools, clothes, instruments, boats, cooking utensils, and of course the famous shrunken heads. From all over the world.",
          "I love this place so much that I almost hesitate to share it with anyone else! The Pitt Rivers is a little off the beaten path but should be everyone's \"must see\" list in Oxford. A single large room with two galleries holding further collections, it could be walked round in an",

          "Well curated, interesting, diverse collection covering human design in everything from tattoos and textiles to weaponry and clothes",
          "Massive collection, somewhat randomly displayed, but an amazing experience of a collector of his period. Suggest not for children although access is through Natural History museum and that is great for younger visitors.",
          "Well worth the visit - we were there a couple of hours and could easily have spent a day! A huge variety of artefacts ranging, by theme, from mundane to intriguing.",
          "I was rather surprised as to the amount of really interesting exhibits this rather small museum had to offer. It is free entry, and definetly worth a donation to support this little treasure. A perfect way to pass the time on a rainy day in Oxford.",
          "If you are in Oxford and have time make sure to keep a couple of hours to visit Pitt Rivers it is full of amazing things to see.",
          "Wear some comfy shoes because you will be here for a while!! There is ALOT to see and take in. So many interesting pieces to look at, just when you think you have finished looking at one section, you will realise that there are more objects under the cabinet you have been",
          "Fabulous exhibition. Took several hours to take it all in. People were quiet and respectful of each other. A very pleasant experience all round.",
          "I pretty much only came to the UK this trip to see Pitt Rivers Museum, having studied it as part of my post grad degree at uni. It did not disappoint, though in some ways it was quite different to how I imagined it would be. The collection is incredible, and the displays",
          "If your visiting oxford I would definitely recommend, it's free attached to the natural history museum!",
          "The Pitt-Rivers holds so much much amazing stuff but it can be hard to understand what you're really looking and get the story behind it. The shrunken heads are amazing though and a must see for any visitor!",
          "I absolutely love the Pitt Rivers, which for me is the best museum anywhere. Full of weird eclectic collections, you just never get bored wanfdering around, And it's free!",
          "The Pitts River is so different as you will see the moment you walk in from the National History Museum. It's got a completely different atmosphere. I recommend starting at the top floor 3 and working your way down. Thay so many items on display and just look above and below",
          "We struggled to find much of interest in this museum. We found the Egyptian mummy section quite fascinating but there wasn't much else that really gripped us. It almost felt like we was in some sort of junk antique shop or a hoarders house lol. I can appreciate not everyone",
          "I would have given the venue more but I found it all very dimly lit. It\u2019s a fascinating blend of real and unreal exhibits. Curios from across the world. Fun and educational. Great for all ages.",
          "Wow!! Fantastic museum, so much to see. Thoroughly enjoyed, great for children, lots of families there.",
          "Went with my friend and her children we ranged in age from 8 to 18 and everyone had fun and found some weird stuff to like and look at. Staff were nice too and you can touch stuff",
          "The museum is accessed through the Natural History Museum and focuses on Ethnology, Anthropology etc. It is a truly eclectic mix of items and whilst not really suitable for young children it is absolutely fascinating.",
          "Love this place, my Son first introduced us to it. So many beyond the ordinary exhibits with interesting descriptions of what you are looking at. Not too big either you can do it justice in one visit but you will want to go back as there is always some thing you will have",
          "A relatively small space, especially compared to the main Natural History Museum, but there is an awful lot packed in. Items are arranged by type rather than by age or source, which I found quite interesting. The dark room can get a bit oppressive, but I would definitely",
          "Absolutely fascinating. Prepare to spend a few hours there. Lots of absolutely unique exhibits, such as the shrunken heads from South America. Will definitely visit again",
          "There is so much to see you have to return again and again as we did it is almost two museums in one so take your time and return to finish",
          "This is by far the best museam in oxford for a group with mixed interests. The exhibits are so varied you are bound to find somthing to intrigue you. I've lived in oxford for 20 years and never get bored of coming here.",
          "We have never been here before, so we visited while we were in Oxford with friends. Entry is free (charity donation recommended) to this fascinating place. Lots to see here, and the museum is split into two seperate places once inside - make sure you see both. Very unusual",
          "Considering this museum is meant to be an 'open house' museum and there are meant to be friendly staff members we certainly were NOT greeted by any. The woman at the desk asked us if we had booked to which our college tutor obviously replied yes because we had. They had no",
          "Oh, to live closer and be able to visit this unique collection more times... for one visit is not nearly enough to absorb or even properly appreciate all in this huge collection of archeology, anthropology and natural history and other artifacts.",
          "I\u2019ve seen this place on the television numerous times and too actually see it with my own eyes amazed me. It\u2019s at the back of the Natural History Museum and it\u2019s free of charge but it kindly asks for any donations for the upkeep of the museum. There\u2019s three floors of interesting",
          "Very unique museum with an amazing layout. Items are grouped by type instead of by era or geography which gives a truely unique feel. So much to look at, must do on any Oxford trip.",
          "This museum is connected to the natural history museum, you literally walk through from one to the other. They have a fantastic collection of artefacts but there is so much to look at it is hard to take it all in as it is all very closely displayed. I found it a bit",
          "Interesting and enjoyable visit, although found the exhibits a little cluttered. As the museum was busy and displays were so close together, had to miss some areas out due to viewing demand.",
          "This is one of those museums where if they don't have it, it probably doesn't exist. If anything, it's overstocked and there certainly isn't too much space to move around, but every corner turned leads to a new eye-opening sight. I'd go again tomorrow if I could.",
          "Its next to museum of natural history oxford . Amazing how they put the stuffs and show them:) but becarefull u gonna see some doll's head hehehe . Im asian , and feel amazing how they collect buddhist.",
          "Overwhelming, but in a good way. An important collection, that covers most cultures and traditions. Tribal artifacts, shrunken heads, weapons, etc So much to see and it is free. Just amazing.",
          "Perfect day out with the family, just remember there is two museum in one building. Natural History museum and Pitt river.",
          "So much to see and the children love both museums especially the dinosaurs and all the wired animals and fossils-so much to see! Our only gripe was the cafe isn\u2019t big enough for the amount of tourists! We had to go elsewhere but that\u2019s a shame as we could\u2019ve spent many more",
          "Have been here many times but keep returning. The collections are amazing - quirky and interesting. You could spend hours here. Really worth a visit if you are in Oxford.",
          "Large museum, great collection. We spent about 2.5 hours in the museum and that was not enough! Definitely want to go there again. The museum is free accessible, but worth a donation!",
          "You enter the Pitt Rivers Museum by going through the University's Natural History Museum which is across the road from the rather splendid Victorian brick Keble College. Both museums are worth a visit if only to see their magnificent Victorian iron roofs, as I do with visiting",
          "I can get lost in this museum. I have been a few times and enjoy every minute. There is so much to see and the interest imof the place keeps me exploring and coming back. A must see in a trip to Oxford.",
          "This place is amazing and a must see. Didn\u2019t spend a long time in these but will on my next return. So much interesting artefacts on display, although seems a little cramped in having so many things to display it is a fascinating place. My highlight is the shrunken heads on",
          "Absolutely packed full with history. The staff are very friendly and welcoming and everything is is Victorian casing which really adds to the beauty of the museum. Worth a visit. And it\u2019s free!",
          "Great place to go when the weather is bad. Lots of interesting things to see. Massive totem poles and shrunken heads.",
          "V i P Excellent Pitt Rivers Museum thanks one of my new friends in UK who work in Kuwait who told me about it the Museum is free of charge with donation option its very nice one full of exhibits marvelous fantastic well organized recommended strongly",
          "Popped in just to tick it off to be honest but was quite uplifted to see such excellent use being made of some quite 'dated' exhibit styles... Loved the engagement for young children able to touch the bears and other exhibits to truly make a tactile and interactive museum",
          "Fascinating exhibits and very helpful staff. They do run various exhibits and activities especially for kids. My son and I loved it equally and cannot wait to get back.",
          "The museum is great for children and is packed with artifacts from around the world. they have a section o weapons knives and guns etc which made me nervous did not like that bit but reaaly enjoyed looking at the clothing from around the world and the building itself.",
          "Visited with a few friends in January. Unlike them, it was my first time. It's difficult to describe, as the exhibits are both varied and unusual. The place is packed with exhibits, almost as if they have outgrown the premises, which is accessed from the Museum of Natural",
          "We were visiting Oxford for a quiet weekend without the kids. Great for a few hours when you can view at leisure. Fascinating cabinets with all sorts in them. The natural history museum and pittrivers are linked and accessed by the same entrance with the Pittrivers accessed from",
          "This place is amazing! So much to see! We took my 10year old daughter and she loved it. The university students and staff were fantastic, at three separate times when my daughter expressed interest in objects, they were really enthusiastic about the topics and happy to chat to",
          "Lots of really interesting areas, especially the evolution part showing dinosaurs through to homosapiens. The t-Rez stan is amazing",
          "I love visiting this museum and find new objects on each visit. It is top of our list to take visitors to when they come.",
          "If you like Ancient times and like History this is the place to go. There is so much to see you woul not believe how Amazing this Museum is and how many years History there is to See. There is so much Humbling Surprise's to see as well. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "My mate and I always meet up once a month and this time it was Pitt Rivers. I have to tell you this place is stunning. There are so many exhibits to see and is absolutely interesting. You need several hours to go round and take your time to take it all in.A great place to take",
          "It was almost overwhelming, the many and varied exhibits. Different cultures represented, implements from days gone by, again covering a vast range of cultures and times; a definite must see venue, but leave plenty of time, we would have had a tour had we had the time. To be",
          "Visited here for the first time - and wow! The natural history part of this museum is full of interesting animals and hands on activities, great for children! The Pitt Rivers Museum part was jaw-dropping and you just didn't know where to look first! What a truly amazing",
          "An outstanding museum which we visit regularly and visit a different section each time we visit. The animal skeletons, ranging from pigs, to elephants and then to T rex\u2019s give children a real experience which helps learning. There are bees, insects, geology and so many different",
          "Free entry and a really great museum. You could spend hours here if you like lots of random/ unique collections. 3 floors of quirky items. Very enjoyable and will go back as didn\u2019t take it all in.",
          "This has got to be the most varied and bonkers collection of things ever assembled in a museum. It has something for everyone. If you have kids they will love it. Well worth the visit, its free but do make a donation please.",
          "Can recommend it to everyone who likes exploring! I could have spent a lot more time there. A huge collection of random artefacts, some creepy, some not, but definitely worth discovering.",
          "This was definitely interesting & creepy for me all at the same time. So many things to see, the shrunken heads was horrible. The lighting was very dim as well which added to the creepy atmosphere. It\u2019s a good day out & free entry, you can leave a donation in the entrance if you",
          "This was a great place to visit with my grandson. He found it very interesting with lots to see and to discover. It is very well organised with artefacts from all over the world but you do not feel cramped.",
          "Although the light is quite low there's so much to see and enjoy, a place to come back over and over again",
          "In Oxford for the day to attend a football match, I took the chance to spend the morning in one of our favourite Museums. We have visited on a number of occasions over the years and it has never failed to enthrall. The way it is set out with displays grouped round certain",
          "Excellent that the museum has remained the 'old way' -cabinet after cabinet of jam packed collections, a real sensory overload at times! I think it's great that the original tiny handwritten labels are on pieces. Its neck craning,slightly dim and you squeeze past the displays.",
          "I could spend days in this museum! Huge collection of the most random items from all around the world. It is situated right behind the natural history museum so it is convenient for the entertainment of both children and adults (I\u2019m sure kids will enjoy the dinosaurs and the",

          "If museums were kinds of coffee, the Pitt Rivers would be a double espresso. Imagine all the things peoples from around the world have devised to provide themselves with food, clothing, and security, then pack all the artifacts into cases with only enough room for tags (with",
          "General Pitt Rivers left Oxford university has amazing collection. Also the cabinets and tables from Victorian times he displayed them in. The Pitt Rivers Museum is also known as The University of Oxford\u2019s museum of anthropology and world archaeology. The museum was founded in",
          "This has to be the best museum we have every been too!!!!! There was so much to see and do. Kids were engaged from the moment we walked through the door. Normally the kids are done after an hour but here they wanted to keep going to every nook and corner to make sure they",
          "Another great trip to this museum with my little boy. We did a few of the treasure hunts round it and interacted with a number of the assistants around the museum who were happy to answer and enlighten my son after his huge number of wierd and wonderful questions. It doesn\u2019t",

          "This is a great museum to go to with kids. I visited today with my husband and it was full of little ones. It\u2019s very kid-friendly and there is a lot to see for adults as well. A great natural history museum in the heart of Oxford but for one caveat: it\u2019s ridiculously cramped",
          "Interesting and diversified range of exhibits from around the world and from different cultures. Probably a tad too packed in to make it a comfortable visit.",
          "This is how museums should be; inspirational & thought provoking. There are so many diverse things to see; something for everyone. Mike and his colleagues were helpful and incredibly knowledgeable, making our visit all the more special. We\u2019ll be back.",
          "One of the best museums I've visited in the UK. Not very large but you can easily spend a couple of hours or more there as there is a large collection of various objects covering a variety of countries and time periods gathered in this place. I absolutely loved it!",
          "Such an amazing space for some amazing artefacts! We spent over an hour looking at all the displays and the Bacteria display! Easy for youngsters to take it in. The cafe was expensive but had all we needed. Would go again.",
          "This is the greatest collection of (stolen) stuff ever! Go see it at night when they have the torch lit explorations!",
          "Great museum where you can easily spend many hours just discovering new and exciting things. Visit even if it is not a rainy day, entrance free",
          "Great exhibits that were entertaining for the children that we could see (we visited as a couple). Lots of skeletal remains - dinosaurs, human and more. Recommended for a visit",
          "Sorry but a very similar review to the other museums in oxford I went to: collection to be absurdly good, cleanness great, access good and toilets very very good and of what little contact I had with staff was also excellent.",
          "What an amazing place. Tucked away out the back of the natural history museum is this treasure trove. An amazing amount of artefact crammed into the museum. I would have preferred a little more information on what's on show as the descriptions are sparse. The collections are",
          "So much to read! Amazing place, quite dark but make sure you have time to take everything in. Check out the photography exhibition round the corner where the toilets are (always amazing work)",
          "Museums not to be missed plenty to see, allow plenty of time for visit, and lovely cafe. The build is lovely and every thing laid out very well, and plenty of information for you to read",
          "This is a truly fascinating place of collections and investigations. Every cabinet warranted careful inspection. Fascinated by its History and its Science. Wheelchair accible with help.",
          "Fascinating and quirky museum full of ancient artefacts and Dickensian like displays making it very atmospheric. The day we visited there was an opportunity to handle and discuss objects with one of the museum staff, amazingly I identified 5 of the 6 objects - the item made from",
          "It's free and easily seen in a few hours. Really good for kids. Lots of taxidermy, rocks, and even a Dodo bird!",
          "A traveling collector's paradise. Easily hundreds of thousands of items, each with a story - some artsy, some whimsical, some serious, and some horrific (just ask any 12 year old boy or girl there to give you a tour of the most interesting bits).",
          "My family and I visited Pitt Rivers Museum for the first time during a day out in Oxford last month and absolutely loved it! It\u2019s quite unlike any museum I\u2019ve ever been to before, beautiful, original and fascinating exhibits, I can\u2019t wait to go back and spend more time there.",
          "From the shrunken heads to the totem poles, carved masks to canoes, models to instruments. There is so much culture and history to see in this fabulous museum. There are lifts to go with the floors of exhibits, though be ready for the dim lighting - in place to preserve these",
          "A really interesting place to visit with lots of specimens and artefacts to view. It has activities for kids but also interesting to view as two adults as well Entrance is free but there are donation boxes so bring some cash for that.",
          "The atrium ceiling alone is reason enough to visit. Absolutely stunning. The exhibits on the ground floor are superbly curated. The anthropology exhibits require Indigenous direction, they're curated with a typically archaic colonial viewpoint that doesn't do the origins of",
          "The Pitt Rivers will hold everyone whatever their age enthralled at the range and variety of this fabulous collection of fossils (dinosaurs), insects, clothing, weaponry, ancient artifacts from around the world, to mention but a few. My 4 year old grandson loved it - spent 5",
          "Museum is great. Architecturally located in a stunning purpose built Victorian building. This museum is crammed full of items collected over the years of civilisation around the world and ages. Only downside is that the place is too crammed full and might be nice to spread out",
          "This is advertised as almost an add on to the Oxford Museum of Natural History, which it is... indeed you have to go through that museum to gain access to this one. So what you don't expect is almost a complete museum in itself. Very old fashioned, curiosity shop type feel to",
          "We visited as part of a walking tour & can't wait to go back & lose ourselves in the oddities & antiquities that make up this incredible museum. A great place to take kids as well. Allow some time as there is so much to see.",
          "This was my third visit to this amazing museum, and I have no doubt that I'll return whenever I'm in Oxford and have the time to spend. My advice is not to try and take it all in at one go, focus on something that catches your attention and really dig into it. I was looking at",
          "We ran in here to escape from a very rainy afternoon and it was such an interesting diversion. The museum is set up more like a mad scientists' storage closet or laboratory. You have to spend time reading the details in each case to really understand how significant the",
          "A nice place to visit . After a nice walk we ended up close to the specific museum. It was busy with kids and families. It was like a museum within a museum . Must visit",
          "To get to the Pitt Rivers, you go right through the Natural History Museum which is a mostly unreconstructed Victorian museum with glass cases and erected dinosaur bones and statues of male scientist in marble. In the summer, because they recently cleaned the glass roof, it is",
          "A museum designed for adults many years ago but is such fun and interest to all ages. Whatever is ones interest n history geography or people from around the world a great place to start",
          "I visited Pitt-Rivers joined with a visit to the Natural History Museum. Follow the arrows to find the entry or don't be afraid to ask because it will well worth it. After the big spaces and order of the Natural History Museum, you will feel yourself like Alice in Wonderland.",
          "I've never been to a museum that is so old fashioned, but in such a fascinating way. There is such a wide variety of items here and the order is unclear sometimes. There are things being displayed all over - in cabinets, drawers, on the wall, under cabinets - everywhere. We went",
          "Fascinating place - I've never seen a museum like it. Try to catch one of the guided tours if you can - it will help you make sense of what you are seeing",
          "Next to the Natural History Museum and close to central Oxford, about a 10 minute walk, this is a must see museum for anyone with time following visits to the major attractions. The exhibits are designed to give the visitor an insight into so many things from costumes to weapons",
          "Love this museum which has loads of interesting areas for all ages.You can spend hours here and is a favourite place for school trips.",
          "Wow wow wow!!! What an amazing place! We spent hours here looking at his amazung collection! Nevrr seen so many artefacts under one roof! Amazing!!!",
          "This is must see museum in Oxford. I am there at least twice a year! Always worth it. Amazing for couples and for families.",
          "Great little free museum, full of curios from around the globe! Entrance is at the far wall of the Natural History Museum (also worth a look around and a stoke of a brown bear!). We had a nightmare finding it as used iPhone maps to guide us on foot from the town centre, it sent",
          "Always something awesome to see. Advice: focus on an area of interest otherwise the three floors of stuff is overwhelming. Be sure to visit the gift shop in the natural history museum in the front. Beautiful hand painted ceramic mugs",
          "This is a place you need to visit time and time again, and every time you'll see something amongst the vast eclectic collection that you hadn't noticed before. Great for children and equally fascinating for adults.",
          "We didn\u2019t have enough time to do this fantastic museum justice but we were delighted to accompany our great nieces here, just as we had accompanied their mum many years before. It\u2019s a definite one not to be missed, along with the natural history museum. Great fun for kids, will",
          "Pit Rivers never ceases to surprise and delight. We visited it when I was a child when my children were growing up and now I look forward to bringing my Grandchildren. Adults and children alike can enjoy this little museum. It is packed with specimens of natural history and many",
          "It looked like a giant curiosity cabinet. Loads of items in each display case as they were labelled by region, not period or culture.Loads to look at",
          "Case after case display objects by form or function. A few examples include guns, swords, and other weapons; textiles and jewellery; religious objects, boat models, and toys. Children and adults will find interesting things. There\u2019s a shop and toilets. Lifts available. Staff",
          "So many strange and wonderful things with handwritten labels and old fashioned display cases. Thematic arrangement which is interesting. Don\u2019t miss the shrunken heads.",
          "A huge display of items from around the world, all housed in an equally impressive building. An absolute must on any itinerary.",
          "A wonderful experience while in Oxford. This free museum that is attached, perhaps connected with the Natural History Museum and is great for all ages. Very accessible.",
          "Such a fascinating place needing many visits. Every time we visit we see something new. An amazing range of exhibits including the famous Shrunken heads",
          "What a fun museum, hidden in the back of the equally fun natural history museum. General Pitt put together a great collection of the world's pot pourri. You can tour both museums for free (but do donate 5 GBP to keep the fun going). Everything from wooden sailing ships to",
          "Been here few times as my children have been growing up So many exhibits to see its mind blowing Very eclectic!",
          "So much to see. The first section - the Natural World is excellent fun for families. As we walked around it was lovely to see and hear parents and grandparents talking to and engaging the little ones. There are some terrific exhibits and plenty of information. The 'back' room",
          "On first entering the museum, it's an overwhelmingly crammed, floor to ceiling, apparently chaotic collection. But settle into it and it's brilliant. Often with no sense as to what's in the case next door. Where almost every other museum has reduced the items on show in",
          "Here is a wonderful carpet bag of excentric delights...everything is displayed with enthusiasm and joy!",
          "Transcultural (and not regional) approach is great. One can borrow a magnifying glass and a torch to read minuscule hand-written tags of descriptions of objects which are often hidden underneath or behind another object. Completely unbound to contemporary museological trends",
          "A museum like no other you will ever visit. I have visited a few times over rhe past 18 years and each time I see something new. A collection of diverse and fascinating \u2018things\u2019 - one man\u2019s curious and eccentric interests - since updated by thoughtful and respectful yet brave",
          "Crammed with \u201cstuff\u201d in a manner of yore. But for me it was the wonderful building - splendid Victorian architecture.",
          "Had a pleasant wander in the atmospheric gloom of this place full of items that the explorers of old would have brought back from the isolated lands. I was hoping they were fairly obtained and no sacred rules were broken as there were lots of ceremonial garments and offerings",
          "Tucked away at the rear of the Natural History Museum, This collection is unique in it's layout and style. You can wander around and find all sorts of things from every corner of the world from all sorts of cultures and historical periods. People have commented on the lack of",
          "a hidden gem. not just a fascinating museum of ethnography packed with thousands of extraordinary artifacts from around the world but also a museum of how museums used to be. the collections are organized not by culture but by theme - musical instruments, boats, weapons, etc -",
          "A bit too cluttered and the lighting not as good. But if you are interested in anthropology and civilization, this will be interesting.",
          "Wow, what a place! Make sure you leave yourself plenty of time to look around here. From tattoo guns to reindeer cheese, this place has it all. Fascinating and just enough information given. Please leave a donation as this place is free admission!",
          "The building layout itself is slightly cramp, however there is just so much to see. Millions of random objects that fascinate everyone. From modern day to ancient times. Clothing, to weapons. It's such a cabinet of curiosity. Well worth a visit.",
          "We really had no idea about this museum and were quite staggered by the quantity, variety and scope of the place. So much crammed into the space!! Interesting organisation of the displays in that they were grouped by type rather than ethnicity or place. Could have spent a lot",
          "What a great find - full of great interesting new objects in a truly beautiful building. Lots of objects to touch - fantastic for children and adults alike. Really brings things to life - I know it\u2019s free but please donate to keep it open - we spent 2 hours here but could",
          "Soooo much to see here you can\u2019t do it justice in one visit. Managed about 3hours before my husband and I had brain overload! Staff were always available to have an informative chat with. What a fantastic place! Intend to return to absorb more fabulous facts!",
          "We wanted to see this museum as we'd read about in a book about curiosities in England. Unfortunately we only had 45 minutes left before it closed at 4.30 (half hour earlier than the natural history museum itself. It's not a very large area but absolutely packed with items.",
          "Amazing place full of history and didn't cost a cent to get in. You must visit here if ever in Oxford. 5 minute walk from the centre of the city past lots of historic buildings. Also a mobile coffee shop on the front lawn which was a bonus.",
          "This is a wonderful place with every variety of items on display. It\u2019s very well done as there are a great number of articles but the displays make it easy to see all with ease. You enter through a hall from Nature History Museum if you like. Don\u2019t know if there is a separate",
          "Beautiful building, staff and exhibits. When we were there it was a special day for kids to touch the exhibits. Great!",
          "Really interesting, Send the kids to find the shrunken heads. easily spend an hour without getting board",
          "like someones attic - a beautiful atmospheric mess of artefacts from around the globe, good crowd, young, international",
          "If you\u2019ve ever wanted to feel like an archaeologist, just walk into the Pitts Rivers Museum. Make sure you allot a couple of hours to explore!",
          "A nice variety of things to view, the building itself was lovely, and a nice cafe. Would recommend off peak perhaps.",
          "It's jam-packed. Like seriously filled to the brim with so many interesting artefacts. Could have spent hours longer in there and probably still eouldnt have seen every single thing. Worth a visit!",
          "Well worth a visit. Incredibly interesting exhibits. Set in an architectural gem. Very helpful staff too.",
          "The architecture and layout of this building is stunning. Even though many of the exhibits were not of personal interest, it was worth the trip just to see the inside of this building. And it's free!",
          "This museum is packed with things made by humans from all parts of the planet over thousands of years. I found hours of fascination here.",
          "You'll be amazed upon entering the museum on the hundreds of glass cases filled with thousands of artifacts in this dimly lit museum, Which actually makes it that more special, you'll find weapons, toys, musical instruments and even the Harry Potter featured Shrunken Heads!",
          "After having been here on a school trip many years back I thought I would be nice to pop back in when I eventually returned to Oxford and it was just a good as I remembered it being with many weird and wonderful exhibits from all over the world. You have things from Asian",
          "We went as part of the History class to look at the difference between the Japanese and western armory in the 14 th century. But you can go and wonder for days and days looking at every article and read the history behind it. It organized in a way that you can also see the trade",
          "A slightly biased review in that I already knew of Pitt Rivers' collection and studied it as part of my degree, so I was so excited to go here. I read in an earlier review that it was a good idea to take a torch and they were right! I like reading all tiny hand-written labels",
          "We visited 4 adults and 2 kids (6&8). Very impressed with this off the beaten track. The kids loved the shrunken heads and the museum is absolutely packed with curiosities. Definitely we will be visiting again soon",
          "An eclectic collection of stuff, organised into things like fishing equipment, musical instruments, guns, jewellery, weaving etc. With each section having things from all over the world. Packed ground floor and two galleries. Quite dark in places but you can borrow a torch!",
          "Just the smell as you walk from the Natural History Museum awakens all the senses, it is everything you want in a museum and so much more.",
          "Special thanks to my UK friend, Raj who took me to this Omniscient oxford museum. There is no entry fee and modest dressing is required. Highly useful for school students and people interested in arts and history. Parking facility is possible infront of the museum. I'm",
          "Wonderful my niece and daughter thoroughly enjoyed it. They loved stroking the bear ! Great to have picnic at the front .....",
          "I love the Pitt Rivers museum. Walking in through the Natural History museum, you are initially quite shocked at the differences, but what appears as just a dimly lit room full of glass cabinets, is actually a treasure trove of ancient history. Boxes, shelves, cabinets, and even",
          "Really enjoyed walking around this museum in Oxford. Very interesting indeed and free of charge. Quite old fashioned as well, which added to the experience.",
          "If you like curiosities and ethnography, you will love this museum. It is full of the most interesting objects, crowded together with charming hand written labels. It has been cleverly curated, grouping objects together mostly by type rather than by region or date. It includes",
          "Have been many, many times now and it never fails to deliver. I see something new each time. The netsuke collection is incredible. Highly recommended",
          "This place is super quirky, but so much fun! In Victorian and Edwardian times, aristocratic rich guys with nothing better to do used to travel the world, bringing home all kinds of oddities and interesting things they'd never seen before. I guess after a while no one knew what",
          "With wonderful little \"scavenger hunt\" style worksheets, this was a great place to explore with school-aged kids. There are many fascinating, curious pieces in the collections.",
          "There are just so many things to see in this museum despite its size. It can take you the whole day to really see everything. I especially love the exhibits on skeletons and shrink heads, awesome!",
          "An eclectic collection of artefacts, from shrunken heads to the history of tattooing. Lots of items, with information to pull things together.",
          "We knew it was connected to the natural history museum so was ideal to visit both. With all of the different levels and showcases make sure you allow yourself a couple of hours at least to look around, there is a lot of interesting items to see from shrunken heads, different",
          "The Museum of Natural History building and internal courtyard are magnificent. The layout of the exhibits reminds one that once upon a time all good museums displayed their collections, rather than purveyed the theatrical gimmickry found in many large museums. The Pitt Rivers",
          "Nice museum with lots of archaeological artifacts, evolutionary info, stuffed animals, dinosaurs. Something for everyone. Good way to spend a morning.",
          "This museum has everything for all ages. There are stuffed animals including the famous Oxford dodo. Downstairs, there are historical artefacts.",
          "This room is just a boastful and disrespectful display of stolen artefacts from imperial Britain, in showcases, badly arranged like a bric-a-brac shop, and with no meaning or purpose - not education, not nothing - just showing people, look how many unusual items I have collected",
          "We popped in just before this place closed and were blown away by everything on show. It really was like being in a movie of Indiana Jones. All of the artefacts are incredible. We will 100% go back and take a better look around.",
          "I am a fine art student and visited this on the recommendation of my tutor and it didn't disappoint. It was a 'step back in time' with regards to the displays - lots of dark wood and glass cabinets and items from many different cultures. There appeared to be the original",
          "So much to see in architecturally interesting building. The shrunken heads in a must!. Time was short for us so need to go back!",
          "We knew it was close by to the natural history museum but We didn\u2019t expect it to be inside the same building. Make sure you allow yourself a couple of hours at least to look around, theres a lot of interesting items to see. Weapons, masks, real shrunken heads as punishment and",
          "Took the husband to show him what has always been my favourite museum. We both loved it (especially the shrunken heads)!",
          "We went there kinda not expecting much, but there\u2019s actually so much to see, that we spent more time than we planned. It\u2019s busy but it\u2019s not chaotic. It\u2019s a global museum with collections of masks and other stuff from all over the world. It\u2019s very well organised. It looks small",
          "I regret to say I\u2019d never seen this museum before. It is so full of amazing things that it is hard to know where to start. One could easily spend a day here. We spent about 4 hours and then went into the science museum- also good but not in the same league. So very many",
          "As a former archaeology student at a world\u2019s top archaeology program, I found this museum disrespectful of different culture and it felt more like a display of racist imperialist attitude of the founders. I\u2019m sure British people wouldn\u2019t like it if they see their ancestors",
          "Night at the Museum on steroids!! ATMOSPHERE! ATMOSPHERE! ATMOSPHERE! I stood at the stop of the stairs in awe of what my eyes saw. Just stop, take it all in and then go explore. OMG!! AMAZING is a real understatement. I am 53 and I was blown away by this place, I felt like a",
          "We spent an hour visiting the Pitt Rivers Museum and all enjoyed our visit. The museum does have a huge amount of exhibits too many for me, you could spend hours and hours in there. I visited with my 10 and 5 year old and they both enjoyed working through the children's work",
          "This is an amazing building housing a great collection which is well laid out. Although we don't have young children now, I particularly liked the facilities to engage children in learning and understanding. No entry fee, donations requested",
          "Very interesting, lots of odd but interesting artefacts, if you\u2019ve got few hours to spare defiantly well worth the visit. But bewarnd the shrunken heads are gruesome ;0",
          "My second visit and I\u2019ve still not explored all it has to offer. Great to see so many children enjoying it and having staff encourage them to learn more. A must for visitors to Oxford",
          "What an amazing place to have a drinks party - to be able to sip champagne whilst looking at the amazing exhibits is a real honour. The Dodo exhibit is my favourite but the dinosaur was the most photographed The largest natural history museum outside of London A must visit -",
          "Absolutely fascinating exhibitions - really cool atmosphere in the building too. We saw shrunken heads, boats, ancient jewellery, ancient weaponry and armour (a vest made of stingray skin!!!) absolute museum of wonders !",
          "Hadn't planned on going to the museum, but the weather turned fir the worse, so we ended up at the museum. Wow. ! What a surprise, . As soon as you enter your presented with a fantastic display of dinosaur artifacts. Would be impossible in this review to list the number, and",
          "Awesome place with the most enthusiastic staff - highly recommend especially with young children. Cannot wait to return",
          "It's all about culture! Collection covers a very broad range, and objects are piled in glass cases. Unlike other museums, it has an old-fashioned (almost Victorian) vibe, and you might even find something that no one noticed before!",
          "I was amazed by the variety and beauty of the museum displays. Loved the natural history displays, especially dinosaur skeletons, fossils and crystals. We only saw a smallish section but we will definitely be back! Nice cafe too :)",
          "Fascinating way to spend a couple of hours. From clothing to body manipulation such as reshaping skulls and binding feet. So much to see and blow your mind. It\u2019s housed inside the natural sciences museum so a visit to both can take 4 or 5 hours. There is also a healthy pop up",
          "I am not a museum person but the the Pitt Rivers Museum and the museum in front of it are packed with things truly worth seeing. Beautiful in every way.",
          "at the back of the natural history museum lies this wee cavern of treasures - it is crowded with artefacts, from a (covetable) innuit hoody to the infamous shrunken heads. not suitable for the very young - ideal for taking museum-reluctant teens to.",
          "There is tons of things to see in the museum and could spend hours in there looking at different this from around the world.",
          "We were in the Natural History museum so decided to visit this too as you can only access it from the Natural History Museum. It is phenomenal - there is so much to see, its overwhelming. Where should you start? Highly recommend.",
          "This museum is my absolutely my favourite in Oxford it is so interesting and utterly amazing a must if you enjoy looking at the unusual 10/10",
          "My first dip into the Pitt Rivers left me overwhelmed and confused as it is not arranged like a traditional museum. We took the highlights tour (2:30 and 3:15 on Tuesday and Wednesday) which was a perfect introduction to this amazing collection. I was able to finally",
          "We visited the museum on a day trip to Oxford. The museum houses a unique collection of artefacts from around the world. We found the Kula valuables on the first floor particularly interesting after studying them on an Ou module. Amazing that entry to this museum is free. Would",
          "The most unique museum where I have ever been. Very interesting and has a really unusual layout, perfectly used all nooks of this small place. A huge totem beautifully emerge above all the other curiosities, making the place more interesting. I felt a bit sad wondering about the",
          "Part of \\ inside the natural history museum. Free entry. Some reviews say it is dark and a bit crampt but that adds to the flavour of the place! Unusual artifacts from all over the world, renowned for the shrunken heads there are some great items!! Younger visitors might need",
          "I hated museums as a kid, I\u2019m not that bothered by them now to be honest! But this is less museum and more an eclectic mix of objects on display! Shrunken heads, samurai suits of armour and a totem pole all sit side by side. It\u2019s absolutely crazy and I loved every minute of it.",
          "Went here for an afternoon visit. Free entry at all times , excellent. This museum is really unusual with exhibits from all over the world. A must visit place if you have children. Bring a torch. You could spend days here to see everything",
          "A flying visit having had an appointment in town was well worth the visit! We thoroughly enjoyed a good hour there & the little one love's dinosaurs so had to be done given the opportunity. I highly recommend a visit! Beautiful museum indeed",
          "I'm not sure what i was expecting but it was much better than i thought, when you first walk in there is immediately stuff for kids to keep them happy, numerous activities too, both my girls loved it! Aged 5 and 7. The activities were really interesting as an adult to read as",
          "An absolutely wonderful collection - could spend hours browsing. Another review considered it poorly displayed but in fact it's arranged by typology so you can see all the varieties of a specific artefact/activity across different times and cultures. There are free tours (see",
          "We came to visit on one of the hottest days of the year and the museum is lovely and cool. Lots to see and despite certain exhibits being not for children the mouse trail helps them look around. The pop up coffee is shop has the nicest coffee I have tasted in ages.",
          "It feels as though this extensive collection was jammed in place at some time in the 1950s and hasn't been rearranged since. There is so much to see but it is so poorly displayed that it is difficult to know where to look. The lighting was so dim I thought at first there had",
          "This is an amazing collection. The room and galleries in which the collection is held is kept fairly dark, probably to make it more atmospheric. However our 5 year old found the masks and faces rather frightening and would not stay. We will return in years to come.",
          "Very similar to the Horniman museum in London; lots of artifacts related to human development, including tools and weapons.",

          "This museum is absolutely packed with amazing and interesting objects. They're densely packed though so it needs time to have a good look around. As a result, the neighbouring museum of natural history probably gets more attention but Pitt Rivers is equally extraordinary. Really",

          "The Pitt Rivers has, in the truest sense, everything that is weird and wonderful. Whatever you\u2019re looking for, you\u2019ll find something else even more interesting. It\u2019s what all museums should be like....",
          "This is one of the world's great museums. The collections are staggering. The 19th century modes of display- hundreds of objects grouped by cataagory rather than culture is mind-blowing. I spent an entire day here! Their contemnporary shows are thought provoking and timely.",

          "Do not underestimate the number of items on display by assuming it is just one hall size. The one hall with multiple floors displays 500,000 items. The Museum is located to the east of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, and can only be accessed through that",
          "We visited for the first time in 2017 and did not have much time before it closed. So this time we took more time and you really need a lot to see everything. A great place and a must see!",
          "I love the quirkiness of the Pitt Rivers museum, and the recent Illuminating Movement late night opening special event was a great excuse for another visit. There were a good range of activities across the museum going on, well worth looking out for upcoming special events.",
          "There are so many fascinating things in here, I spent hours peering into cabinets seeing the different items. I love the fact its grouped by function so you can see how different cultures tackled the same thing. There are lots of very personal artifacts which really give an idea",
          "This collection which was originally started by early plant collectors, has thousands of examples of every day objects and craft from all over the world. I remember the jewellery section , children's toys, cooking vessels, but its hard to choose favourite. Too much to take in",
          "I didn\u2019t spend as much time here as I would have liked due to boisterous school group. Having said that, youth will absolutely love this place. Most gravitated to the shrunken head collection (Knight bus scene from Harry Potter-Prisoner of Azcaban.) Really too much to see in one",

          "I must say it annoys me when other reviewers say it`s free to get in, yes it is but throw in \u00a35 for all of you at least as this will help to the upkeep as even \u00a35 is nothing for what you will see. My wife and i spent over 4hrs in here and we were amazed at the way it was laid",

          "On Saturday the weather was cold and miserable and we had a morning to find something to do. I had looked up this museum on Trip advisor and read all the excellent reviews so we decided to give it a try. We were all pleasantly surprised by the variety of items on display, some",
          "We briefly visited this museum, as we were passing, purely out of curiosity and a general interest in history. Though we'd never heard of it, we saw it feature in a TV program the very next day (spooky!!). The range and quality of the exhibits is jaw dropping and we have to go",

          "What a trove of treasures from around the world. Many just go for the shrunken heads (not really that exciting, but certainly not something you see every day). There are cases and cases of all kinds of things--weapons, armor, art, clothing. I could have walked about for hours",
          "Definitely worth a couple of hours. This is a museum from about a hundred years ago with handwritten explanations or oddly typed descriptions of what you are seeing. Jam packed with stuff. Docent was roaming and engaging patrons. You have to experience it to believe it. The",

          "Great collection of things collected from around the world, the highlight for me was the shrunken heads! They are creepy but fascinating. It's definitely what you would expect of a museum that is part of The Natural History museum. Good for kids too as there are many things that",
          "This is possibly the most amazing place in Oxford. It\u2019s a truly eclectic collection of awesome stuff. The Pitt Rivers has everything I could wish for in a museum. Natural history, weaponry, body art, shrunken heads, costumes, a witch in a bottle. Yes, I do go to check she\u2019s",

          "This place is wild! Very overwhelming, but it\u2019s kinda cool to see an old school collection still displayed like it\u2019s still the Victorian era. Some interpretive material at the entrance would be helpful to explain why it is the way it is. Definitely an oddity worth exploring!",
          "Wow, what a place. Just the architecture on its own was amazing, but the museum itself was splendid. Every nook and cranny was displaying something wonderful, you could easily spend a day in here. Children would love this place, if we lived in the area, we would be back time and",
          "This is a unique museum of cultural treasures from around the globe. These are organised according to themes or types, rather than where they are from. It is one of the highlights of a visit to Oxford. The building itself is old, but there is new wing which includes a coffee",

          "Definitely worth the visit, and it's free to get in!! I prefer the natural history museum as I find it more interesting and I prefer the vibe. However pitt rivers is still full of cool things. Bit cheeky that they ask for a \u00a35 donation but it is free admission so it's alright. Great, fun educational trip for kids!",
          "Visiting this museum is experiencing what object and information storage is when there is too much of it and little amount of guidelines on how to organize it, resulting in a fascinating group of item collections arranged with little \u2026",
          "A fantastic place to visit. Would recommend visiting multiple times as there is so much to see. It is well layed out and great for kids as there are activities tailored for them available. As its all indoors an ideal place to visit on a rainy day",
          "Wow thats a lot of stuff and a lot of cultures.\nI've never been to a museum with so much stuff on display! \nIt covers cultures and agrees from across the globe and time.\nFrom pottery and Peru to shrunken heads to fire making from tattoos \u2026",
          "There's so much to see and learn. It's like an adventurers' treasure trove from around the world. \nWe absolutely loved it! \n\nThe museum staff were helpful and clearly passionate, sharing interesting facts and pointing out items that were especially unusual.",
          "If you haven't seen this collection of  artifacts then you must. Such an eclectic range of wonderfully preserved articles from  all over the world. If only I had more time to take it all in. Will definitely visit again.",
          "You may wish to see my review for the Oxford Museum of Natural History. Pitt Rivers Museum (better termed \"Collection\") is inside the natural history museum. \n\nThis museum is an excellent location for individual travelers, adult and young \u2026",
          "Magnificent collection, which needs more extensive interpretation of some sort. The staff is informative and friendly and were happy to give answer all questions. You can spend days in this museum and always discover something new. I love the puffer fish lantern and blowfish helmet.",
          "My best museum ever! Where do you get to see a dodo, a dinosaur and and...shrunk heads! The very best of Oxford!\nPlease support this venue, ad they saved the shrunk heads and it is the very best place to celebrate their culture",
          "Nice but huge ! So many small objects and models to see... l have been twice and not finished !  Oxford is nice to exploring ! Park and Ride (car park with bus return cheaper than city centre car park !) is better option if you want to spend all day !",
          "Amazing place. My partner is an anthropologist and he was over the moon enthralled with the collection.  The presentation by category is enlightening if overwhelming.  We met a curator who spent  a long time with us talking about everything \u2026",
          "Wonderful building and great collection. Good for children, don't miss the rooms behind the main building. Look for the shrunken human heads.",
          "Really neat museum and concept. It\u2019s overwhelming how much stuff is contained in those three levels. Worth a visit, but do plan how long you\u2019ll stay. You can spend several days there if you let yourself explore all the exhibits closely!",
          "I have mixed views: the modern section does not work for me. I first was enthralled by the magic of the Museum 55 years ago, a bird's nest of objects. I realise that modernisation and user-friendliness are popular with curators etc but l \u2026",
          "My wife and I visited this museum on a whim after finding outselves in Oxford for a day. Was expecting to spend maybe an hour inside. Three hours later and we were still finding exhibits to explore with the museum starting to close. Don't \u2026",
          "A mind boggling collection of collections. Something for everyone. A place you could go back to again and again and always find something different.",
          "This is a great museum. Highly recommended. But there is a lot to see in one day so you may you need to come back. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd13",
          "The Pitt Rivers, and Natural History Museum, which are joined, are a great place to visit. A unique collection in fantastic buildings which have been upgraded to make them very easily accessible. Plus, blue badge parking spaces bang outside.",
          "Excellent display, lots of different things to see, a family favourite was The World's Smallest Doll",
          "Worth a visit, recommend doing it in 2 parts and having a coffee because there is so much cool stuff to take in.",
          "Nice to visit definitely recommend, only criticism is too many artifacts packed into a \nSingle display can be a little overwhelming.",
          "Free entry and lots to see, very varied collection, smaller amounts from many places so you see many different styles and methods",
          "I've been coming here since I was a child and now I take my child here. There is so much to see that you always see different things each time you come. Favourites are the shrunken heads, samurai and the huge totem pole. \n\nYou enter through \u2026",
          "Literally too much for the eye to take in all at once, but that just means repeat visits and it's definitely worth it!",
          "An absolute gem. You can easily spend a day there and come back for more.",
          "One of the most beautiful museums I've ever been to. The staff is friendly, there are no crowds whatsoever and the best thing: it got this super cozy athmosphere that lets you think about the history of the objects you discover every step \u2026",
          "Went for a college trip. If you're looking for stuff for specific cultures you may want to check online as personally there wasnt much for my research on mexico. Very cramped and dark so a torch is handy. Packed with lots of different artifacts that are very interesting.",
          "This is a spectacular collection of items from across humanity. \nThere's SO much on display, most of the university's collection, it's crazily crowded but it really works. It's organised by item so one cabinet will show similar tools from \u2026",
          "Amazing you need a good couple of hours to see half of the exhibits on show \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Wonderfully ecclectic although could do with a touch more space - so much stuff in a small museum",
          "A genuinely different museum, seeing the commonalities of cultures around the world, and presenting beautiful things in an unique way.",
          "Vast collection of different objects, interesting  highlights tour.",
          "Wow! What a great museum! The display of all objects is very cleverly done. It is interesting and fun, suitable for all ages and for every taste. Highly recommend",
          "Denied entry because we had travelled as a group yet were visiting alone. Do not recommend the woman who had the peach trousers who's name is more than likely Karen if you are reading this you are RUDE and need to learn to drop the attitude to paying customers.",
          "So much to see here! A ton of different and amazing objects are on display. You can easily lose a day in here trying to see everything. An anthropologist's dream.",
          "Fascinating collection. Take a highlight tour if you can.",
          "Great exhibits, great staff, great museum",
          "Amazing museum. A must-see for visitors and residents alike.",
          "Right from the start the Pitts River Museum has a sense that you are entering a new experience. \nWell displayed collection consistent with the expectations set by the experience. \nHandle objects from from around the world, space and beyond. \nLoved it!",
          "The interior alone is incredible!",
          "Great Museum in a Victorian style,  but with many added more recent displays.",
          "More of a hoarders palace but great fun. Top floor shows a honderd and plus devices what we monkeys devised to kill each other with",
          "This quirky museum is well worth a visit! It is free entry for all and satisfies all cravings for the weird and wonderful. The collection here is fascinating and the handwritten labels add to the charm and beauty of this unique place. The \u2026",
          "Fantastic collections you would need many days to cover the amount of information and history they have got...loved it",
          "Amazing place. Not very crowded. Incredible dinosaurs!",
          "A flawless collection of so many various things! from Dinosaur bones to rocks to mayan art to space stuff! I can not fault this museum at all, the staff were really helpful when I asked for information about a previous exhibit.",
          "My teenage daughters and I really enjoyed our visit today. Lots of interesting artifacts and many different animals, birds, insects and fossils to look at. There is a cafe for snacks and drinks and nice toilets.",
          "Very interesting museum in a magic building. Mostly for children but remember that everyone was a child...",
          "So I've been to Pitt Rivers before but mostly as a child. It's still as good and as interesting. The building it's in is a really cool building, I imagine it not changing since the Victorian era. Large airy atrium with dinosaurs and other \u2026",
          "It's great to have access to such a great museum for free! :) It's also sad to see the humanity history through the wars that we have been battling along the centuries. Pitt Rivers shows a wide collection of battle equipment such as guns, \u2026",
          "Good place, however not the best service for visitors.",
          "Amazing museum, definitely worth a visit. With astonishing Victorian architecture. Much to see.",
          "This is one of the most amazing museum experiences in the world. It's old-fashioned, yes - but that's what's great about it!",
          "A wonderful collection of items. The kids didn't enjoy this as much as the the Museum of Natural History next door.",
          "Best museum ever visited, very unique!",
          "This is one of the best museums in the UK and well worth a visit. From shrunken heads, masks and toys to fire starting tools and trinkets just wonderful. Wheelchair access is good and the building is stunning.",
          "Probably the most interesting museum I've ever been to. Always see things I've missed on repeat visits.",
          "Great place to stroll around in, has tons of information and objects from magic, ships and samurai's. Some parts are very cramped. They also have a mice game where there are multiple mice around for you to find (great for children).",
          "This museum is chock full of examples of the human journey from the Stoneage to the present.....it's magnificent !!!!",
          "Best museum in Oxford, so many amazing things crammed into the lovely old cabinets. Have been there countless times but always spot something different and interesting. The mouse hunt is fun for kids. My son also loves Pitt Rivers and the Natural History Museum next door, its the only place in Oxford he asks to visit.",
          "A treasure trove of delights. My favourite museum ever!",
          "You can never move through the three floors and the exhibitions in 2 hours. So if you can, split your time over two days and take it all in. It's a calming space, with chairs available for seated viewing too, if the scramble gets a bit too \u2026",
          "Huge collection of artifacts with free entrance. Great for an afternoon visit with family or friends, specially when the weather outside is not friendly :)",
          "Reading about the history of the museum and its building was really impressive! The display place there might be small, but it is well-organised.\nA must-see anthropological and archeological sight!",
          "Love visiting, I always find something I haven't seen before",
          "When round with a friend on a saturday, lots of children perhaps a school day for less children. It was very interesting  but difficult to get  around in places with a walker especially with lots of children rushing round excited. Great way to spend an afternoon. Something for everyone",
          "The best museum I have ever been to. It's an absolute treasure trove. My kids loved the tribal section with the shrunken heads. I have been several times and will return.",
          "Excellent museum, great collections of unusual items",
          "Great place for both adults and children. This free museum is packed full of interest.",

          "Fascinating objects. A must see if you're in Oxford",
          "Wonderful selection of cultural artifacts from around the world presented in a great older museum. It's great to get in amongst the cabinets and discover so much about the world. Upstairs is a history of weapons and warfare for those military buffs.",
          "Excellent. Just can't see enough in one day. X",
          "So interesting! Free to visit.you need 2~3 hrs to really take it all in",
          "Stunning displays full of curiosity and wonder!",
          "Ceremonial clothes worn in past in various countries, clothes used in extreme winter places. Dressing table essentials used. Types of armors, battle weapons, guns, bows & arrows and many more exhibits to look for. A lot of collection of artefacts from various countries, deities, etc. Amazing place.",
          "The hidden gem of Oxford...could easily spend hours walking around in there",
          "What a fascinating treasure trove! The items range from the rare to the every day. Though considering you have a collection of hair accessories from every corner of the globe, even the usual becomes unusual.\n\nThe arrangement of the museum \u2026",
          "Really interesting and helped with research for my textile art course work,\nWould recommend for all ages as there is a children's activity to do when you get there,\nLove it",
          "A very awesome and ecclectic collection of unusual artifacts from all over the world. Definitely worth a visit",
          "Quite interesting and well done. If you like the history of human culture, it's wonderful.",
          "Coolest museum I've ever been to. Tops the London Natural History Museum by miles. If you're in Oxford, definitely go.",
          "Great museum something for everyone. Kids love the dinosaurs and make sure you find out the shrunken Japanese heads!",
          "This is a really interesting collection. There is so much to look at, this needs lots of short visits to do it justice.",
          "A curiosity shop more than a museum, and wonderful for that.",
          "It was a bit too crowded. They should improve the layout.",
          "Amazing.  So much history!",
          "Located at the end of the natural history museum. Pit Rivers is probably the most interesting museum in my oppinion. It contains items from cultures all over the world and of different time periods. Extensive collection of jewelry, ornaments, religious items, clothing and items of war. Do not miss it.",
          "Brilliant! Something for everyone \ud83d\udc4d",
          "I could spend weeks in here... Love it.",
          "This was my first visit to Oxford and I was really looking forward to visiting some of the museums. The problem was that I went to this one first, and was so captivated that I didn't have much time to visit the more famous museums. This \u2026",
          "Really really great. Lacking some info on exhibits but otherwise great.",
          "Cluttered with lots of artefacts. No particular order beyond artefact type. Strange energy in the place.",

          "Love it! You can't see it all in just one visit.",
          "They've got loads of neat stuff here. It's free as well. You can spend hours here an never see everything. Over all it is worth a visit if you're in town.",
          "My four year old son was enthralled. As a family, we absolutely love this place as it makes history really accessible. Loved the dinosaur bones and looking at things with a torch, and the staff are absolutely lovely, particularly a man who showed Bram some things he could touch.",
          "Excellent museum. Beautiful, well kept building. Amazing exhibits. Friendly staff.",
          "Great family day out. They have added a lot more over the last couple of years and now there is a good amount to see and do. Shame it doesn't have parking but it's quite easy to get a bus or park in one of the nearby streets and walk over. My kids love the dinosaurs especially and we were amazed on how big they are",
          "This is fantastic Museum. I love exploring through the different exhibits. This time round I went upstairs and enjoyed the Samurai displays!",
          "Ok. Probably good for kids. Lots of static displays. But free entry so, hey.",

          "An amazing place. You will need more than one visit to look at everything fully",
          "Best museum in Oxford. Ethical issues aside (you do wonder how they got all of these objects, especially some of the sacred ones) you will be hard pressed to find such a cabinet of wonders anywhere else. Filled with objects from all ages \u2026",
          "One of the finest museums in the world. Packed full of curious and interesting things. Organised in a fascinating way, by function rather than chronology. Go!",

          "Simply overwhelming, make sure to buy the new quick guide to the Pitt Rivers museum to provide some kind of guideline - or simply allow yourself to get lost among the thousands of exhibits. A truly unique experience you should not miss!",
          "So many interesting  and exciting items to see.",
          "Most people have seen it on the tv if you watch Morse or any film with a British Victorian style museum in it. That said a great half a day out. \nThere is somewhere to eat but better places in the city.\nBut the collection of artifacts is \u2026",

          "This is a traditional British museum. Full of fascinating exhibits - something for everyone. Great for families. Quiz sheet for children. Staff friendly and informative.",
          "This place is bonkers, but definately worth a visit. Its small, but there is no way you will see everything. There are thousands of small pieces dotted around, but some incredible larger pieces such as Noh theatre masks and Samurai armour.\n\nDefinately worth a little tour, plus its free.",
          "Just amazing, will be back",
          "Brilliant, stuff London museums, this is the place to go. \ud83d\udc4d",
          "In the running for 2019 museum of the year,  that should be museum of the millennium. Maybe its a bit of a marmite museum, I love it. The experience is unmissable how ever you feel abouts it's collection of shrunken heads etc.",
          "If you haven't been here, it cannot be adequately surmised. A true experience. The sight of the crowded cases coming into view through the museum doors has stayed with me for many years, and no matter how many times I go, it never fails to disappoint.",
          "Stitch a brilliant collection of the unexpected",
          "Fascinating, with a huge variety of displays but the lighting could be improved a little",
          "Great! Weapon display was particularly good",

          "A stunning collection and a handful of infortmation for every piece. Very interesting and fun for a few hours.",
          "It's easy to overlook the Pitt Rivers, with its small entrance from the back of the Museum of Natural History. Doing so would be a big mistake, as its impressive collection of artefacts from Britain's colonial past is truly awe-inspiring. \u2026",
          "Amazing collection of artefacts from shrunken heads, to massim lime spatulas, i was overwhelmed at first but took another visit the next day to visit the upper floors. Loved all the tribal clubs, shell and bone fishhooks, shell necklaces, sheilds, weapons etc etc etc",

          "Favourite museum in the UK. Great for history buffs and enthusiasts",
          "Really interesting place, nice day out for the whole family as the kids were so excited. In the cafe I\u2019ve had a carrot cake which was unbelievably delicious. We\u2019ll be back for more \ud83d\ude1c",

          "Lovely museum. I've been a few times now and I'm glad they've changed the labels so they're much easier to read. However it is still dark in there, and I understand it's for conservation but as a visually impaired person, reading the labels \u2026",
          "Eclectic collection of artifacts from around the world. You could spend hours looking though the displays. \nDisplay cases are quite close together so not much room to get by. Closes before the natural history museum does.",

          "So much to see and learn",

They're literally piled as packed in as possible and this museum alone would take days to soak it all in.",
          "Absolutely fantastic place for an afternoon with the family...or by yourself! No matter how many times you visit you will always find things you've never noticed before!

          "A wide range of items that have been collected / donated. Kind of arranged by type, but no specific theme, just a large collection of things through the ages. This is it's charm. One minute you're looking at Victorian toys, the next shrunken heads.",
          "Strangest and, yet, one of the most interesting museums that I've ever been to. If you have the time, definitely add this to your itinerary.",
          "One of my favourite museums",
          "Loved loved loved it.  Just behind the natural history museum is a delight. Shrunken heads, clothes made out of animal intestines but may favourite display was things that look like other things.  Well worth the drive from South Wales",
          "Linked to Natural History Museum. Huge variety of artifacts. Top floor is loaded with weapons. All level accessible via lift.",

          "An incredible collection of \"things\". There's no other way of describing it really as the contents are so varied. The items are grouped into small sub collections line \"musical instruments\", \"boats\", etc. I went specifically to see the \u2026",

          "This is a museum of, literaly, everything. Starting from fashion to medicine to afterlife to means of transportation to daily life. It is incredibly interesting and can take anywhere between 1 and 100 hours to explore it. Each exponate has a story and some strange reason why it ended up there.",

          "Lovely museum so full of exhibits it's impossible to see all in one visit. Old fashioned layout but none the worse for it. We had decided what we wanted to see and stuck to the plan. Kids will love some of the quirkier exhibits but it could turn into an aimless ramble.",

          "Wierd and wonderful. Definitely worth more than a couple of visits",
          "A \"must see\" in Oxford.  More of a collection than a museum, you can lose yourself in artefacts from a different era, from peoples that no longer exist.  In the entrance hall look out for the geology exhibits, and don't miss the supporting columns, each one made out of a different type of rock.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Magdalen Bridge  spans the divided stream of the River Cherwell just to the east of the City of Oxford, England, and next to Magdalen College, whence it gets its name and pronunciation. It connects the High Street to the west with The Plain, now a roundabout, to the east.\n\n\n== Antecedents ==\nThis point of the Cherwell has been used for crossing since ancient times. The first known reference to a bridge goes back to 1004 and originally it was probably a wooden trestle construction or a drawbridge. By the 16th century a late medieval stone bridge had replaced the wooden one. This bridge was about 1,500 feet (460 m) long and was formed by 20 arches.By the 1770s, the stone bridge was too narrow for the increasing traffic, as it did not allow two vehicles crossing safely. In addition to this, the structure was becoming unsound due to the combination of two factors: a generalized lack of maintenance and the negative effects of regular flooding. Eventually some of the arches of the western side collapsed during the floods of February 1772, making the bridge irreparable.\n\n\n== The new bridge ==\n\nThe present stone bridge was designed by John Gwynn of Shrewsbury with a similar length to the previous one. It has a total of 11 arches of different dimensions distributed as follows. For each of the two branches of the river there are three large semicircular arches plus two smaller ones at each side of the river, originally designed for the towpaths. A central elliptical arch, the only existing in the long central area across the island, completes the structure. This arch only conveys water when the island gets submerged. The original plans of the bridge are in the British Library, 1802 c.17, vol.2, and King's Maps xxxvi, 33 (1).The bridge, built between 1772 and 1790 by John Randall, originally had a width of 27 feet (8.2 m), which accommodated a single roadway and two pavements. Although the bridge was opened to traffic by the end of 1778, a new scheme for the balustrade and the completion of the south western corner were not finished until 1782 and 1790 respectively.Gwynn's original design included an extravagant decoration for the balustrade with sculptures and sphinxes that were commissioned to Henry Webber in 1778 but eventually abandoned in 1782. According to Pevsner, the bridge has \"good sturdy balusters\", although these have been replaced over the years because of degradation due to pollution.Despite opposition from University members, the bridge was widened in 1882 to accommodate a four-foot gauge track for the tramway. The 18th-century bridge was widened by 20 feet (6.1 m) on the south side, but design was retained.\n\n\n== May Morning ==\n\nThe bridge is the scene of large crowds every 1 May early in the morning for the traditional May Morning celebrations in Oxford. There has been a recent tradition of students to jump off the bridge, despite the danger of injury due to low water levels in the Cherwell. In some years many jumpers have been injured and, in order to avoid this, the bridge is now routinely closed on May Morning.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMagdalen Bridge, Oxford\nMagdalen Bridge Boathouse\nRestrictions on Magdalen Bridge by Tom Pinnock, The Oxford Student, 2004",

          "Did this with some friends celebrating a birthday, had a lovely 30mins punt around the river whilst enjoying a glass or 2 of champagne, had a fantastic driver! (not sure if that's correct LOL) was a very busy on the river as it was a lovely sunny day and you can choose to steer",
          "Wanted to do this for years, so happy to experience, and tick off my bucket list. The young man taking us around the canal was informative, and so competent. We all thoroughly enjoyed punting. It wasn\u2019t to expensive either...",

          "Mid way through our busy day exploring Oxford by foot, hiring a chauffeured punting boat was thoroughly relaxing. It was a quiet and still break from the busy city. Family of four (2 adults, 2 teens) fit snugly. No reservations needed. We walked right up and were off shortly.",
          "Never been on a punt before, but loved the calmness and quiet of the experience. Had a lovely chauffeur, George, who knew his stuff when asked questions about the river and the surrounds. Not cheap, but something you have to do whilst in Oxford surely!",

          "My girlfriend surprised me with this experience on our recent visit to Oxford. She opted for the self-guided option and it was really fun. We hired a boat for an hour and decided to extend our time to two hours we enjoyed it so much. While it is challenging to first learn how to",

          "Me and my friends decided to go for a pedalo as we felt punting would be too difficult or one of us would fall in. It was really easy to steer and was great fun. The price for an hour divided by 4 was very reasonable. It was \u00a322/hour when we went Oct 2017. I would recommend",
          "We both learned how to punt in good time. It looks far easier than it is. The pole is very long, heavy and wet. If you aren't careful you will fall in when the pole sticks in the mud. You can pay a little extra for a skilled punter to take you.",
          "Having read many books & seen movies with people punting down the river in Oxford, we knew from the time we planned our trip that this was something we wanted to do here. It was just 2 of us, my husband and me, and while it took each of us a few minutes to get the hang of",

          "In fairness I should say enjoyable for the person being punted. Stick with it - after 15 minutes you get the hang of it. Don't attempt to go any further in the hour than they suggest unless you have done this before. You need an id to hand them as surety",
          "We decided to have a go at punting, after a short queue we were given some instructions & pushed away. That's great fun the problems started when getting back to dock, as there were so many boats on the water at one time, at no point did any of the 15+ staff just standing on",
          "Paid for a chauffeured punt - \u00a330 for 30mins but we were on there for around 45mins. Amelia, our chauffeur, was lovely and friendly. Informative about all the buildings and fields on the banks of the river. Let my two girls have a go at punting themselves! Lots of fun and well",

          "We stood in (a rather disorganized) line to rent a punt. We were ushered in, and we asked how much it was. We were told we needed to give them L30 of which L8 was a deposit. The attendant neglected to tell us that it was L22 *per hour*. After spending a (lovely) 2.5 hours",
          "When in Oxford....this has to be done!. Friendly staff who give clear sound advise and guidance before setting off. Great value and an enjoyable half hour of being on the river.",
          "We had a go at punting ourselves and it was such a fun afternoon! Punting is a little physically challenging but good fun once in a routine. We found it very relaxing when someone else was punting and we were sat enjoying a drink! I'd definitely visit again.",
          "transported to a quiet sedate means of transport in the busy city. Expertly punted by Linus who was polite and charming.",

          "Just had a fun hen party in the rain using these punts. Had a punt guide called Seb who dropped us off and he was fun and engaging. He forgot to give us our cushions so when we got picked up after our picnic lunch they provided, we had to wait as the punt that arrived to pick us",
          "Hired a self drive punt for \u00a322 for an hour for up to 5 people. It was pretty busy at the boatyard but we were soon allocated a boat and given a quick run through on how to punt. Our driver quickly got the hang of it and after moving away from busy Magdalene Bridge we then",
          "I loved watching my boyfriend row with the four of us while seeing the river pass us by. If it wouldn't have been for my nephew babbling on non stop, it would have been soooo peaceful (it was quite peaceful anyway\ud83d\ude09). It was also worth 22 for a boat per hour. I would do it",
          "Fabulous fun!! We hired 2 punts, one chauffered and one to do yourselves. Lovely helpful young lad chauffered us. Delightful way to spend some time and prices were reasonable,. Staff were all very helpful & chatty.",

          "Had an hour to kill so decided to give it a try. 2 minutes of instruction and I didn't fall in or tip my family over so all worked out well. Worked a small bit of a sweat up trying to keep things working well but really a fun relaxing hour! Totally worth doing. Quite",
          "I spent a long weekend in Oxford with three girlfriends. We chose to have a chauffeured punt as we didn't fancy doing the hardwork - plus we didn't want to fall in! (Apparently it's quite common, and we did see one person fall!) We had the most lovely guy called Henry doing our",
          "I went with three friends and we enjoyed our punting a lot. However it was very busy around the start/finish zone and this made for a stressful beginning due to there not being enough space for everyone. The staff were quite stressed and due to how busy it was we didn't get very",

          "We were hesitant at first to spend \u00a330 on this trip but we're so glad we did! It was a really lovely, relaxing experience just gliding along the river looking at the scenery. There are loads of ducks on the river and they will come right up to your boat looking for food (which",
          "My wife wanted us to go punting on the river, as we had done in Cambridge. This time, as before, we chose the chauffeured punting, and our chauffeur, Phil, had not gone to Oxford. However, he said he'd been at the job for 10 years, had studied boat building, and had built the",
          "This was the most elegant, relaxing & calming experience of my life. Normally an adrenaline junky, I believed I would be bored, uncomfortable & irritable.... Well, I was very rapidly proven very wrong. Staff are kind, friendly, informed & do everything to make sure customers get",
          "We did both, the self punt and the foot paddle. Punting wasn't as easy as suspected but had a great time working it out. The view is amazing on the way, best to have a good sense of humour if punting for the first time. Paddle boat is much more relaxing for everyone involved.",
          "Well what a lovely funny hour punting in Oxford. Friendly staff. We thought 22 pounds for an hour was acceptable for a lovely experience.",
          "We both love punting as graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, so being in Oxford on a sunny day, it was a must. Worth going early before the Cherwell gets packed with those who are not so adept! Don't like the pedaloes you can hire from this boathouse as they make too much noise:",
          "Tom our chauffeur was absolutely brilliant and fun throughout our hours punting, making it a fab experience for my husbands birthday.",
          "Having been on a gondola in Venice we though a punt in oxford would be fun. These folks at Magdalen Bridge Boathouse were excellent. We opted for the chauffeured trip and a chatty young man punted us around. It was a brilliant experience and a must if you visit Oxford. I",

          "We were lucky. It was a glorious autumn day, but with only a few people on the river because it had rained earlier. We had an expert (16 year old girl!) punter to steer us along. Better than an unexpected dip, though fun watching others try their hand. \u00a330 for 30 minutes.",
          "Lovely experience as this was our first punting ride. Not easy at the beginning but after few minutes struggle it would become easy. If you are in Oxford this is something I'd recommend to do. Kids would love it",
          "The guides and staff were quick to accommodate a very large group with friendly smiles and efficient service. The 'punter' was friendly and made the experience that much more fun. Not much too it, but definitely something you need to experience.... Beware, through, the gift",
          "I always fancied doing this but it was a bit boring being a passenger until my husband fell in! We hired a punt boat at \u00a322, for price I thought it was ok. It's not as easy as it looks. I think my husbands advice would be if the pole goes in and you can't get it let go! Dog",
          "We pushed the boat out (sorry) and hired a chauffeured punt for a cruise around the river. It was well worth it (we saw someone take a swim!). So serene and relaxing.",
          "A lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of choosing between Oxford or Cambridge. I've been punting on both and preferred the scenic trip I took in Oxford. There are a range of boats to choose from, including pedalos and rowing boats if you prefer not to have any help.",
          "We are Oxford locals and as it was a sunny day decided to spend an hour on the river. We hired a rowboat and on the way back accidentally knocked into one of the punts that was being chauffeured by a 'crew' member. It was a gentle knock but the crew member massively overreacted.",
          "My son and I took turns to complete this one hour sport. It looks easier than it is. I enjoyed it even I am not good at keeping it straight. Wish I have more time to practice. Such a good thing to spend an earlier evening before sunset. It's beautiful.",
          "What an AWESOME thing to do in Oxford! Well worth it and such fun on a sunny day! Really relaxed crew, few rules and plenty of opportunity to have a go. Definitely do it!!",
          "I recently went punting at Oxford with friends. Our guide was friendly and he told us the history of the buildings we were able to admire throughout the trip. We enjoyed the company of the ducks swimming next to us.",
          "We had a lovely guide called Lara. She took us round the river on a lovely sunny day. Another company said we would have to book a punt in advance, they were down the river, but these guys took us straight away! Friendly, polite, helpful shipmates and skippers! Definitely coming",
          "We really enjoyed spending a couple of hours on the river learning to do something new and also something we couldn't do anywhere else? I'm sure you couldn't just hire a gondola in Venice? Ok so it may not be quite a gondola but it's probably as close as it gets. Yes it's a",
          "It's a very relaxing ride if you get a pro, but doing it yourself can be very tricky. It's a nice way to spend an afternoon. (A ride with a pro punting is 30 mins and doing it yourself can be over an hour) I highly recommend this attraction.",
          "Even though we had got a reservation, we had to wait for pedalo boat 45 minutes. Stuff didn't care and when we demanded our reservation they were unpolite. But I must mention that sailing the canals was brilliant!",
          "Lazy way to see St.Hilda's and parts of Christ Church and Magdalen and the River Cherwell. Informative and enthusiastic 'chauffeur' Tom gave brief commentary whilst avoiding other punts 'poled' by those younger and fitter than us. A good laugh.",
          "Punting in Oxford was on my dsughter's bucket list so she insisted that we do it. I was so put off by the 30 pound for half an hour (that is 600 rands for a South African!) that we hired one at 22 for the hour. Well, it was a disaster as punting is really really difficult when",
          "This was such a lovely time ! Would highly recommend this. We spent \u00a330 for half an hour and had a young lady row for us down the river my son (13) went on a peddle low behind us. Lovely scenery very peaceful",

          "This tour was booked through a site that booked everything for my hen party, so we were just advised to be at the boathouse for 2pm. When we reached there was quite a queue, but we were sent straight to the front as we had a booking. We were a group of 13 ladies all shapes and",
          "Rented one of the pedal boats. Very helpful and friendly staff. Sailing the canals was beautiful. Definitely part of the experience of visiting this lovely city.",
          "We discovered this place on Trip Advisor and have to recommend it if you're in Oxford and the weather permits. It's easy to get to, not too long and if you get a good crew member (as we did) then you get to tour the river with some history / local facts thrown in for good",
          "We definitely wanted to include punting in our trip to Oxford but weren't sure if my wife's dad and brother would join us or not. We are very glad they did because they ended up doing all the punting ;). It is harder than it looks and if you don't have the technique you need to",
          "A little background info first: I've been a teacher for a summer program in Oxford for nine years. We occupy two of the colleges with 500 students from all over the world, as well as have a sister program at another college (with slightly younger teens) of a about 300 students.",
          "We had to stand in line for about 45 minutes for our turn, but ultimately, we had a fantastic time. We went with a pro punter and are glad we did. We got to relax, enjoy the view and take plenty of photos. As crowded as the dock was, once we were on the river, we felt like",
          "I can honestly say I was terrified when my friend suggested we do this, but you have to do something that scares you....right? What an hour of fun we had. If you truly want to enjoy and understand this activity take it in turns to punt yourself. Steering the wrong way, crashing",
          "This place is ideally situated and easy to reach. The crew were really professional and organised. It was a great laugh.",
          "We hired a boat for one hours do it yourself punting!! As it was our friends birthday, we encouraged him to punt!! It was great fun, but hard work. I think it was around \u00a324 for an hour. (We had to put a deposit down too, which was refunded) There is a little network of canals,",
          "We took the chauffeured punt option as husband was reluctant to have a go himself. We had a lovely young Chauffeur called Tom who took great care of us. We thought \u00a330 between the 4 of us was reasonable. The highlight was seeing a heron at close quarters on the riverbank and",
          "We rented a peddle boat for an hour at the cost of \u00a322 which seemed quite steep for two people. However, after we were freed from a rope which became tangled in the peddles by two persistent crew members, we could fully appreciate the pricing. We then peddled to the Thames",
          "As part of a European conference, our social activities included punting on the Cherwell - 7 chauffeured boats - one containing Italian guests who thought they were in Venice! This was the most relaxing experience and enjoyed by everyone. Definitely recommend.",
          "We visited Oxford and what is a visit to Oxford without experiencing a try at 'punting'... The 'crew' at the punting location could not have been more helpful, they assured us (rightly) that it was no problem and no problem it was, they assisted us to make a small boat trip into",
          "I chose this activity as recommended in a guidebook for England as I like to immerse myself in the culture of a place. I had just finished a university tour, climbed the tower of University Church of St. Mary the Virgin, visited the Covered Market and toured the Bodleian",
          "Reasonable price- shared the cost with other 2 friends so only had to pay about 10 quid. We hired our own punter so that helps a lot- just lie down and put your shades on with a peace of mind! Although you will enjoy seeing novice punters at work which can be hilarious at times!",
          "I used to live in Oxford and punting was always a great thing to do on a nice day! Decided to take my boyfriend on a sunny day as he's never been before. We were told the current was too strong so chauffeured punting was the only option which was fine! It's a beautiful route",
          "Our family and friends had lovely day out on the river. Great adventure. My two little kids enjoyed the most. At the start we were going no where, but once get going you will learn how it works. great fun. Love punting",

          "A great way to spend an hour in the hottest day of the year! Last July I was rushing around colleges and lectures with some pupils at the University of Oxford's Open Day- which just happened to be the hottest day of 2015. We'd spent the two days prior to that at a residential",

          "Came here on a nice day and the conditions were perfect for a ride on the river. Having tried punting before this time we opted for a pedalo. Both vessels were very good and with a bit of skill was easy to handle. If you're lucky you can see a lot of wildlife and the whole",
          "Having never been punting before, this was a great first time experience. The girl was so friendly and actually gave us tons of info about the surrounding area. Only a half hour trip but fun nonetheless :D",

          "Maybe I should have been the one to punt instead of my partner as he couldn't really get to grips with it but that was part of the fun! A lovely way to spend some quiet time with each other in the busy city and do something different that we can't do at home. Very reasonable",
          "Had a lovely time on the scenic river with a wonderful guide Nick educating us on Oxford. Would thoroughly recommend on a sunny day.",
          "We came on a autumn weekday. For the first 55 minutes of our trip we were the only ones on the river. There was no need for us to book, however in peak season it would probably be necessary. Punting is a tradition in Oxford and it is a nice thing to take part in whilst in",
          "Recently had a trip on the river. Chose a chauffeured punt as I was worried I may fall in. The Chauffeur Ewan was great. He told us a few interesting points while we cruised the river for an hour. But didn't bore us. He took us all the way to the River Thames, which if I was",
          "We had not booked in advance as we were unsure about the weather. Punting is essentially a fair weather activity. Having no experience of the art of punting and watching the antics of those who were punting themselves, we opted for chauffeured punts at \u00a325 for half an hour",
          "Glad we paid for a guy to ferry us, it was funny watching the other tourists tangle themselves up in drift wood! Knowledgable about the river whilst not intrusive. Nice a peaceful, not too long and not too short. A lovely experience.",
          "I had been punting in Cambridge about ten years ago, but never in Oxford. My siblings and I went to Oxford for the day and went for a punt, in two boats. It was a lot of fun. My brother was doing the punting on the other boat, and he provided some hysterical entertainment as he",
          "Opting for the pedaloes rather than the punted boats, we hired two boats for our family group that consisted of three adults and four children over 8 years of age. The cost was reasonable and, understandably, we had to leave a damage deposit too. The children all took turns to",
          "I took my wife and mother in law who is 86 punting , I had never done this myself but what a fantastic hour we had , stunning location , so peacefull and easier to control the boat than you think, the people that run this are so friendly, and the boss is a great chap as are all",
          "Great way to spend an idle afternoon in the sun with friends. We opted for the chauffeured experience, as falling in seemed less likely this way. We were guided by a very pleasant young man called Pat who was talkative, friendly, didn't bump into any obstacles and generally made",
          "You can either have a guide take you or if you fancy trying it yourself then why not? It's good fun but takes a bit of practice. If you go to Oxford it's something you must do. Tick it off your bucket list.",
          "Took a pedalo on this tour rather than a punt, as we thought we'd be able to manage better!! Great fun for our teenagers and 10 year old. Laughed so much and was a super way to spend an hour in Oxford. Beautiful sunny day too, which helped.",
          "We love it here and for a return visit had another excellent chauffered punt (thanks Matt!). We then returned the next day to hire a rowing boat, which was great fun although as the river was busy it was more of a dodgem circuit! We did see a young lad fall in!! The staff are",
          "We only live just south of Oxford but had been gifted a half hour 'guided' punting session on the Cherwell by some friends. It was excellent - our 'guide' Bobby managed to avoid the initial mass of self driven punt hires and took us on a very pleasant half hour circuit. We'll",
          "We generally get together as a large group at least once a year with a few beers in the punt and make an evening of it with a trip to nearby Atomic Burger for some food. The people that run it are hugely accommodating, friendly and fun. It's a great thing to do for people of all",
          "Take some time out in oxford from the hustle and bustle and enjoy a chauffeured punt, bliss! Be expertly manoeuvred past all the struggling tourists getting annoyed in the 30oC heat! Take a small (or large if you have time) bottle of champers for the adults and an ice cream for",

          "Had to do the \"punting in Oxford\" thing, didn't we ? \u00a320 for an hour and it was great fun. Very well organised and explained, we rather overloaded our punt with five big people, but we managed fine, just look out for the other loonies ! For the less adventurous there are pedalos",

          "A perfect way to get some instant life memories. Nobody is any good at it but everybody wants to have a go. Especially good if you have had a large lunch.",
          "Punting tour is one thing one should not miss while visiting Oxford... after visiting the colleges, the museum, it's time to have a boat tour along the river. You can do it yourself but if you lack confidence, you can hire someone (with a fee!) to do it for you, just sit down",
          "We went punting and took pimms with us, it was a wonderful day. We had the man do it for us, as we could see others who had attempted it themselves were stuck or finding it hard. We all sat back and relaxed, taking in the sights. The guy who was doing all the hard work was",
          "After watching some people trying to punt, we opted for a rowing boat. Once we got the hang of it it was great fun. We were lucky with the weather which helped. Definitely one of the highlights of our trip. The river wasn't very big and I can imagine that during a busy time it",
          "Do this if the weather is nice--it is lovely to punt down the Thames. A little difficult, and we were a bit scared we would capsize or fall off, but we survived--it was great and worth it--you can do it yourself or hire a punter for a few more pounds--we did ourselves.",
          "We turned up on a sunny Thursday afternoon in the school holidays and wanted two chauffeured punts. We pretty much could get straight in. Kids went in one and had a chap called. Max. He was great with the kids and let them all have a go. Very patient! The adults went on the",
          "friendly staff. We had reserved two punts on a busy sunny Sunday and had a fantastic time on the river. Highly recommended, good place to punt around as there are lots of ways to go (good when you can't turn around...) definitely gets busy though so do book!",
          "It was a scorching hot Saturday afternoon and after a short wait in the queue watching the mayhem as the brave and/or foolish wobbled off grasping their poles, we decided to pay an additional \u00a35.00 for the services of a \"Crew\" member to man our punt. This allowed us to sit back",
          "It was a beautiful summer day when we visited Oxford. Our family of 5 decided to try punting. It was a memorable experience! Super-Dad decided we didn't need a chauffeur which may have been a mistake. We had no casualties and we made it back to the dock without incident. But",
          "Invited a number of friends to Oxford this weekend. The ten of us hired two boats and self-punted. Unfortunately the weather wasn't amazing but it was good fun and I highly recommend if visiting Oxford and you have some spare time. I'd recommend booking in advance if you will",
          "Unless you are very brave or know the script don't try and impress your new girlfriend by taking her off in a punt down the Cherwell yourself, judging by some of the sights we saw you might just end up looking like a prat or worse getting an early bath. Its pricy but we paid",
          "Just the perfect end to a day sightseeing. I would recommend this brief escape down the river with a chauffeur to punt . The \u00a325 for the boat is well worth the money and if you are really daft or able, save a fiver and risk ending up in the water by punting yourself. the",
          "We found this to be a refreshing way see some of Oxford's waterways. The three of us comfortably fit in a punt and we had lovely weather as we rowed along. The bridges and buildings along the waterways were very picturesque. Thank goodness they give you a map so that you know",
          "I have now been three times punting with magdalan bridge punting and it is fabulous - this is simply one of the best experience whilst in oxford. I took 3 teenagers & 3 younger children and they all loved it. Another time it was myself and two friends! Choose from hiring a punt",
          "We wanted to hire a punt, but since neither of us knew how to use one, we had to go with a pedalo. Very easy to operate, and a relaxing way to see a little more of the town/university. The guy at the boathouse was friendly and informative.",
          "We had a relaxed and informative tour by our guide Jimmy. The idyllic way to see parts of this cultural and diverse city. Highly recommend this English classic! Our nearby hotel told us punting was 'out of season' but couldn't believe it as it was still summer! Glad we didn't",
          "Beautiful day, wanting to punt on the river. Magdalen bridge punting tour looked good. The organisation was, at best chaotic. Those queueing patiently often being bypassed by large groups being routed through the gift shop. I can understand that the company has to deal with",
          "A great, fun, relaxing way to see this beautiful corner of Oxford. Fellow punters / rowers can also provide some good entertainment. Take a few drinks on board and enjoy",
          "We booked 4 chauffeured punts as part of a Hen party celebration and from start to finish the trip was brilliant. The tour was booked through an independant hen party company and included in our trip was a full picnic hamper (4 hampers for 16 people) and two bottles of wine per",
          "It was our first punting tour with 2 teenagers and it does need some skills to move the boat properly. You might want to take a towel on board for those who can't keep their balance ;-) The kids learnt quickly and we had a lot of fun going up and down the Cherwell, past the"

        "wiki": "St Michael at the North Gate is a church in Cornmarket Street, at the junction with Ship Street, in central Oxford, England. The name derives from the church's location on the site of the north gate of Oxford when it was surrounded by a city wall.\nSince 1971, it has served as the ceremonial City Church of Oxford, and has joined the parishes of the two earlier City Churches with its own.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally built around 1000\u20131050, with the tower from 1040 still in existence, the church is Oxford's oldest building. It was constructed of Coral Rag. The church tower is Saxon. The architect John Plowman rebuilt the north aisle and transept in 1833.The Oxford Martyrs were imprisoned in the Bocardo Prison by the church before they were burnt at the stake in what is now Broad Street nearby, then immediately outside the city walls, in 1555 and 1556. Their cell door can be seen on display in the church's tower.\nSt Michael at the North Gate is the current City Church of Oxford, which is the church where the Mayor and Corporation of Oxford are expected to worship. The title was originally held by St Martin's Church at Carfax, and then by All Saints Church in the High Street after St Martin's Church was demolished in 1896. City Church status passed to St Michael's when All Saints Church was declared redundant in 1971 and was subsequently converted into the library of Lincoln College, Oxford.  The parishes of St Martin's and All Saints are now amalgamated with St Michael's.\nA ceremony, called \"beating the bounds\", is held each year on Ascension Day to mark out the boundary of the parish.  Led by the vicar, parishioners process around the old boundary stones of the parish; the vicar places a cross in chalk on each, and then church wardens hit the stones with wands made of willow, shouting \"Mark, mark, mark!\" as they do so.\n\n\n== People ==\nWilliam Morris and Jane Burden (who lived off Holywell Street nearby) were married here on 25 April 1859. The marriage certificate is on view in the Saxon tower. John Wesley's pulpit is also on view here.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnglo-Saxon architecture\nSt Mary Magdalen, Oxford, to the north\nBocardo Prison\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Parish Church of St Michael at the North Gate with St Martin and All Saints, the City Church of Oxford: official website\nPhotograph and other information on OxfordCityGuide.com\nMyTravelGuide.com information\n360\u00b0 panorama inside the church",

A good view of the city centre with its historic spires and towers of Oxford University can be obtained at the park's highest point, a favourite location for photographers.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe park is located alongside Headington Road. St Clement's links the park with central Oxford. A 19th-century bridge links the park with Headington Hill Park. On the southern boundary is the gently curving Morrell Avenue, named after a local brewery family.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe land was privately owned by the Morrell family of Headington Hill Hall until bought by the Oxford Preservation Trust in 1932 to preserve it as open space. In 1951 the Trust gave the land to the city of Oxford. A carved stone by the sculptor Eric Gill is located at the foot of the Park and records the Trust's gift thus:  'This park was acquired by the Oxford Preservation Trust through the liberality of the Pilgrim Trust and David and Joanna Randall-McIver 1932'.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\nMany events are held in the park including the annual parade of the Lord Mayor and the annual fund-raising fireworks display of the Oxford branch of Round Table.\nOn 7 July 2001, there was a music festival in the park, including Radiohead, Supergrass (who started in Oxford), Beck, Sigur R\u00f3s, Humphrey Lyttelton and two local bands, Hester Thrale and The Rock of Travolta. Over 40,000 people attended, the largest event in the park to date.\nFoodies Festivals organizes events at South Park, including master classes from chefs such as Levi Roots and Ed Baines.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHeadington Hill Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Parks in Oxford - South Park\".

        "wiki": "Hertford College ( HART-f\u0259rd) is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in England. It is located on Catte Street in the centre of Oxford, directly opposite the main gate to the Bodleian Library. The college is known for its iconic bridge, the Bridge of Sighs. There are around 600 students at the college at any one time, comprising undergraduates, graduates and visiting students from overseas.\nThe first Hertford College began in the 1280s as Hart Hall and became a college in 1740 but was dissolved in 1816. In 1820, the site was taken over by Magdalen Hall, which had emerged around 1490 on a site adjacent to Magdalen College.  In 1874, Magdalen Hall was incorporated as a college, reviving the name Hertford College. In 1974, Hertford was part of the first group of all-male Oxford colleges to admit women.Alumni of the college's predecessor institutions include William Tyndale, John Donne, Thomas Hobbes and Jonathan Swift. More recently, former students have included author Evelyn Waugh, the first female Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, the civil servants Jeremy Heywood and Olly Robbins, and the newsreaders and reporters Fiona Bruce, Carrie Gracie, Krishnan Guru-Murthy and Natasha Kaplinsky.\n\n\n== Hart Hall and the first Hertford College ==\n\n\n=== Hart Hall ===\n\nThe first Hertford College began life as Hart Hall (Aula Cervina) in the 1280s, a small tenement built roughly where the college's Old Hall is today, a few paces along New College Lane on the southern side. In mediaeval Oxford, halls were primarily lodging houses for students and resident tutors. \nThe original tenement, mentioned in the deed of 1283, which was bought by Elias de Hertford from Walter de Grendon, mercer, lay between a tenement of the university (Blackhall) on the west, and a tenement of the Prioress of Studley on the east. In the deed by which Elias de Hertford sells it to John de Dokelynton in 1301, this last tenement is called Micheldhall.  The deed was made over to his son, also Elias, in 1301. The name of the hall was likely a humorous reduction of the name of its founder's home town, and allowed for the use of the symbol of a hart to be used for identification.\nAt that time, New College Lane was known as Hammer Hall Lane (named after a hall to the east, as New College had not then been founded), and its northern side was the old town wall. The corner of Hammer Hall Lane and Catte Street (which had a postern in the wall called Smithgate) was taken by Black Hall, which was the place of John Wycliffe's imprisonment by the Vice-Chancellor around 1378. On the other side of Hart Hall along the lane was Shield Hall. On Catte Street itself was the entrance to Arthur Hall, which lay down a narrow passage behind Hart Hall, and Cat Hall (Aula Murilegorum), which stood further south, roughly where the Principal's Lodgings now stand.The younger Elias sold on Hart Hall (named in this deed as 'le Herthalle') after a month to a wealthy local fishmonger John of Ducklington, who, seven years later, bought Arthur Hall and annexed it to Hart Hall. In 1312, John sold the two halls to Walter de Stapledon, Bishop of Exeter, who desired to found a college. After just over a year, Stapledon moved his scholars to a larger site that he had purchased on Turl Street, which became Stapledon Hall, later Exeter College. However, Exeter College retained certain rights over Hart Hall, with which it plagued the hall's development for centuries.In 1379, Hart Hall and Black Hall were rented by William of Wykeham as a temporary home for his scholars as his New College, to the east along what became New College Lane, was being built. The first two Wardens of New College also appear as Principals of Hart Hall. Until the 17th century, there is evidence of scholars (including Thomas Ken) matriculating at Hart Hall while waiting for a vacancy at New College. By this time, it appears that Shield Hall had been partly taken over by Hart Hall and partly demolished to make way for New College's cloister. Although Black Hall continued a separate existence, its principal was often the same as Hart Hall's. In 1490, Hart Hall is described as having a library, which was unusual for a hall. In 1530, Hart Hall annexed Black Hall also. For some time, Cat Hall was leased by All Souls College, and then by Exeter College, until it also was subsumed into the growing Hart Hall early in the 16th century, giving the hall most of the land around what is today its Old Quadrangle.In the latter half of the 16th century, Hart Hall became known as a refuge for Catholic recusants, particularly under Philip Randell as principal (1548\u20131599). Because of its connection with Exeter College and that college's increasing puritanism, a number of Exeter's tutors and scholars migrated to Hart Hall. The hall attracted an increasing number of Catholics from further afield, including the Jesuit tutor Richard Holtby in 1574, who was instrumental in the conversion of his student, and later Jesuit martyr and saint, Alexander Briant to Catholicism. Coming from a Catholic family, the English poet John Donne came up to Hart Hall in 1584.\n\nHart Hall expanded and new buildings were put up. In the early 17th century, the current Senior Common Room was built as lodgings for the principal. From this period also, the main entrance of the hall moved from being a narrow passage off New College Lane to a gate on Catte Street. By the late 17th century, Cat Hall is described as being used as 'the ball-court of Hart Hall'. In the latter part of the 17th century, the principal, Dr William Thornton, provided a proper gate for the Catte Street entrance of the hall, and decorated with a device of a drinking hart with the motto Sicut cervus anhelat ad fontes aquarum ('As the hart panteth after the water brooks', taken from Psalm 42, verse 1, but in a peculiar translation). Although the current gatehouse is not Thornton's original, it retains the design and motto, and houses the original decorated gates. It has been suggested that this frieze with its Latin motto is the real counterpart of the one translated for the waiting crowd by the title character of Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure.In 1692, the political satirist Jonathan Swift was incorporated from Trinity College, Dublin, on the books of Hart Hall to receive his MA.\n\n\n=== Richard Newton's Hertford College ===\nOn 28 July 1710, the Rev Dr Richard Newton was admitted principal of Hart Hall. Newton was a well-connected, energetic, educational reformer. He was appointed principal from 'a very peaceful retirement' as Rector of Sudborough, where he was personal tutor to two brothers, who were both destined to be prime minister \u2014 Thomas Pelham-Holles and Henry Pelham \u2014 bringing the younger with him to Hart Hall. He dedicated himself to raising the hall from debt and securing a firmer financial endowment. Newton planned to redesign the hall around a proper quadrangle, with a tutor, or angler, and students living in each angle, and common buildings along the sides. However, only two buildings in his design were ever built: one angle in the south-east corner of the Old Quadrangle (nowadays known as the Cottage), and his simple stone Chapel on the south side (consecrated 25 November 1716), which now serves as the college's Library. These buildings were financed entirely from Newton's pocket, to the sum of around \u00a32000 (around \u00a3301,000 adjusted for inflation).In 1720, Newton published his Scheme of Disciplines laying out his scheme of education with a view to obtaining a charter of incorporation, and, on 18 May 1723, he presented his petition for a charter. The proposal met immediate opposition, especially from Exeter College, exercising its old rights, and All Souls, desiring to expand northward onto the hall's land. In addition, the appointments of principals for the various halls had established itself in a game of promotion, and a few would-be principals opposed the plan. John Conybeare, then a Fellow of Exeter, and later Bishop of Bristol, was Newton's most ardent opponent, penning the book Calumny Refuted against Newton's reforms. After years of struggle, Richard Newton's statutes were accepted on 3 November 1739, and the charter incorporating 'the Principal and Fellows of Hertford College' (Principalis et Socii Collegii Hertfordiensis) was received on 8 September 1740.Newton's Hertford was a relatively spartan college, having received no real endowment. Meals were simple and cheap, and the principal insisted on eating the same as everyone else. Students were expected to work hard, and, where Newton found the university's education lacking, he supplemented it with disputations within the college. Newton allowed gentlemen-commoners to matriculate at the college, but they paid double fees for the same accommodation and food as the others. They were originally allowed to wear their coloured gowns and tufted caps, but Newton eventually made them wear the ordinary black gown. Thus, many a well-to-do family sent their sons to Hertford College to instil in them some disciplined education, unlike the privileged wining and dining had by gentlemen-commoners in other colleges.\n\n\n=== Decline and dissolution ===\nAfter Richard Newton's death in 1753, the principalship of the college fell to a succession of men mostly lacking the desire or energy to continue their predecessor's plan. One exception to this succession was David Durell, who built up the reputation and academic success of the college. Under Durell, the future statesman Charles James Fox matriculated in 1764 (Hertford, unusually for Oxford, was a Whig college). However, the scheme of four tutors in their respective angles was reduced to two, and cheaper junior fellows took over some of the burden of tutoring. It was at Hertford that the tutor Benjamin Blayney prepared his 1769 Standard Edition of the Authorized King James Version of the Bible. Apart from Durell's principalship, the college went into decline due to the mismanagement of uninterested principals and the lack of decent endowments. In May 1805, Bernard Hodgson, last principal of Hertford College died, and no suitable successor could be found and agreed upon. By 1810, matriculation had ceased, and the last students were awarded their degrees. The last tutor and vice-principal, Richard Hewitt, continued to live in his rooms without students until May 1816, when a commission declared Hertford College dissolved.\n\n\n== Magdalen Hall and the second Hertford College ==\n\n\n=== Magdalen Hall ===\n\nMagdalen Hall was founded around 1490 on a site to the west of Magdalen College and next to Magdalen's grammar school. The site is now Magdalen's St Swithun's quadrangle. It took the name of an earlier Magdalen Hall in the High Street, which was founded by William Waynflete in 1448 and then closed on the opening of Magdalen College in 1458. The first master of the grammar school was appointed in 1480, and its original school building was erected in 1486. However, as the hall took independent students as well as those belonging to the college, it quickly became an independent institution under its own principal.\nThe hall was known for its adherence to the teachings of John Wycliffe, and William Tyndale, translator of the English Bible and martyr, studied there. Another famous student of the hall was the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes, who came up in either 1601 or 1602. At the English Civil War, Magdalen Hall was known as a Puritan hall under the principalship of Henry Wilkinson. Famous Puritan graduates include Philip Nye, key adviser to Oliver Cromwell on matters of religion and regulation of the Church. The hall rarely used a badge of arms, but, when it did, it used the same arms as the college.At the time of the demise of the first Hertford College, Magdalen College had long been searching for a way of expelling Magdalen Hall in order to expand into its buildings. Before the demise of Hertford, Magdalen College conspired to make its site ready to receive a transplanted Magdalen Hall. The current Lodge of Hertford College thus still bears the arms of Magdalen Hall (and so also of Magdalen College) beside those of Hertford College (and Hart Hall) and the university.\n\n\n=== Move to Catte Street ===\n\nJohn Macbride became both principal of Magdalen Hall and Lord Almoner's Professor of Arabic in 1813, and plans to move the hall to the site of Hertford College were already afoot. On 15 March 1815, Magdalen College submitted a proposal for the move to Convocation. Magdalen College proposed to repair the Hertford buildings and defray the expense of Magdalen Hall's move to the site, while the hall were to relinquish claim to their own buildings to Magdalen College. An Act of Parliament was passed supporting the plan, but no move was made until a fire accidentally started by an undergraduate on 9 January 1820 destroyed almost half of Magdalen Hall's buildings. Not long after this, one of Hertford College's buildings on Catte Street, so flimsy that it was known as the 'paper building', collapsed. With this motivation, the new foundation stone of Magdalen Hall was laid at the new site on 3 May 1820, and the hall's migration was complete by 1822. The Catte Street frontage was pulled down and rebuilt, and several buildings had an extra storey added to them. Magdalen Hall expanded to fill the space, and became the largest hall by far, numbering 214 members in 1846. Macbride and his vice-principals were active in building up the refounded Magdalen Hall. To distance the hall from its namesake college, Macbride attempted to change the name to 'Magdalene Hall', but this change was never accepted. Macbride served as principal for 54 years, until his death in 1868. The Macbride Sermon, one of the University Sermons, is preached each Hilary term in the Chapel of Hertford College in his memory.\n\n\n=== Refounding of Hertford College ===\n\nDuring John Macbride's principalship it became clear that the growing, energetic Magdalen Hall should be incorporated as a college to match its academic standing in the university. Since the name 'Magdalen College' was already taken, the favoured option was the revival of 'Hertford College'. Macbride was succeeded as principal by his vice-principal, Richard Michell, in 1868. He brought a bill before Parliament in 1873 for the incorporation of Magdalen Hall as Hertford College. The bill received significant financial support from Thomas Baring, then newly elected MP for South Essex. Baring had been a Fellow of Brasenose College, and had offered a substantial endowment of fellowships and scholarships to that college, but it had been refused, as Brasenose rejected his conditions of restricting the funds to members of the Church of England. However, to ease the passage of the bill, Baring removed his condition to the first instalment of the endowment (subsequent instalments were restricted), and Magdalen Hall was incorporated as 'the Principal, Fellows, and Scholars of Hertford College' (Principalis, Socii, et Scholastici Collegii Hertfordiensis) on 7 August 1874. Thus, Michell became the last principal of Magdalen Hall and the first principal of the refounded Hertford College.\nBaring bought a house across New College Lane from the college to serve as fellows' lodgings (at some point this house was named Clarendon House), which was the first move of the college onto the northern side of New College Lane. This was soon followed by the purchase of other houses on that side of the road, which were collectively known as \u00c6des, and the old Chapel of Our Lady at Smithgate (which is now the Octagon, housing the Middle Common Room). Also during this period, a gatehouse was built on the Catte Street frontage and the old doors were reinstalled there. A new dining hall was built above the gatehouse, and much of the northern side of the Old Quadrangle, apart from Old Hall, was rebuilt.\n\nIn 1877, Henry Boyd succeeded Michell, becoming the second principal of the refounded Hertford College. His energy, good connections and longevity created the modern college as it is today. Boyd's name appears carved on the landmark Bridge of Sighs, and he is commemorated by a memorial in the Chapel (to the left of the chancel) and a portrait in the Hall (at the west end of High Table). Boyd's partnership with the architect Thomas Graham Jackson brought about the expansion of the college and its endowment with its iconic 'Anglo-Jackson' buildings. In 1887, Jackson began work on the Gatehouse, the Hall and its spiral staircase, and the north range of the Old Quad. In 1901, Jackson started building the college's site on the northern side of New College Lane. By 1908, he had completed a new Chapel, which he declared to be his favourite work. Eventually, after much opposition, he built the Bridge of Sighs, linking the Old and New Quads across New College Lane, in 1913.In the two world wars, a total of 171 members of Hertford College died (those of World War I are commemorated by a memorial on the south wall of the chancel in the Chapel, while those of World War II are remembered in a memorial in the portico, to the right of the Chapel door). Notable among them is Major Percy Nugent FitzPatrick, son of James Percy FitzPatrick, who was killed near Cambrai on 14 December 1917. It was with the death of his son that James Percy FitzPatrick made the suggestion after the war's end to keep a two-minute silence each year on Armistice Day.\n\nIn 1922, the novelist Evelyn Waugh came up to Hertford, famously feuding with his history tutor C. R. M. F. Cruttwell (who was to become the fourth principal of the refounded college, 1930\u20131939), and later naming a number of odious characters after him. Waugh wrote of his time at Hertford, 'I do no work here and never go to Chapel'. He novelised his time at Oxford in Brideshead Revisited, having his protagonist Charles Ryder at Hertford.\nStarting from 1965, Hertford made a special effort to encourage applicants from state schools through the Hertford Scheme established by Physics Fellow Neil Tanner, in which candidates were interviewed early, outside the standard application process, and could be offered a place at the college without having to sit the university entrance exam. This had the effect of dramatically raising academic standards within the college, and other colleges introduced similar initiatives.  Today, around 70% of undergraduate students at the college come from UK state schools. This percentage of individuals from state schools (out of all UK applicants/students) is higher than at most Oxford colleges.  This commitment to diversity is in keeping with Hertford's earlier history of openness: in 1907 Hertford admitted the first African-American Rhodes Scholar, Alain Leroy Locke, after he had been refused by several other colleges.\nGeoffrey Warnock served as the 9th Principal of the refounded college from 1971 until 1988, and presided over the latest period of growth, and established the college's leftist credentials. In 1974, Hertford became one of the first five co-educational colleges in the university (the others being Brasenose, Jesus College, St Catherine's, and Wadham). The college now has an almost equal gender balance, with slight variations from year to year. In memory of Warnock, the college has a student-accommodation building near Folly Bridge named after him. He also has a memorial in the Chapel, and a portrait behind High Table in the Hall.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\nHertford College's main site is situated on Catte Street, New College Lane and Holywell Street. The site consists of three quadrangles: Old Quadrangle, New Quadrangle, and Holywell Quadrangle. The college also has three large groups of buildings for student accommodation near Folly Bridge: Warnock House, the Graduate Centre and Abingdon House. In addition to these, the college owns a number of houses around Oxford.\n\n\n=== Old Quadrangle ===\nThe Old Quadrangle (known as Old Quad or OB Quad, for Old Buildings) is, as the name suggests, the oldest and the original quadrangle. Its entrance is the through the Gatehouse on Catte Street, directly opposite the main gates of the Bodleian Library. The Gatehouse is a late 19th-century building by Thomas Graham Jackson, bearing the image of a drinking hart above the archway. However, the wooden doors with their colourful floral decoration are the original gates of Hart Hall from the 17th century. The Gatehouse houses the Lodge.\nThrough the Gatehouse, the quadrangle is laid out around a pleasant lawn with a few decorative trees. The lawn is off-limits during Michaelmas and Hilary terms but is accessible during Trinity term for sitting on (at any time) and croquet (on Fridays and Sundays only). \n\nIn the north-east corner of the quad is the Old Hall, the oldest remaining buildings of Hart Hall, dating from the 1570s. The Old Hall and its adjoining Buttery are now in regular use for dining, especially by the Fellows. Running southwards, along the eastern side of the quad, is a 17th-century building, with oriel windows tucked away on its southern end. Originally, the portion closest to the Old Hall was student accommodation, and the southern portion was the principal's lodgings. Today the building is mostly taken over by the Senior Common Room, with the northern ground-floor room being the Old Library. In the south-east corner is the 18th-century Cottage, the only one of the planned four 'angles' of Dr Newton that was ever built. Originally, this occupied the entire corner, around to what was the chapel (and is now the library). Its southern side was demolished to make way for Jackson's Chapel.\n\nThe southern side of the quad consists of the Chapel, built in 1908 by Jackson, which has a particularly good acoustic. Its ante-chapel houses a stained-glass window depicting William Tyndale, made in 1911 for the British and Foreign Bible Society, and installed at Hertford in 1994. West of the Chapel is the Library, which was the previous chapel built in the 18th century by Newton. The Library possesses many fine, antique books, most of which belonged to the library of Magdalen Hall. Among these are many rare 17th-century manuscripts and an original edition of Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan given as a personal gift to the college: Hobbes prepared this work while at Magdalen Hall.\nThe western side of the quad has the Gatehouse, with the Lodge, in its centre. On either side of this are slightly earlier buildings, the southern of which is the Principal's Lodgings, and the northern mostly houses the college's offices. In addition, the north-west building has access onto the Bridge of Sighs. Above the Gatehouse is the dining Hall, which is wood-panelled and hung with a number of college portraits. The hall is reached from the quad by a distinctive stone spiral staircase designed by Jackson, and inspired by the spiral staircase at the Ch\u00e2teau de Blois.\nThe northern side of the quad consists of a building by Jackson, much of which now houses the Bursary. The building is infamous as the site of the incident novelised in Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited in which Sebastian Flyte, returning from a Bullingdon Club bender vomits through a window into a ground-floor room.\n\n\n=== New Quadrangle ===\n\nThe New Quadrangle (known as New Quad or NB Quad, for New Buildings) is connected to the Old Quadrangle, across New College Lane, by the Bridge of Sighs, which was designed by Thomas Graham Jackson. The north-western corner of New Quad is taken up by the Indian Institute building, which is not part of Hertford College. Most of the New Buildings are early 20th-century designs by Jackson, except the slightly later frontage onto Holywell Street, on the northern side of the quad. The quad is entered through a gate onto Catte Street, just opposite the Clarendon Building. New Quad is mostly used for undergraduate accommodation.\nThe most significant building in the quad is the Octagon, just north of the gate on Catte Street, which houses the Middle Common Room. It is the 16th-century Chapel of St Mary the Virgin at Smithgate, which formed a bastion in the town walls. An original carving of the scene of the Annunciation can be seen from Catte Street, just beside the gate.\n\n\n=== Holywell Quadrangle ===\n\nHolywell Quadrangle backs directly onto New Quad, and the two are connected by an arched corridor that also contains the steps down to Hertford's subterranean bar. Holywell Quad was built in 1975, and is almost exclusively for first-year undergraduate housing. Its main features are a gate onto Holywell Street, the Junior Common Room in the south-east corner, and the Baring Room (named after Thomas Baring, the college's major benefactor) which is a multi-purpose hall at the top of the southern staircase.\n\n\n== Student life ==\nUndergraduate students are accommodated for the full three or four years of their study, either on the main site or on college-owned property primarily in North Oxford and the Folly Bridge area. A new Hertford Graduate Centre fronting the Isis was built near Folly Bridge and was opened in 2000.\nHertford is home to a college cat named Simpkin, who lives in the College Lodge and is the fourth of his lineage, collectively Simpkins, the collective noun for Hertford College cats; the original was called Simpkin and was introduced by the former college principal Geoffrey Warnock, named after the cat in the Beatrix Potter novel The Tailor of Gloucester. He is provided with a bursary by alumni to cover his food and veterinary treatment.\n\n\n=== Academic achievement ===\nHertford's exam results are slightly above average. In the Norrington Table of results over the period 2006\u20132012 it has come 17th, 9th, 18th, 6th, 12th, 5th and 23rd.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nHertford College Boat Club is among the leading Oxford college boat clubs: both its women's and men's first boats are in the first division of Torpids and Eights Week, with both M1 and W1 winning \"blades\" in the 2015 edition of Torpids. The boats and club room are in the Longbridges boathouse on the Isis. With the transition of Magdalen Hall to Hertford College in 1874, the old blue-black of the hall stopped racing in 1873, and the new red-white of the college took to the river in 1875. Within only seven years of its refoundation, the college came Head of the River in the annual college boat races, in 1881. On achieving that victory, the crew carried their boat all the way back to the college and burnt it just inside the gates. The college archives possess a letter detailing the club's celebrations from the sub-librarian of the Bodleian Library, who spent the night on the scaffolding surrounding the work on the Old Schools Tower, directly opposite the Hertford gate, in case the fire spread to the library. In 2005, the boathouse was gutted by an arson attack carried out by the Animal Liberation Front, in protest against animal testing at the university. The new boathouse was rebuilt on the same site.The college was endowed with a new well-equipped gym in 2011 and has playing fields in New Marston, which include a pavilion with facilities for most major team sports.\nIn August 2013 Hertford College Rugby Club became the first team from the UK to tour Mongolia in official partnership with the Mongolian Rugby Football Union. They played matches against The Mongolia Defense University and the Ulaan Baatar Warriors. Both matches were played in the national stadium and broadcast live on Mongolian national television. In 2017, the team returned to Mongolia, this time playing two matches against the Ulaanbaatar Warriors.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nHertford College has the largest and most active music society of any Oxford college, drawing in musicians from around the university, with ensembles including the Hertford College Orchestra, the Hertford College Chapel Choir, the Hertford College Wind Band, the Hertford College Jazz Band and the Hertford College Bruckner Orchestra. \nThere are two competitive organ scholarships. The Chapel's fine acoustic lends itself to concerts and recitals, and it is frequently used for recording.\n\n\n== People associated with the college ==\n\n\n=== Principals ===\n\nThe current Principal of the college, from 2011, is the political economist and former newspaper editor Will Hutton.\n\n\n=== Selected current Professorial and Tutorial Fellows ===\nThe college has over 30 Tutorial Fellows in the subjects it offers at undergraduate level. \n\nHagan Bayley, Professor of Chemical Biology\nCharlotte Brewer, Professor of English Language and Literature, Tutor in English\nDame Kay Davies, FRS, Dr Lee's Professor of Anatomy\nMartin C.J.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Folly Bridge is a stone bridge over the River Thames carrying the Abingdon Road south from the centre of Oxford, England. It was erected in 1825\u201327, to designs of a little-known architect, Ebenezer Perry (died 1850), who practised in London.The bridge is in two parts separated by an island. The origin of the name is uncertain although it has been suggested that it originated about 1650 after a tenant of Bacon's study.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe bridge apparently stands at the site of the ford over which oxen could be driven across the Isis, the ancient name of the Thames in the Oxford area. The first known stone bridge on the site was built by Robert d'Oilli in around 1085, but there was believed to be a wooden bridge in the time of Ethelred of Wessex. Remains of the Saxon structure may still be seen beneath the present bridge.\nUntil the late 17th century the bridge was known as South Bridge, and formed part of a long causeway known as Grandpont, which stretched along most of the line of Abingdon Road. In the 13th century, the alchemist Roger Bacon lived and worked at \"Friar Bacon's Study\" which stood across the north end of the bridge until 1779, when it was removed to widen the road. Samuel Pepys visited Bacon's study in 1669, noting: \"So to Friar Bacon's study: I up and saw it, and gave the man 1s\". In 1369, when there was a grant of pontage on \"Grauntpount\", the structure was said to be \"so dangerous as to be well nigh impassable\".\nA toll-booth gateway tower used to straddle the approach to the bridge, which was on the Abingdon to Banbury turnpike. The former bridge and \"Bacon's Tower\" were drawn by many artists, including the twelve-year-old J. M. W. Turner.There was also a weir underneath the bridge which had a flash lock and later a \"pen\" lock. At the beginning of the 19th century this and the poor state of the bridge itself constituted a problem for navigation. Surveys discovered that the foundations were in a very bad state, and in 1815 an Act of Parliament was obtained to rebuild the bridge and remove the \"Tackle and Works\" underneath. The new bridge works were begun in 1824 and completed in 1827. A pound lock was established nearby in about 1832, which was removed in 1884. The bridge is Grade I listed.The toll house was rebuilt in 1844 and is now, along with the bridge, also Grade II listed; tolls on the bridge were abolished in 1850. A scheme for a public footbridge next to the bridge was designed by Nicholas Grimshaw & Partners but was not built.\n\n\n== Environs ==\n\nRobert Gunther, the historian of science, bought 5 Folly Bridge, an unusual castellated house by the bridge, in 1911. The house is embellished with statues and cast iron balconies on the outside. It is located on a small island in the middle of the Thames.\nSalters Steamers are located near the bridge. Punts are available close to the bridge and Christ Church Meadow is just downstream. The Head of the River public house is next to the bridge to the northeast, with views of the bridge and river.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland originated as a story told on a boating trip which began at Folly Bridge.The novel Folly Bridge: A Romantic Tale was written by David Leslie Murray and published in 1945.\nThe 1970 book Last Boat to Folly Bridge was written by the sailor Eric C. Hiscock.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCrossings of the River Thames\nSt Aldate's, to the north\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFolly Bridge drawing, 1896\nToll House at Folly Bridge\nFolly Road Bridge at Structurae\nFolly Bridge (2002) at Structurae",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "North Hinksey is a village and civil parish in Oxfordshire, England, immediately west of Oxford.  The civil parish includes the large settlement of Botley, effectively a suburb of Oxford. North Hinksey was part of Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred it to Oxfordshire.\nThe village of North Hinksey has a manor house, The Fishes public house, a Church of England primary school and a Church of England parish church, St. Lawrence's, which dates back to at least the 12th century.  Four of the older houses have thatched roofs.  There was also the administrative offices of the Church of England Diocese of Oxford (Diocesan Church House) in the enlarged former vicarage. This, as of September 2016 is to be converted to housing. Harcourt Hill and Raleigh Park lie to the southwest of the village.\nAll the shopping and other facilities in the parish are now found in Botley. The centre of the old village is now effectively cut off from much of the newer part of Botley by the busy Oxford Ring Road, part of the A34 trunk road, though there are two pedestrian underpasses.\nThe parish has a cemetery which includes 671 identified Commonwealth war graves.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlso called Hengestesige (10th century); Hengsteseia (12th century); Henxtesey (13th century); Northengseye (15th century); Laurence Hinksey, Ferry Hinksey, Ivy Hinksey, (passim).\nNorth Hinksey was anciently called Hengestseigge, and was given in 955 to Abingdon Abbey. This place was settled in the Saxon era. Its toponym is thought to mean 'stallion's isle'. Along with the neighbouring village of South Hinksey, it was once part of the estate of the Benedictine abbey at Abingdon, and was in Berkshire until the boundary changes of 1974.  The village appears on the 1610 John Speed map as 'Laurence Hinksey', after the church's dedication, while a 1670s map shows 'Ivy Hinksey'.  It was also at one time called Ferry Hinksey, being linked to the eastern side of Hinksey Stream by a small ferry, reached from west Oxford by way of Ferry Hinksey Road.  The ferry ceased operation in 1928, and the various streams are now crossed by small bridges, though a 'Ferry Cottage' remains that matches the period and has access to the river. Ferry Hinksey (as it then was) is also the burial place of Thomas and Rachael Willis (died 1648 and 1631 respectively) the parents of the physician Dr Thomas Willis. He played an important part in the history of anatomy, neurology, and psychiatry, and was a founding member of the Royal Society.\n\n\n== John Ruskin and the diggers ==\nThe critic John Ruskin was fond of riding out from Oxford, and his trips often took him westwards to North Hinksey, whose rustic charm he admired.  (There is a plaque to this effect on one of the old thatched cottages.)  He noted the poor state of the village road, and in 1874, he thought of a scheme which would give Oxford students the benefits of manual labour, and also improve conditions for the villagers.  He organised a group of undergraduates to help him in the building of an improved road, bordered with banks of flowers.  The episode might have vanished into historical obscurity, except that the students in his road-building gang included Oscar Wilde, Alfred Milner, Hardwicke Rawnsley, William Gershom Collingwood and Arnold Toynbee.  Wilde later wrote of the episode in Art and the Handicraftsman (published in Essays, 1879):\n\nWe were coming down the street\u2014a troop of young men, some of them like myself only nineteen, going to river or tennis-court or cricket-field\u2014when Ruskin going up to lecture in cap and gown met us.  He seemed troubled and prayed us to go back with him to his lecture, which a few of us did, and there he spoke to us not on art this time but on life, saying that it seemed to him to be wrong that all the best physique and strength of the young men in England should be spent aimlessly on cricket ground or river, without any result at all except that if one rowed well one got a pewter-pot, and if one made a good score, a cane-handled bat. He thought, he said, that we should be working at something that would do good to other people, at something by which we might show that in all labour there was something noble.  Well, we were a good deal moved, and said we would do anything he wished.  So he went out round Oxford and found two villages, Upper and Lower Hinksey, and between them there lay a great swamp, so that the villagers could not pass from one to the other without many miles of a round. And when we came back in winter he asked us to help him to make a road across this morass for these village people to use.  So out we went, day after day, and learned how to lay levels and to break stones, and to wheel barrows along a plank\u2014a very difficult thing to do. And Ruskin worked with us in the mist and rain and mud of an Oxford winter, and our friends and our enemies came out and mocked us from the bank.  We did not mind it much then, and we did not mind it afterwards at all, but worked away for two months at our road.  And what became of the road? Well, like a bad lecture it ended abruptly\u2014in the middle of the swamp.  Ruskin going away to Venice, when we came back for the next term there was no leader, and the 'diggers', as they called us, fell asunder.\n\n\n== Local topography ==\nIt remains difficult to travel from North Hinksey to South Hinksey, although the Oxford Ring Road now links the two villages.\n\nThe most notable path between Oxford and North Hinksey is a metalled bridleway and cycle track variously known as Willow Walk and Ruskin's Ride.  This path was built in 1876\u201377 by Aubrey Harcourt (1852\u20131904), a major local landowner, but not open to the public until 1922.  There is also a smaller unmade path which begins alongside the large back garden of The Fishes and crosses Hinksey Stream by a bridge at the site of the old ferry.\n\n\n=== Raleigh Park ===\n\nRaleigh Park, comprising woodland, grassland and unusual alkaline boggy areas, lies in North Hinksey just west of the Oxford ring road. It is managed by Oxford City Council and conservation work is done by the Friends of Raleigh Park and the Oxford Conservation Volunteers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHinksey\nHinksey Stream\nNew Hinksey\nSouth Hinksey\nBotley, Oxfordshire\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPage, W.H.; Ditchfield, P.H., eds.

        "wiki": "Cowley () in Oxford, England, is a residential and industrial area that forms a small conurbation within greater Oxford. Cowley's neighbours are central Oxford to the northwest, Rose Hill and Blackbird Leys to the south, New Headington to the north and the villages of Horspath and Garsington across fields to the east.  Internationally, Cowley is best known for its automotive industry - historically it was the home of the car manufacturer Morris (later absorbed into British Leyland, then the Rover Group), which has now evolved into MINI.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Cowley area has been inhabited since Roman times. The line of a Roman road runs north-south along the eastern edge of Cowley. It linked a Roman town at Dorchester-on-Thames with a Roman military camp at Alchester near Bicester. A road called Roman Way follows part of its route. It is behind the Mini car factory, starting opposite the Stagecoach in Oxfordshire bus garage.\nCowley coalesced from the former villages of Middle Cowley, Temple Cowley and Church Cowley (around St James church), though the ancient parish of Cowley covered much of the area now known as East Oxford. The western portion of the original parish of Cowley was split off and became part of the city of Oxford in 1889, and was given the name of Cowley St John, though today it is often called the Cowley Road area, after the road across the fields from Oxford to Cowley villages. The term Cowley today usually refers to the remainder of Cowley (the parish of Cowley St James where the original Cowley villages stood), which became part of the city of Oxford in 1928. However, because the settlements of Cowley were situated within the larger Cowley parishes, there are still some modern contexts (such as the Cowley Fathers mentioned below) when the term \"Cowley\" is used to refer to other areas in East Oxford outside of Cowley proper.\nCowley was a manor from Mediaeval times, and a 16th-century manor house stood on Oxford Road near the corner with Hollow Way. In 1139, Matilda of Boulogne founded Temple Cowley here for the Knights Templar. The house became part of the Oxford Military College which was built on its grounds in the 19th century. In 1864, the Wycombe Railway between High Wycombe and Oxford was built through Cowley, but at this time the village was so small that the railway company did not provide it with a station.\nCowley St. James C of E school, situated on Beauchamp Lane adjacent to the church, was established in 1834 and continued to operate as a primary school until 1975. Its most famous pupil was William Morris, later Lord Nuffield, who founded Morris Motors which was the source of a great deal of local employment leading to substantial growth in the area. A public house is named after him located in the nearby Templar Square shopping centre. Another well-known pupil of the school was the actress Dame Maggie Smith.\nIn 1866 the Society of St. John the Evangelist, a Church of England religious order, was founded near Cowley Road in the parish of Cowley.  SSJE was the first long-lasting Anglican religious order for men since the Reformation.  The members were frequently known as the \"Cowley Fathers\".\nIn 1868 the Eddison and Nodding Company factory was founded in Cowley. John Allen bought it in 1897 and renamed it the Oxford Steam Plough Company. He later renamed it again as John Allen and Sons, and diversified into manufacturing other agricultural and horticultural machinery including the successful Allen Scythe powered by a small Villiers petrol engine. The works closed in the early 1980s, and the John Allen Centre retail park has since been built on the site.\nThe Oxford Military College bought the former Cowley Middle Class School in 1876. The College hall, a former manor house, was built in the early 17th century. The Chapel of 1870 was designed by the architect Edward George Bruton. An east wing designed by Sir Thomas Graham Jackson was added in 1877. The Oxford Military College closed in 1896, developed from 1912 by William Morris as the Cowley plant.\nDuring the 1960s, the centre of Cowley was demolished and replaced with Templars Square shopping centre (previously it had been known as \"Cowley Centre\", and sometimes still is). In the same decade the railway between Princes Risborough and Oxford closed, but the track between Kennington Junction and Cowley remains open for freight in and out of the car factory.\nBetween 1980 and 1992 the Headquarters of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKWMO) was located in a converted barracks building at Cowley Barracks on James Wolfe Road, Cowley. The UKWMO was the organisation responsible for initiating the famous Four-minute warning in the event of a nuclear attack on the UK and was disbanded at the end of the Cold War. Co-located with HQUKWMO was the Headquarters of No 3 Oxford Group Royal Observer Corps whose underground protected nuclear bunker at the Cowley site opened in 1965. Parts of the bunker were demolished in 1995, however most of it was refurbished including the air filtration systems. The site now belongs to Oxford Brookes University who built student accommodation on the site, and now use the former bunker as a storage facility making it the only student halls in the country with its own nuclear shelter.\n\n\n=== Morris Motors ===\n\nThe Cowley area was transformed after 1912 when William Morris bought the former Oxford Military College and moved Morris Motors Limited into it from its former premises in Oxford. He expanded into \"The Old Tin Shed\" in 1914 and then into a huge complex of purpose-built production lines in Cowley, as Morris pioneered Henry Ford-style mass production in the UK.\nThe Great Western Railway, which had taken over the Wycombe Railway, opened a station called Morris Cowley to serve some of the thousands of workers commuting to the factory. In 1933, a goods yard was built beside the line to bring supplies into the factory and take completed vehicles away. This yard still exists and serves the current vehicle-manufacturing plant, though the railway beyond has long been lifted.\nFrom the 1920s through to the 1960s, Cowley expanded into a huge industrial centre. In the Great Depression many people left areas of high unemployment such as South Wales and moved to the Cowley area to work in Cowley's factories. Large areas of housing were built and rented out to the migrants. Florence Park was one area built in the 1920s for a private landlord to rent to new workers. The houses looked nice but they were poorly built and maintained, until the tenants held a rent strike and forced the landlord to make repairs. Most Florence Park houses are now owner-occupied, and the area's tree-lined roads are now a popular neighbourhood in which to live.\nIn World War II the Morris factory produced many de Havilland Tiger Moth training aeroplanes for the war effort and there was also the No 1 Metal and Produce Recovery Depot run by the Civilian Repair Organisation to handle crashed or damaged aircraft and even the wreckage of enemy aircraft was processed here. Paul Nash was inspired to paint Totes Meer based on sketches he made of the recovery depot.\nDespite successive company mergers and name changes, \"Morris's\" is still often used as the name of the car factory to this day. In 1952, Morris Motors became part of the British Motor Corporation (BMC), in 1968 BMC became British Leyland, in the 1980s the group was known as Austin Rover, in the 1990s it was Rover Group and since 2001 the factory has been owned by BMW. But the name \"Morris's\" is ingrained in local culture and speech habits, particularly amongst older inhabitants.\nBy the early 1970s, over 20,000 people worked in Cowley at the vast Morris Motors and Pressed Steel Fisher plants. Unipart is also a major employer in Cowley, with premises next to the car factory.\nIn later years Morris Motors and Pressed Steel became one company. Subsequently the Morris's site was closed down, demolished, and redeveloped as the Oxford Business Park.\n\n\n== Cowley today ==\nThe car factory is known today as Plant Oxford and is now owned by BMW and has been extensively redeveloped. It remains the largest industrial employer in Oxfordshire employing more than 4,300 people. The plant was set up in 1926 by a consortium including William Morris and the Budd Company of America and was adjacent to the Morris Motors factory.  Morris and the Budd Company both pulled out of the consortium and the plant became an independent supplier of bodies and tooling to Morris and other car manufacturers across the world. The company also produced the Prestcold refrigerators. When BMW sold the Rover Group they decide to retain the Pressed Steel site and transfer the Mini from Longbridge to Cowley, enabling the Longbridge site to continue to produce all the Rover products.\nBMW retained ownership of the Cowley plant, formerly Pressed Steel, to build the all-new Mini that was launched in the spring of 2001. It has been the best selling car to be built at the plant since the Maestro and Montego in the 1980s.\nThe Morris Motors factory expanded with factory complexes on both sides of the Oxford Road. Although Morris started his original work on the outskirts of the city the Cowley site quickly became the production site for high volume production. It was the original base of Morris cars when the marque was founded in 1912, and production continued at the factory until 1982, with models including the Morris Minor, Morris Oxford, Riley and Wolsely cars. The Morris marque was not abandoned until 1984 when production of the Longbridge-built Morris Ital and development of the Marina finished. The factory then became the production facility for the Maestro, Montego and the Princess Range.  Production continued with the facility totally given over to production of the Rover 600 and Rover 800. These models were replaced by the Rover 75 in late 1998, but BMW broke up the Rover Group in 2000 and Rover 75 production moved to Longbridge. The original Morris Motor sites were flattened and a technology park has since been created on the site.\nThe former Nuffield Press site including the former Oxford Military College buildings was redeveloped in the late 1990s into housing.\nThe business park has attracted a large David Lloyd Leisure centre and offices of numerous companies including the European headquarters of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and the headquarters of international aid charity Oxfam GB.\nCowley is an ethnically diverse community, with significant black and South Asian communities.\n\n\n== Sports and leisure ==\n\nCowley has a strong sporting tradition. In 1938 Oxford Stadium was built to host the sport of greyhound racing. In 1939 motorcycle speedway moved to Oxford Stadium. After a few years Oxford's speedway team were named Oxford Cheetahs, a name they still bear today.\nUntil 2009 on Watlington Road, opposite the Mini factory, stood Johnson's Caf\u00e9, which fed thousands of Morris Motors workers in the past. It was founded decades ago by Len Johnson and until its final day its interior was decorated with bold murals of early speedway stars. Len's son Joe Johnson was an international motocross star in the 1960s until he settled down to take over the family caf\u00e9. The caf\u00e9 remained in the family to the end under Len's grandson Bob Johnson. This cafe suffered an armed robbery on 16 January 2008 and closed in 2009. The building is now occupied by Oxford Spin & Fitness centre.\nTemple Cowley Pools in Temple Road was a public swimming and gymnasium complex run by Oxford City Council which closed in December 2014 for redevelopment as housing. Its main pool was 25 metres long. It was built on the site of part of a former Knights Templar estate. [1] Opposite the site of the former pool is the band hall of the City of Oxford Silver Band and next door to it stands Cowley Library,. Oxfordshire Record Office occupies the former St Luke's church nearby. Morris Motors Athletic & Social Club in nearby Crescent Road has a large sports ground and club house.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSchools serving Cowley include St Gregory the Great Catholic School.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nCowley is a principal setting in the novel The Alteration by Kingsley Amis, set in an alternative reality where the Protestant Reformation never occurred. Cowley was the site of the Holy Victory in the War of English Succession (where 'Henry the Abominable' attempted to seize the throne from his nephew Stephen II, resulting in a papal crusade). As a result, it was renamed Coverley and made the ecclesiastical capital of England, surpassing the secular capital of London in terms of importance.\nOn his 1992 tour of England (heard on the posthumously released Shock and Awe album), the comedian and satirist Bill Hicks stated that he had found the \"Alabama of Britain\" whilst attending a radio interview in Cowley.Cowley is referenced in the lyrics of the song \"Zorbing\" by the British alternative indie folk band Stornoway: \"Been Zorbing through the streets of Cowley\".\n\n\n== Famous people born in Cowley ==\nThe writer, Gladys Mitchell, born April 21, 1901.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLobel, Mary D, ed.

        "wiki": "Blenheim Palace (pronounced  BLEN-im) is a monumental country house in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, England.  It is the principal residence of the Dukes of Marlborough, and the only non-royal, non-episcopal country house in England to hold the title of palace.  The palace, one of England's largest houses, was built between 1705 and 1722, and designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987.The palace is named for the 1704 Battle of Blenheim, and thus ultimately after Blindheim (also known as Blenheim) in Bavaria. It was originally intended to be a reward to John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough for his military triumphs against the French and Bavarians in the War of the Spanish Succession, culminating in the Battle of Blenheim. The land was given as a gift, and construction began in 1705, with some financial support from Queen Anne. The project soon became the subject of political infighting, with the Crown cancelling further financial support in 1712, Marlborough's three-year voluntary exile to the Continent, the fall from influence of his duchy and lasting damage to the reputation of the architect Sir John Vanbrugh.\nDesigned in the rare, and short-lived, English Baroque style, architectural appreciation of the palace is as divided today as it was in the 1720s. It is unique in its combined use as a family home, mausoleum and national monument. The palace is notable as the birthplace and ancestral home of Sir Winston Churchill.\nFollowing the palace's completion, it became the home of the Churchill (later Spencer-Churchill) family for the next 300 years, and various members of the family have wrought changes to the interiors, park and gardens. At the end of the 19th century, the palace was saved from ruin by funds gained from the 9th Duke of Marlborough's marriage to American railroad heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt.\n\n\n== Churchills ==\n\nJohn Churchill was born in Devon. Although his family had aristocratic relations, it belonged to the minor gentry rather than the upper echelons of 17th-century society. In 1678, Churchill married Sarah Jennings, and in April that year, he was sent by Charles II to The Hague to negotiate a convention on the deployment of the English army in Flanders. The mission ultimately proved abortive. In May, Churchill was appointed to the temporary rank of Brigadier-General of Foot, but the possibility of a continental campaign was eliminated with the Treaty of Nijmegen. When Churchill returned to England, the Popish Plot resulted in a temporary three-year banishment for James Stuart, Duke of York. The Duke obliged Churchill to attend him, first to The Hague, then in Brussels. For his services during the crisis, Churchill was made Lord Churchill of Eyemouth in the peerage of Scotland in 1682, and the following year appointed colonel of the King's Own Royal Regiment of Dragoons.\n\nOn the death of Charles II in 1685, his brother, the Duke of York, became King James II. James had been Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company (today North America's oldest company, established by royal charter in 1670), and with his succession to the throne, Churchill was appointed the company's third ever governor. He had also been affirmed Gentleman of the Bedchamber in April, and admitted to the English peerage as Baron Churchill of Sandridge in the county of Hertfordshire in May. Following the Monmouth Rebellion, Churchill was promoted to Major General and awarded the lucrative colonelcy of the Third Troop of Life Guards. When William, Prince of Orange, invaded England in November 1688, Churchill, accompanied by some 400 officers and men, rode to join him in Axminster. When the King saw he could not even keep Churchill\u2014for so long his loyal and intimate servant\u2014he fled to France. As part of William III's coronation honours Churchill was created Earl of Marlborough, sworn to the Privy Council, and made a Gentleman of the King's Bedchamber.During the War of the Spanish Succession Churchill gained a reputation as a capable military commander, and in 1702 he was elevated to the dukedom of Marlborough. During the war he won a series of victories, including the Battle of Blenheim (1704), the Battle of Ramillies (1706), the Battle of Oudenarde (1708), and the Battle of Malplaquet (1709). For his victory at Blenheim, the Crown bestowed upon Marlborough the tenancy of the royal manor of Hensington (situated on the site of Woodstock) to site the new palace, and Parliament voted a substantial sum of money towards its creation. The rent or petit serjeanty due to the Crown for the land was set at the peppercorn rent or quit-rent of one copy of the French royal flag to be tendered to the Monarch annually on the anniversary of the Battle of Blenheim. This flag is displayed by the Monarch on a 17th-century French writing table in Windsor Castle.Marlborough's wife was by all accounts a cantankerous woman, though capable of great charm. She had befriended the young Princess Anne and later, when the princess became Queen, the Duchess of Marlborough, as Her Majesty's Mistress of the Robes, exerted great influence over the Queen on both personal and political levels. The relationship between Queen and Duchess later became strained and fraught, and following their final quarrel in 1711, the money for the construction of Blenheim ceased. For political reasons the Marlboroughs went into exile on the Continent until they returned the day after the Queen's death on 1 August 1714.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\nThe estate given by the nation to Marlborough for the new palace was the manor of Woodstock, sometimes called the Palace of Woodstock, which had been a royal demesne, in reality little more than a deer park. Legend has obscured the manor's origins. King Henry I enclosed the park to contain the deer. Henry II housed his mistress Rosamund Clifford (sometimes known as \"Fair Rosamund\") there in a \"bower and labyrinth\"; a spring in which she is said to have bathed remains, named after her. It seems the unostentatious hunting lodge was rebuilt many times, and had an uneventful history until Elizabeth I, before her succession, was imprisoned there by her half-sister Mary I between 1554 and 1555. Elizabeth had been implicated in the Wyatt plot, but her imprisonment at Woodstock was short, and the manor remained in obscurity until bombarded and ruined by Oliver Cromwell's troops during the Civil War. When the park was being re-landscaped as a setting for the palace the 1st Duchess wanted the historic ruins demolished, while Vanbrugh, an early conservationist, wanted them restored and made into a landscape feature. The Duchess, as so often in her disputes with her architect, won the day and the remains of the manor were swept away.\n\n\n== Architect ==\n\nThe architect selected for the ambitious project was a controversial one. The Duchess was known to favour Sir Christopher Wren, famous for St Paul's Cathedral and many other national buildings. The Duke however, following a chance meeting at a playhouse, is said to have commissioned Sir John Vanbrugh there and then. Vanbrugh, a popular dramatist, was an untrained architect, who usually worked in conjunction with the trained and practical Nicholas Hawksmoor. The duo had recently completed the first stages of the Baroque Castle Howard. This huge Yorkshire mansion was one of England's first houses in the flamboyant European Baroque style. The success of Castle Howard led Marlborough to commission something similar at Woodstock.\n\nBlenheim, however, was not to provide Vanbrugh with the architectural plaudits he imagined it would. The fight over funding led to accusations of extravagance and impracticality of design, many of these charges levelled by the Whig factions in power. He found no defender in the Duchess of Marlborough. Having been foiled in her wish to employ Wren, she levelled criticism at Vanbrugh on every level, from design to taste. In part their problems arose from what was demanded of the architect. The nation (which was then assumed, by both architect and owners, to be paying the bills) wanted a monument, but the Duchess wanted not only a fitting tribute to her husband but also a comfortable home, two requirements that were not compatible in 18th-century architecture. Finally, in the early days of the building the Duke was frequently away on his military campaigns, and it was left to the Duchess to negotiate with Vanbrugh. More aware than her husband of the precarious state of the financial aid they were receiving, she criticised Vanbrugh's grandiose ideas for their extravagance.Following their final altercation, Vanbrugh was banned from the site. In 1719, whilst the Duchess was away, Vanbrugh viewed the palace in secret. However, when his wife visited the completed Blenheim as a member of the viewing public in 1725, the Duchess refused his wife admission even to enter the park.Vanbrugh's severe massed Baroque used at Blenheim never truly caught the public imagination, and was quickly superseded by the revival of the Palladian style. Vanbrugh's reputation was irreparably damaged, and he received no further truly great public commissions. For his final design, Seaton Delaval Hall, which was hailed as his masterpiece, he used a refined version of the Baroque employed at Blenheim. He died shortly before its completion.\n\n\n== Funding the construction ==\n\nThe precise responsibility for the funding of the new palace has always been a debatable subject, unresolved to this day. The palace as a reward was mooted within months of the Battle of Blenheim, at a time when Marlborough was still to gain many further victories on behalf of the country. That a grateful nation led by Queen Anne wished and intended to give their national hero a suitable home is beyond doubt, but the exact size and nature of that house is questionable. A warrant dated 1705, signed by the parliamentary treasurer the Earl of Godolphin, appointed Vanbrugh as architect and outlined his remit. Unfortunately for the Churchills, nowhere did this warrant mention Queen or Crown.The Duke of Marlborough contributed \u00a360,000 to the initial cost when work commenced in 1705, which, supplemented by Parliament, should have built a monumental house. Parliament voted funds for the building of Blenheim, but no exact sum was mentioned nor provision for inflation or over-budget expenses. Almost from the outset, funds were spasmodic. Queen Anne paid some of them, but with growing reluctance and lapses, following her frequent altercations with the Duchess. After their final argument in 1712, all state money ceased and work came to a halt. \u00a3220,000 had already been spent and \u00a345,000 was owing to workmen. The Marlboroughs were forced into exile on the continent, and did not return until after the Queen's death in 1714.\n\nOn their return the Duke and Duchess came back into favour at court. The 64-year-old Duke now decided to complete the project at his own expense. In 1716 work resumed, but the project relied completely upon the limited means of the Duke himself. Harmony on the building site was short-lived, as in 1717 the Duke suffered a severe stroke, and the thrifty Duchess took control. The Duchess blamed Vanbrugh entirely for the growing costs and extravagance of the palace, the design of which she had never liked. Following a meeting with the Duchess, Vanbrugh left the building site in a rage, insisting that the new masons, carpenters and craftsmen, brought in by the Duchess, were inferior to those he had employed. The master craftsmen he had patronised, however, such as Grinling Gibbons, refused to work for the lower rates paid by the Marlboroughs. The craftsmen brought in by the Duchess, under the guidance of furniture designer James Moore, and Vanbrugh's assistant architect Hawksmoor, completed the work in perfect imitation of the greater masters.\n\nFollowing the Duke's death in 1722, completion of the palace and its park became the Duchess's driving ambition. Vanbrugh's assistant Hawksmoor was recalled and in 1723 designed the \"Arch of Triumph\", based on the Arch of Titus, at the entrance to the park from Woodstock. Hawksmoor also completed the interior design of the library, the ceilings of many of the state rooms and other details in numerous other minor rooms, and various outbuildings. Cutting rates of pay to workmen, and using lower-quality materials in unobtrusive places, the widowed Duchess completed the great house as a tribute to her late husband. The final date of completion is not known, but as late as 1735 the Duchess was haggling with Rysbrack over the cost of Queen Anne's statue placed in the library. In 1732 the Duchess wrote \"The Chappel is finish'd and more than half the Tomb there ready to set up\".\n\n\n== Design and architecture ==\n\nVanbrugh planned Blenheim in perspective;   that is, to be best viewed from a distance. As the site covers some seven acres (28,000 m\u00b2) this is also a necessity.\n\nThe plan of the palace's principal block (or corps de logis) is a rectangle (see plan) pierced by two courtyards; these serve as little more than light wells. Contained behind the southern facade are the principal state apartments; on the east side are the suites of private apartments of the Duke and Duchess, and on the west along the entire length of the piano nobile is given a long gallery originally conceived as a picture gallery, but is now the library. The corps de logis is flanked by two further service blocks around square courtyards (not shown in the plan). The east court contains the kitchens, laundry, and other domestic offices, the west court adjacent to the chapel the stables and indoor riding school. The three blocks together form the \"Great Court\" designed to overpower the visitor arriving at the palace. Pilasters and pillars abound, while from the roofs, themselves resembling those of a small town, great statues in the Renaissance manner of St Peter's in Rome gaze down on the visitor below, who is rendered inconsequential. Other assorted statuary in the guise of martial trophies decorate the roofs, most notably Britannia standing atop the entrance pediment in front of two reclining chained French captives sculpted in the style of Michelangelo,  and the English lion devouring the French cock, on the lower roofs. Many of these are by such masters as Grinling Gibbons.In the design of great 18th-century houses comfort and convenience were subservient to magnificence, and this is certainly the case at Blenheim. This magnificence over creature comfort is heightened as the architect's brief was to create not only a home but also a national monument to reflect the power and civilisation of the nation. To create this monumental effect, Vanbrugh chose to design in a severe Baroque style, using great masses of stone to imitate strength and create shadow as decoration.\n\nThe solid and huge entrance portico on the north front resembles more the entrance to a pantheon than a family home. Vanbrugh also liked to employ what he called his \"castle air\", which he achieved by placing a low tower at each corner of the central block and crowning the towers with vast belvederes of massed stone, decorated with curious finials (disguising the chimneys). Coincidentally these towers, which hint at the pylons of an Egyptian temple, further add to the heroic pantheonesque atmosphere of the building.There are two approaches to the palace's grand entrance, one from the long straight drive through wrought iron gates directly into the Great Court; the other, equally if not more impressive, betrays Vanbrugh's true vision: the palace as a bastion or citadel, the true monument and home to a great warrior. Piercing the windowless, city-like curtain wall of the east court is the great East Gate, a monumental triumphal arch, more Egyptian in design than Roman. An optical illusion was created by tapering its walls to create an impression of even greater height. Confounding those who accuse Vanbrugh of impracticality, this gate is also the palace's water tower. Through the arch of the gate one views across the courtyard a second equally massive gate, that beneath the clock tower, through which one glimpses the Great Court.\n\nThis view of the Duke as an omnipotent being is also reflected in the interior design of the palace, and indeed its axis to certain features in the park. It was planned that when the Duke dined in state in his place of honour in the great saloon, he would be the climax of a great procession of architectural mass aggrandising him rather like a proscenium. The line of celebration and honour of his victorious life began with the great column of victory surmounted by his statue and detailing his triumphs, and the next point on the great axis, planted with trees in the position of troops, was the epic Roman style bridge. The approach continues through the great portico into the hall, its ceiling painted by James Thornhill with the Duke's apotheosis, then on under a great triumphal arch, through the huge marble door-case with the Duke's marble effigy above it (bearing the ducal plaudit \"Nor could Augustus better calm mankind\"), and into the painted saloon, the most highly decorated room in the palace, where the Duke was to have sat enthroned.The Duke was to have sat with his back to the great 30-tonne marble bust of his vanquished foe Louis XIV, positioned high above the south portico. Here the defeated King was humiliatingly forced to look down on the great parterre and spoils of his conqueror (rather in the same way as severed heads were displayed generations earlier). The Duke did not live long enough to see this majestic tribute realised, and sit enthroned in this architectural vision. The Duke and Duchess moved into their apartments on the eastern side of the palace, but the entirety was not completed until after the Duke's death.The palace has been Grade I listed on the National Heritage List for England since August 1957.\n\n\n=== Palace chapel ===\nThe palace chapel, as a consequence of the Duke's death, now obtained even greater importance. The design was altered by the Marlboroughs' friend the Earl of Godolphin, who placed the high altar in defiance of religious convention against the west wall, thus allowing the dominating feature to be the Duke's gargantuan tomb and sarcophagus. Commissioned by the Duchess in 1730, it was designed by William Kent, and statues of the Duke and Duchess depicted as Caesar and Caesarina adorn the great sarcophagus. In bas relief at the base of the tomb, the Duchess ordered to be depicted the surrender of Marshal Tallard. However, the theme throughout the palace of honouring the Duke did not reach its apotheosis until the dowager duchess's death in 1744. Then, the Duke's coffin was returned to Blenheim from its temporary resting place, Westminster Abbey, and husband and wife were interred together and the tomb erected and completed. Now Blenheim had indeed become a pantheon and mausoleum. Successive Dukes and their wives are also interred in the vault beneath the chapel. Other members of family are interred in St. Martin's parish churchyard at Bladon, a short distance from the palace.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nThe internal layout of the rooms of the central block at Blenheim was defined by the court etiquette of the day. State apartments were designed as an axis of rooms of increasing importance and public use, leading to the chief room. The larger houses, like Blenheim, had two sets of state apartments each mirroring each other. The grandest and most public and important was the central saloon (\"B\" in the plan) which served as the communal state dining room. To either side of the saloon are suites of state apartments, decreasing in importance but increasing in privacy: the first room (\"C\") would have been an audience chamber for receiving important guests, the next room (\"L\") a private withdrawing room, the next room (\"M\") would have been the bedroom of the occupier of the suite, thus the most private. One of the small rooms between the bedroom and the internal courtyard was intended as a dressing room. This arrangement is reflected on the other side of the saloon. The state apartments were intended for use by only the most important guests such as a visiting sovereign. On the left (east) side of the plan on either side of the bow room (marked \"O\") can be seen a smaller but nearly identical layout of rooms, which were the suites of the Duke and Duchess themselves. Thus, the bow room corresponds exactly to the saloon in terms of its importance to the two smaller suites.Blenheim Palace was the birthplace of the 1st Duke's famous descendant, Winston Churchill, whose life and times are commemorated by a permanent exhibition in the suite of rooms in which he was born (marked \"K\" on the plan). Blenheim Palace was designed with all its principal and secondary rooms on the piano nobile, thus there is no great staircase of state: anyone worthy of such state would have no cause to leave the piano nobile. Insofar as Blenheim does have a grand staircase, it is the series of steps in the Great Court which lead to the North Portico. There are staircases of various sizes and grandeur in the central block, but none are designed on the same scale of magnificence as the palace. James Thornhill painted the ceiling of the hall in 1716. It depicts Marlborough kneeling to Britannia and proffering a map of the Battle of Blenheim. The hall is 67 ft (20 m) high, and remarkable chiefly for its size and for its stone carvings by Gibbons, yet in spite of its immense size it is merely a vast anteroom to the saloon.The saloon was also to have been painted by Thornhill, but the Duchess suspected him of overcharging, so the commission was given to Louis Laguerre. This room is an example of three-dimensional painting, or trompe l'\u0153il, \"trick-the-eye\", a fashionable painting technique at the time. The Peace Treaty of Utrecht was about to be signed, so all the elements in the painting represent the coming of peace. The domed ceiling is an allegorical representation of Peace: John Churchill is in the chariot, he holds a zigzag thunderbolt of war, and the woman who holds back his arm represents Peace. The walls depict all the nations of the world who have come together peacefully. Laguerre also included a self-portrait placing himself next to Dean Jones, chaplain to the 1st Duke, another enemy of the Duchess, although she tolerated him in the household because he could play a good hand at cards. To the right of the doorway leading into the first stateroom, Laguerre included the French spies, said to have big ears and eyes because they may still be spying. Of the four marble door-cases in the room displaying the Duke's crest as a prince of the Holy Roman Empire, only one is by Gibbons, the other three were copied indistinguishably by the Duchess's cheaper craftsmen.The third remarkable room is the long library designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor in 1722\u201325, (H), 183 ft (56 m) long, which was intended as a picture gallery. The ceiling has saucer domes, which were to have been painted by Thornhill, had the Duchess not upset him. The palace, and in particular this room, was furnished with the many valuable artefacts the Duke had been given, or sequestered as the spoils of war, including a fine art collection. Here in the library, rewriting history in her own indomitable style, the Duchess set up a larger than life statue of Queen Anne, its base recording their friendship.From the northern end of the library\u2014in which is housed the largest pipe organ in private ownership in Europe, built by England's great organ builder Henry Willis & Sons\u2014access is obtained to the raised colonnade which leads to the chapel (H). The chapel is perfectly balanced on the eastern side of the palace by the vaulted kitchen. This symmetrical balancing and equal weight given to both spiritual and physical nourishment would no doubt have appealed to Vanbrugh's renowned sense of humour, if not the Duchess's. The distance of the kitchen from even the private dining room (\"O\" on the plan) was obviously of no consideration, hot food being of less importance than to avoid having to inhale the odour of cooking and proximity of servants.\n\n\n== Pipe organs ==\n\nThe Long Library organ was built in 1891 by the famous London firm of Henry Willis & Sons at a cost of \u00a33,669. It replaced a previous organ built in 1888 by Isaac Abbott of Leeds, which was removed to St Swithun's church, Hither Green. Originally erected in the central bay, with its back to the water terraces, the Norwich firm of Norman & Beard moved it to the northwestern end of the library in 1902 and made a few tonal additions and, the following year, cleaned it. No further changes were made until 1930, when the Willis firm lowered the pitch to modern concert pitch: a Welte automatic player was added in 1931, with 70 rolls cut by Marcel Dupr\u00e9, Joseph Bonnet, Alfred Hollins, Edwin Lemare and Harry Goss-Custard also being supplied. This remained in use for some time: the Duke of the time is said to have frequently sat at the organ bench and pretended to play the organ to his guests and they would applaud at the end. This practice is said to have been halted abruptly when the player started before the Duke had reached the organ. This famous instrument is regularly maintained and is played by visiting organists throughout the year, but its condition is declining: a fundraising campaign has been launched for its complete restoration.The organ in the chapel was built circa 1853 by Robert Postill of York: it is notable as a rare unaltered example of this fine builder's work, speaking boldly and clearly into a generous acoustic.\n\n\n== Park and gardens ==\n\nBlenheim sits in the centre of a large undulating park, a classic example of the English landscape garden movement and style. When Vanbrugh first cast his eyes over it in 1704 he immediately conceived a typically grandiose plan: through the park trickled the small River Glyme, and Vanbrugh envisaged this marshy brook traversed by the \"finest bridge in Europe\". Thus, ignoring the second opinion offered by Sir Christopher Wren, the marsh was channelled into three small canal-like streams and across it rose a bridge of huge proportions, so huge it was reported to contain some 30-odd rooms. While the bridge was indeed an amazing wonder, in this setting it appeared incongruous, causing Alexander Pope to comment: \"the minnows, as under this vast arch they pass, murmur, 'how like whales we look, thanks to your Grace.'\"Horace Walpole saw it in 1760, shortly before Capability Brown's improvements: \"the bridge, like the beggars at the old duchess's gate, begs for a drop of water and is refused.\" Another of Vanbrugh's schemes was the great parterre, nearly half a mile long and as wide as the south front. Also in the park, completed after the 1st Duke's death, is the Column of Victory. It is 134 ft (41 m) high and terminates a great avenue of elms leading to the palace, which were planted in the positions of Marlborough's troops at the Battle of Blenheim. Vanbrugh had wanted an obelisk to mark the site of the former royal manor, and the trysts of Henry II which had taken place there, causing the 1st Duchess to remark, \"If there were obelisks to bee made of all what our Kings have done of that sort, the countrey would bee stuffed with very odd things\" (sic). The obelisk was never realised.\n\nFollowing the 1st Duke's death the Duchess concentrated most of her considerable energies on the completion of the palace itself, and the park remained relatively unchanged until the arrival of Capability Brown in 1764. The 4th Duke employed Brown who immediately began an English landscape garden scheme to naturalise and enhance the landscape, with tree planting, and man-made undulations. However, the feature with which he is forever associated is the lake, a huge stretch of water created by damming the River Glyme and ornamented by a series of cascades where the river flows in and out. The lake was narrowed at the point of Vanbrugh's grand bridge, but the three small canal-like streams trickling underneath it were completely absorbed by one river-like stretch. Brown's great achievement at this point was to actually flood and submerge beneath the water level the lower stories and rooms of the bridge itself, thus reducing its incongruous height and achieving what is regarded by many as the epitome of an English landscape. Brown also grassed over the great parterre and the Great Court. The latter was re-paved by Duchene in the early 20th century. The 5th Duke was responsible for several other garden follies and novelties.Sir William Chambers, assisted by John Yenn, was responsible for the small summerhouse known as \"The Temple of Diana\" down by the lake, where in 1908 Winston Churchill proposed to his future wife.The extensive landscaped park, woodlands and formal gardens of Blenheim are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Blenheim Park is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.\n\n\n== Failing fortunes ==\n\nOn the death of the 1st Duke in 1722, as both his sons were dead, he was succeeded by his daughter Henrietta. This was an unusual succession and required a special Act of Parliament, as only sons can usually succeed to a dukedom. When Henrietta died, the title passed to Marlborough's grandson Charles Spencer, Earl of Sunderland, whose mother was Marlborough's second daughter Anne.The 1st Duke, as a soldier was not a rich man and what fortune he possessed was mostly used for finishing the palace. In comparison with other British ducal families, the Marlboroughs were not very wealthy. Yet they existed quite comfortably until the time of the 5th Duke of Marlborough (1766\u20131840), a spendthrift who considerably depleted the family's remaining fortune. He was eventually forced to sell other family estates, but Blenheim was safe from him as it was entailed. This did not prevent him selling the Marlboroughs' Boccaccio for a mere \u00a3875 and his own library in over 4000 lots. On his death in 1840, his profligacy left the estate and family with financial problems.By the 1870s, the Marlboroughs were in severe financial trouble and in 1875 the 7th Duke sold the Marriage of Cupid and Psyche, together with the famed Marlborough gems, at auction for \u00a310,000. However this was not enough to save the family. In 1880, the 7th Duke was forced to petition Parliament to break the protective entail on the Palace and its contents. This was achieved under the Blenheim Settled Estates Act of 1880 and the door was now open for wholesale dispersal of Blenheim and its contents. The first victim was the great Sunderland Library which was sold in 1882, including such volumes as The Epistles of Horace, printed at Caen in 1480, and the works of Josephus, printed at Verona in 1648. The 18,000 volumes raised almost \u00a360,000. The sales continued to denude the palace: Raphael's Ansidei Madonna was sold for \u00a370,000; Van Dyck's Equestrian Portrait of Charles I realised \u00a317,500; and finally the \"piece de resistance\" of the collection, Peter Paul Rubens' Rubens, His Wife Helena Fourment, and Their Son Peter Paul, and Their Son Frans (1633\u20131678), which had been given by the city of Brussels to the 1st Duke in 1704, was also sold, and is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.These sums of money, vast by the standards of the day, failed to cover the debts and the maintenance of the great palace remained beyond the Marlboroughs' resources. These had always been small in relation to their ducal rank and the size of their house. The British agricultural depression, which started in the 1870s added to the family's problems. When the 9th Duke inherited in 1892, the land was generating dwindling income.\n\n\n== 9th Duke of Marlborough ==\n\nCharles, 9th Duke of Marlborough (1871\u20131934) can be credited with saving both the palace and the family. Inheriting the near-bankrupt dukedom in 1892, he was forced to find a quick and drastic solution to the problems. Prevented by the strict social dictates of late 19th-century society from earning money, he was left with one solution: he had to marry money. In November 1896 he coldly and openly without love married the American railroad heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt. The marriage was celebrated following lengthy negotiations with her divorced parents: her mother, Alva Vanderbilt, was desperate to see her daughter a duchess, and the bride's father, William Vanderbilt, paid for the privilege. The final price was $2,500,000 ($76.8 million today) in 50,000 shares of the capital stock of the Beech Creek Railway Company with a minimum 4% dividend guaranteed by the New York Central Railroad Company. The couple were given a further annual income each of $100,000 for life. The bride later claimed she had been locked in her room until she agreed to the marriage. The contract was actually signed in the vestry of St. Thomas Episcopal Church, New York, immediately after the wedding vows had been made. In the carriage leaving the church, Marlborough told Consuelo he loved another woman, and would never return to America, as he \"despised anything that was not British\".The replenishing of Blenheim began on the honeymoon itself, with the replacement of the Marlborough gems. Tapestries, paintings and furniture were bought in Europe to fill the depleted palace. On their return the Duke began an exhaustive restoration and redecoration of the palace. The state rooms to the west of the saloon were redecorated with gilt boiseries in imitation of Versailles. Vanbrugh's subtle rivalry to Louis XIV's great palace was now completely undermined, as the interiors became mere pastiches of those of the greater palace. While this redecoration may not have been without fault (and the Duke later regretted it), other improvements were better received. Another problem caused by the redecoration was that the state and principal bedrooms were now moved upstairs, thus rendering the state rooms an enfilade of rather similar and meaningless drawing rooms. On the west terrace the French landscape architect Achille Duch\u00eane was employed to create a water garden. On a second terrace below this were placed two great fountains in the style of Bernini, scaled models of those in the Piazza Navona which had been presented to the 1st Duke.\n\nBlenheim was once again a place of wonder and prestige. However, Consuelo was far from happy; she records many of her problems in her cynical and often less than candid biography The Glitter and the Gold. In 1906 she shocked society and left her husband, finally divorcing in 1921. She subsequently married a Frenchman, Jacques Balsan. She died in 1964, having lived to see her son become Duke of Marlborough, and frequently returning to Blenheim, the house she had hated and yet saved, albeit as the unwilling sacrifice.After his divorce the Duke married again, to a former friend of Consuelo, Gladys Deacon, another American. This eccentric lady was of an artistic disposition, and a painting of her eyes still remains on the ceiling of the great north portico (see secondary lead image). A lower terrace was decorated with sphinxes modelled on Gladys and executed by W. Ward Willis in 1930. Before her marriage while staying with the Marlboroughs she had caused a diplomatic incident by encouraging the young Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany to form an attachment. The prince had given her an heirloom ring, which the combined diplomatic services of two empires were charged to recover. After her marriage Gladys was in the habit of dining with the Duke with a revolver by the side of her plate. Tiring of her the Duke was temporarily forced to close Blenheim, and turn off the utilities to drive her out. They subsequently separated but did not divorce. The Duke died in 1934 and his widow in 1977.The 9th Duke was succeeded by his and Consuelo Vanderbilt's eldest son: John, 10th Duke of Marlborough (1897\u20131972), who after eleven years as a widower, remarried at the age of 74, to (Frances) Laura Charteris, formerly the wife of the 2nd Viscount Long and the 3rd Earl of Dudley, and granddaughter of the 11th Earl of Wemyss. The marriage was short-lived, however; the Duke died just six weeks later, on 11 March 1972. The bereaved Duchess complained of \"the gloom and inhospitality of Blenheim\" after his death, and soon moved out. In her autobiography, Laughter from a Cloud (1980), she referred to Blenheim Palace as \"The Dump\". She died in London in 1990.\n\n\n== Second World War ==\nDuring the war the 10th Duke welcomed the boys from Malvern College as evacuees, and in September 1940 allowed the Security Service (MI5) to use the palace as its base until the end of the war.\n\n\n== The palace today ==\n\nThe palace remains the home of the Dukes of Marlborough, the present incumbent of the title being Charles James (Jamie) Spencer-Churchill, 12th Duke of Marlborough. Charles James succeeded to the Dukedom upon his father's death on 16 October 2014.As of October 2016, the Marlboroughs still have to tender a copy of the French royal flag to the Monarch on the anniversary of the Battle of Blenheim as rent for the land that Blenheim Palace stands on.The palace, park, and gardens are open to the public on payment of an entry fee (maximum \u00a324.90 as of October 2016). Separation of tourist entertainment attractions (the \"Pleasure Gardens\") from the palace ensures that the atmosphere of a large country house is retained. The palace is linked to the gardens by a miniature railway, the Blenheim Park Railway.Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill, the brother of the current Duke, wished to feature a contemporary art programme within the historic setting of the palace where he spent his childhood. He founded Blenheim Art Foundation (BAF), a non-profit organisation, to present large-scale contemporary art exhibitions. BAF launched on 1 October 2014 with the UK's largest ever exhibition by Ai Weiwei. The foundation was conceived to give a vast number of people access to innovative contemporary artists working in the context of this historic palace.The public have free access to about five miles (8 km) of public rights of way through the Great Park area of the grounds, which are accessible from Old Woodstock and from the Oxfordshire Way, and which are close to the Column of Victory.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Baroque residences\nBlenheim Palace in film and media\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBingham, Jane (2015).

During the War of the Spanish Succession, he had led the English to victory over the French and Bavarians at the Battle of Blenheim in Germany in 1704. The palace was designed by Sir John Vanbrugh, with a great deal of involvement by Nicholas Hawksmoor, and is regarded as the finest example of truly Baroque architecture in Great Britain.Woodstock, England: Blenheim PalaceNorth front of Blenheim Palace, Woodstock, Oxfordshire, England; designed by Sir John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor and built in 1705\u201325.\u00a9 4orty7even/FotoliaIn the early 18th century Queen Anne\u2019s gardener, Henry Wise, designed the grounds of the palace in the formal style of Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre\u2019s famed gardens for Vaux-le-Vicomte and Versailles in France. Little remains of Wise\u2019s landscaping, however, because tastes changed in the mid-18th century, and Lancelot (Capability) Brown was asked to redesign the grounds in his pastoral style of informal or seemingly natural landscapes of woods, lawns, and waterways.

          "A fantastic evening with the family. A highlight of our Christmas holiday. A leisurely walk through the gardens with many different areas lit by wonderful lighting displays and accompanying music. When booking we were warned it would be an hour or so to tour. We took over 2&1/2",
          "This was very enjoyable, even more as it was a dry mildish evening. Not too crowded either. The changing lighting, accompanying music were very creative, and done to the same high standard as at London's Kew Gardens. Good to have hot chocolate with marshmallow to warm up too.",
          "I was there with my dad on New Year\u2019s Day. My dad was in a mobility scooter and toppled over just after the illuminated arch near the gingerbread cottage. I was advised at the time of booking that the trail and path was suitable for disabled and mobility scooters. The patch that",
          "Absolutely brilliant. A walk through the grounds split into different illuminated zones. Very well done.",
          "We were lucky to be here at a time they were presenting an Alice in Wonderland themed exhibition throughout - but the Alice paraphernalia didn't detract from the awesome architecture, decorations, paintings and sensational grounds. Justifiably a national and International",
          "Myself, my Husband and our two friends visited Alice in the Palace and the Illuminated trail on New Years Day 2020, and what a fantastic day we had. We couldn't believe how beautifully the Place had been decorated. Every room had more wonders to behold, telling the story of",
          "Visited between Christmas and New Year. Booked parking which I highly recommend. However, there is a park and ride service available as well. There was plenty to see but I think they lacked attractions on the walk back towards the end of the trail. Very nice evening out",
          "The palace, the grounds, the illuminated walk, Alice in the Palace, Mad Hatter's tea in the Orangery, the little steam train, the maze, etc., etc., etc. : a fabulous place and a simply fabulous Christmas event that had the family engrossed for the whole day. My favourite part:",
          "We went to see the special Christmas \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d theme decorations. We had not been to the castle before. It was amazing. Even from the outside it is difficult to imagine how massive and majestic this castle is. From the entryway through the corridors and large",
          "We went to Blenheim specifically for Alice in the Palace and we were not disappointed. It was absolutely STUNNING. Each room seemed more beautiful than the last. The amount of detail and thought that must have gone into it all. The staff were lovely and really sweet with my",
          "Absolutely stunning decorations - the attention to detail made for a magical visit as one of our favourite stories was brought to life. Can't wait to find out the theme for next year! \u2663\ufe0f\u2666\ufe0f\u2660\ufe0f\u2764",
          "I made the trek out to Blenheim only to find that the palace has been temporarily devoted to Alice in Wonderland\u2014that the tour would not be about the palace and that the Churchill exhibit was closed. The Oxford TI didn\u2019t explain this. A disappointment.",
          "Staff were lovely and very helpfull, was an interesting experience with some of the old palace decorated with the Alice in Wonderland theme. All was to a high standard to look at, but for the high price was expecting a bit more interactive stuff and maybe something to take away",
          "We took our two young boys (6 and 3) for the Christmas lights and Alice In The Palace and they loved it! What a lovely setting for such a wonderful attraction. Alice in the Palace was good although I can imagine it might get a bit \"samey\" every year, whereas the lights trail",
          "This was a treat given us by our son and his wife who live in the UK. We were visiting from South Africa. Parking was easy - they bought a parking ticket too. The Christmas market had closed the day before so that was a bit disappointing as it was only 15 Dec. the lights were",
          "My first trip to Blenheim was in 2018 for Cinderella in the palace and the illuminated trail. Now, I'm not sure if I was just so overwhelmed by seeing the beauty of the palace for the first time that I felt so blown away or if Cinderella was really that much better. While the",

          "Another great show, an hour and half walk and lots to see. Great fun for all ages. Can't wait for 2020 display.",
          "This was our first trip to Blenheim Palace. The family had booked tickets for the illuminated Christmas Trail as a birthday present. Didn't really know what to expect, having been told to wrap up warm and wear good sturdy boots! Glad I listened to good advice as it was blooming",
          "We had a wonderful morning at Blenheim Palace. We will make the most of the annual pass to go back and see the Palace with out the Christmas decorations. The access to the palace is excellent and very accessible friendly for wheelchairs. The two young men on the wheelchair lift",
          "The light trail was a delight, the lights to the music was a big hit. My favourite was the oil fire lights. Lots of music to sing along too to make it feel extra festive. Only downside was the stupidly expensive hot chocolate stall trying to rip people off who have already paid",
          "We visited at the beginning of December, 6 of us including 3 children and 1 wheelchair user. I reserved a wheelchair in advance by phone and it was there for us as promised. Although the only parking option available when I booked was the park & ride, it was no problem to drive",
          "We were first timers for the Christmas light 'trail' at Blenheim so cannot comment on if previous years have been better. It was a wonderful experience to get our family in a festive mood! Very well organised and staff have to be commended for being so polite and happy to wish",
          "Have been to blenheim palace many times, but never at Christmas. Absolutely loved it! Because we are annual pass holders, the Alice in the palace bit was included so we just paid for the light trail...had no idea what to expect and was absolutely blown away!! We had a crisp,",
          "Although the trail didn't feel as Christmassy this year it was still a pretty fun evening, the market gets better each year and the general set up keeps improving (more eateries and toilets provided). Some of the lights were awesome especially the paraffin lamps in the rose",
          "This was our first time at the Light Trail and it was impressive. However, I do know what people mean when they say it wasn't as good as previous years. There were gaps where lights probably were a year ago. The sound quality was excellent. We managed to get a deal through",
          "Absolutely outstanding visit! I took my 5 year old granddaughter who dressed as Alice and it was truly magical and memory making. She loved it, as did I. So much so that next year I hope to be taking the whole family 14 of us\ud83d\ude01",
          "Famous for being the house and birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill, it is a World Heritage Site with a huge acreage of parks and the palace housing some of the finest collections of antique furniture in Europe. it's very close to Oxford and one of the best palaces I have seen.",
          "We came for the Christmas Market and it was really fun. The booths had a lot of different and fun items to chose from, the food booths were nice and had a variety, the grounds are beautiful. It was fun!! Only downside was it had rained a bunch the days before so it was",
          "I cannot believe some of the negative reviews on here. Some people just like to complain about anything and don\u2019t appreciate how lucky they are to even have the chance to experience such an incredible event. Anyway I would like to say...Blenheim Palace THANK YOU! The Alice at",
          "The \"Alice in the Palace\" installation was just perfect, with well chosen colours to coordinate with the existing decoration of each of the rooms. We spent just over an hour enjoying the experience and trying to absorb all the detail. We appreciated the interactive screens",
          "I actually visited this attraction twice. The first time, in November, I came in a family party - 6 adults and 4 kids. In spite of timed tickets the congestion in the Palace was horrendous. This was due in part to buggies which should really be parked outside for an event like",
          "Having visited Blenheim Palace in the summer, this was our first time in the winter and for the Christmas Light Walk. The visit can be summed up in one word - Spectacular. Entrance was via a pre-purchased timed ticket. Once in the grounds on the Christmas Light Walk we were",
          "The most awesome Christmas experience ever with this year\u2019s theme of Alice in Wonderland in the Palace and a tasteful Christmas market in the grounds, suitable for young and old. Learned little about the history of Blenheim as Churchill\u2019s birthplace but no matter, will be happy",
          "I come here to walk my dog, to relax, to take a walk, to hang out. I never get bored of it! It's beautiful, it makes the annual pass for me so much more worth it",

Fantastic activity for children who knew the story. Garden lighted",

          "Don't believe the Scrooges who've given negative reviews - we loved it! We started with the Alice-themed afternoon tea - delicious though rather too much sweet stuff. We brought some home & haven't finished it yet. Alice in the Palace was lovely - as other reviewers have said,",
          "We were really excited to attend this event and bought tickets well in advance, when buying tickets you also have to pay an additional \u00a310 parking. We were inside the palace for 45 minutes with hardly any activities or anything special. The cost of this event does not justify",
          "First time here, inside the palace was very pretty, didn't seem to take long to get through it though. The illumination trail was lovely. Took over an hour to walk around. Was muddy in places, but still we had a lovely time here. Plenty of toilets dotted about. Very nice hot",

          "Only one word...amazing! Do not miss out on this magic experience, book early to avoid disappointment because it really is worth it! Book to park on site as it is well worth the extra for convenience, the fairground rides were perfectly good for our 4.5 year old and the lights",

          "We had been wanting to visit Blenheim for a long time, and just happened to choose the time at the end of November when they put on a special show. This year's was called Alice in the Palace and we were treated to displays, mirrors and stories connected with Alice in Wonderland.",
          "I really would not recommend visiting the Alice in the Palace event. After seeing social media posts of the christmas lights I thought it would be a nice trip for me and my girlfriend to visit, so booked the tickets. I thought they were quite expensive (over \u00a350 for two people)",
          "Having booked online for 4 adults at \u00a318.50 per person for the Blenheim Christmas light trail I was disgusted to find that when we turned up I was told by the car park attendant that our \u00a374 payment didn't include parking we would have to pay an extra \u00a310 to park the car! so",

          "Took our little one to The Christmas Lights Trail - and we all really enjoyed it. Well managed, the lights were incredible, and really Christmasy - will probably come back next year we enjoyed it that much. A little fun fair and food stalls at the start - but friends who were",
          "We visited with a party of 7 including a 2yr old having been 2 years ago. We booked the park & ride at \u00a37 a car, which was staffed by some very friendly guys & gave parking on tarmac - but you do need to be careful to avoid the huge potholes! The buses run every few minutes so",

          "As other reviews have said. they seem to have cut back on lights this year and it was all a little underwhelming. We still enjoyed our visit but felt a bit disappointed overall that there weren\u2019t as many lights on the trail so it wasn\u2019t as magical as we\u2019d previously experienced.",
          "We visited the Christmas lights in January and thought they were superb, but were told to visit before Christmas to experience the market. We went last night and it was so disappointing. Either a lot of lights weren\u2019t working due to wet weather, or they have cut back a lot. No",

          "We decided to give Christmas at Blenheim another try after we were disappointed last year, and I'm pleased to say we did have a much better time. This is probably partly down to the attraction being better, but also planning our day differently made it more enjoyable. We paid",

          "We visited on Sunday 29th Sept and unfortunately got mixed up with a half marathon taking place which created congestion . I should have checked if anything out of the ordinary was happening but didn't. The Palace was crowded to the point where it was difficult to view any",
          "Blenheim is lovely but it would be even lovelier if the staff selling admission tickets made it very clear that, unless you make a charitable donation, you can't later convert your ticket into an Annual Pass. Then visitors like me wouldn't inadvertently buy the wrong kind of",

          "Let me start be saying that our visit to Blenheim was a return from a 1982 visit. While we thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful palace, we were appalled at the artist Catellan\u2019s art on display is such a beautiful and, dare we say, historically significant place to the British",
          "Enjoyed a lovely day in the park around the place. Decided we were hungry and came across The Pleasure Gardens Pizza Caf\u00e9. Was really lovely, not like the normal attraction cafe. lovely location and decor, can see them cooking the pizzas from scratch. Can also see them going",
          "The first thing we were told is that everything gold in the palace is real gold. Even the ceilings were adorned in Gold. The history, paintings, marble statues were incredible. We also saw where Sir Winston Churchill was born. At the end of the tour was his history. What a",
          "Wow what a fabulous place. Unbelievably amazing. The finest stately home I have ever visited. Hard to comprehend the sheer size of the place unless you see it. Also the grounds are really lovely. Need to spend a whole day to see everything.",
          "I had seen reviews and photos of the palace but I wanted to experience it myself. We got to the palace early but as it was a good day we could walk around the outside of the palace before going in the entrance through the gift shop (you don't need a ticket for this) before going",
          "This is a wonderful place to visit. Plenty of things to see. As it was raining I didn't go around the gardens only managed the formal garden near the house. Used the audio guide and was able to really take in the history of the place at my own pace, rewinding if needed. Went to",

          "I have waited a week since visiting, and was going to email the 'palace' to get their views before I wrote this review, but having seen their trite reaction to complaints on here, similar to the ones I have, I decided there was no point. We thought we would visit on our journey",

          "First the tip if you are likely to return in the next 364 days, upgrade your ticket to an annual pass. It costs nothing so well worth doing and there is nothing to lose. The rooms are lovely to visit , you get very close to priceless items and the provided head sets give good",
          "The palace itself is just incredible and the Churchill exhibition is fascinating I\u2019m not normally a fan of audio guides but the ones at Blenheim have padded earphones and easy to use controls so I gave one a go and glad I did. So much to see inside and the grounds are",
          "A really special place and well worth visiting. The house itself is stunning and full of centuries of history. Definitely worth the price of admission but even if you don't want to pay to see the house you can still enjoy the beautiful grounds. The lake views are simply out of",

          "They should have a \"Look Up\" themed tour of Blenheim Palace - the ceilings and all of the architectural details are just spectacular! Early November was a nice time to visit because there weren't big crowds, and the autumn colors of the grounds were beautiful.",
          "A truly stunning estate in the English country side. Nice exhibit about Winston Churchill outlining the influence Blenheim has on his life and career. We only had a couple hours here but could have spent many more exploring the grounds surrounding the palace.",
          "4.5 stars\nJust slightly pricey would be what knocks it down by half! The Alice in the Palace was fantastic and to be fair when you go round you can see why it is \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3s  :)\nThe staff through there have done a wonderful job and it's great to \u2026",
          "We went for the lights show and it was incredible! Staff were just the most friendly and all the things on offer made it a perfect night out. If this is any relation to the Palace on a normal day I'll definitely be coming again! Will recommend!",
          "Loved the themed Christmas at the palace 2019 which was Alice in the palace. Light trail was excellent good light displays. Knowledgable staff is very good and helpful staff. Remember to take welly boots if your going on the light trail as \u2026",
          "The palace was an exciting place to visit with lots of art, history and culture. The fantastic audio guide was helpful in understanding the marvellous art and history. \n\nThe palace aside, the outdoors are definitely worth exploring. They\u2019re \u2026",
          "A very disappointing visit.\nThe tour bus left us a very long way from the entrance to the palace as they were setting up for some \" iron man\" type of competition.\nThe guides were rushing us almost immediately\nafter we entered. It was raining and whole areas were roped off for the competition. Expensive!",
          "Great stately home. Good audio tour and fantastic gardens.  Food was pricey and the tomato soup was surely a powder packet one, not nice, but it did not detract from a very pleasant day with 3 generations of my family.",
          "Very impressive place. Recommended if you want to understand more about battle of Blenheim and John Churchill",
          "Blenheim Palace did not disappoint. We visited Blenheim Palace with four friends to visit Alice at the Palace based on Alice in Wonderland. The display was spectacular and really had the WOW factor. We also enjoyed the lights trail which was magical and memorable. We would really recommend this magical experience.",
          "A good day out, albeit quite pricey. The grounds are nice to walk around, and there's plenty of history in the house, but it's quite one sided. I'm not sure you really get the full character of Churchill from it, all quite a sanitized history of events. Nice for a family day out and you can get a good stroll around the grounds.",
          "Fantastic as usual. All of the Christmas events were stunning, easily accessible by wheelchair and this year in particular the staff were helpful, approachable and jolly! The only major downside was that we nearly didn't get tickets because \u2026",
          "How can you not rate this 5 stars? I got the membership for the year. The park is absolutely beautiful and I'll be going back shortly just got a picnic.",
          "One of the better palace tours we have ever done. Very extensive and plenty to see! The grounds are beautiful.",
          "This place is so pretty. The grounds are great for dog walks and the Christmas lights are fab.",
          "What a wonderful place to have on the doorstep. An expensive day out? Yes, but it offers such a pleasant variety of activities the price is what it is. The estate is so sprawling there can be many thousands in attendance without it feeling too busy",
          "What an amazing place of history. So well preserved, and much thought gone into informing you during the visit. 100% come again",
          "Lights were fabulous. Better thought needs to be given with regard to guests being able to identify where they have parked their car! A simple lane ID or even an area marked would be useful",
          "Lovely family home. Converted tickets into annual passes. Came Back for the second day visit to look round the beautiful gardens. Saw the house on the first day. We will be back to explore further. Cafe was good. Sandwiches were tasty and \u2026",
          "Amazing! Breath taking! so much to see and not enough time but the great thing is you can get your paid ticket upgraded on the day  to the 1 year pass for free. Then it's no trouble, you can go as much as you want within the year which is great and soo worth it. The staff are so lovely and friendly.",
          "Wish more of the house was open but the grounds and the imposing facade make it worth a visit. Some of the interior pieces are completely astonishing too. Tapestries and furniture that have been immaculately kept. Always remember to look up as well \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Went for Christmas event stunning. Will be going again.",
          "First time seeing the house from inside, the Christmas display was magical. Also did the outside lights trail which was lovely but think it was better when I saw it a few years ago. The christmas market is nice but small and not many vegan options.",
          "The Alice in the Place Christmas special was beautiful. The light show in the evening on the grounds, well was magical. A wonderful day out showing the best of British. First rate.",
          "Went to see the Christmas Lights show. They were fantastic, and provided over an hour and a half's worth of visual spectacle. The music that accompanied was excellent also.",
          "Nice big house. It had a terrific set of sculptures in it when I went. It does grate a little to pay \u00a327 pounds to help a fabulously wealthy family pay to look after their big house, but it is probably their birthright or something.",
          "Amazing park and lots of activities all year. The afternoon tea is amazing",
          "Fantastic place to visit - in the day or for the Xmas Show. The Winston Churchill exhibit is totally engaging and very interesting. The Christmas Show - which is different each year - is incredible. The Palace is set up with a story that \u2026",
          "The illuminated Trail - there aren't enough adjectives to describe this, simply STUNNING! So very well executed, happy, engaging staff. Fabulous.  Alice at The Palace, even grown ups will love this, such attention to detail.",
          "Alice in Wonderland was great, the lights even better! The Christmas market was just ok though. However, only one restaurant that was fully booked before we arrived and the burgers that we had from one of the stalls were pretty burnt.",
          "Beautiful palace! The grounds are great and you could spend as much or as little time exploring as you'd like. In the actual palace I like that they have the audio tours where you can choose which parts of the room you'd like to hear about \u2026",
          "Came for the Christmas festival. I thought walking around the outside of the house was much more interesting than the inside. We paid \u00a354 for two of us to walk the Alice in Wonderland, far far far too expensive, only took about 30 mins. The night time  illuminated trail was much better, we really enjoyed that.",
          "Beautiful grounds, Annual pass definitely worth it to visit regularly. Various events throughout the year free with the pass. Lovely coffee shops dining & gift shop",
          "Just stunning - the palace and the park and lake just are beautiful. We went late in the afternoon as the large tour buses were all leaving - it was the perfect time to visit. The shop was great too!",
          "Absolutely breathtaking! The best trip I have ever been on. This beautiful place is stunning, the lights, history, everything.",
          "A fantastic place, with amazing practical items to follow the history of this fascinating subject.",
          "Absolutely beautiful and such an interesting history. Amazing place for families of all ages (lacks ramps in gardens)",
          "We did the xmas illuminated walk and Alice in the palace.  Both were excellent but too any people on the walk and not lighted in parts so constantly looking for children.  Rides were great.",
          "We were given a voucher for afternoon tea which we enjoyed.\nA good selection of sandwiches and cakes. In fact there were too many cakes but we were provided with a cardboard box (tick for environmentally friendly) to take home the uneaten \u2026",
          "Lovely buildings and gardens. Spent a good few hours and didn't see it all, will be returning with the annual pass. The art exhibition was a little distracting from the beauty of the rooms. Staff all very nice. Cafe serves wonderful food.",
          "Very nice building, inside and outside, but the prices were the biggest from many attraction that I saw till now. 10\u00a3 for parking and 27\u00a3 for admission is way too much, as you can see only a few rooms and that doesn't take so much time.",
          "What an architectural masterpiece! You can also get an annual pass so you can go back as many times within the next year.",
          "historical place, beautiful gardens.",
          "What a marvellous house. Flew all around it in my chopper. From Oxford airport which is only mins away. Landed at the back of the house for a spot of brecki.",
          "fantastic place to spend time with family.  getting away from the hustle and bustle.  city noise.  Fresh air, peace, quiet and beautiful nature all around.",
          "Elegant Palace that's wonderful to explore and learn about the history. The grounds are beautiful to explore, especially during this time of year with all the trees in autumnal colours. Definitely recommend a visit, plus you can return free for a  whole year.",
          "Christmas lights-Illuminated trail and Christmas  market.The illuminated trail was amazing and the decorated christmas trees and changing colours/decor of the outside of the palace looked great.The market had a variety of goods and take \u2026",
          "Spent the better part of a day here. The place is beautiful and the grounds are stunning.",
          "Very disappointed and left feeling we had been conned!!! \u00a337 for two for park and gardens as we had our dogs with us thinking as all the signs say we can come back as many times as we like over the next 12 months , absolute rubbish you have to pay another \u00a320 to be able to do that. Why don,t they tell you that up front? Very under hand.",
          "Perfect in every way.    Decor, Alice in the palace, shop with super staff, loos, Christmas market, evening lights.  A favourite place.  We will be back.",
          "Highly recommended place to visit. Easily accessible and we thoroughly enjoyed it",
          "Alice in wonderland themed house decorations were stunning , such detail , really well done !!! . The gardens light festival  was out of this world !!!! We have been to a few of these now but this blew everything out of the water, just \u2026",
          "Simoly the best. Can any stately home compare with this Palace. So much history so much style. Words cannot describe it.",

          "A first class day. Alice in the palace excellent followed by a walk through the lit up woods very good indeed. Well worth the day\n Thank you Blenheim Palaceand its staff.",
          "Love Blenheim. They are constantly doing conservation or restoration in the palace and grounds which is why it looks loved and cared for.",
          "Excellent views, but a bit pricey.",
          "Lovely the Alice tour was smashing around the palace. Enjoyed our lunch. Brought Christmas presents from the sheds great day out.",
          "We visited for the Alice in the Palace, the experience was very enjoyable but this was soon dampened after finding out how much it cost to ring the ticket office!! \u00a313 bill, what a ripoff, be warned",
          "Could have done with more pop up coffee places and seating so many people for the Alice exhibition everywhere was chaos queuing and nowhere to sit!! But fabulous exhibition in the Palace",
          "Blenheim Palace is ostentatious on all accounts and rightly so because it is truly beautiful. The gardens surrounding the actual building are huge! The palace tends to get very busy, especially on a weekend so do go early if you can.",
          "Really disappointed. Came last year and enjoyed it. Visited today with prams and had problems with accessibility (steps & doorways), made worse due to the improvement works so possibly normally would be OK but had bad experience today. Also \u2026"

        "wiki": "The University of Oxford (legally The Chancellor Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford) is a collegiate research university in Oxford, England. There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge. The two \"ancient universities\" are frequently jointly called \"Oxbridge\". \nThe university is made up of 39 constituent colleges, six permanent private halls, and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions. All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford is organised around weekly tutorials at the colleges and halls, supported by classes, lectures, seminars, and laboratory work provided by university faculties and departments; some postgraduate teaching, and occasionally undergraduate teaching, includes tutorials organised by faculties and departments. It operates the world's oldest university museum, as well as the largest university press in the world and the largest academic library system nationwide.In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2019, the university had a total income of \u00a32.45 billion, of which \u00a3624.8 million was from research grants and contracts. The university is ranked among the best higher learning institutions by most international and major national league tables.Oxford has educated a wide range of notable alumni, including 28 prime ministers of the United Kingdom and many heads of state and government around the world. As of November 2019, 72 Nobel Prize laureates, 3 Fields Medalists, and 6 Turing Award winners have studied, worked, or held visiting fellowships at the University of Oxford, while its alumni have won 160 Olympic medals. Oxford is the home of numerous scholarships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, one of the oldest international graduate scholarship programmes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\n\nThe University of Oxford has no known foundation date. Teaching at Oxford existed in some form as early as 1096, but it is unclear when a university came into being. It grew quickly from 1167 when English students returned from the University of Paris. The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188 and the first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a universitas or corporation in 1231. The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during the reign of King Henry III.After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled from the violence to Cambridge, later forming the University of Cambridge.\n\nThe students associated together on the basis of geographical origins, into two 'nations', representing the North (northerners or Boreales, who included the English people from north of the River Trent and the Scots) and the South (southerners or Australes, who included English people from south of the Trent, the Irish and the Welsh). In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students' affiliations when membership of a college or hall became customary in Oxford. In addition, members of many religious orders, including Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites and Augustinians, settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence and maintained houses or halls for students. At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest such founders were William of Durham, who in 1249 endowed University College, and John Balliol, father of a future King of Scots; Balliol College bears his name. Another founder, Walter de Merton, a Lord Chancellor of England and afterwards Bishop of Rochester, devised a series of regulations for college life; Merton College thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford, as well as at the University of Cambridge. Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.In 1333\u20131334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III. Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.\n\n\n=== Renaissance period ===\n\nThe new learning of the Renaissance greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn, who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies, and John Colet, the noted biblical scholar.\nWith the English Reformation and the breaking of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai. The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.\nIn 1636 William Laud, the chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury, codified the university's statutes. These, to a large extent, remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press, and he made significant contributions to the Bodleian Library, the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to receive the BA degree from the university and \"dissenters\" were only permitted to receive the MA in 1871.\n\nThe university was a centre of the Royalist party during the English Civil War (1642\u20131649), while the town favoured the opposing Parliamentarian cause. From the mid-18th century onwards, however, the university took little part in political conflicts.\nWadham College, founded in 1610, was the undergraduate college of Sir Christopher Wren. Wren was part of a brilliant group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the Oxford Philosophical Club, which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the college's Warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus that went on to found the Royal Society.\n\n\n=== Modern period ===\n\n\n==== Students ====\nBefore reforms in the early 19th century the curriculum at Oxford was notoriously narrow and impractical. Sir Spencer Walpole, a historian of contemporary Britain and a senior government official, had not attended any university. He says, \"few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quotes the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\" Nevertheless, Walpole argued: \n\n Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.\nOut of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers). After graduation 87% became professionals (59% as Anglican clergy). Out of the students who matriculated in 1870, 59% were sons of professionals (25% were Anglican ministers). After graduation 87% became professionals (42% as Anglican clergy).M. C. Curthoys and H. S. Jones argue that the rise of organised sport was one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton, Winchester, Shrewsbury, and Harrow.All students, regardless of their chosen area of study, were required to spend (at least) their first year preparing for a first year examination that was heavily focused on classical languages. Science students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with Greek language study removed from their required courses. This concept of a bachelor of science had been adopted at other European universities (London University had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.At the start of 1914 the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total. The University Roll of Service records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed. Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, 'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914\u20131918'. During the war years the university buildings became hospitals, cadet schools and military training camps.\n\n\n==== Reforms ====\nTwo parliamentary commissions in 1852 issued recommendations for Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunity given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.The system of separate honour schools for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and Literae Humaniores. Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853. By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\". Theology became the sixth honour school. In addition to these B.A. Honours degrees, the postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) was, and still is, offered.\n\nThe mid-19th century saw the impact of the Oxford Movement (1833\u20131845), led among others by the future Cardinal John Henry Newman. The influence of the reformed model of German universities reached Oxford via key scholars such as Edward Bouverie Pusey, Benjamin Jowett and Max M\u00fcller.\nAdministrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, and the establishment of four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies. Knowledge of Ancient Greek was required for admission until 1920, and Latin until 1960.\nThe University of Oxford began to award doctorates for research in the first third of the 20th century. The first Oxford DPhil in mathematics was awarded in 1921.The mid-20th century saw many distinguished continental scholars, displaced by Nazism and communism, relocating to Oxford.\nThe list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to politics, the sciences, medicine, and literature. As of October 2019, more than 70 Nobel laureates and more than 50 world leaders have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.\n\n\n=== Women's education ===\n\nThe university passed a statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level; for a brief period in the early 1900s, this allowed the \"steamboat ladies\" to receive ad eundem degrees from the University of Dublin. In June 1878, the Association for the Higher Education of Women (AEW) was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, T. H. Green and Edward Stuart Talbot. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group founded Lady Margaret Hall in 1878, while T. H. Green founded the non-denominational Somerville College in 1879. Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville opened their doors to their first 21 students (12 from Somerville, 9 from Lady Margaret Hall) in 1879, who attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop. There were also 25 women students living at home or with friends in 1879, a group which evolved into the Society of Oxford Home-Students and in 1952 into St Anne's College.These first three societies for women were followed by St Hugh's (1886) and St Hilda's (1893). All of these colleges later became coeducational, starting with Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne's in 1979, and finishing with St Hilda's, which began to accept male students in 2008. In the early 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege, however the integration of women into Oxford moved forward during the First World War. In 1916 women were admitted as medical students on a par with men, and in 1917 the university accepted financial responsibility for women's examinations.On 7 October 1920 women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees. In 1927 the university's dons created a quota that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957. However, during this period Oxford colleges were single sex, so the number of women was also limited by the capacity of the women's colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status.In 1974, Brasenose, Jesus, Wadham, Hertford and St Catherine's became the first previously all-male colleges to admit women. The majority of men's colleges accepted their first female students in 1979, with Christ Church following in 1980, and Oriel becoming the last men's college to admit women in 1985. Most of Oxford's graduate colleges were founded as coeducational establishments in the 20th century, with the exception of St Antony's, which was founded as a men's college in 1950 and began to accept women only in 1962. By 1988, 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female; in 2016, 45% of the student population, and 47% of undergraduate students, were female.In June 2017, Oxford announced that starting the following academic year, history students may choose to sit a take-home exam in some courses, with the intention that this will equalise rates of firsts awarded to women and men at Oxford. That same summer, maths and computer science tests were extended by 15 minutes, in a bid to see if female student scores would improve.The detective novel Gaudy Night by Dorothy L. Sayers, herself one of the first women to gain an academic degree from Oxford, is largely set in the all-female Shrewsbury College, Oxford (based on Sayers' own Somerville College), and the issue of women's education is central to its plot. Social historian and Somerville College alumna Jane Robinson's book Bluestockings: A Remarkable History of the First Women to Fight for an Education gives a very detailed and immersive account of this history.\n\n\n== Buildings and sites ==\n\n\n=== Map ===\n\n\n=== Main sites ===\n\nThe university is a \"city university\" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. The Science Area, in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) Radcliffe Observatory Quarter in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.\nIconic university buildings include the Radcliffe Camera, the Sheldonian Theatre used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the Examination Schools, where examinations and some lectures take place. The University Church of St Mary the Virgin was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian. Christ Church Cathedral uniquely serves as both a college chapel and as a cathedral.\nIn 2012\u20132013, the university built the controversial one-hectare (400m \u00d7 25m) Castle Mill development of 4\u20135-storey blocks of student flats overlooking Cripley Meadow and the historic Port Meadow, blocking views of the spires in the city centre. The development has been likened to building a \"skyscraper beside Stonehenge\".\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nThe University Parks are a 70-acre (28 ha) parkland area in the northeast of the city, near Keble College, Somerville College and Lady Margaret Hall. It is open to the public during daylight hours. As well as providing gardens and exotic plants, the Parks contains numerous sports fields, used for official and unofficial fixtures, and also contains sites of special interest including the Genetic Garden, an experimental garden to elucidate and investigate evolutionary processes.\nThe Botanic Garden on the High Street is the oldest botanic garden in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on 1.8 ha (4 1\u20442 acres). It is one of the most diverse yet compact major collections of plants in the world and includes representatives of over 90% of the higher plant families. The Harcourt Arboretum is a 130-acre (53 ha) site six miles (10 km) south of the city that includes native woodland and 67 acres (27 hectares) of meadow. The 1,000-acre (4.0 km2) Wytham Woods are owned by the university and used for research in zoology and climate change.\nThere are also various collegiate-owned open spaces open to the public, including Bagley Wood and most notably Christ Church Meadow.\n\n\n== Organisation ==\n\nAs a collegiate university, Oxford's structure can be confusing to those unfamiliar with it. The university is a federation, comprising over forty self-governing colleges and halls, along with a central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor.\nAcademic departments are located centrally within the structure of the federation; they are not affiliated with any particular college. Departments provide facilities for teaching and research, determine the syllabi and guidelines for the teaching of students, perform research, and deliver lectures and seminars.\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).\n\n\n=== Central governance ===\nThe university's formal head is the Chancellor, currently Lord Patten of Barnes, though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figure and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of Convocation, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor, currently Louise Richardson, is the de facto head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. The University Council is the executive policy-forming body, which consists of the vice-chancellor as well as heads of departments and other members elected by Congregation, in addition to observers from the students' union. Congregation, the \"parliament of the dons\", comprises over 3,700 members of the university's academic and administrative staff, and has ultimate responsibility for legislative matters: it discusses and pronounces on policies proposed by the University Council.\nTwo university proctors, elected annually on a rotating basis from two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student welfare and discipline, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings. The university's professors are collectively referred to as the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the Chichele Professorships and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy. The various academic faculties, departments, and institutes are organised into four divisions, each with its own head and elected board. They are the Humanities Division; the Social Sciences Division; the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division; and the Medical Sciences Division.\nThe University of Oxford is a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.\n\n\n=== Colleges ===\n\nTo be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall. There are thirty-nine colleges of the University of Oxford (including Parks College, planned to admit students in 2021) and six permanent private halls (PPHs), each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities. Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.\nThe colleges are:\n\nThe permanent private halls were founded by different Christian denominations. One difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas colleges are governed by the fellows of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination. The six current PPHs are:\n\nThe PPHs and colleges join together as the Conference of Colleges, which represents the common concerns of the several colleges of the university, to discuss matters of shared interest and to act collectively when necessary, such as in dealings with the central university. The Conference of Colleges was established as a recommendation of the Franks Commission in 1965.Teaching members of the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, although the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments. There is no common title for the heads of colleges: the titles used include Warden, Provost, Principal, President, Rector, Master and Dean.\n\n\n=== Finances ===\n\nIn 2017/18, the university had an income of \u00a32,237m; key sources were research grants (\u00a3579.1m) and academic fees (\u00a3332.5m). The colleges had a total income of \u00a3492.9m.While the university has a larger annual income and operating budget, the colleges have a larger aggregate endowment: over \u00a34.9bn compared to the university's \u00a31.2bn. The central University's endowment, along with some of the colleges', is managed by the university's wholly owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007. The university has substantial investments in fossil fuel companies, and in 2014 began consultations on whether it should follow some US universities which have committed to sell off their fossil fuel investments.The total assets of the colleges of \u00a36.3 billion also exceed total university assets of 4.1 billion. The college figure does not reflect all the assets held by the colleges as their accounts do not include the cost or value of many of their main sites or heritage assets such as works of art or libraries.The university was one of the first in the UK to raise money through a major public fundraising campaign, the Campaign for Oxford. The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled \"Oxford Thinking \u2013 The Campaign for the University of Oxford\". This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure; having passed its original target of \u00a31.25 billion in March 2012, the target was raised to \u00a33 billion. The campaign had raised a total of \u00a32.8 billion by July 2018.\n\n\n=== Affiliations ===\nOxford is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, and the International Alliance of Research Universities. It is also a core member of the Europaeum and forms part of the \"golden triangle\" of highly research intensive and elite English universities.\n\n\n== Academic profile ==\n\n\n=== Admission ===\n\nIn common with most British universities, prospective students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.  The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.To allow a more personalised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for organ scholarships and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.\nOxford has the lowest offer rate of all Russell Group universities.Most applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges, which work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of their college preferences. Shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. Students from outside Europe can be interviewed remotely, for example, over the Internet.\nOffers are sent out in early January, with each offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receives an offer from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make \"open offers\" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until A Level results day in August.The university has come under criticism for the number of students it accepts from private schools; for instance, Laura Spence's rejection from the university in 2000 led to widespread debate. In 2016, the University of Oxford gave 59% of offers to UK students to students from state schools, while about 93% of all UK pupils and 86% of post-16 UK pupils are educated in state schools. However, 64% of UK applicants were from state schools and the university notes that state school students apply disproportionately to oversubscribed subjects. Oxford University spends over \u00a36 million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.In 2018 the university's annual admissions report revealed that eight of Oxford's colleges had accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years. David Lammy said, \"This is social apartheid and it is utterly unrepresentative of life in modern Britain.\"\n\n\n=== Teaching and degrees ===\n\nUndergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1\u20134 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week's work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight-week academic terms: Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity. (These are officially known as 'Full Term': 'Term' is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as \"first week\", the last as \"eighth week\" and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example \"-1st week\" and \"0th week\" precede term). Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities, and their total duration amounts to less than half the year. However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).\nResearch degrees at the master's and doctoral level are conferred in all subjects studied at graduate level at the university.\n\n\n=== Scholarships and financial support ===\n\nThere are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate, with a total possible grant of \u00a310,235 over a 3-year degree. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships. Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities. The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards. In 2016, Oxford University announced that it is to run its first free online economics course as part of a \"massive open online course\" (Mooc) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network. The course available is called \u2018From Poverty to Prosperity: Understanding Economic Development\u2019.\nStudents successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and exhibitions, normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; \"commoners\" (originally those who had to pay for their \"commons\", or food and lodging) are restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term \"scholar\" in relation to Oxford therefore has a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were \"noblemen commoners\" and \"gentlemen commoners\", but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. \"Closed\" scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe university maintains the largest university library system in the UK, and, with over 11 million volumes housed on 120 miles (190 km) of shelving, the Bodleian group is the second-largest library in the UK, after the British Library. The Bodleian is a legal deposit library, which means that it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK. As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.The buildings referred to as the university's main research library, The Bodleian, consist of the original Bodleian Library in the Old Schools Quadrangle, founded by Sir Thomas Bodley in 1598 and opened in 1602, the Radcliffe Camera, the Clarendon Building, and the Weston Library. A tunnel underneath Broad Street connects these buildings, with the Gladstone Link, which opened to readers in 2011, connecting the Old Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera.\n\nThe Bodleian Libraries group was formed in 2000, bringing the Bodleian Library and some of the subject libraries together. It now comprises 28 libraries, a number of which have been created by bringing previously separate collections together, including the Sackler Library, Social Science Library and Radcliffe Science Library. Another major product of this collaboration has been a joint integrated library system, OLIS (Oxford Libraries Information System), and its public interface, SOLO (Search Oxford Libraries Online), which provides an electronic catalogue covering all member libraries, as well as the libraries of individual colleges and other faculty libraries, which are not members of the group but do share cataloguing information.A new book depository opened in South Marston, Swindon in October 2010, and recent building projects include the remodelling of the New Bodleian building, which was renamed the Weston Library when it reopened in 2015. The renovation is designed to better showcase the library's various treasures (which include a Shakespeare First Folio and a Gutenberg Bible) as well as temporary exhibitions.\nThe Bodleian engaged in a mass-digitisation project with Google in 2004. Notable electronic resources hosted by the Bodleian Group include the Electronic Enlightenment Project, which was awarded the 2010 Digital Prize by the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nOxford maintains a number of museums and galleries, open for free to the public. The Ashmolean Museum, founded in 1683, is the oldest museum in the UK, and the oldest university museum in the world. It holds significant collections of art and archaeology, including works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Turner, and Picasso, as well as treasures such as the Scorpion Macehead, the Parian Marble and the Alfred Jewel. It also contains \"The Messiah\", a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence.\nThe University Museum of Natural History holds the university's zoological, entomological and geological specimens. It is housed in a large neo-Gothic building on Parks Road, in the university's Science Area. Among its collection are the skeletons of a Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops, and the most complete remains of a dodo found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy.\n\nAdjoining the Museum of Natural History is the Pitt Rivers Museum, founded in 1884, which displays the university's archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General Augustus Pitt Rivers stipulated that the university establish a lectureship in anthropology.\nThe Museum of the History of Science is housed on Broad Street in the world's oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building. It contains 15,000 artefacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science. In the Faculty of Music on St Aldate's is the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. Christ Church Picture Gallery holds a collection of over 200 old master paintings.\n\n\n=== Publishing ===\n\nThe Oxford University Press is the world's second oldest and currently the largest university press by the number of publications. More than 6,000 new books are published annually, including many reference, professional, and academic works (such as the Oxford English Dictionary, the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, the Oxford World's Classics, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, and the Concise Dictionary of National Biography).\n\n\n=== Rankings and reputation ===\nOxford is regularly ranked within the top 5 universities in the world and is currently ranked first in the world in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, as well as the Forbes's World University Rankings. It held the number one position in the Times Good University Guide for eleven consecutive years, and the medical school has also maintained first place in the \"Clinical, Pre-Clinical & Health\" table of the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings for the past seven consecutive years. In 2019, it ranked 7th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings. The THE has also recognised Oxford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its World Reputation Rankings, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Stanford. The university is fifth worldwide on the US News ranking. Its Sa\u00efd Business School came 13th in the world in Financial Times Global MBA Ranking.Oxford was ranked ninth in the world in 2015 by the Nature Index, which measures the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals. It is ranked 5th best university worldwide and 1st in Britain for forming CEOs according to the Professional Ranking World Universities, and first in the UK for the quality of its graduates as chosen by the recruiters of the UK's major companies.In the 2018 Complete University Guide, all 38 subjects offered by Oxford rank within the top 10 nationally meaning Oxford was one of only two multi-faculty universities (along with Cambridge) in the UK to have 100% of their subjects in the top 10. Computer Science, Medicine, Philosophy, Politics and Psychology were ranked first in the UK by the guide.According to the QS World University Rankings by Subject, the University of Oxford also ranks as number one in the world for four Humanities disciplines: English Language and Literature, Modern Languages, Geography, and History. It also ranks 2nd globally for Anthropology, Archaeology, Law, Medicine, Politics & International Studies, and Psychology.\n\n\n== Student life ==\n\n\n=== Traditions ===\n\nAcademic dress is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held amongst the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations \u2013 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum. This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote on not so much making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow. In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.Other traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally. At most colleges these formal meals require gowns to be worn, and a Latin grace is said.\nBalls are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in 9th week of Trinity Term, are called commemoration balls; the dress code is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. These are usually held on an annual or irregular basis, and are usually black tie.\nPunting is a common summer leisure activity.\nThere are several more or less quirky traditions peculiar to individual colleges, for example the All Souls Mallard song.\n\n\n=== Clubs and societies ===\n\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as cuppers (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard university wide groups. Significant focus is given to annual varsity matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is The Boat Race, watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, Torpids and Summer Eights. A blue is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. As well as traditional sports, there are teams for activities such as Octopush and quidditch.\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent Cherwell and OUSU's The Oxford Student. Other publications include the Isis magazine, the satirical Oxymoron, and the graduate Oxonian Review. The student radio station is Oxide Radio. Most colleges have chapel choirs. Music, drama, and other arts societies exist both at collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Oxford Revue. Unlike most other collegiate societies, musical ensembles actively encourage players from other colleges.\n\nMost academic areas have student societies of some form which are open to students studying all courses, for example the Scientific Society. There are groups for almost all faiths, political parties, countries and cultures.\nThe Oxford Union (not to be confused with the Oxford University Student Union) hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers. There have historically been elite invite-only societies such as the Bullingdon Club.\n\n\n=== Student union and common rooms ===\nThe Oxford University Student Union, formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU, exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. The OUSU Executive Committee includes six full-time salaried sabbatical officers, who generally serve in the year following completion of their Final Examinations.\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It is worth noting that JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College's entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. A total of 69 Nobel prize-winners have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.\nMore information on notable members of the university can be found in the individual college articles. An individual may be associated with two or more colleges, as an undergraduate, postgraduate and/or member of staff.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\n\nTwenty-eight British prime ministers have attended Oxford, including William Gladstone, H. H. Asquith, Clement Attlee, Harold Macmillan, Edward Heath, Harold Wilson, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. Of all the post-war prime ministers, only Gordon Brown was educated at a university other than Oxford (the University of Edinburgh), while James Callaghan and John Major never attended a university.Over 100 Oxford alumni were elected to the House of Commons in 2010. This includes former Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, and numerous members of the cabinet and shadow cabinet. Additionally, over 140 Oxonians sit in the House of Lords.\n\nAt least 30 other international leaders have been educated at Oxford. This number includes Harald V of Norway, Abdullah II of Jordan, William II of the Netherlands, five Prime Ministers of Australia (John Gorton, Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, Tony Abbott, and Malcolm Turnbull), Six Prime Ministers of Pakistan (Liaquat Ali Khan, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Sir Feroz Khan Noon, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto and Imran Khan), two Prime Ministers of Canada (Lester B. Pearson and John Turner), two Prime Ministers of India (Manmohan Singh and Indira Gandhi, though the latter did not finish her degree), Prime Minister of Ceylon (S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike), Norman Washington Manley of Jamaica, Haitham bin Tariq Al Said (Sultan of Oman) Eric Williams (Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago), Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (former President of Peru), Abhisit Vejjajiva (former Prime Minister of Thailand), and Bill Clinton (the first President of the United States to have attended Oxford; he attended as a Rhodes Scholar). Arthur Mutambara (Deputy Prime Minister of Zimbabwe), was a Rhodes Scholar in 1991. Seretse Khama, first president of Botswana, spent a year at Balliol College. Festus Mogae (former president of Botswana) was a student at University College. The Burmese democracy activist and Nobel laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, was a student of St Hugh's College. Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the current reigning Druk Gyalpo (Dragon King) of Bhutan, was a member of St Peter's College.\n\n\n=== Law ===\nOxford has produced a large number of distinguished jurists, judges and lawyers around the world. Lords Bingham and Denning, commonly recognised as two of the most influential English judges in the history of the common law, both studied at Oxford. Within the United Kingdom, three of the current Justices of the Supreme Court are Oxford-educated: Robert Reed (Deputy President of the Supreme Court), Nicholas Wilson, and Michael Briggs; retired Justices include David Neuberger (President of the Supreme Court 2012\u20132017), Jonathan Mance (Deputy President of the Supreme Court 2017\u20132018), Alan Rodger, Jonathan Sumption, Mark Saville, John Dyson, and Simon Brown. The twelve Lord Chancellors and nine Lord Chief Justices that have been educated at Oxford include Thomas Bingham, Stanley Buckmaster, Thomas More, Thomas Wolsey, Gavin Simonds. The twenty-two Law Lords count amongst them Leonard Hoffmann, Kenneth Diplock, Richard Wilberforce, James Atkin, Simon Brown, Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, Robert Goff, Brian Hutton, Jonathan Mance, Alan Rodger, Mark Saville, Leslie Scarman, Johan Steyn; Master of the Rolls include Alfred Denning and Wilfred Greene; Lord Justices of Appeal include John Laws, Brian Leveson and John Mummery. The British Government's Attorneys General have included Dominic Grieve, Nicholas Lyell, Patrick Mayhew, John Hobson, Reginald Manningham-Buller, Lionel Heald, Frank Soskice, David Maxwell Fyfe, Donald Somervell, William Jowitt; Directors of Public Prosecutions include Sir Thomas Hetherington QC, Dame Barbara Mills QC and Sir Keir Starmer QC.\nIn the United States, three of the nine incumbent Justices of the Supreme Court are Oxonians, namely Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Neil Gorsuch; retired Justices include John Marshall Harlan II, David Souter and Byron White. Internationally, Oxonians Sir Humphrey Waldock served in the International Court of Justice; Akua Kuenyehia, sat in the International Criminal Court; Sir Nicolas Bratza and Paul Mahoney sat in the European Court of Human Rights; Kenneth Hayne, Dyson Heydon, as well as Patrick Keane sat in the High Court of Australia; both Kailas Nath Wanchoo, A. N. Ray served as Chief Justices of the Supreme Court of India; Cornelia Sorabji, Oxford's first female law student, was India's first female advocate; in Hong Kong, Aarif Barma, Thomas Au and Doreen Le Pichon currently serve in the Court of Appeal (Hong Kong), while Charles Ching and Henry Litton both served as Permanent Judges of the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong; six Puisne Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada and a chief justice of the now defunct Federal Court of Canada were also educated at Oxford.\nThe list of noted legal scholars includes H. L. A. Hart, Ronald Dworkin, Andrew Burrows, Sir Guenter Treitel, Jeremy Waldron, A. V. Dicey, William Blackstone, John Gardner, Robert A. Gorman, Timothy Endicott, Peter Birks, John Finnis, Andrew Ashworth, Joseph Raz, Paul Craig, Leslie Green, Tony Honor\u00e9, Neil MacCormick and Hugh Collins. Other distinguished practitioners who have attended Oxford include Lord Pannick Qc, Geoffrey Robertson QC, Amal Clooney, Lord Faulks QC, and Dinah Rose QC.\n\n\n=== Mathematics and sciences ===\n\nThree Oxford mathematicians, Michael Atiyah, Daniel Quillen and Simon Donaldson, have won Fields Medals, often called the \"Nobel Prize for mathematics\". Andrew Wiles, who proved Fermat's Last Theorem, was educated at Oxford and is currently the Regius Professor and Royal Society Research Professor in Mathematics at Oxford. Marcus du Sautoy and Roger Penrose are both currently mathematics professors, and Jackie Stedall was a professor of the university. Stephen Wolfram, chief designer of Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha studied at the university, along with Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, Edgar F. Codd, inventor of the relational model of data, and Tony Hoare, programming languages pioneer and inventor of Quicksort.\nThe university is associated with eleven winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, five in physics and sixteen in medicine.Scientists who performed research in Oxford include chemist Dorothy Hodgkin who received her Nobel Prize for \"determinations by X-ray techniques of the structures of important biochemical substances\", Howard Florey who shared the 1945 Nobel prize \"for the discovery of penicillin and its curative effect in various infectious diseases\", and John B. Goodenough, who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2019 \"for the development of lithium-ion batteries\".  Both Richard Dawkins and Frederick Soddy studied at the university and returned for research purposes. Robert Hooke, Edwin Hubble, and Stephen Hawking all studied in Oxford.\nRobert Boyle, a founder of modern chemistry, never formally studied or held a post within the university, but resided within the city to be part of the scientific community and was awarded an honorary degree. Notable scientists who spent brief periods at Oxford include Albert Einstein developer of general theory of relativity and the concept of photons; and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger who formulated the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment. Structural engineer Roma Agrawal, responsible for London's Shard, attributes her love of engineering to a summer placement during her undergraduate physics degree at Oxford.\nEconomists Adam Smith, Alfred Marshall, E. F. Schumacher, and Amartya Sen all spent time at Oxford.\n\n\n=== Literature, music, and drama ===\n\nWriters associated with Oxford include Vera Brittain, A.S. Byatt, Lewis Carroll, Penelope Fitzgerald, John Fowles, Theodor Geisel, Robert Graves, Graham Greene, Joseph Heller, Christopher Hitchens, Aldous Huxley, Samuel Johnson, C. S.

Housman, Gerard Manley Hopkins, W. H. Auden, T. S. Eliot, Wendy Perriam and Philip Larkin, and seven poets laureate: Thomas Warton, Henry James Pye, Robert Southey, Robert Bridges, Cecil Day-Lewis, Sir John Betjeman, and Andrew Motion.Composers Hubert Parry, George Butterworth, John Taverner, William Walton, James Whitbourn and Andrew Lloyd Webber have all been involved with the university.\n\nActors Hugh Grant, Kate Beckinsale, Rosamund Pike, Felicity Jones, Gemma Chan, Dudley Moore, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Anna Popplewell and Rowan Atkinson were students at the university, as were filmmakers Ken Loach and Richard Curtis.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nOxford has also produced at least 12 saints, 19 English cardinals, and 20 Archbishops of Canterbury, the most recent Archbishop being Rowan Williams, who studied at Wadham College and was later a Canon Professor at Christ Church. Duns Scotus' teaching is commemorated with a monument in the University Church of St. Mary. Religious reformer John Wycliffe was an Oxford scholar, for a time Master of Balliol College. John Colet, Christian humanist, Dean of St Paul's, and friend of Erasmus, studied at Magdalen College. Several of the Caroline Divines e.g. in particular William Laud as President of St. John's and Chancellor of the University, and the Non-Jurors, e.g. Thomas Ken had close Oxford connections. The founder of Methodism, John Wesley, studied at Christ Church and was elected a fellow of Lincoln College. Britain's first woman to be an ordained minister, Constance Coltman, studied at Somerville College. The Oxford Movement (1833\u20131846) was closely associated with the Oriel fellows John Henry Newman, Edward Bouverie Pusey and John Keble. Other religious figures were Mirza Nasir Ahmad, the third Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Shoghi Effendi, one of the appointed leaders of the Baha'i faith and Joseph Cordeiro, the only Pakistani Catholic cardinal.\n\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n\nOxford's philosophical tradition started in the medieval era, with Robert Grosseteste and William of Ockham, commonly known for Occam's razor, among those teaching at the university. Thomas Hobbes, Jeremy Bentham and the empiricist John Locke received degrees from Oxford. Though the latter's main works were written after leaving Oxford, Locke was heavily influenced by his twelve years at the university.Oxford philosophers of the 20th century include J.L. Austin, a leading proponent of ordinary-language philosophy, Gilbert Ryle, author of The Concept of Mind, and Derek Parfit, who specialised in personal identity. Other commonly read modern philosophers to have studied at the university include A. J. Ayer, Elizabeth Anscombe, Paul Grice, Mary Midgley, Iris Murdoch, Thomas Nagel, Bernard Williams, Robert Nozick, Onora O'Neill, John Rawls, Michael Sandel, and Peter Singer. John Searle, presenter of the Chinese room thought experiment, studied and began his academic career at the university. Likewise, Philippa Foot, who mentioned the trolley problem, studied and taught at Oxford.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nSir Roger Gilbert Bannister, who had been at Exeter College and Merton College, ran the first sub-four-minute mile in Oxford.\nSome 150 Olympic medal-winners have academic connections with the university, including Sir Matthew Pinsent, quadruple gold-medallist rower.Rowers from Oxford who have won gold at the Olympics or World Championships include Michael Blomquist, Ed Coode, Chris Davidge, Hugh Edwards, Jason Flickinger, Tim Foster, Luka Grubor, Christopher Liwski, Matthew Pinsent, Pete Reed, Jonny Searle, Andrew Triggs Hodge, Jake Wetzel, Michael Wherley, and Barney Williams. Many Oxford graduates have also risen to the highest echelon in cricket: Harry Altham, Bernard Bosanquet (inventor of the googly), Colin Cowdrey, Gerry Crutchley, Jamie Dalrymple, Martin Donnelly, R. E. Foster (the only man to captain England at both cricket and football), C. B. Fry, George Harris (also served in the House of Lords), Douglas Jardine, Malcolm Jardine, Imran Khan, Sophie Le Marchand, Alan Melville, Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi, Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, M. J. K. Smith, and Pelham Warner.\nOxford students have also excelled in other sports. Such alumni include American football player Myron Rolle (NFL player); Olympic gold medalists in athletics David Hemery and Jack Lovelock; basketball players Bill Bradley (US Senator and NBA player) and Charles Thomas McMillen (US Congressman and NBA player); figure skater John Misha Petkevich (national champion); footballers John Bain, Charles Wreford-Brown, and Cuthbert Ottaway; fencer Allan Jay (world champion and five-time Olympian); modern pentathlete Steph Cook (Olympic gold medalist); rugby footballers Stuart Barnes, Simon Danielli, David Humphreys, David Edward Kirk, Anton Oliver, Ronald Poulton-Palmer, Joe Roff, and William Webb Ellis (allegedly the inventor of rugby football); World Cup freestyle skier Ryan Max Riley (national champion); polo player Claire Tomlinson (highest ranked woman world-wide); and tennis player Clarence Bruce.\n\n\n=== Adventure and exploration ===\n\nThree of the most well-known adventurers and explorers who attended Oxford are Walter Raleigh, one of the most notable figures of the Elizabethan era, T. E. Lawrence, whose life was the basis of the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia, and Thomas Coryat. The latter, the author of \"Coryat's Crudities hastily gobbled up in Five Months Travels in France, Italy, &c'\" (1611) and court jester of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, is credited with introducing the table fork and umbrella to England and being the first Briton to do a Grand Tour of Europe.Other notable figures include Gertrude Bell, an explorer, archaeologist, mapper and spy, who, along with T. E. Lawrence, helped establish the Hashemite dynasties in what is today Jordan and Iraq and played a major role in establishing and administering the modern state of Iraq; Richard Francis Burton, who travelled in disguise to Mecca and journeyed with John Hanning Speke as the first European explorers to visit the Great Lakes of Africa in search of the source of the Nile; anthropologist Katherine Routledge, who carried out the first survey of Easter Island; mountaineer Tom Bourdillon, member of the expedition to make the first ascent of Mount Everest; and Peter Fleming, adventurer and travel writer and elder brother of Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond.\n\n\n== Oxford in literature and other media ==\n\nThe University of Oxford is the setting for numerous works of fiction. Oxford was mentioned in fiction as early as 1400 when Chaucer in his Canterbury Tales referred to a \"Clerk [student] of Oxenford\". By 1989, 533 novels based in Oxford had been identified and the number continues to rise. Famous literary works range from Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh, which in 1981 was adapted as a television serial, to the trilogy His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman, which features an alternate-reality version of the university and was adapted for film in 2007 and as a BBC television series in 2019.\nOther notable examples include:\n\nZuleika Dobson (1911) by Max Beerbohm, a satire about undergraduate life.\nSinister Street (1913\u20131914) by Compton MacKenzie, himself a graduate of Magdalen College, a Bildungsroman about two children born out of wedlock.\nGaudy Night (1935) by Dorothy L. Sayers, herself a graduate of Somerville College, a Lord Peter Wimsey mystery novel.\nThe Inspector Morse detective novels (1975-1999) by Colin Dexter, adapted for television as Inspector Morse (1987\u20132000), the spin-off Lewis (2006\u20132015), and the prequel Endeavour (2012\u2013).\nTrue Blue (1996), a film about the mutiny at the time of the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race of 1987\nThe History Boys (2004) by Alan Bennett, alumnus of Exeter College, a play about a group of grammar school boys in Sheffield in 1983 applying to read history at Oxford and Cambridge. It premiered at the National Theatre and was adapted for film in 2006.\nPosh (2010), a play by Laura Wade, and its film adaptation The Riot Club (2014), about a fictionalised equivalent of the Bullingdon Club.\nTestament of Youth (2014), a drama film based on the memoir of the same name written by Somerville alumna Vera Brittain.Notable non-fiction works on Oxford include Oxford by Jan Morris.The university is parodied in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series with \"Unseen University\" and \"Brazeneck College\" (in reference to Brasenose College).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \n'The University of Oxford', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 3: The University of Oxford (1954), pp. 1\u201338\nWorks by or about University of Oxford at Internet Archive",

          "Animal knuckle bones, I hasten to add. This small museum is tucked away in Oxford's Town Hall. It celebrates all sorts of aspects of Oxford's past, from Morris Minor to Cooper's marmalade. Well worth a visit. About half an hour will cover it. Though that said, I will pay another",
          "This museum is only 2 rooms in the Oxford Town Hall. But its two rooms packed with interest, laid out in an entertaining and informative way. With the university dominating Oxford its good to be reminded of its industrial past - car manufacturing, marmalade and a street made",

          "I think Lisa S says it all below. Oxford has an amazing history behind it - this museum doesn't do it justice. I think the gift shop is bigger than the 2 dedicated rooms. And that didn't even stock Oxford items - you can read about Frank Cooper's marmalade but the shop only",

        "wiki": "Christ Church Cathedral is the cathedral of the Anglican diocese of Oxford, which consists of the counties of Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Berkshire. It is also the chapel of Christ Church at the University of Oxford. This dual role as cathedral and college chapel is unique in the Church of England.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe cathedral was originally the church of St Frideswide's Priory. The site was historically presumed to be the location of the nunnery founded by St Frideswide, the patron saint of Oxford, and the shrine now in the Latin Chapel, originally containing relics translated at the rebuilding in 1180, was the focus of pilgrimage from at least the 12th until the early 16th century.In 1522, the priory was surrendered to Thomas Cardinal Wolsey, who had selected it as the site for his proposed college. However, in 1529 the foundation was taken over by Henry VIII. Work stopped, but in June 1532 the college was refounded by the King. In 1546, Henry VIII transferred to it the recently created See of Oxford from Osney. The cathedral has the name of Ecclesia Christi Cathedralis Oxoniensis, given to it by Henry VIII's foundation charter.\nThere has been a choir at the cathedral since 1526, when John Taverner was the organist and also master of the choristers. The statutes of Wolsey's original college, initially called Cardinal College, mentioned 16 choristers and 30 singing priests.\nChrist Church Cathedral is one of the smallest cathedrals in the Church of England.The nave, choir, main tower and transepts are late Norman. There are architectural features ranging from Norman to the Perpendicular style and a large rose window of the ten-part (i.e. botanical) type.\n\n\n== Dean and Chapter ==\nAs of 28 January 2019:\nDean \u2014 Martyn Percy (since 4 October 2014 installation)\nSub-Dean \u2014 Edmund Newey (since 3 August 2013 installation)\nDiocesan Canon Precentor \u2014 Grant Bayliss (since 2 September 2017 installation)\nArchdeacon of Oxford \u2014 Martin Gorick (since 4 May 2013 collation)The university's four senior theology professors are also ex officio Canons Residentiary:\n\nRegius Professor of Divinity \u2014 Graham Ward (since 2012)\nLady Margaret Professor of Divinity \u2014 Carol Harrison (lay; since 27 April 2015 installation)\nRegius Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology \u2014 Nigel Biggar (since 6 October 2007 installation)\nRegius Professor of Ecclesiastical History \u2014 Sarah Foot (since 6 October 2007 installation; ordained 2017)\n\n\n== Music ==\n\n\n=== Organ ===\nThe organ is a 43-rank, four-manual and pedal instrument built in 1979 by Austrian firm Rieger Orgelbau.\n\n\n=== Organists ===\n \nFirst among the notable organists of Christ Church Cathedral is the Renaissance composer John Taverner, who was appointed as the first organist by Wolsey in 1526. Other organists (and directors of the choir) have included Basil Harwood, Thomas Armstrong, W. H. Harris, Simon Preston, Francis Grier and Nicholas Cleobury. The post of organist is currently held by Steven Grahl. (As in many English cathedrals, the organist is also director of the choir and much of the organ playing is delegated to the sub-organist or organ scholar.)\n\n\n=== Choirs ===\nThe main choir, the Christ Church Cathedral Choir, consists of 12 adults (6 professional \"lay-clerks\" and 6 student \"academical clerks\") and 16 choristers (boys aged 7 \u2013 13), and is directed by Steven Grahl. They sing in university term time, at Christmas and Easter, and have an extensive touring and recording programme.\nFormer choristers include the composer William Walton.\nThe Cathedral Singers consists of volunteers and is currently directed by James Potter.

        "wiki": "The History of Science Museum in Broad Street, Oxford, England, holds a leading collection of scientific instruments from Middle Ages to the 19th century. The museum building is also known as the Old Ashmolean Building to distinguish it from the newer Ashmolean Museum building completed in 1894. The museum was built in 1683, and it is the world's oldest surviving purpose-built museum.\nThe museum is open to the general public every afternoon except Mondays, with free admission.\n\n\n== History ==\nBuilt in 1683 to house Elias Ashmole's collection, it was the world's first purpose-built museum building and was also open to the public. The original concept of the museum was to institutionalize the new learning about nature that appeared in the 17th century and experiments concerning natural philosophy were undertaken in a chemical laboratory in the basement, while lectures and demonstration took place in the School of Natural History, on the middle floor. Ashmole's collection was expanded to include a broad range of activities associated with the history of natural knowledge and in 1924 the gift of Lewis Evans' collection allowed the museum further improvement, becoming the Museum of the History of Science and appointing Robert Gunther as its first curator.\n\n\n== Collections and exhibitions ==\n\nThe collection and the building itself now occupies a special position in the study of the history of science and in the development of western culture and collecting.\nOne of the most iconic objects in the collection is Einstein's Blackboard that Albert Einstein used on 16 May 1931 in his lectures while visiting the University of Oxford, rescued by dons including and E. J. Bowen and Gavin de Beer.The current collection contains around 18,000 objects from antiquity to the early 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science and is used for both academic study and enjoyment by the visiting public.\nThe museum contains a wide range of scientific instruments, such as quadrants, astrolabes (the most complete collection in the world with c.170 instruments), sundials, early mathematical instruments (used for calculating, astronomy, navigation, surveying and drawing), optical instruments (microscopes, telescopes and cameras), equipment associated with chemistry, natural philosophy and medicine, and a reference library regarding the history of scientific instruments that includes manuscripts, incunabula, prints and printed ephemera, and early photographic items.\nThe museum shows the development of mechanical clocks. Lantern clocks and longcase clocks are exhibited in the Beeson Room, named after the antiquarian horologist Cyril Beeson (1889\u20131975) who gave his collection to the museum. Early turret clocks are exhibited above the stairs from the basement to the raised ground floor.\nFrom October 2009 until February 2010, the Museum hosted the first major exhibition of Steampunk art objects, curated by Art Donovan and presented by Dr Jim Bennett, then the museum director.The museum is also home to the Rochester Avionic Archive, which includes a collection of avionics that originated with the Elliot Brothers, but also includes pieces from Marconi and BAE Systems.\n\n\n== Curators ==\n\nThe following have been Curator or Secretary to the Committee or Director at the museum:\nR. T. Gunther (1924\u201340)\nF. Sherwood Taylor (1940\u201345, temporary; 1945\u201350)\nC. H. Josten (1950\u201364; 1964\u201394, emeritus)\nF. R. Maddison (1964\u201394)\nJ. A.

          "Radio apparatus used by Marconi, Roman astrolabes, blackboard used by Einstein, etc, etc. Selected items from world class collections.",
          "One of Oxford's smaller museums but no less impressive for that. The amazing stories of developing scientic breakthroughs such as Einstein's analysis of the universe (note his formulae on the very blackboard he used in the 1930s) is really too much to take in on a single visit.",
          "Excellent guide. A lift on the exterior of the building serves lower ground floor only. No lift to upper floor",

          "My husband is a scientist, so we \"had\" to visit this museum, and I have to admit that I was impressed. The focus of the exhibits was on measurement, and the artifacts are well labeled and impressive. I think that children would be bored, but for many adults this museum is",
          "This museum is solely for the the history of scientific equipment. If you are interested in science and what equipment you need or needed to carry out scientific experiments; this is the place for you. In the basement there is a demonstration of how static electricity is",

          "Well this is an interesting museum with lots (perhaps too many given the small size of the museum) of interesting equipment used by important figures in the history science - it would repay careful study by someone interested in this topic. To others it is a confusing collection",
          "We came to view Einsteins Blackboard & disappointingly the gallery was closed for a private event....nigh on a 3rd of the museum, given it was the whole of the bottom floor. There are some other interesting pieces however to make the main attraction unavailable is akin to going",
          "The museum is great for seeing a lot of the history of science objects. Highlight is probably the blackboard used by Einstein in 1930s when he gave some lectures on the expanding Universe which is in the basement. Upstairs is a great history of timepieces. Would thoroughly",

          "For anyone interested in science and it\u2019s history, the collection will be fascinating. There\u2019s a friendly, relaxed atmosphere with space to relax, think and be. However, there is no getting over the fact that the museum is desperately in need of refurbishment. Once that",
          "Myself and a close friend visited the Museum of Science the first week in August as a first visit to Oxford. The museum was one of the first we approached, and it looked very beautiful and we were very excited about what we might discover. As we were approaching the stairs,",
          "Although small, this museum has free entry and some unique exhibits. The highlight for me is a blackboard used by Einstein himself to deliver a lecture! As a tip, in extreme heat the top gallery is closed from 1:30 to 3pm, so avoid visiting at this time.",
          "Some of the exhibits are marvelous. I particularly like the story of Ada |Lovelace, Byron's daughter, which was fascinating. However the place was dark, dismal and badly lit. The stairs down to the lower floor were poorly lit and difficult for my wife who has sight issues. It",
          "And this place is a little more \"collection\" than \"museum\". Case upon case of historical scientific instruments, in particular, those relating to navigation, astronomy, measurement, computation and chemistry. Worth the detour if you have an interest in science. As a scientist,",
          "Nice place, with a lot of ancient astrolabs, but not only. A lot of insightful explanations about discoveries in different fields, astronomy, medicine, electricity and telecommunications, etc.",
          "I visited the museum and was amazed at the variety of exhibits, especially the butterfly and birds collection.",
          "This museum is sited in an old building (wide, creaky stairs and no air conditioning). There is much to interest anyone with a scientific bent, and even those without one will be impressed by the blackboard which Einstein wrote on when he gave lectures there.",
          "No entrance fee and the exhibits go through three floors. You can see the early microscopes and how they developed through the ages. From the most basic instrument right through to the more sophisticated models, (which by today's standards would be basic). See the artificial",

          "Rather small inside but worth a look if you appreciate the sciences! We very much enjoyed there collection of Orrerys and sundials :) Not to mention the blackboard from one of Einstein\u2019s lectures! One of the must see museums if your visiting Oxford!",
          "Great collection of old instruments, 17C microscopes, telescopes, old chemistry sets, Dorothy Hodgkin's ORIGINAL 3D structure of Insulin! Under-rated!",
          "Our trip was defined by what we couldn't do. Don't wear a bag, don't take in food or drink, don't sit on the steps. Don't hold the sweets you have taken from your children. Probably interesting for adults. If you have young kids avoid.",

          "Everything about this museum fits its scope and makes it unique. The collection of astrolabes is second to none, the array of instruments runs from the gross (autopsy tools) to the sublime (16th-century pocket sundials), and of course there's Einstein's preserved chalkboard in",
          "It was free and had a couple of cool items like Einstein\u2019s blackboard from a lecture. But it also had a crazy amount of other items that were identified but has no indication how they were used. I have a PhD and left feeling pretty empty and wishing there was a helpful guide to",
          "From the outside it looks very impressive and the architecture of the building itself is an attraction. The museum of history and science holds a lot of pieces given its size! It is quite 'cosy' so i don't think i would recommend it to wheelchair users. In addition, the feel of",
          "This museum is tiny. It has three floors, and is not a great deal bigger than a large house. You can get a good feel for it in an hour. But I will bet you feel you want to go back. The two upper floors are dedicated to astronomy, microscopes (why aren't all microscopes",
          "With it being free, excellent value. There were a lot of unique exhibits on display, including Einstein's blackboard (with his writing still on). Unfortunately we seemed to visit in between special exhibits. Still worth going along just for the standard exhibits though. Original",
          "Best thing about it is that it is free. However if you have mobility issues, dont bother. There are stairs to climb and to be honest I did not find it of interest. There is Einsteins original blackboard on the lower ground floor, but difficult to see properly because of",
          "Staff were very helpful and full of knowledge. On learning we were from Australia, staff immediately pointed us in the direction of exhibits that may be particularly relevant. I was most excited to find the skull of Phineas Gage. Einstein's chalkboard was interesting and I",
          "Well worth spending a couple of hours here, with or without an interest in science. We found the basement area particularly interesting, make sure you see Einstein's blackboard.!",
          "Free to enter which is rare in Oxford. Great collection of globes and navigational equipment and scientific instruments",
          "You\u2019ve probably never heard of this museum before, and although it\u2019s not big and grand like the Ashmolean or insanely eccentric like the Pitt Rivers, it\u2019s still a great little museum! Best collection of scientific instruments I\u2019ve seen only after the Galileo Museum in Florence.",

          "The museum appears hidden away and has slightly unusual opening hours - but nevertheless is well worth a visit. Exhibits are over three floors and for me, the most interesting were the beautiful hand held sun dials, as well as the exhibits from the early days of the telegraph",
          "Very interesting visit but was expecting a greater range of exhibits (rather like a mini Science Museum) but given the size of the building I understand they have had to limit the scope. Altogether well worth it and I will visit again to fill in the bits I missed!",

          "The first time that I visited this museum, I was truly surprised to find that it made me think about ideas that I took for granted. For instance, the idea of time measurement has had an extraordinarily complicated history and it's all documented here. There are so many of the",
          "Great visit, we joined the free tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable and obviously enjoyed showing people the museum.",
          "I enjoyed looking around this museum. There are some interesting things to look at in there. I found the finds from when they did some work in the building very interesting. There is a lot of things in some of the cabinets, so plenty to look at.",
          "This museum is tiny, but with some really interesting items. We had but a little time so we went in just to see a famous piece of blackboard that Einstein used during his lecture in Oxford. It was never wiped clean, but framed and protected behind glass instead! The entrance is",
          "Lovely little museum for those interested in science and its history, particularly physics and navigation. The collection can be a little repetitive (huge amount of astrolabes), but some of the old craftmanship is very intricate and given that there is no entry fee it's worth",

          "We came on the end of the day after seeing other museums that Oxford is offering. It didn't impress us much - after previous ones this one looked underfinanced. The upper floor was closed due to employees illness, so only downstairs was available. There are surely very",

          "Magnificent medieval building housing an eccentric collection of largely ancient scientific instruments. Astrolabes, globes and microscopes are to the fore. Its all a bit dusty and old-fashioned, but for a free attraction, in a grandiose setting, to complain is churlish.",
          "This is a very small museum that has a handful of artifacts that are worth seeing. I enjoyed seeing Marconi\u2019s wireless, a chalkboard Einstein used for a talk, and the fragments of Babbage\u2019s Difference Engine. If you\u2019re a science geek, go for it. Pretty remarkable how",
          "I have taken my two boys to many, many museums, and on the whole they love them. So I was surprised that they found this one so disappointing, though even as an adult, I found it 'dry'. The building is attractive and my younger son did enjoy the chandeliers hanging in the",

          "Unfortunately the upper part of the museum was closed due to staff shortages. The ground floor and basement areas were very interesting though. Einsteinium chalkboard was interesting to see in the basement.",
          "Nice Middle Ages Museum. Filled with local area stuff. Not as interesting as the Pitt River or Natural History Museums, but another stop in Oxford if you have the time.",
          "A great little museum, housed in splendid old building in the heart of Oxford. Free admission, but obviously they are grateful for donations. We came for the exhibition 'Back from the Dead - Demystifying Antibiotics.' On the way to the basement where the exhibition was housed,",
          "Have lived in oxford for many years and never been in this museum. It was very interesting. Especially if your into science (medicines) and machine like clocks. The stairs are hard going and creak. We spend around 30 mins looking at the old history.",
          "This museum has also free admission. It is a small museum but definitely a worth to visit. There are fascinating displays here for example the blackboard with notes by Einstein in his lecture in Oxford university in 1931. The displays also include some interesting early",
          "The building, in Broad Street, was the original home of the Ashmolean Museum, but now houses a fascinating collection of scientific exhibits - probably the most famous is the blackboard, still bearing Einstein's writing from his visit to Oxford. In addition a host of",
          "This is not a large attraction by any means, and can easily become crowded. However the exhibits are fascinating. Hundreds of years ago these instruments had to be invented they didn't have a manual! As an enthusiastic photographer, I found all the camera equipment on display",
          "Just opposite Blackwell`s Bookshop on Broad Street in Oxford, is the Museum of the History of Science. It is easy to miss. So look out for the Sculptures of Large Male heads on the pillars outside, and climb the stone steps. You enter the middle of three floors, with fascinating",
          "There's nothing nicer then dipping into a bit of free history. It's a very cramped experience and personally I'd have loved a bit more information on some of the items, that said this is run by volunteers I believe, the building itself is beautiful, worth a visit but possibly",
          "This is quite a large museum dedicated to the history of science, showcasing scientific instruments, but not all built for the purpose of doing actual work with them. Quite a few are artistic gems. Currently in the basement there is an exhibition about penicillin and the Oxford",
          "We had a free guided tour of this unusual museum which made it more interesting, as a few pieces were pointed out and explained. Some of the exhibits are a bit dry but if you're interested in old instruments, clocks, cameras etc it's the place for you. There was an interesting",
          "We just thoroughly enjoyed the exhibition about penicillin. Lots of information but well and imaginatively presented for the general public.",
          "Definitely follow the (free) guided tour if there's one when you're there (there are several per day). Wonderful collection of compasses, clocks, and Einstein's blackboard from a lecture he gave. Very kid friendly, with activities and things to find/collect.",
          "This is a nice museum with beautiful pieces of astronomy. Interesting for chemists and physicists. There is a blackboard in the upper floor with a small Albert Einstein's class when he came to oxford. Entrance free, but you can make a donation.",
          "Entered the museum and instantly felt welcomed to just browse and nose around. The displays were arranged by instruments which emphasized the changes in technology over the years. This museum does not charge admission and is dependent on donations so please be generous if you",
          "The rating is based on my interests, and not necessarily the quality of the museum as a whole. I was waiting for the Old Bodleian tour and wandered into this museum. Interesting, for me, on a superficial level as I do not have a particular interest in science. The astrolabes,",
          "We popped in. Whistle stop tour round but quite a bit to see if you like science. Shame there's not much info about many of the exhibits.",
          "Only in Oxford would there be a museum like this . Massive display of everything scientific including dome seriously macabre surgery tools !",
          "As a Scientist it was great to see the exhibits close up, The staff were knowledgable and very friendly.",
          "Size does not matter when comes to museums. This is a rather tiny museum however the stuff and gadgets in there have enormous impact in mankind history particularly the Einstein Blackboard. One should not miss this when visiting Oxford!",
          "Called in whilst passing. Well worth a visit as there are a lot of fascinating pieces of equipment on display. Hope they get the lift fixed soon as it is a trial if you have a pushchair.",
          "This is a great place to visit if you have even the most passing interest in science or scientific instrumentation with everything from early astrolabes to early photographic equipment and artists drawing aids.",
          "Nice museum with some extremely interesting objects on display including a blackboard used by Albert Einstein himself. Staff were a little pushy with seeking donations which bordered on awkward.",
          "I basically just wandered into this museum not expecting much, but I came away quite impressed. The museum is very small, it deserves bigger space, but it has some very valuable artifacts from the last few hundred years. He best part was the shop, which has some very interesting",
          "As soon as I stepped into this museum, I was confronted by a male member of staff who asked for a donation. I had barely had my bearing of where I was. I politely said I don't have any change, which I honestly didn't as a tourist. He insisted to give me change if I give him any",
          "This is a nice collection of various scientific instruments covering different fields from Astronomy to Medicine, as well as various navigational instruments, clocks and other assorted items from the history of Science. Very interesting displays, but perhaps a bit jumbled",
          "For the size of the museum, the collection of early scientific instruments is housed in the world\u2019s oldest surviving purpose-built museum building, the contents are fantastic, many ground breaking inventions, and exhibits of monumental importance, some are priceless, are",
          "Anyone who loves beautiful things will enjoy a visit here. You do not need to have an interest in science although that adds another dimension of course. This is a small museum with quite a lot to see over 3 floors and as it is free and central you can pop in for 10 minutes or",
          "Worth visiting for display of all types of scientific instrumentation across hundreds of years. It's amazing how science has been emphasised in different cultures across the centuries.",
          "Science not really my thing but some interesting artifacts. worth a look if you have time. small shop downstairs. free entry. On three levels.",
          "Stop by and make sure you take a careful look at the heads mounted on the fence work! Amazing architecture.",
          "only basement and ground floor open, just wanted to pop in and see Einstein 's blackboard. there are some lovely items here. not bad for a museum out of London",
          "I enjoyed this museum. It's got some good exhibits and some good history Inc. An equation Einstein did on a visit to the city. It's on lots of floors. Not sure if lift is available for those who can't do lots of steps. Free museums are the way they should be. Well done.",
          "This is a very interesting collection of scientific artefacts and instruments. I really enjoyed going here and it was larger than I expected. There were several trails for the children to help them explore it too. Definitely worth a visit when in Oxford.",
          "Great things to see here and they change the focus regularly to keep people interested. they also run courses for people to join to get involved in science.",
          "excellent place to spend a few hours looking at the exhibits and interacting with the past. Friendly place to be what ever the weather.",
          "Nice place to spend an hour or two in. One floor was closed due to staff illness when we went so unable to see everything. Many of the items would benefit from more information to assist lay visitors. As a scientist myself I seemed to spend quite a bit of time explaining to my",
          "We enjoyed a couple of hours in this little gem of a museum. Exhibits from physics to pharmacology and everything in between. A stunning collection of antique instruments.",
          "I am glad I went to this museum and while it has some old and interesting scientific items to view there are a lot of very similar objects. My main problem with the museum is the name as it implies that you will be shown a history of science and this is not the case; there is",
          "The name of the museum is a bit misleading; the real heart of the collection is older scientific instruments. If you love brass and gears, this is the place! It's wonderful to see all the astrolabes, sundials, microscopes, drawing instruments, and so much else. It's a pretty",
          "Unfortunately we could only spend forty minutes here at the end of a long day of sightseeing. However the staff were both welcoming and friendly. The exhibits were very interesting and we especially liked the formulae written by Einstein on a blackboard whilst lecturing in",
          "Some nice pieces in the collection but could be displayed in a more engaging way, with more explanatory info. In fairness I am not a science buff so probably not the intended audience. Gift shop uninspiring",
          "The collection seems a bit stretched under the title 'history of science'...the museum is quite small, and science is a pretty big area... The displays are mostly mathematical science and astronomy-related. Good to learn more about how Islam and the Middle East influenced the",
          "I love the history of science (leaning a bit more towards the biology/medicine side of things) and found a lot of that in the basement level. If you are interested in mathematics, physics, and astronomy, then you will delight in the tons of artifacts this museum has collected",
          "I love science and was looking forward to this, just a little boring really so wouldn't recommend, good thing is that it was free.",
          "High hopes for this trip to the museum - lots of fascinating sundials and orbs and quadrants etc ...fascinating but very little information on how they were used or by whom and specifically what for. Sadly just information that they were collections belonging to specific people.",
          "This museum is great for the science junkie. Have you ever seen an astrolabe? The lower floor has Einsteins Blackboard if that interest you as well as a great epenecilin exhibit. Worth a quick visit.",
          "Wonderful artefacts. You need time to look carefully at all the instruments and then you realize how interesting they are. Good for a short visit.",
          "The Museum of the History of Science is free of charge, something that is unusual these days. The museum has three floors. The theme was interesting (physics, medicine and navigation), but there was not much information about the items - besides itself. The museum could be a lot",
          "Free!! Many interesting science exhibits,collections of instruments and tools. Think I saw my old high school slide rule! Downstairs be sure to see the Einstein blackboard- his actual writing from a lecture at Oxford. Worth a visit for all involved in a science industry or",
          "We have been to this museum before but were pleasantly surprised to find our way to the top floor. We had missed this floor when we visited before. The lady there was very patient and kind. She brought instruments to our attention we would have missed and explained how things",
          "If you like science, old machine, microscopes, naval equipment from all over the world! this is the place to go. Its free and friendly",
          "Very centrally situated and with a good selection of scientific exhibits. Its good to look in on a tour but remember that most museums are closed in Oxford on Monday.",
          "This museum had all kinds of beautiful scientific instruments and equipment. It shows a time when before science was \"sterile\" and when the makers of precision instruments were artisans. Many lovely astrolabes, globes, etc. But it is a bit of a specialised interest. The",
          "This museum is full of all kinds of items: astrolabes for navigation -tiny feats of early engineering and beautiful too: engraved and intricate. A blackboard, preserved with Einstein's lesson in chalk. Even if you have no particular interest in science and its history, you;ll",
          "A great place to go and view some of the great ideas and inventions undertaken by our forefathers. Could spend many hours here",
          "This museum was very small and quite dark. Bit disappointed as it wasnt what we expected. Free entry. Would take 30 mins to an hour to visit.",
          "Housed in a beautiful ancient building and tons of scientific instruments, astrolobes, clocks, sundials, globes. Even the blackboard Einstein used when at Oxford. Free entrance and a world of science, well explained and docents to explain anything that you have a question",
          "Free entrance and a good selection of exhibits well laid out with detailed explanations very interesting.",
          "We have walked past this building a few times but this time noticed a sign for this museum. Very helpful staff showed told us about free wifi and the app that would help our self-guided tour. Not a big place but absolutely fascinating. Some great exhibits.",
          "Was looking forward to visiting this museum, but was disappointed that there were no real descriptions or displays showing how the instruments were used and what they were used for. There were a lot of different instruments from all ages, many of them made to exacting precision",
          "I had forgotten I had seen this online until walking past so popped in. Very friendly and helpful staff and quite a bit to see. Probably a bit to specialised for some.",
          "You cannot visit Oxford without going to this museum. It has the most incredible collection of scientific instruments. The blackboard Einstein wrote out formulae on has pride of place on the wall upstairs.",
          "We are science nerds and enjoyed the display of measuring devices from sextants to compass' to architectural drawing instruments. But it is a bit repetitive and there is no finger... you have to know the other exhibit I reference.",
          "Had about 45 minutes to kill before boarding our coach. Thought we would just pop in for a taster viewing. Husband managed to climb the steps even with dodgy knees and spend about 10 minutes browsing the glass cabinets on the entrance floor. I was bored from the moment I stepped",
          "This museum has everything that shows the progress of science ranging from radio technology to electricity. Einstein's blackboard is a very interesting addition to the museum. Highly recommend a visit to anyone regardless of interest in Science.",
          "The name suggests a little bit more than what it is, namely a neatly laid out collection of historical scientific instruments, mostly measuring tools. If you are into science, it can be nice to spend a little time here, but it could have been more.",
          "Arrived near to closing. Greeted by a lovely Scottish gentleman. No sorry we are nearly closed but a warm welcome and guidance what to see in limited time. Headed down to see Einsteins blackboard. Fantastic! This will be our first port of call on future visits, only scraped the",
          "This museum has fallen behind the times. Its collection is excellent, and the staff are helpful. On the other hand, the exhibits are dated and fail to engage with the audience. It's a good museum for those who are truly interested. For the casual visitor it's not so good.",
          "This is old school stuff: but fascinating with it. A collection of odd instruments shows what passed for science once upon a time - but it's a charming place that is full of history. A blackboard used by Einstein, just one example, but there are many others. Not friendly for",
          "As an engineer I found this visit completely enthralling. I could only wonder as to how past scientists and engineers managed to make the life-changing discoveries which govern our lives today given the crude apparatus on display. Took 3 hours to go around only half of it so",
          "We are lucky enough to live nearby so we tend to use this as a quick dip resource rather than spending a long time here. Repeated visits mean the kids are learning to behave better there - it is a VERY quiet museum if you have children! Though they do offer family workshops and",
          "This museum would more appropriately be called the museum of historical scientific devices. It is free and worth a quick stop, but it is not a science museum in the sense that most people would think.",
          "This museum is rather small, but does have a lot of neat things to checkout. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "This is a three story small museums with loads to offer! Not only were the staff so generous and knowledgeable, but they could talk to all kinds of people! This museum is free so worth your time to look around! They even had a chalk board with Instien's (if that's how it's",
          "My husband really wanted to go here, my daughter (10) and I were less keen! The building itself, both in/out is stunning. The man at the entrance was happy and friendly. Some of the exhibits were rather interesting, and it was well organised. The steps were very steep",
          "Microscopes, post mortem sets, surgery sets were v interesting. Personally not v interested in sundials and measurement /calculation instruments though. But generally v worth a visit. Postcard collections so so.",
          "My teen was keen to visit here and was totally absorbed by the artifacts. Lots of astronomical instruments which as my son is currently doing a GCSE in Astronomy totally enthralled him. Well worth a visit!",
          "Though I do not think this is a museum for children, I always find something that interests me whether a medical instrument of navigational instrument.",
          "There is a lift, which will only take you to the basement of this museum. On the day of our visit, the lift was broken",
          "We visited this place on a cold and rainy day. It is small however, we amazed hie they fit amount of pieces such a small place. Due to weather it was over crowded and was difficult to spend enough time for each item. Overall great place to visit",
          "Didn't have long to visit this museum but enjoyed looking a the old medical and scientific instruments. Was quite dark and crowded as it was raining outside so difficult to see some of the exhibits. Not a place to take children as I doubt they'd see much and you need to read",
          "One can't deny that the London museums have scale and grandeur. But for me, much as I loved them as a kid, they are too much. The museums of Oxford represent all that is good in museums. Just the right size and not lacking in exhibits. This museum is no exception. Ham-packed",
          "There was so much I wanted to look at! Stopped in here for a flying visit and was very impressed by the collection. Entry is free, with a suggested donation, and I only wish I could've stayed longer. It felt like a house packed with curiosities, rather than a museum, in many",
          "This is such a nice little building which houses great treasures like Einstein's genuine handwritten notes on a blackboard, the penicillin, different early astronomical gadgets and other stuff early scientists used. It was quite fun knowing more about the past",
          "Fascinating little museum right in the centre of Oxford. Lots of old scientific instruments, and a few iconic new ones too. Einstein's blackboard was a highlight.",
          "A really nice museum - perhaps more for adults than children though as much of the exhibits are items in glass and read the card. Top item for me has to be the chalk-board used by Einstein left untouched after he delivered a lecture.",
          "A free collection of scientific curiosities well worth your time. The first public museum in the world, imagine that. We happened to enter just when a tour was about to start. I highly recommend latching on to one because a passionate volunteer, at least in my experience,",
          "I'm glad that I live in the 21st C - the \"sawbones\" certainly made you think what happened before the NHS!! An amazing collection - well worth the FREE visit.",
          "A great collection of scientific equipment. There isn't much space, so big bags are a nuisance. There are also lots of stairs, so buggies are a no- no. Really good if you want to learn about navigational equipment",
          "The first thing I was directed to was the Magical Tablet used by the Elizabethan Astrologer Dr John Dee. The assistant started by telling me there were things that were considered science in their time, but wouldn't be now!! The buildings are old and there would be problems with",
          "We were not sure about this museum, yet after reaching it around 4.30pm, we were sure that we will not be able to visit other museums in Oxford, as they seem to all close at 5pm. This museum is free of charge, has not queues whatsoever, plus with very friendly staff that try to",
          "An vast assortment of scientific instruments and equipment. because so many subjects are covered, you are bound to find something of interest. Do not hesitate to make conversation with the room guides who are so helpful, enthusiastic and full of interesting information. And it",
          "Staff very helpful. Small museum all based on science. Well worth a visit. Building its set in is amazing. Free to visit with a donation box. Lots of information all over. Set over 3 floors.",
          "We paid a short visit to this museum with family who are Oxford residents. The room downstairs is small but plenty of exhibits if scientific artefacts interest you. Free entry. Children's activities going on.",
          "The building was formerly the home of the Ashmolean Museum. Had a brief 15 minute look around yesterday. There are so many interesting and unusual exhibits that you could spend hours here. I particularly like the collection of historic globes, which are tucked away in a corner",
          "I recommend taking one of the FREE tours which are offered a few times each day. It is not a large museum, but what is here is highly interesting and the docents provide considerable information. The tour lasts only about 30-45 minutes, but you can stay as long as you like -",
          "This is a great little museum that is worth a quick look particularly for those with a fascination for science and the history of discovery. Among the many great historical objects is a blackboard with a hand written formula in chalk by Albert Einstein written during a lecture",
          "This was our second visit in a short period of time. Although it was the same exhibits, we were still mesmerized by the age and variety of items. The globe's alone are worth a visit.",
          "There are some very interesting things to see here I spent a very rainy day loosing myself for an hour and learning a few things along the way worth a visit",
          "This museum has one of the most extensive collections of scientific instrument I have ever seen (and I have seen a good few). The skill and precision of the workers has to be seen to be believed. One thing that particularly caught my attention was the display of microscopes.",
          "In these halls you'll see the instruments that helped man pursue knowledge for the past 1000 years. Many are exquisitely crafted with fabulous artistic skill. Often the instruments pay homage to God which I found instructive since the cultural norm these days seems to be that",
          "Me and my partner loved this museum. It was hard going on my knees with the stairs but I didn't care as I wanted to see everything. We want to go back as we couldn't take everything in as there is so much in each cabinet.... See you again soon",
          "Free entry and great for an hour or so to amuse older children. Some wonderful artefacts demonstrating the skills of the craftsmen sometimes despite the science being incorrect.",
          "This is a relatively small museum but full of interest. Especially recommended to those with an interest in science. I thought I would be in there for 20 minutes or so and stayed for two hours, and I still did not see everything. And its free!",
          "Excellent, accessible range of exhibits of scientific apparatus and experimental equipment. Free entry and definitely worth a visit even if you're not a science buff.",
          "So happy that me and my partner popped in.... spent such a long time taking in everything. ... I could spend days just looking at everything.... will have to pop back to make sure I haven't missed anything",
          "This is a very interesting museum. Not too big so easily done. The ground floor usually holds a special exhibition so check before you go. But the Blackboard is always there.",
          "Went here on a recommendation. Great collection of early astronomical instruments on the floor you enter on. Explanatory information is clear and well presented. Loved this place.",
          "The trip through the scientific equipment used by well known characters from history was fascinating with everything from and astrolabe to hand blown glass flasks",
          "This museum is very much one for science enthusiasts only. It could benefit from some information on the principles behind the equipment on display. There are collections of sundials (which I did enjoy looking at), measuring instruments, globes etc. I'm afraid I quickly became",
          "Tons of history...could spend hours in this place. Tons of medical & astrology history. Well worth a few hours of your time.",
          "We loved visiting this museum because we have a family connection with Harry Moseley who was tragically killed in Gallipoli in 1915 and whose research led to the discovery of new elements in the periodic table. It was fascinating to feel a connection with he exhibits which",
          "lots of very interesting scientific instruments set out in cabinets - einstein's handwritten notes on display",
          "Devoted primarily to the tools devised for scientific study during the Renaissance-to-Industrical Revolution",
          "This was my first visit as a tourist to Oxford. It won't be my last due to hidden gems like this museum. The scientific equipment on show is fascinating. Such delicate items that have been cared for by generations. I loved the compasses, the astrological interpretations of the",
          "We just happened to call in as there was an exhibition on and we thought we would take advantage of our visit to see it. It is a fascinating building and the displays are well thought out and easy to see. Very enjoyable.",
          "We enjoyed looking around this museum, plenty to see. Fascinating items to look at. Loved the creaky floorboards!!!!",
          "Had some very fascinating displays on an expansive variety of scientific equipment and measurement devices, but the museum itself seemed a bit small. Essentially three different (albeit large) rooms as well as a special exhibit section. Still some very interesting pieces of 17th",
          "I was deeply dissapointed with this museum. I had hopes it would be a small scale version of the museum in London much like the History Museum was but unless you like globes or compasses there really wasn't anything to see. The museum also showed a lot of glass chemistry",
          "Lots and lots of compasses!.. some interesting information that is well displayed over three floors. Especially interesting display of medical equipment, just a shame there wasn't more of it. More varid displays with more information would make the experience so much better.",
          "I sent the day visiting the museums in Oxford - The Natural History / Pitt Rivers and The Ashmolean all of which are stunning. This museum however is small and disappointing, however if you are a scientist, you may find it all interesting. It is very nicely set up I should add",
          "Take advantage of any opportunity to visit, a beautiful building with fascinating artefacts. So many things to see!",
          "This is just a collection of scientific instruments. It is not clear how these instruments contributed to the history of science.",
          "This museum isn't massive, but it still has some interesting artefacts and pieces on display. It was free to enter. We particularly enjoyed going through the Dear Harry exhibition. Although he died during WWI, it was incredibly interesting to see his work and achievements and",
          "A museum that has many curios including Einstein's blackboard upon which he wrote his famous theory of relativity",
          "Artifacts in this museum are nicely presented and really good for my 13 year old family friend to learn about the old apparatus.",
          "Wasn't expecting this museum to be as good as it turned out to be. We accidentally got involved in a tour, which turned out to be very good since our tour guide was engaging and very knowledgable about the museum and the pieces on display. Lots of astrolabes and old scientific",
          "Lots of interesting old brass ornate instruments, some previously owned by famous historical engineers like Brunel. Microscopes, orrerys and other stuff. Fabulous.",
          "Housed in the original Ashmolean building this is an absolutely charming museum. They have a very comprehensive collection on the history of chemistry and astronomy. The guards were more than happy to explain some of the items and answer general questions. Definitively worth a",
          "What a fascinating place to visit. Do not be fooled by its small size or its lengthy title - this is a place that has a genuine blackboard that ALBERT EINSTEIN wrote on hung innocently on a wall! From old models of the universe where earth is the centre, to massive teloscopes to",
          "Given that my boy has short attention span, the small museum and short guided tour was just right for us. We loved the uniqueness of the museum and the rich history of science objects. The guide, Robert, was fantastic story teller!",
          "Amazing collection of scientific objects; first antibiotic culture dishes, finest collection of astrolabes in the universe, digital timepieces, Marconi's original radio gear! Lewis Carroll's photographic gear, Einstein's blackboard! They have a programme of family friendly",
          "Pleasantly surprised by the amount of stuff they managed to cram into such a small space! Einstein's blackboard!!",
          "This is a stunning museum. I only saw part of it and was sad not to have more time. The lower floors are filled with antique scientific instruments from times when such objects were not just useful but beautiful. The special exhibit when we were there (on Geeks) was",
          "Why I think you should stop by this museum: - It is free of charge (save money!); - It is a little one, on three small floors, so it won't take much of your time; - There's Einstain's blackboard about relativity of when he gave lectures about it in Oxford in 1931 (where will you",
          "As found on a free walking tour of Oxford (which was excellent), I stopped off to look at this Museum. Firstly, its completely free (donations accepted). The recent Henry 'Harry' Moseley exhibition is the outdtanding feature. The actual instrumemts available to view are quite",
          "The museum had a good range of astronomy exhibits and a nice selection of early chemistry and medical equipment but I was hoping for a little more variation. But you can not go wrong for free!",

          "I wish I came to this museum more than just once. Each section contains so much interesting info/history that you need time to digest it.",
          "This has a lot of interesting items for those who like to see old things. There is a blackboard that Einstein wrote equations on very old microscopes, the telescope that was used to discover Uranus. Oh and let's not forget the items used to help discover penicillin! The layout",
          "Boring. Unless you really love scientific instruments, avoid. Much better to visit The Science Museum in London or MOSI in Manchester. In fairness in the space available a useful history of science would be difficult. But there doesn't seem to be any attempt to tell ANY",

          "Easy to find on Broad St and free to enter makes this museum quite appealing. On entering it doesn't look that big but the place is crammed full of different curiosities, it actually shows some superb workmanship in articles such as microscopes and astrolobes and how such things",
          "This is a small museum entered via Broad Street. Entry is free. No doubt scientists can marvel at the ingenuity of our forebears. For the less well informed, the instruments are all so very beautiful - a joy to look at and marvel at for the workmanship, as well as the science.",
          "A great collection of medical instruments, navigational instruments, etc. It is dark, old and interesting.",
          "We visited the new exhibition after listening to a John Humphreys interview on Today. What a disappointment. We expected to see Henry Moseley's work properly explained, but there was virtually nothing except a short video and a chart which made no sense at all. Lots of maps",
          "Lots of curious instruments, but we were disappointed by the lack of detail in the signage and labelling. All \"what\" and no \"why\", or even \"how it's used\", so we learned little that we didn't know already. Nothing compared to the exhibition in the Weston library nearby.",

          "The Museum of the History of Science is based in the world\u2019s oldest surviving purpose-built museum building, cramming several thousand exhibits over three quite small floors, linked by a large wooden staircase, so it's not easy for those with mobility problems. This means that",
          "One of the best places that I visited in Oxford. The museum is amazing, full of history, ancient devices as a the first calculators, clocks, armillary spheres, etc. It is quite small in comparison with other similar museums, but it offers an extraordinary experience (a free",

          "Insufficient labelling meant that many of the exhibits were unexplained which was a shame. Science IS interesting but you felt none of those 'eureka' moments here. A couple of hands on stuff (which you had to pay for) and the whole place dark and gloomy. Again spoilt by over",
          "Well, this museum mostly consists of a seemingly endless collection of brass scientific instruments. Even after casting my eye over them I don't even know what some of them are, since there's not much in the way of explanation. There are helpful volunteers around to ask, but I",
          "A great little museum which i would highly recommend visiting when in Oxford there is alot to look at and has a unique collection. If you have an interest in science or the history of science then it's a definitely worth a visit.",

          "Enjoyed seeing intricately gorgeous astronomical artefacts such as compendiums, telescopes, astrolabes and globes. If you're a fan of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy you might spot a few alethiometer lookalikes. Don't miss the blackboard featuring an equation written",
          "We stumbled upon this excellent Museum on our way to various universities. Dinasour skeletons, T Rex and friends made for a lovely downstairs display amongst other exhibits. The kids seemed to be enjoying the apes and shrunken heads etc.",

          "A great museum in city centre, full of historically relevant scientific items and paraphernalia. The museum is laid out over multiple floors and has an amazing amount of items. If you want to soak it all up, plan on at least a couple hours. Entrance is free so you can even nip",
          "As we were walking up the steps to this museum, I folded a bag of nuts and put them in my bag. As we entered a guide jumped on us telling me eating was not allowed in the museum. I replied I knew and that was why I put them away outside the museum. This guide then proceeded to",
          "This was the evening when ALL the museums of Oxford reopen at 7pm, there are a lot of them. This is a fascinating, small (only really three levels) place which does have main Oxford contributions to the world displayed: Antibiotics anyone? Well worth a visit, even for those with",

          "The museum is on 3 floors of a very old (1600s) building which is interesting in its own right - though it is full of ancient astrolabes and orrerys etc, which scientists and men of letters used centuries ago. It's a bit \"dry\" for non scientists in my view.",

          "A do not miss museum in Oxford. Popped in for a cursory look (PS it is FREE) and got drawn in for an hour - wishing I had even more time. Make sure you take in all floors as each one has its own character (and volunteers who seem to love what they do!). Thoroughly enjoyed it.",
          "Just as one flocks Mona Lisa in Luovre the same happens in this museum about Einstein's Black Board. But the museum has many other things to show. Eg. The museum has the world's finest collection of astrolabes. There is an interesting exhibition about the Oxford sciencegroups",

          "A beautiful collection of scientific instruments. Orrerys, microscopes, telescopes and much more. And it's all free. (but please leave a donation)",
          "The museum feels a bit like a Tardis - the cram so much \"stuff\" in. Not sure entirely what order (if any) they are in, but somehow that doesn't matter. The whole building shows how important Oxford has been in terms of scientific discoveries over the years and individual",
          "Loads of brass apparatus and interesting inventions so even if science history isn't your thing, go to see the beauty. If science history is your thing, there's even more for you here. The docents seem quite knowledgeable and eager to point out the most interesting things.",

          "Some of the most bizzare things I've ever seen, but interesting. Best thing was seeing Einstein's blackboard, but there were globes and all sorts to marvel at. There was an interesting crystals exhibit too. It's free to go in and just asks for donations. Also I noticed there",
          "Situated in an old town mansion right next door to the Bodleian library, the Museum of the History of Science is an unknown gem outside of the city which you be glad to be taken to when you visit. With collections over the three floors open to the public, there are many unusual",
          "and if I was in Oxford for a further day I would have gone again. You could almost fill an hour with each case in the basement and there are a dozen of them, the special exhibition on crystals was worth a look and that is even before you think of the floor you go in on, then",
          "This is one of those hidden gems which you stumble over. Chocked to the brim with scientific instruments of all descriptions, yet still accessible to anyone due to carefully crafted explanatory signage and the extremely informative guides. Very much worth your time.",
          "It's a nice museum with free admission. It was kind of interesting to see all the old science stuff and the free family tours they offered seemed to be a lot of fun for the children. But for me it got boring after 30 min. They have like 20 times the same stuff. Not like one or",

          "Hidden away in a back street in Oxford lay this wonderful museum! So many treasures that you'd have no idea about unless you ventured inside. My wife and I visited both this museum and the Ashmolean and we both preferred this one. Make suer you see the dinosaurs before you",
          "I loved it though I found it hard to get past the heavy emphasis of Darwinism (remember, it's still an unproven theory). That aside the displays were really interesting and worth every minute invested in the exhibits.",
          "Very interesting displays, free entrance and full of quirky old gadgets. Like all the museums in Oxford, it is free and is covered lightly on the free tour, but you are free to stay and explore, which I highly recommend.",
          "not many would know that some of the first Dinosaur skeletons were discovered somewhere in Oxford itself. And also good to learn that Alice in the Wonderland was created there... So many little surprises in this great fun place for children.",
          "A wonderful little museum full of artifacts, measures, surgeons tools from earlier times. The blackboard Einstein used in May, 1931 is framed and reserved, explaining relativity. You must go when in Oxford.",
          "This is a great museum and is the second time we have visited. On the first occasion there was a table talk about an astrolabe owned by Elizabeth I. We were impressed with the large number of beautiifully-made instruments housed in wooden boxes. Take the time to visit and come",
          "You need to have an interest in Science to enjoy this one but it is not big enough to take a lot of your time and so it is worth a drop-in while passing in Oxford. Add it to your itinerary",
          "There was outside construction work happening at the time we visited. However that did not pose any issues for visiting. But it prevented us from seeing the facade of the museum. This contained the iconic board where Einstein had written his famous formula when he visited",

          "We were advised that Einstein's backboard was on display by a tour guide. There is a lot of building work going on at the front of it but it is still worth a visit. It was rather small and limited but still worth a visit.",
          "I'd been looking forward to visiting this museum the most, however I was quite underwhelmed with my visit. The building itself is beautiful, it has great stone statues outside and it a very nice building to look at. The museum was not what I was expecting. It is mainly a",
          "This is a small museum that displays various scientific instruments from different time periods. You'll find a blackboard with equations from a lecture given by Einstein. They have abacus, telescopes, medical instruments, microscopes, astrolabes, and many other items. Too bad",
          "Ok so lots of the detail of the exhibits were lost on us but its a beautiful building in the centre of Oxford and we just had to see Einstein's blackboard at first hand! Be warned there are lots of stairs to climb and the more child friendly natural history exhibits are tucked",
          "Well what did we expect from a Museum at Oxford other that Excellent, firstly the museum is FREE yes I will say that again FREE, it's full of interesting artifacts that take you back to days gone by. If you like museums and you like Science then this is an a sulfate must for you",

          "This is really brilliant starting with astrolabes to modern technology and the museum staff are full of anecdotes and knowledge",
          "There is a wide variety of scientific instruments from an early gyroscope to Marconi's wireless, to a blackboard with equations written by Einstein. If you love science and the process of discovery, you will love this small museum. It's free, but so far as I could tell not",
          "This small museum can be seen in 20 mins. The collection consists mainly of historic scientific tools such as old telescopes and medical equipment. None of the labels explain the items well. There also isn't much of a coherence of the items on display in each room so it looks",
          "Really good place to visit to have a look around. A good selection of science equiptment and some helpful staff to ask if you have any questions. The one shame is that it isn't a big place compared to the Ashmolean, so they can't fit too much inside it - but not really their",
          "This is free on entry but you are encouraged to make a donation. There are some really interesting things to see and so much of it. The highlight for me was the penicillin section and the collection of surgery instruments and the old draughtsman instrument. I a, not sure this a",

          "Very small museum, but again worth a visit. My husband enjoyed this more than me but a few things of interest.",
          "So much to see and it's the most beautiful building. Loads of dinosaurs for the kids, aswell as loads of other animals. Rocks from space.... could go on and on. Fantastic museum.",
          "While I was in Oxford for the day I decided to see what was inside, I was amazed at how big and how many objects and artifacts are in there. The staff was very helpful and answered any questions I asked, worth a visit if you have a spare hour or two.",

          "As scientists my boyfriend and I really enjoyed seeing this museum. We spent a good hour wandering around looking at the exhibits. Especially enjoyed all the old microtomes, cameras and the first vile that Penicillin was grown in. As it is free, worth checking out. Just keep an",

          "If you have a huge amount of time like I did, then go and see it. But if you have limited time, you wouldn't miss anything if you don't visit. It's opposite the Blackwell's bookstore. The bookstore is more interesting than the museum itself for me though.",
          "This museum is apparently an overlooked site and it is quite a shame, as it is very interesting. We spent a little time there whilst it was raining outside and didn't regret it, quite the contrary. There is a wealth of instrument, from astrobale to early telescopes and",
          "My son loves all things scientific, so we assumed he'd enjoy a visit to this museum. Unfortunately the old school don't touch displays in glass cases approach was a real disappointment. There really was nothing here for him to engage with, and he wasn't up for lots of standing",
          "Very interesting museum & well worth a visit. This is an ancient building unlike the modern Ashmoleum and is interesting for that quite apart from the exhibits which are fascinating",
          "Museum of the History of Science has something to offer everyone. The objects are incredible and the exhibitions are well-labeled. I particularly enjoyed the craftsmanship that when into many of the tools.",
          "People often miss this museum because there's so much else to see in Oxford. You don't need to be in the least scientific to enjoy the excellent and informative exhibitions here but when you leave you may want to know more. The building was where the Ashmolean began and is next",
          "Fascinating, absorbing and informative.Well appointed displays with relevant information clearly labeled.",

          "Very interesting museum. From microscopes to the oldest photo cameras... It also has the board that Alberd Einstein draw when he visit Oxford. The entry to the museum is free. In case you go for a daily tour to Oxford, have in mind that the museum opens at 14:00 to 17:00.",
          "This is a fun place to run through in three-quarters of an hour. It's got some dandy gizmos from science past, and some intriguing stuff, esp in the special time exhibit that's on as of April 2012. Definitely something you should see when you're at the Bodleian and in the part",

The exhibit was Time machines, focussing on clocks, but the historic chemistry displays were awesome too.. and don\u2019t miss Einstein\u2019s famous chalk boards where he wrote E=MC2. I spent less than",
          "This is a place full of interesting artefacts: early science equipment, solar system models, truly anything and everything. I visited the museum three times so far and have found the displays interesting - I just don't think it's as captivating as the Pitt Rivers or the",

          "The Oxford Museum of the History of Science is really more a three level repository of historical scientific objects, particularly microscopes, telescopes, astrolabes, clocks and other devices used to survey and measure. Many of these objects are quite beautiful in their own",
          "Worth a quick look round if you have some interest in the objects on display (old astronomical and medical equipment, very cool). A beautiful building and setting, like most things in Oxford. Free to enter.",
          "The exhibits here are world calss: Einsstein's blackboard whith his claculations, the original Marconi radio equipment, the original apparatus for making penicailin. It's great to see this stuff, but is's just in old glass cases with albels. It's so important historically,",
          "The free guided tour was fascinating and the guide was enthusiastic and knowledgable.",
          "A neat place to visit. It is free which makes it worth popping in for a visit to see the current displays. If time is of the essence, you can buy pass it for the Natural History Museum down the road.",

          "Free to Visit, there's a donation box. Audio tour equipment is for \u00a33. Definitely worth getting it.",

          "Although this place has some thoroughly interesting things to look at and read about, the place it quite small, some of the previous amazing items (like darwins microscope and Einstein's blackboard) has now been taken out which is a real shame. The gift shop could do with a re-work as well.",
          "Great museum for adults if you like a lot about science and learning about time and things free to get in small museum but ok",

          "Interesting exhibits but if you're thinking of going in there this summer, don't! It was like we walked into a slow roasting oven. I don't think the building had any  open windows. \nWe would go back again when the weather cools down.",
          "Exellent visit not to busy",

          "A must whenever u visit London, free of charge as every museum",
          "Nice spot, great collection that focuses on instruments and telescopes. The shame of it is that all the pieces seem like knick knacks once context is removed. I think if I were more invested in the subject, I would have stayed longer, but I enjoyed wandering around.",
          "absolutely love this place has always been a favorite of mine since i was small",

          "So many antique model of modern equipment! Great collection and so impressive!!",

          "Its ok.",
          "Amazing interactivity and huge amount of excibitions. Spent all day there. Love this museum!!!",

        "wiki": "Harcourt Arboretum is an arboretum owned and run by the University of Oxford. It is a satellite of the university's botanic garden in the city of Oxford, England. The arboretum itself is located six miles (10 km) south of Oxford on the A4074 road, near the village of Nuneham Courtenay in Oxfordshire, and comprises some 150 acres (0.61 km2). Professor Simon Hiscock is the Horti Praefectus (Director) of the botanic garden and arboretum.The arboretum forms an integral part of the tree and plant collection of the University of Oxford Botanic Garden. It occupies part of what were the grounds of Nuneham House, about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the house itself. It was designed to form an impressive entrance to the landscaped grounds of the house.\nWilliam Sawrey Gilpin (1762\u20131843), the artist and later landscape designer, laid out the pinetum, which forms the core of the arboretum. The trees are now mature, with giant redwoods and monkey-puzzle trees.\n\nThe grounds include a 10-acre (40,000 m2) typical English woodland and a 37-acre (150,000 m2) summer flowering meadow.\nIn late spring, the azaleas and rhododendrons are especially impressive. There are carpets of bluebells in the woods too. In the autumn, the leaf colours are brilliant, including Japanese maples. Peacocks roam the grounds, as they have since the establishment of the arboretum. In recent years, paths have been improved for accessibility.\nThe grounds are open to the public at a charge.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Harcourt Arboretum at Wikimedia Commons\n\nHarcourt Arboretum information from the University of Oxford\nHarcourt Arboretum information from the University of Oxford Museum Education",

          "We visited this arboretum in the autumn which is probably not the best time of year to visit. There is a large wooded area which contains some very rare trees and the information given on the plaques is very interesting. Other trees are labelled but we do wish more of the trees",
          "We learned a lot from our very knowledgeable guide, a lovely way to spend a couple of hours. Would definitely return to see the arboretum at a different time of year.",

          "We have visited Oxford Botanic Gardens many times so this year we signed up to an annual pass which gives us access to Harcourt Arborteum. We enjoyed a pleasant 45 minute walk and will be returning to see how it changes with the changing of the seasons.",
          "The trees are just beginning to turn to autumn colours in the Arboretum. The paths are easy to navigate and there is a lot to see if you enjoy the outdoors. The peafowl, we are told rather sternly, do not belong to the Arboretum and should not be fed - but they look rather",
          "We visited on Saturday whilst on our annual visit to Oxfordshire. Whilst the Arboretum is between seasons i.e. too late for the azaleas etc and too early for Autumn we spent a very pleasant couple of hours walking around all the trails through the woods and meadows. We enjoyed",
          "(And the no dogs rule is a definite bonus.) highlights include the peacocks who very relaxed around people and a rare Yew tree from the Andes. Apparently, we choose an in between time missing the flower meadows and too early for autumn colour, but still good.",
          "I came to the Arboretum for the first time in my life, I'm ashamed to say, at the end of June. The day I visited a Summer Fayre was on. It had quite a lot stalls offering local and international foods and drinks, and was nice. The main point of my visit was the Arboretum though",
          "We spent a glorious few hours exploring the woods and paths, paths are easily marked out and there are lovely little pockets where children can explore. There are some activities to do too, although we found if hard to find out about these. Lots of lovely of lovely peacocks",
          "Wonderful place for a day off - plenty of old, interesting trees, huge meadows and some flowering trees. We spent lots of time trying to locate pigs and thanks to the staff, who pointed out where they have been recently seen we were able to find them. Bring your lunch with you",
          "A very pleasant walk around the woodland area and meadows with the better half, some interesting things to see and very well kept.... the downside probably the cost \u00a36pp for a couple of hours walk round is what I would call a bit excessive... but then its Oxford so say no more!,",
          "Do you really need to pay to go to a woodland? Go to a public park instead, you won't miss a thing. All they have here that might be a bit unusual is a few redwoods and a monkey tree with a name tag. Other than that there is a pond full of cattails and a pig pen.",

          "A wonderful space, full of amazing trees. As I have a season ticket for Oxford Botanic Gardens I thought I would take advantage of the dual membership. Well worth the effort. There are well defined paths throughout, so little chance of getting lost.",
          "If you like trees, plants and peaceful, rural surroundings, this is a very pleasant place to visit. It is large enough to provide a good length of walk, especially if you insist on walking all of the trails, but small enough to be manageable, for instance, for my elderly",

          "We were initially attracted by the news that there was a Plant Sale which turned out to be a bit limited and quite expensive. However we did enjoy a \"walk in the woods\" especially as the Rhodedendron season, whilst perhaps just past its very best, still had a lot to offer.",

          "Really great place to take children to show different types of trees and butterflies in the meadows. Small piggery which the toddlers really loved. And the peacocks are beautiful! A very relaxing morning wandering around the beautifully tended gardens.",

          "I visited Harcourt Arboretum on 20 April 2017, and the bluebells were nearly at their best.. Therefore, they will look their best from about between 22 April and 26 April 2017. Please note: There are nice toilets by the main entrance (Peacock Lodge, the Education Centre) There",
          "This is a very fine arboretum. At the moment there are just a few trees out in blossom , but there is a lovely display of daffodils (March 10). At all times of the year it is a beautiful peaceful area, but has peak times with it's highlights of blossom, bluebells and autumn",

          "Interesting trail to follow along the Acer Walk, and following the trail around the Aboretum, stopping at each sign which gave interesting facts about the trees, insects, and where the trees came from. A really pleasant walk.",
          "Harcourt Arboretum is owned and managed by the University of Oxford. As well as a range of specimen large trees, there is a collection of acers which can be quite spectacular in the autumn. It is a pity that the acers are all planed down at the point of the arboretum closest",
          "This was my first visit to the arboretum and to visit in the Autumn was very special. To see so many beautiful colours all in one place was amazing. There is a small charge to enter the arboretum but well worth it. The arboretum does not have anywhere to purchase food and drink",
          "A useful place to stop and stretch your legs. The different paths are not well signed, so it's easy to get lost, even with a map. We spent about an hour wandering round, luckily we had two for one tickets. But agree \u00a310.00 would be expensive.",

          "After living in Oxford for thirty years and working for the the University so getting in for free. I was stunned by the beauty of the trees, flowers. It is so quite and peaceful place I have ever been. Don't take my word let the beauty of sight and smell let your imaginations",
          "A lovely little getaway not that far from Oxford. Be aware that there aren't a lot of facilities there (when we visited, there were toilets but nowhere to buy food/drink.) We were very happy to use a trail that worked well for pushing a pram - took about 30 minutes and included",
          "Great place to come in any season. Loads of varieties to look at, and the bluebells in May are fabulous. Because this is a free to enter place you can come as often as you like seeing the changes through the seasons.",
          "We arrived by small coach deliberately because the entrance is not wide enough to take a larger coach and there is not much parking for bigger vehicles. Plenty of car parking space though. The cost per adult is \u00a35.00 which is great value as you could stay all day walking around",
          "Visited 07/05/16 with large party of trained Tree Wardens. Alarmed on arrival to see the savage tree surgery work on oaks around the reception hut. These huge, fully mature oaks have been rendered unattractive because of poor work and make a poor example. Reception explained",
          "We have been past many times and as it was a nice day yesterday actually went in! The entrance fee is \u00a35 per adult and it is well worth it. It was much bigger than we expected as you can't tell the size from the road. There are bluebells which have a rope fence around them",
          "This is undoubtedly a lovely place to visit, also at this time of the year! Nice place for a restoring walk in nature. Paths are easy to find even if I was expecting a more detailed map. The only inconvenient we had was to miss the pedestrian entry on the main road, which could",
          "Lovely place for a walk, we didn't venture further than the woods so there was lots to see another day. I was glad that there are no dogs allowed as I could let my 4yr old wander freely without the worry of standing in dog poop, which is a problem in the open countryside! The",

          "This is a lovely place to visit at this time of year. Small admission charge but the facilities (mainly toilets) are fine, the paths are well maintained and the trees (well labelled) are spectacular. Let the children run/roam, kicking leaves, finding acorns, trying to catch",
          "I went with some friends. The place is divided in 3 areas and the first one is the unique one which deserve the price of the ticket. The redwoods are really nice but the signals at the footpaths doesn't exist and the labels of each tree are not clear so you don't learn anything",

          "Delightful mixture of meadows and woodland, with gentle walks and areas to sit and rest. Free entry if you are a member at Kew. No catering facilities, which was a shame, but there is a supermarket a five minute drive away where you can stock up on refreshments.",

Lewis wrote all of his Narnia books and other classics. The house itself was featured in the Narnia books. Lewis's gardener at The Kilns, Fred Paxford, is said to have inspired the character of Puddleglum the Marshwiggle in The Silver Chair.The Kilns was built in 1922 on the site of a former brickworks. The lake in the garden is a flooded clay pit. In 1930, The Kilns was bought by C. S. Lewis, his brother Warnie Lewis, and Mrs Janie Moore. Maureen Dunbar, Janie Moore's daughter, also lived there. C. S. Lewis wrote of the house: \"I never hoped for the like\". Mrs Moore was the mother of Lewis's university friend Paddy Moore, who had been killed in the First World War.\nThe house is located in what is now called Lewis Close, south of Kiln Lane.\nThe Kilns is currently owned and operated by the C.S. Lewis Foundation, who runs it as the Study Centre at the Kilns.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to The Kilns at Wikimedia Commons\n\nC.S.

        "wiki": "Christ Church Picture Gallery is an art museum at Christ Church, one of the colleges of Oxford University in England. The gallery holds an important collection of about 300 Old Master paintings and nearly 2,000 drawings. It is one of the most important private collections in the United Kingdom. The greater part of the collection was bequeathed by a former member of the college, General John Guise, arriving after his death in 1765. Further gifts and bequests were made by W. T. H. Fox-Strangways, Walter Savage Landor, Sir Richard Nosworthy & C.R. Patterson (Russian Orthodox metal plaques, many enamelled).\nThe Picture Gallery is especially strong on Italian art from the 14th to 18th centuries. The collection includes paintings by Annibale Carracci (The Butcher's Shop), Duccio, Fra Angelico, Hugo van der Goes, Giovanni di Paolo, Filippino Lippi (The Wounded Centaur), Sano di Pietro, Frans Hals, Salvator Rosa, Tintoretto, Anthony van Dyck and Paolo Veronese, and drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Peter Paul Rubens and a great range of other artists, especially Italians.The drawings collection is shown by a small exhibition, changing roughly every three months, and sometimes showing works not in the permanent collection, especially those by modern artists. The gallery was designed by Hidalgo Moya and Philip Powell, and built in 1968, enabling the collection to be open to the public for the first time. It is located in the Deanery garden.Professor Joanna Woodall of the Courtauld Institute is a former Assistant Curator of the gallery. The current (2015) curator is Jacqueline Thalmann.Late on 14 March 2020, paintings by Van Dyck, Annibale Carracci and Salvator Rosa were stolen from the gallery.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n40 Years of Christ Church Picture Gallery.

          "I have to admit a little disappointment. The exhibition of drawings and prints rotates so that only a selection of the (big) collection is on view at any one time. We were lucky to see some brilliant Durers but missed the Leonardo (shame). There are a mix of paintings by",

        "wiki": "All Souls College (official name: College of the Souls of All the Faithful Departed) is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in England. Unique to All Souls, all of its members automatically become fellows (i.e. full members of the college's governing body). It has no undergraduate members, but each year recent graduate and postgraduate students at Oxford are eligible to apply for examination fellowships through a competitive examination (once described as \"the hardest exam in the world\") and, for those shortlisted after the examinations, an interview.All Souls is one of the wealthiest colleges in Oxford, with a financial endowment of \u00a3420.2 million (2018). However, since the college's principal source of revenue is its endowment, as of 2007 it only ranked 19th among Oxford colleges in total income. All Souls is a registered charity under English law.The college is located on the north side of the High Street adjoining Radcliffe Square to the west. To the east is The Queen's College with Hertford College to the north.\nThe current warden (head of the college) is Sir John Vickers, a graduate of Oriel College, Oxford.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe college was founded by Henry VI of England and Henry Chichele (fellow of New College and Archbishop of Canterbury), in 1438, to commemorate the victims of the Hundred Years' War. The Statutes provided for a warden and forty fellows; all to take Holy Orders: 24 to study arts, philosophy and theology; and 16 to study civil or canon law. The college's Codrington Library was completed in 1751 through the bequest in 1710 of Christopher Codrington, a wealthy slave and plantation owner from Barbados, who attended Oxford and later became colonial governor of the Leeward Islands.\nToday the college is primarily a graduate research institution, with no undergraduate members. All Souls did formerly have undergraduates: Robert Hovenden (Warden of the college from 1571 to 1614) introduced undergraduates to provide the fellows with servientes (household servants), but this was abandoned by the end of the Commonwealth. Four Bible Clerks remained on the foundation until 1924.For over five hundred years All Souls College admitted only men; women were first allowed to join the college as fellows in 1979, the same year as many other previously all-male colleges in the university.\n\n\n== Buildings and architecture ==\n\n\n=== Codrington Library ===\n\nThe All Souls Library (formally known as the Codrington Library) was founded through a bequest from Christopher Codrington (1668\u20131710), a fellow of the college. Christopher Codrington bequeathed books worth \u00a36,000, in addition to \u00a310,000 in currency. This bequest allowed the library to be built and endowed. Christopher Codrington was born in Barbados, and amassed his fortune from his sugar plantation in the West Indies. The library was completed in 1751, and has been in continuous use since then. The modern library comprises some 185,000 items, about a third of which were published before 1800. The collections are particularly strong in law and history (especially military history).\n\n\n=== Chapel ===\nBuilt between 1438 and 1442, the chapel remained largely unchanged until the Commonwealth. Oxford, having been a largely Royalist stronghold, suffered under the Puritans' wrath. The 42 misericords date from the Chapel's building, and show a resemblance to the misericords at Higham Ferrers. Both may have been carved by Richard Tyllock.\nChristopher Wren was a fellow from 1653, and in 1658 produced a sundial for the college. This was originally placed on the south wall of the Chapel, until it was moved to the quadrangle (above the central entrance to the Codrington Library) in 1877. During the 1660s a screen was installed in the Chapel, which was based on a design by Wren. However, this screen needed to be rebuilt by 1713. By the mid-19th century the Chapel was in great need of renovation, and so the current structure is heavily influenced by Victorian design ideals.\nAll services at the chapel are according to the Book of Common Prayer; the King James Bible is also used rather than more modern translations.\n\n\n== Fellowships ==\n\n\n=== Examination fellowships ===\nIn the three years following the award of their bachelor's degrees, students graduating from Oxford and current Oxford postgraduate students having graduated elsewhere are eligible to apply for examination fellowships (sometimes informally referred to as \"prize fellowships\") of seven years each. While tutors may advise their students to sit for the All Souls examination fellowship, the examination is open to anybody who fulfils the eligibility criteria and the college does not issue invitations to candidates to sit. Every year in early March, the college hosts an open evening for women, offering women interested in the examination fellowship an opportunity to find out more about the exam process and to meet members of the college.Each year several dozen candidates typically sit the examination. Two examination fellows are usually elected each year, although the college has awarded a single place or three places in some years, and on rare occasions made no award.The competition, offered since 1878 and open to women since 1979, is held over two days in late September, with two papers of three hours each per day. It has been described in the past as \"the hardest exam in the world\".Two papers (the 'specialist papers') are on a single subject of the candidate's choice; the options are classics, English literature, economics, history, law, philosophy, and politics. Candidates may sit their two specialist papers in different specialist subjects, provided each paper is in one subject only (for example, a candidate might sit one paper in History and one paper in Politics). Candidates who choose Classics have an additional translation examination on a third day.Two papers (the 'general papers') are on general subjects. For each general examination, candidates choose three questions from a list. Past questions have included:\n\n\"'If a man could say nothing against a character but what he could prove, history could not be written' (Samuel Johnson). Discuss.\"\n\"Should the Orange Prize for Fiction be open to both men and women?\"\n\"Does the moral character of an orgy change when the participants wear Nazi uniforms?\"Before 2010 candidates also faced another examination, a free-form \"Essay\" on a single, pre-selected word.Four to six finalists are invited to a viva voce or oral examination. Previously, these candidates were then invited to dinner with about 75 members of the college. The dinner did not form part of the assessment, but was intended as a reward for those candidates who had reached the latter stages of the selection process. However, the dinner has been discontinued as the college felt candidates worried too often that it was part of the assessment process.\nAbout a dozen examination fellows are at the college at any one time. There are no compulsory teaching or requirements, although examination fellows must pursue a course of study or research at some point within their first two years of fellowship. They can study anything for free at Oxford with room and board. As \"Londoners\" they can pursue approved non-academic careers if desired, with a reduced stipend, as long as they pursue academia on a part-time basis and attend weekend dinners at the college during their first academic year. As of 2011 each examination fellow receives a stipend of \u00a314,842 annually for the first two years; the stipend then varies depending on whether the fellow pursues an academic career.\n\n\n==== Notable candidates ====\nUntil 1979, women were not permitted to put themselves forward for fellowships at All Souls.\n\n\n===== Successful =====\nLeo Amery (1897), politician\nSir Isaiah Berlin (1932), philosopher\nGeorge Earle Buckle (1877), journalist\nGeorge Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston (1883), Viceroy of India\nGeoffrey Dawson (1898), journalist\nMatthew d'Ancona (1989), journalist\nJohn Gardner (1986), legal philosopher\nBirke H\u00e4cker (2001), legal scholar\nQuintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone (1931), politician and philosopher\nDouglas Jay, Baron Jay (1930), politician\nKeith Joseph, Baron Joseph (1946), politician\nCosmo Gordon Lang, 1st Baron Lang of Lambeth (1888), Archbishop of Canterbury\nT.

Fellowship of the college has accompanied the award of a Chichele chair since 1870.\nFollowing the work of the 1850 Commission to examine the organisation of the university, the college suppressed ten of its fellowships to create the funds to establish the first two Chichele professorships: The Chichele Professor of International Law and Diplomacy, established in 1859 and first held by Mountague Bernard, and the Chichele Professor of Modern History, first held by Montagu Burrows.\nThere are currently Chichele Professorships in five different subjects:\n\nChichele Professor of Economic History: Kevin O'Rourke.\nChichele Professor of the History of War: Peter H. Wilson appointed 2015.\nChichele Professor of Public International Law: Catherine Redgwell appointed 2012.\nChichele Professor of Social and Political Theory: Amia Srinivasan appointed 2019.\nChichele Professor of Medieval History: Julia M. H. Smith, appointed September 2016Probably the best known former Chichele Professor is Sir Isaiah Berlin. Perhaps the best known former Professor of the History of War was Cyril Falls.\n\n\n=== Chichele Lectures ===\nThe Chichele Lectures are a prestigious series of lectures formally established in 1912 and sponsored by All Souls College. The lectures were initially restricted to foreign history, but have since been expanded to include law, political theory, economic theory, as well as foreign and British history. Traditionally the lectures were delivered by a single speaker, but it is now common for several speakers to deliver lectures on a common theme.\n\n\n== Customs ==\nEvery hundred years, and generally on 14 January, there is a commemorative feast after which the fellows parade around the college with flaming torches, singing the Mallard Song and led by a \"Lord Mallard\" who is carried in a chair, in search of a legendary mallard that supposedly flew out of the foundations of the college when it was being built. During the hunt the Lord Mallard is preceded by a man bearing a pole to which a mallard is tied \u2013 originally a live bird, latterly either dead (1901) or carved from wood (2001). The last mallard ceremony was in 2001 and the next is due in 2101. The precise origin of the custom is not known, but it dates from at least 1632. A benign parody of this custom has been portrayed as the Unseen University's \"Megapode chase\" in Sir Terry Pratchett's 2009 novel Unseen Academicals.\n\n\n== People associated with All Souls ==\n\n\n=== Fellows ===\n\nPast and current fellows of the college have included:\n\n\n=== Wardens ===\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nCurrent Examination Fellows\nVirtual Tour of All Souls College",

          "I can't say too much about All Souls as we visited a Fellow there and had a private tour. However, the atmosphere there is so relaxed, it almost feels like some form of monastic retreat. The library is breathtaking. Well worth a trip if you are in Oxford and can get in.",
          "If you visit Oxford, you should definitely take one of the many city walks and guided tours that are offered. Perfect way to get to know the city and the many, many beautiful buildings and interesting history - it really takes your breath away! Can't wait to go there again.",

          "All Souls is a research college, so the part you get into on the standard tour is the disappointing mediaeval parts. When they participate in Open Doors, you get to go into the main quad and into the fabulous Hawksmoor built Library."

        "wiki": "The Bate Collection of Musical Instruments is a collection of historic musical instruments, mainly for Western classical music, from the Middle Ages onwards. It is housed in Oxford University's Faculty of Music near Christ Church on St. Aldate's.\nThe collection is open to the public and is available for academic study by appointment. The current curator (November 2017) is Andy Lamb, a former NCO who served in the Royal Artillery and was a trumpeter in their Junior Leaders band during his training as a Boy Soldier.  There are frequent gallery events and special exhibitions. More than a thousand instruments by important English, French and German makers, are on display, showing the musical and mechanical development of wind and percussion instruments from the Renaissance to the current day.The collection is named after Philip Bate who gave his collection of musical instruments to the University of Oxford in 1968, on the condition that it was used for teaching and was provided with a specialist curator to care for and lecture on it. The collection also houses an archive of his papers.\nThe Bate Collection is additionally the home of the Reginald Morley-Pegge Memorial Collection of Horns and other Brass and Woodwind Instruments; the Anthony Baines Collection; the Edgar Hunt Collection of Recorders and other instruments; the Jean Henry Collection, the Taphouse Keyboard Loans; the Roger Warner Keyboard Collection; the Michael Thomas Keyboard Collection; a number of instruments from the Jeremy Montagu Collection; a complete workshop of the English bow-maker William C Retford, as well as a small collection of Bows formed in his memory, the Wally Horwood Collection of books and recordings, and other instruments acquired by purchase and gift.\n\nAn album, 'Voices From The Past, Vol. 2: Instruments of The Bate Collection' was released in 2015.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of music museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBate Collection website",

To the west is Worcester Street and to the east is Gloucester Street.\nThe green was once an open space outside Gloucester College (now Worcester College), after which it was named.  From 1783 to 1915 a fair was held on the green, and from 1835 to 1932 it was the site of the city's cattle market.  In 1935, after the cattle market had been moved, the western half of Gloucester Green became the site of the city's bus station, and the eastern half became a car park.  \nIn 1987, a major redevelopment of the area began. The eastern half became a square, surrounded by shops, restaurants and residential accommodation.  A new, smaller, bus station was built on the site of the old bus station, and an office block was built between the bus station and Worcester Street.  An underground car park was also provided.\nToday, the Gloucester Green bus station is the Oxford terminus for long-distance coach services, including services to London, coaches to Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton and Stansted airports, and route X5 to Cambridge. The bus station is too small to accommodate more than a few local bus services.\nA food market is held in the square every Wednesday and an antiques market every Thursday.\nGloucester Green is surrounded by Oxford theatres: close by are the Oxford Playhouse and Burton Taylor Studio theatres on Beaumont Street and Gloucester Street, respectively, and the OFS Studio in the Old Fire Station and the New Theatre, both on George Street.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

      "name": "Saint Giles' Church",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "St. Giles' Church is a church in North Oxford, England. It is at the northern end of the wide thoroughfare of St Giles', at the point where it meets Woodstock Road and Banbury Road. It stands between where Little Clarendon Street joins Woodstock Road and Keble Road joins Banbury Road.\nThe church was built in the 12th and 13th centuries.Oxford's main War Memorial adjoins the southern end of St. Giles' churchyard.\n\n\n== Foundation, dedication and building ==\nThe church was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it was recorded that the owner of the land north of the city intended to build a Norman church there. The church was built for one Edwin, son of Godegose and finished in 1120. In 1139, Edwin granted the church and all its property to the then newly created Benedictine Godstow Abbey, 2 miles (3.2 km) to the northwest.\nSt Giles Church is 550 yards (500 m) north of Oxford's city wall, and when built it stood in open fields. There were no other buildings between it and the city wall, where the St Michael at the North Gate church stands. About a thousand people lived within the walls of Oxford at this time.The church was not actually consecrated until 1200, by Saint Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln. There is a 13th or 14th century consecration cross consisting of interlaced circles cut into the western column of the bell tower that is believed to commemorate this. Also in commemoration of the consecration, St Giles' Fair was established. The fair continues to this day, held on the Monday and Tuesday after the Sunday following 1 September, which is St Giles' Day. St Hugh also expanded the St Mary Magdalen's Church to the south in 1194.\nSurviving 12th century features of the church include two windows in the north side of the clerestorey of the nave and the lower parts of the bell tower. The tower was finished early in the 13th century, which is the date of the aisle arcades and Early English Gothic lancet windows as well. The Decorated Gothic chancel was built late in the 13th century.\n\n\n== During and after the Reformation ==\nGodstow Abbey surrendered St Giles' church and all its lands to the Crown in 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1542 the Crown granted St Giles' to Dr George Owen of Godstow, a physician of King Henry VIII. In 1573 his son Richard Owen sold St. Giles to Sir Thomas White, Lord Mayor of London, who in 1555 had refounded the Cistercian house of St Bernard on the east side of St Giles' Street as St John's College. Sir Thomas granted St Giles' to St John's, which since then has held the advowson of the parish. Incumbents of St. Giles' have included two notable Laudians: William Juxon from 1610 to 1615 and Thomas Turner from 1624 to 1629.Monuments in St. Giles' church include figurines of Henry Bosworth (died 1634), his wife Alice and their three children. They seem to have been made for a tomb that has not survived. St. Giles' church was damaged during the English Civil War, in which the Parliamentarian army besieged the Royalist force defending Charles I in Oxford. John Goad, vicar from 1644 until 1646, is said to have led services in St. Giles during Parliamentary artillery bombardments of Oxford in 1645. The Civil War may have been when the Bosworth tomb was destroyed.\nSt. Giles' church building received only minor repairs during the 17th and 18th centuries. At different times in the 19th century parts of the building were repaired and the chapel on the south side of the chancel was partly rebuilt.\n\n\n== The benefice since the 19th century ==\n\nOxford has expanded over time, so St Giles' church is now relatively central within the city. As north Oxford was built up and its population grew, new parishes were created out of parts of St. Giles'. They included St Philip and St James', consecrated in 1862 and St. Margaret's, consecrated as a daughter church of SS. Philip and James in 1883. St. Giles remains a separate ecclesiastical parish but is now reunited with the parish of St Philip and St James with St Margaret in a united benefice.\n\n\n== Bells ==\nThe bell tower has a ring of eight bells. The oldest bell is the tenor, cast by Ellis Knight I of Reading, Berkshire in 1632. Five more were cast by William Taylor, presumably at the Taylor family's then Oxford bell-foundry, in 1850: the same year as the rebuilding of St. Giles south chapel was begun. St. Giles' youngest bells are the treble and second, cast in 1927 by Mears and Stainbank at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in the East End of London.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSt Giles' Fair, held each September on St Giles' south of the church\nSt Mary Magdalen's Church, to the south\nSt Michael at the Northgate, also to the south, Oxford's oldest building\nEdward Drax Free, vicar\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCrossley, Alan; Elrington, C.R.

        "wiki": "The Oxford Oratory Church of St Aloysius Gonzaga (or Oxford Oratory for short) is the Catholic parish church for the centre of Oxford, England. It is located at 25 Woodstock Road, next to Somerville College. The church is served by the Congregation of the Oratory.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSt Aloysius' was founded as the Jesuit (Society of Jesus) parish of central Oxford. Completed in 1875, the building of St Aloysius' was an important step in the ongoing refoundation of a Roman Catholic presence in Oxford. The parish was served by notable members of the society for many years, including Gerard Manley Hopkins (December 1878 \u2013 September 1879). The church also housed a notable collection of relics bequeathed by Hartwell de la Garde Grissell, many of which were destroyed in the 1970s.\nIn the 1980s, the Jesuits left the church and the parish was taken over by the Archdiocese of Birmingham. In 1990, the Archbishop of Birmingham invited members of the Birmingham Oratory to take over the running of the parish and found a new Oratorian community in Oxford. Two priests from Birmingham arrived in September 1990 and, in 1993, the Oxford Oratory was established as an independent Congregation. Fr Robert Byrne then served as provost from 1993 to 2011. From 2011-2019, Fr Daniel Seward served as provost. The incumbent is the Very Rev. Fr Nicholas Edmonds-Smith.\n\n\n== Liturgy ==\nIt is part of the tradition of the Oratory in England to ensure that the liturgy is celebrated in a dignified and worthy manner. In the Oxford Oratory most Masses are celebrated in English, but on Sundays and Holydays a non-Tridentine Solemn Mass is sung in Latin. Latin is also used in the Tridentine Low Mass also celebrated on Sundays and Holydays, while the Parish Mass is sung in English.\n\n\n== Organ ==\nThe organ was enlarged between 1998 and 2004 by Matthew Copley. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.\n\n\n== Building ==\nThe church was designed by Joseph Hansom in a Gothic Revival style. Much of the original interior decoration was painted over in the 1970s, and the altar moved forward. The building is being gradually restored as part of the 'Oxford Oratory - Reaffirmation & Renewal' campaign.\nThe church consists of a single nave and five side chapels. To the left of the sanctuary is the Sacred Heart chapel, and the Lady Chapel is to the right. There are also chapels dedicated to St Philip Neri (formerly St Joseph's chapel) and Our Lady of Oxford (also known as the relic chapel). There are plans to build a new baptistery and a chapel dedicated to Cardinal Newman after his beatification in September 2010.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMap sources for Oxford Oratory\nOfficial website\nThe Latin Mass Society of England & Wales\nLatin Masses in Oxford\nHistoric England.

        "wiki": "The Cotswold Wildlife Park & Gardens exhibits over 260 different species of animals. The park is set in 160 acres (0.65 km2) of landscaped parkland and gardens 2 miles south of Burford, on the A361, Oxfordshire, England. Around 350,000 people visited the park in 2012.\n\n\n== Animal exhibits ==\nWalled Garden houses aviaries, including a Humboldt penguin enclosure and a Tropical House with exotic plants and free-roaming sloths, and tropical birds such as great blue turacos, Bali starlings and bleeding heart pigeons. Penguin feeding and talk is held daily at 11 am and 3 pm. Mammals in the Walled Garden include meerkats, yellow mongooses, prairie dogs and a breeding group of Oriental small-clawed otters. There is also a collection of small primates, including squirrel monkeys, pygmy marmosets, red-handed tamarins and emperor tamarins.\nMadagascar, opened in 2008, is a walk-through exhibit which draws attention to the plight of endangered lemur species. The mixed exhibit features ring-tailed lemurs, collared lemurs, mongoose lemurs, crowned sifaka, Madagascar teal and radiated tortoise are also on show, and were brought into the collection especially for \"Madagascar\". The breeding record of the lemur collection is very good with the ring-tailed lemurs giving birth regularly since their introduction in 2009, and the red-bellied lemurs also having bred successfully. Lemur feeding and talk is held daily at noon.\nWoodland Walk houses a number of larger animal species from South America including: Brazilian tapir, capybara, Patagonian maras and giant anteaters, as well as Visayan warty pigs. Other enclosures in the walk-through include Canadian timber wolves, white-naped cranes and parma wallabies. The entrance to the woodland walk is via a bridge over the lake, which has a wide variety of ducks and Chilean flamingos.\nLarge mammals - Large moated paddocks are home to a trio of giraffe, a herd of Chapman's zebra, a group of ostriches and breeding groups of white rhinoceros and Bactrian camels. Nearby are the park's big cat enclosures which house clouded leopards and Asiatic lions.\nReptile House, Bat House and Insect House - The Reptile House is home to species such as black mambas, crocodile monitors, bearded dragons, poison dart frogs, and rhinoceros iguanas. The reticulated pythons, and anacondas are particularly large specimens. The park achieved the first UK breeding for Morelet's crocodiles in 2007, with 12 eggs hatching successfully. The Insect House is home to leaf-cutter ants, scorpions and tarantulas and other species of invertebrates. The Bat House holding Seba's short-tailed bats, Egyptian fruit bats and Turkish spiny mice are in the Reptile Courtyard. and nearby are enclosures for white-handed gibbons and siamangs.\nAround the manor house and next to the 600-year-old oak tree outside the orangery, is home to the red pandas. In front of the manor house, next to the rhino paddock, is the Aldabra giant tortoise enclosure. Behind the manor house is the Skymaze adventure playground, picnic area and restaurant.\n Around the railway station includes a variety of owls and birds of prey, such as the great grey owl, snowy owl, and turkey vulture. Nearby is an enclosure for black-and-white colobus. Next to the railway station entrance is the wolverine enclosure. In 2012 the park's wolverines gave birth to the UK's first-ever cubs to be born in captivity. The Park is the only collection in Europe to have successfully bred wolverines. Next to the wolverines are the pheasant aviaries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1804 the estate's owner William Hervey had the current manor house called Bradwell Grove Manor House designed by William Atkinson and built by Richard Pace of Lechlade, in the then-fashionable Georgian Gothic style. This followed the example of Strawberry Hill, Horace Walpole's masterpiece at Twickenham. The house replaced an original 17th-century Jacobean residence, part of which was incorporated into the north service wing. Hervey also planted a great number of trees in the park, many of which can still be seen including a huge wellingtonia tree on the west lawn. This tree is over 40 metres high and can be seen on the skyline from many miles away.In 1923 the house and estate were purchased by Colonel Heyworth-Savage, and on his death when killed in action in North Africa on 28 December 1941 the estate was passed to his grandson John Heyworth. John Heyworth was born in the manor house on 21 August 1925 and when he left school he served from 1943\u20131947 in the Royal Dragoons, the regiment which had been commanded by his father. The house was rented out for twenty years to Oxford Regional Hospital Board, until in 1969 John Heyworth decided to open the gardens to the public, and since 1970 the house has been the heart of the Wildlife Park. John Heyworth died on 24 November 2012, and now the managing director is his son Reggie Heyworth.\nThe Walled Garden was originally a kitchen garden, the area now houses the marmosets and tamarins, contained cold fruit frames full of parma violets and other delicate plants, and on the site of the gardeners' greenhouse stood two structures reputed to be the oldest greenhouses in Oxfordshire. The Tropical House has taken the place of three adjoining greenhouses, the first for carnations, the second for rare hot-house plants and a fig tree, and the third for nectarines and peaches. The water supply for the Walled Garden came from a central well now covered over but still marked. There was a cricket pitch on what is now the grass car park, and two grass tennis courts outside the drawing room and brass-rubbing room. Many years ago, there was even a private nine-hole golf course covering what is now the ostrich enclosure and surrounding area.\nThe manor house now has various roles, with its many rooms being used as visitor areas. The old dining room \u2013 still with its original curtains, panelling and fireplace \u2013 has become the brass-rubbing centre; the drawing room is used for meetings, exhibitions and conferences; the library is now a bar area; the original kitchen has been turned into a storeroom and a self-contained flat; and other rooms are used as administration and maintenance offices, storerooms and staff accommodation. Even the maze of cellars is used for hibernating certain species from the reptile collection. The old stables and other out-buildings now the reptile and bat houses, classrooms, offices and the quarantine area. The billiard room is now the restaurant kitchen, and its billiard table was turned into the lower tier of the waterfall in the penguin enclosure.\n\n\n== Other exhibits ==\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThe 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge railway runs in a circuit (just under a mile long) around the park. The station is located on the edge of the woods between the owl aviaries and the Walled Garden.\nThe railway was first installed in 1974, in a horseshoe-shaped circuit from the current station round to the giant tortoises in front of the manor house. The circuit was completed and the station rebuilt in 2007, when it was officially opened by the local M.P., the Rt. Hon. David Cameron.\nThe train is called Bella in memory of one of the original white rhinos at the park.\n\n\n=== Park and gardens ===\n\nThe park is well known for its exotic planting, particularly in the favourable micro-climate of the Walled Garden, where bananas and cannas are a speciality. There is a huge pair of Californian redwood trees, imposing tree ferns and giant rhubarb with unusual foliage.\nThe exotic birds and animals are complemented by flamboyant planting schemes. The South Terrace has been given a period feel, although in fact the terrace, balustrade and pond were constructed in 1989, thanks to a generous legacy from a regular visitor to the park, Miss Daisy Louise Eley. By contrast, the planting around the West Terrace, in front of and around the restaurant is more contemporary. In May the front of the restaurant is draped in wisteria flowers. The 'Winter Garden', between the owls and the siamang gibbons is planted with a wide range of perennials, bulbs and woody plants with an emphasis on providing interest in winter.\nBamboo is a particular favourite at the park, with over fifty varieties planted. They are cut regularly for browse for the animals. The bamboo grows well here because of regular mulching of rhino manure. There is prairie-style planting around the rhino paddock to echo the African plains. The remains of a huge cedar of Lebanon in the Adventure Playground now supports the children's tree house and slide.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nAs of October 2006, the Cotswold Wildlife Park holds 40 species, which are part of either an ESB (European Studbook) or EEP (European Endangered Species Programme). It is the studbook holder for the red-crested turaco and Mount Omei babbler. In addition, both the crested pigeon and blue-winged kookaburra are monitored species. In August 2015, the park announced that a second white rhinoceros had been born at the park.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nAll photographs were taken in the park.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "TA playground, playpark, or play area is a place specifically designed to enable children to play there. It is typically outdoors. While a playground is usually designed for children, some target other age groups or people with disabilities.  A playground might exclude children below a certain age.\nModern playgrounds often have recreational equipment such as the seesaw, merry-go-round, swingset, slide, jungle gym, chin-up bars, sandbox, spring rider, trapeze rings, playhouses, and mazes, many of which help children develop physical coordination, strength, and flexibility, as well as providing recreation and enjoyment and supporting social and emotional development. Common in modern playgrounds are play structures that link many different pieces of equipment.\nPlaygrounds often also have facilities for playing informal games of adult sports, such as a baseball diamond, a skating arena, a basketball court, or a tether ball.\nPublic playground equipment installed in the play areas of parks, schools, childcare facilities, institutions, multiple family dwellings, restaurants, resorts, and recreational developments, and other areas of public use.\nA type of playground called a playscape is designed to provide a safe environment for play in a natural setting.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThrough history, children played in their villages and neighbourhoods, especially in the streets and lanes near their homes.In the 19th century, developmental psychologists such as Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel proposed playgrounds as a developmental aid, or to imbue children with a sense of fair play and good manners. In Germany, a few playgrounds were erected in connection to schools, and the first purpose-built public-access playground was opened in a park in Manchester, England in 1859.\n\n\n=== Mass motorisation ===\n\nHowever, it was only in the early 20th century, as the street lost its role as the default public space and became planned for use by motor cars, that momentum built to remove children from the new dangers and confine them to segregated areas to play. In the United States, organisations such as the National Highway Protective Society highlighted the numbers killed by automobiles, and urged the creation of playgrounds, aiming to free streets for vehicles rather than children's play. The Outdoor Recreation League provided funds to erect playgrounds on parkland, especially following the 1901 publication of a report on numbers of children being run down by cars in New York City.In tandem with the new concern about the danger of roads, educational theories of play, including by Herbert Spencer and John Dewey inspired the emergence of the reformist playground movement, which argued that playgrounds had educational value, improved attention in class, enhanced physical health, and reduced truancy. Interventionist programs such as by the child savers sought to move children into controlled areas to limit 'delinquency'. Meanwhile, at schools and settlement houses for poorer children with limited access to education, health services and daycare, playgrounds were included to support these institutions' goal of keeping children safe and out of trouble.\n\nOne of the first playgrounds in the United States was built in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park in 1887. In 1906 the Playground Association of America was founded and a year later Luther Gulick became president. It later became the National Recreation Association and then the National Recreation and Park Association. Urging the need for playgrounds, former President Theodore Roosevelt stated in 1907:\n\nCity streets are unsatisfactory playgrounds for children because of the danger, because most good games are against the law, because they are too hot in summer, and because in crowded sections of the city they are apt to be schools of crime. Neither do small back yards nor ornamental grass plots meet the needs of any but the very small children. Older children who would play vigorous games must have places especially set aside for them; and, since play is a fundamental need, playgrounds should be provided for every child as much as schools. This means that they must be distributed over the cities in such a way as to be within walking distance of every boy and girl, as most children can not afford to pay carfare. In post war London the landscape architect and children's rights campaigner Lady Allen of Hurtwood introduced and popularised the concept of the \u2019junk playground\u2019 - where the equipment was constructed from the recycled junk and rubble left over from the Blitz. She campaigned for facilities for children growing up in the new high-rise developments in Britain's cities and wrote a series of illustrated books on the subject of playgrounds, and at least one book on adventure playgrounds, spaces for free creativity by children, which helped the idea spread worldwide.\n\n\n=== Playgrounds in the Soviet Union ===\n\nPlaygrounds were an integral part of urban culture in the USSR. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were playgrounds in almost every park in many Soviet cities. Playground apparatus was reasonably standard all over the country; most of them consisted of metallic bars with relatively few wooden parts, and were manufactured in state-owned factories. Some of the most common constructions were the carousel, sphere, seesaw, rocket, bridge, etc.\n\n\n== Design ==\nPlayground design is influenced by the intended purpose and audience.  Separate play areas might be offered to accommodate very young children.  Single, large, open parks tend to not to be used by older schoolgirls or less aggressive children, because there is little opportunity for them to escape more aggressive children.  By contrast, a park that offers multiple play areas is used equally by boys and girls.\n\n\n== Effects on child development ==\n\nProfessionals recognize that the social skills that children develop on the playground often become lifelong skill sets that are carried forward into their adulthood. Independent research concludes that playgrounds are among the most important environments for children outside the home. Most forms of play are essential for healthy development, but free, spontaneous play\u2014the kind that occurs on playgrounds\u2014is the most beneficial type of play.\nExciting, engaging and challenging playground equipment is important to keep children happy while still developing their learning abilities. These should be developed in order to suit different groups of children for different stages of learning, such as specialist playground equipment for nursery & pre-school children teaching them basic numeracy & vocabulary, to building a child's creativity and imagination with role play panels or puzzles.\nThere is a general consensus that physical activity reduces the risk of psychological problems in children and fosters their self-esteem. The American Chief Medical Officer's report (Department of Health, 2004), stated that a review of available research suggests that the health benefits of physical activity in children are predominantly seen in the amelioration of risk factors for disease, avoidance of weight gain, achieving a peak bone mass and mental well-being.\nEvidence suggests that children who participate in physical activity improve their self-esteem. Ekeland, Heian and Hagan (2005) and Gruber found that exercise programmes had a significant positive effect on children's self-esteem.\nCommentators argue that the quality of a child's exercise experience can affect their self-esteem. Ajzen TPB (1991) promotes the notion that children's self-esteem is enhanced through the encouragement of physical mastery and self-development. It can be seen that playgrounds provide an ideal opportunity for children to master physical skills, such as learning to swing, balance and climb. Personal development may be gained through the enhancement of skills, such as playing, communicating and cooperating with other children and adults in the playground.\nIt can also be seen that public and private playgrounds act as a preventative health measure amongst young people because they promote physical activity at a stage in children's lives when they are active and not yet at risk from opting out of physical activity.\n\nChildren have devised many playground games and pastimes. But because playgrounds are usually subject to adult supervision and oversight, young children's street culture often struggles to fully thrive there. Research by Robin Moore concluded shown that playgrounds need to be balanced with marginal areas that (to adults) appear to be derelict or wasteground but to children they are area's that they can claim for themselves, ideally a wooded area or field.\n\nFor many children, it is their favorite time of day when they get to be on the playground for free time or recess. It acts as a release for them from the pressures of learning during the day. They know that time on the playground is their own time.A type of playground called a playscape can provide children with the necessary feeling of ownership that Moore describes above.  Playscapes can also provide parents with the assurance of their child's safety and wellbeing, which may not be prevalent in an open field or wooded area.\n\n\n== Funding ==\nIn the UK, several organisations exist that help provide funding for schools and local authorities to construct playgrounds. These include the Biffa Award, which provides funding under the Small Grants Scheme; Funding Central, which offers support for voluntary organisations and social enterprises; and the Community Construction Fund, a flagship programme by Norfolk County Council.\n\n\n== Safety ==\n\nSafety, in the context of playgrounds, is generally understood as the prevention of injuries.  Risk aversion and fear of lawsuits on the part of the adults who design playgrounds prioritizes injury prevention above other factors, such as cost or developmental benefit to the users. It is important that children gradually develop the skill of risk assessment, and a completely safe environment does not allow that.\nSometimes the safety of playgrounds is disputed in school or among regulators.  Over at least the last twenty years, the kinds of equipment to be found in playgrounds has changed, often towards safer equipment built with plastic.  For example, an older jungle gym might be constructed entirely from steel bars, while newer ones tend to have a minimal steel framework while providing a web of nylon ropes for children to climb on. Playgrounds with equipment that children may fall off often use rubber mulch on the ground to help cushion the impact.Playgrounds are also made differently for different age groups. Often schools have a playground that is taller and more advanced for older schoolchildren and a lower playground with less risk of falling for younger children.\nSafety discussions do not normally include an evaluation of the unintended consequences of injury prevention, such as older children who do not exercise at the playground because the playground is too boring.Safety efforts sometimes paradoxically increase the likelihood and severity of injuries because of how people choose to use playground equipment.  For example, older children may choose to climb on the outside of a 'safe' but boring play structure, rather than using it the way the designers intended.  Similarly, rather than letting young children play on playground slides by themselves, some injury-averse parents seat the children on the adult's lap and go down the slide together.  This seems safer at first glance, but if the child's shoe catches on the edge of the slide, this arrangement frequently results in the child's leg being broken.  If the child had been permitted to use the slide independently, then this injury would not happen, because when the shoe caught, the child would have stopped sliding rather than being propelled down the slide by the adult's weight.Also concerning the safety of playgrounds is the material in which they are built. Wooden playgrounds act as a more natural environment for the children to play but can cause even more minor injuries.  Slivers are the main concern when building with wood material.  Wet weather is also a threat to children playing on wooden structures.  Most woods are treated and do not wear terribly fast, but with enough rain, wooden playgrounds can become slippery and dangerous for children to be on.\n\n\n=== Regulation ===\nIn the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American National Standards Institute have created a Standardized Document and Training System for certification of Playground Safety Inspectors. These regulations are nationwide and provide a basis for safe playground installation and maintenance practices. ASTM F1487-07 deals with specific requirements regarding issues such as play ground layout, use zones, and various test criteria for determining play ground safety. ASTM F2373 covers public use play equipment for children 6\u201324 months old.  This information can be applied effectively only by a trained C.P.S.I. A National Listing of Trained Playground Safety Inspectors is available for many states. A Certified Playground Safety Inspector (CPSI) is a career that was developed by the National Playground Safety Institute (NPSI) and is recognized nationally by the National Recreation and Park Association or N.R.P.A. (Some information sources offer  interactive examples of playground equipment that violates CPSC guidelines.)\nIn Australia, Standards Australia is responsible for the publication of the playground safety Standards AS/NS4422, AS/NZS4486.1 and AS4685 Parts 1 to 6. The University of Technology Sydney is responsible for the training and accreditation of playground inspectors. The Register of Playground Inspectors Australia lists all the individuals who have been certified to inspector playgrounds within Australia.\n\nEuropean Standards EN 1177 specifies the requirements for surfaces used in playgrounds. For each material type and height of equipment it specifies a minimum depth of material required. EN 1176 covers playground equipment standards. In the UK, playground inspectors can sit the examinations of the Register of Play Inspectors International at the three required levels - routine, operational and annual. Annual inspectors are able to undertake the post-installation inspections recommended by EN 1176.\n\n\n=== Prevention strategies ===\nBecause the majority of playground injuries are due to falls from equipment, injury prevention efforts are primarily directed at reducing the likelihood of a child falling and reducing the likelihood of a severe injury if the child does fall.  This is done by:\n\nreducing the maximum fall height of equipment, primarily by reducing the overall height of anything a child might climb on or into;\nreducing the likelihood of falling from equipment, through using barriers, discouraging climbing, and making upper surfaces inconvenient or uncomfortable for climbing or sitting on; and\ninstalling a more flexible surface under and around play equipment, so that a child who falls is less likely to break a bone.How effective these strategies are at preventing injuries is debated by experts, because when playgrounds are made from padded materials, children often take more risks.\n\n\n=== Playground injury ===\n\nEach year in the United States, emergency departments treat more than 200,000 children ages 14 and younger for playground-related injuries.  Approximately 156,040 (75.8%) of the 1999 injuries occurred on equipment designed for public use; 46,930 (22.8%) occurred on equipment designed for home use; and 2,880 (1.4%) occurred on homemade playground equipment (primarily rope swings).\n\nPercentage of injuries involving public equipmentAbout 46% occurred in schools.\nAbout 31% occurred in public parks.\nAbout 10% occurred in commercial childcare centers.\nAbout 3% occurred in home childcare.\nAbout 3% occurred in apartment complexes.\nAbout 2% occurred in fast food restaurants.\nAbout 9% occurred in other locations.From January 1990 to August 2000, CPSC received reports of 147 deaths to children younger than 15 that involved playground equipment.\n\n70% of those deaths occurred in home\n30% of those deaths occurred in public useGirls were involved in a slightly higher percentage of injuries (55%) than were boys (45%).\nInjuries to the head and face accounted for 49% of injuries to children 0-4, while injuries to the arm and hand accounted for 49% of injuries to children ages 5\u201314. Approximately 15% of the injuries were classified as severe, with 3% requiring hospitalization.  The most prevalent diagnoses were fractures (39%), lacerations (22%), contusions/abrasions (20%), strains/sprains (11%).\nFor children ages 0\u20134, climbers (40%) had the highest incidence rates, followed by slides (33%).  For children ages 5\u201314, climbing equipment (56%) had the highest incidence rates, followed by swings (24%). Most injuries on public playground equipment were associated with climbing equipment (53%), swings (19%), and slides (17%).\nFalls to the surface was a contributing factor in 79% of all injuries. On home equipment, 81% were associated with falls.\nIn 1995, playground-related injuries among children ages 14 and younger cost an estimated $1.2 billion.On public playgrounds, more injuries occur on climbers than on any other equipment. On home playgrounds, swings are responsible for most injuries.Playgrounds in low-income areas have more maintenance-related hazards than playgrounds in high-income areas. For example, playgrounds in low-income areas had significantly more trash, rusty play equipment, and damaged fall surfaces.\n\n\n=== Unintended consequences ===\n\nAs a result of what some experts say is overprotectiveness driven by a fear of lawsuits, playgrounds have been designed to be, or at least to appear, excessively safe.  This overprotectiveness may protect the playground owner from lawsuits, but it appears to result in a decreased sense of achievement and increased fears in children.The equipment limitations result in the children receiving less value from the play time.  The enclosed, padded, constrained, low structures prevent the child from taking risks and developing a sense of mastery over his or her environment.  Successfully taking a risk is empowering to children.  For example, a child climbing to the top of a tall jungle gym feels happy about successfully managing the challenging climb to the top, and he experiences the thrill of being in a precarious, high position.  By contrast, the child on a low piece of equipment, designed to reduce the incidence of injuries from falls, experiences no such thrill, sense of mastery, or accomplishment.  Additionally, a lack of experience with heights as a child is associated with increased acrophobia (fear of heights) in adults.The appearance of safety encourages unreasonable risk-taking in children, who might take more reasonable risks if they correctly understood that it is possible to break a bone on the soft surfaces under most modern equipment.Finally, the playground that is designed to appear low-risk is boring, especially to older children.  As a result, they tend to seek out alternative play areas, which may be very unsafe.Risk management is an important life skill, and risk aversion in playgrounds is unhelpful in the long term. Experts studying child development such as Tim Gill have written about the over-protective bias in provision for children, particularly with playgrounds.  Instead of a constructed playground, allowing children to play in a natural environment such as open land or a park is sometimes recommended; children gain a better sense of balance playing on uneven ground, and learn to interpret the complexity and signals of nature more effectively.\n\n\n== Types ==\n\nPlaygrounds can be:\n\nBuilt by collaborative support of corporate and community resources to achieve an immediate and visible 'win' for their neighborhood.\nPublic, free of charge, like at most rural elementary schools\n Connected to a business, for customers only, e.g., at McDonald's, IKEA, and Chuck E. Cheese's.\nFor-Profit business with an entrance fee, like those at the (now defunct) Discovery Zone, Zoom Zoom's Indoor Playground in Ancaster, Ontario, Jungle Jam Indoor Playground, and Kidtastic Indoor Playground.\nNon-Profit organizations for edutainment as children's museums and science centers, some charge admission, some are free.\n\n\n=== Inclusive playgrounds ===\n\nUniversally designed playgrounds are created to be accessible to all children.  There are three primary components to a higher level of inclusive play:\n\nphysical accessibility;\nage and developmental appropriateness; and\nsensory-stimulating activity.Some children with disabilities or developmental differences do not interact with playgrounds in the same way as typical children.  A playground designed without considering these children's needs may not be accessible or interesting to them.\nMost efforts at inclusive playgrounds have been aimed at accommodating wheelchair users.  For example, rubber paths and ramps replace sand pits and steps, and some features are placed at ground level.  Efforts to accommodate children on the autism spectrum, who may find playgrounds overstimulating or who may have difficulty interacting with other children, have been less common.\n\n\n=== Natural playgrounds ===\n\n 'Natural playgrounds' are play environments that blend natural materials, features, and indigenous vegetation with creative landforms to create purposely complex interplays of natural, environmental objects in ways that challenge and fascinate children and teach them about the wonders and intricacies of the natural world while they play within it.\nPlay components may include earth shapes (sculptures), environmental art, indigenous vegetation (trees, shrubs, grasses, flowers, lichens, mosses), boulders or other rock structures, dirt and sand, natural fences (stone, willow, wooden), textured pathways, and natural water features.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Playgrounds for adults ===\n\nChina and some countries in Europe have playgrounds designed for adults.  These are outdoor spaces that feature fitness equipment designed for use primarily by adults, such as chin-up bars.\nPlaygrounds for older adults are popular in China.  Seniors are the primary users of public playgrounds in China.  These playgrounds are usually in a smaller, screened area, which may reduce the feeling of being watched or judged by others.  They often have adult-sized equipment that helps seniors stretch, strengthen muscles, and improve their sense of balance.  Similar playgrounds for adults have been built in other countries.  Berlin's Preu\u00dfenpark for example is designed for people aged 70 or higher.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAdventure playground\nChin-up bar\nChildren Youth and Environments Journal\nCold War playground equipment\nCommercial Playgrounds\nEmpower playgrounds\nFriendship bench\nObstacle course\nPlayground game\nPlayground song\nPlayground Surfacing\nPlayscape\nPlaytime\nPlaywork\nRecess (break)\nRopes course\nRubber Mulch\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAjzen, I.

        "wiki": "Oxford Castle is a large, partly ruined Norman medieval castle on the western side of central Oxford in Oxfordshire, England. Most of the original moated, wooden motte and bailey castle was replaced in stone in the late 12th or early 13th century and the castle played an important role in the conflict of the Anarchy. In the 14th century the military value of the castle diminished and the site became used primarily for county administration and as a prison. The surviving rectangular St George's Tower is now believed to pre-date the remainder of the castle and be a watch tower associated with the original Saxon west gate of the city.\nMost of the castle was destroyed in the English Civil War and by the 18th century the remaining buildings had become Oxford's local prison. A new prison complex was built on the site from 1785 onwards and expanded in 1876; this became HM Prison Oxford.\nThe prison closed in 1996 and was redeveloped as a hotel and visitor attraction. The medieval remains of the castle, including the motte and St George's Tower and crypt, are Grade I listed buildings and a Scheduled Monument.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nAccording to the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis (Abingdon Chronicle), Oxford Castle was built by the Norman baron Robert D'Oyly the elder from 1071\u201373. D'Oyly had arrived in England with William I in the Norman Conquest of England and William the Conqueror granted him extensive lands in Oxfordshire. Oxford had been stormed in the invasion with considerable damage, and William directed D'Oyly to build a castle to dominate the town. In due course D'Oyly became the foremost landowner in Oxfordshire and was confirmed with a hereditary royal constableship for Oxford Castle. Oxford Castle is not among the 48 recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, but not every castle in existence at the time was recorded in the survey. D'Oyly (d'Oilly)'s Oxford holdings are, however, mentioned in the Domesday Book as \"Meadow 30 acres. 1 mill, value 0.5 [pounds].\"; the mill mentioned is presumably the Castle Mill, formerly adjacent to the still surviving St. George's Tower, rebuilt in 1781 before eventually being demolished in 1930.D'Oyly positioned his castle to the west side of the town, using the natural protection of a stream off the River Thames on the far side of the castle, now called Castle Mill Stream, and diverting the stream to produce a moat. There has been debate as to whether there was an earlier English fortification on the site, but whilst there is archaeological evidence of earlier Anglo-Saxon habitation there is no conclusive evidence of fortification. Oxford Castle was an \"urban castle\", overlying a portion of the Saxon town wall, but it remains uncertain whether local buildings were demolished to make room for it. Poore et al. (2009) give a suggested street plan of the town in late Saxon times (their figure 4) showing the then town wall with its north, west, south and east gates; at the north gate is the Saxon tower now associated with the church of St Michael at the North Gate, while the west gate is occupied by the apparently Saxon tower of St. George's, which is now believed to have subsequently been incorporated into the fabric of the later Norman castle.\n\nThe initial castle was probably a large motte and bailey, copying the plan of the castle that D'Oyly had already built 12 miles (19 km) away at Wallingford. The motte was originally about 60 feet (18 m) high and 40 feet (12 m) wide, constructed like the bailey from layers of gravel and strengthened with clay facing. There has been debate over the sequencing of the motte and the bailey: it has been suggested that the bailey may have built first (thus utilising the pre-existing St. George's Tower as the first keep) which would make the initial castle design a ringwork rather than a motte and bailey.By the late 12th to early 13th century, the original palisade walls and wooden keep had been replaced in stone. The new curtain wall incorporated St George's Tower, which is built of coral rag stone, 30 by 30 feet (9 m \u00d7 9 m) at the base and tapering significantly toward the top for stability. This was the tallest of the castle's towers, and is now believed to be a survival from late Saxon times (c. 1020) as a watch tower associated with the west gate of the Saxon city. Evidence that this tower is Saxon in origin and thus pre-dates the castle itself is presented in Poore et al. (2009), who comment that \"a single, massive stone tower does not seem to belong within the outer defences of an earth-and-timber castle\", and other sources have concurred on architectural grounds, also noting that its orientation does not match that of the remainder of the castle, and that its height would have originally afforded an extensive view over the city, but which would have been superseded (and in fact, blocked) with the construction of the castle motte. The date of the remaining towers is uncertain although the southernmost, round tower, of which the base still remains, is dated to 1235 in various documentary sources, including Woolnoth's The Ancient Castles of England and Wales of 1825; in at least one source, it is referred to as \"Henry III's Tower\".Inside the walls the buildings included a chapel with a crypt attached to St. Georges Tower, which may be on the site of a previous church. The chapel originally had a nave, chancel and an apsidal sanctuary. It was a typical early Norman design with solid pillars and arches. In 1074 D'Oyly and his close friend, Roger d'Ivry had endowed a chapel with a college of priests, which is presumed to be the structure in question; at an early stage it acquired a dedication to Saint George. As detailed below, the crypt of this chapel still survives, albeit in a new location within the castle, having been moved and reconstructed from its original materials in 1794.\nThe ten-sided stone shell keep, 58 feet (18 m), constructed in the 13th century to replace an earlier wooden structure, closely resembled those of Tonbridge and Arundel Castles. The keep enclosed a number of buildings, leaving an inner courtyard only 22 feet (7 m) across. Within the keep, stairs led 20 feet (6 m) down to an underground 12 feet (3.7 m) wide stone chamber, with an Early English hexagonal vault and a 54 feet (16 m) deep well providing water in the event of siege.\n\n\n=== Role in the Anarchy and Barons War ===\n\nRobert D'Oyly the younger, Robert D'Oyly the elder's nephew, had inherited the castle by the time of the civil war of the Anarchy in the 1140s. After initially supporting King Stephen, Robert declared his support for Empress Matilda, Stephen's cousin and rival for the throne, and in 1141 the Empress marched to Oxford to base her campaign at the castle. Stephen responded by marching from Bristol in the Autumn of 1142, attacking and seizing the town of Oxford and besieging Matilda in the castle. Stephen set up two siege mounds beside the castle, called Jew's Mount and Mount Pelham, on which he placed siege engines, largely for show, and proceeded to wait for Matilda's supplies to run low over the next three months. Stephen would have had difficulty in supplying his men through the winter period, and this decision shows the apparent strength of Oxford Castle at the time.Finally in December, Matilda responded by escaping from the castle; the popular version of this has the Empress waiting until the Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage in the snow, being lowered down the walls with three or four knights, before escaping through Stephen's lines in the night as the king's sentries tried to raise the alarm. The chronicler William of Malmesbury, however, suggests Matilda did not descend the walls, but instead escaped from one of the gates. Matilda safely reached Abingdon-on-Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day. Robert had died in the final weeks of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney for the remainder of the war. At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D'Oyly, Robert D'Oyly the younger's son, in 1154.In the Barons' War of 1215\u201317 the castle was attacked again, prompting further improvements in its defences. In 1220 Falkes de Breaut\u00e9, who controlled many royal castles in the middle of England, demolished the Church of St Budoc to the south-east of the castle and built a moated barbican to further defend the main gate. The remaining wooden buildings were replaced in stone, including the new Round Tower which was built in 1235. King Henry III turned part of the castle into a prison, specifically for holding troublesome University clerks, and also improved the castle chapel, replacing the older barred windows with stained glass in 1243 and 1246. Due to the presence of Beaumont Palace to the north of Oxford, however, the castle never became a royal residence.\n\n\n=== 14th\u201317th centuries ===\n\nBy 1327 the fortification, particularly the castle gates and the barbican, was in poor condition and \u00a3800 was estimated to be required for repairs. From the 1350s onwards the castle had little military use and was increasingly allowed to fall into disrepair. The castle became the centre for the administration of the county of Oxford, a jail, and a criminal court. Assizes were held there until 1577, when plague broke out in what became known as the \"Black Assize\": the Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire, two knights, eighty gentlemen and the entire grand jury for the session all died, including Sir Robert D'Oyley, a relative of the founder of the castle. Thereafter assizes ceased to be held at the castle.Ralph Agas's map of Oxford in 1578 shows that by then, while the curtain wall, keep and towers remained, the barbican had been demolished to make way for houses. Hassall, 1976, states that by 1600 the moat was almost entirely silted up and houses had been built all around the edge of the bailey wall, although this is contradicted by the castle's appearance in John Speed's map of Oxford, 1605. In 1611 King James I sold Oxford Castle to Francis James and Robert Younglove, who in turn sold it to Christ Church College in 1613. The college then leased it to a number of local families over the coming years. By this time Oxford Castle was in a weakened state, with a large crack running down the side of the keep. A map of the castle prepared for Christ Church College in 1615 shows the keep on its mound, St. George's Tower with associated buildings and sections of the curtain wall remaining to the north and south, and the next tower to the south, plus a single remaining tower to the north-east, as well as the Castle Mill and a southern entrance to the castle complex; according to this map, by 1615 houses and their gardens had been built up to over half of the Castle Ditch or moat, which appears to still contain water.\nIn 1642 the English Civil War broke out and the Royalists made Oxford their capital. Parliamentary forces successfully besieged Oxford in 1646 and the city was occupied by Colonel Ingoldsby. Ingoldsby improved the fortification of the castle rather than the surrounding town, and in 1649 demolished most of the medieval stonework, replacing it with more modern earth bulwarks and reinforcing the keep with earth works to form a probable gun-platform. In 1652, in the third English Civil War, the Parliamentary garrison responded to the proximity of Charles II's forces by pulling down these defences as well and retreating to New College instead, causing great damage to the college in the process. In the event, Oxford saw no fresh fighting; early in the 18th century, however, the keep was demolished and the top of the motte landscaped to its current form.\n\n\n=== Role as prison ===\n\nAfter the Civil War, Oxford Castle served primarily as the local prison. As with other prisons at the time, the owners, in this case Christ Church College, leased the castle to wardens who would profit by charging prisoners for their board and lodging. The prison also had a gallows to execute prisoners, such as Mary Blandy in 1752. For most of the 18th century, the castle prison was run by the local Etty and Wisdom families and was in increasing disrepair. A view of the castle published in 1769 in the work \"England Displayed\" by P. Russell and Owen Price is of interest in that it shows the appearance of the chapel attached to St George's tower prior to its demolition in 1794, as well as the motte and some then-surviving portions of the curtain wall including an arch or gateway in the wall immediately to the north of the tower. The chapel and/or associated buildings are also shown, from a range of angles, in views by other artists including Samuel and Nathaniel Buck's Antiquities (drawing dated 1729), a 1773 engraving included in Francis Grose's Antiquities of England and Wales, 1786, a painting by Michael Angelo Rooker dating from 1779, and a view by the artist John Baptist Malchair dating from 1784. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard visited the castle several times, and criticised its size and quality, including the extent to which vermin infested the prison. Partly as a result of this criticism, it was decided by the County authorities to rebuild the Oxford Prison.In 1785 the castle was bought by the Oxford County Justices and rebuilding began under the London architect William Blackburn. The wider castle site had already begun to change by the late 18th century, with New Road being built through the bailey and the last parts of the castle moat being filled in to allow the building of the new Oxford Canal terminus. Building the new prison included demolishing the old chapel attached to St George's tower and repositioning part of the crypt in 1794. The work was completed under Daniel Harris in 1805. Harris gained a reasonable salary as the new governor and used convict labour from the prison to conduct early archaeological excavations at the castle with the help of the antiquarian Edward King.In the 19th century the site continued to be developed, with various new buildings built including the new County Hall in 1840\u201341 and the Oxfordshire Militia Armoury in 1854. The prison itself was extended in 1876, growing to occupy most of the remaining space. The inmates included children, the youngest being a seven-year-old girl sentenced to seven days hard labour in 1870 for stealing a pram.  In 1888 national prison reforms led to the renaming of the county prison as HM Prison Oxford.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nToday, the remains of the Saxon St.George's Tower, Motte-and-Bailey Mound, the Prison D-Wing and Debtor's Tower make up the Oxford Castle & Prison tourist attraction. \nThe prison was closed in 1996 and the site reverted to Oxfordshire County Council. The Oxford Prison buildings have since been redeveloped as a restaurant and heritage complex, with guided tours of the historic buildings and open courtyards for markets and theatrical performances. The complex includes a hotel in the Malmaison chain, Malmaison Oxford, occupying a large part of the former prison blocks, with cells converted as guest rooms. However, those parts of the prison associated with corporal or capital punishment have been converted to offices rather than being used for guests. The mixed-use heritage project, officially opened on 5 May 2006, won the RICS Project of the Year Award 2007.The full extent of the original castle is somewhat obliterated today, especially with the intrusion of the newer County Hall into the eastern side, while New Road runs over the location of north-east portion of the curtain wall with its two square towers; nevertheless the position of its outer perimeter moat is approximated by portions of New Road, Castle Street and Paradise Street (refer map at right), while the remains of the original Barbican lie underneath the modern Westgate shopping centre. Since 1954 the two oldest parts of the castle have been Grade I listed buildings: the 11th-century motte with its 13th-century well-chamber, the circa 11th-century St George's tower (listed as Norman, but now generally believed to be Saxon), the relocated crypt chapel, and the 18th-century D-wing and Debtors' Tower. The site is protected as a Scheduled Monument. As at 2018, guided tours of the surviving medieval and 18th century portions are available to visitors via a commercial operator, Heritage Projects (Oxford Castle) Ltd, with opening hours and pricing available via their website.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCastles in Great Britain and Ireland\nList of castles in England\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nAmt, Emilie.

          "Who would\u2019ve known that this small castle and prison set up would be so famous in Oxford! Please note that you are not allowed to wander on your own accord, they insist that you take the guided tour, but this is an absolutely fabulous thing for them to offer as part of this",
          "It is amazing to be wandering the winding streets of Oxford to come across the amazing Motte and this wonderful piece of history. Amazing to walk through something 1,000 years old and hear the history of Oxford, the Castle and its use as a prison. Do not miss!",

          "My husband and I took the tour and the young woman--Becca--our guide was outstanding! She made the visit not only informative but also a delightful piece of theater. For Becca this is not a job but a pleasure or that is what she portrayed. Well worth the visit. Sad to say both",
          "Nice way to spend time in Oxford, especially when the weather's not the best. At first it seemed our tour guide Robin was a bit tired and wanted to be anywhere else but there, but during the tour he \"got it going\" and he did his part nicely. Tour itself was interestingly put",

          "Very good and interesting, but if you suffer from vertigo, do not go up the tower, I found it terrifying, very narrow and steep spiral staircase. Harder coming down! Other than that brilliant \ud83d\ude01",
          "Quite interesting museum but most of the castle is now a hotel which is a bit disappointing. There is a great view from the mound but they charge you a pound to climb up it which seems a bit mean",
          "Engaging guide (Becca) delivered interesting tour, relating the castle and prison's history, along with a few spooky tales. A great day trip from London. Note: Stairs could be a challenge for some.",

          "Decided to do the tour and wasn't sure what to expect. While the guide was informative and fine, in truth, there isn't much to see other than climbing the tower and seeing some cells. I thought for the money charged, it wasn't value for money. Not sure I'd recommend it for",
          "I and another adult took my grand children aged 5 and 7to visit the Oxford Castle. We arrived earlier than our booking and we able to join an earlier tour. The guide, Robin, was excellent and held the interest of the children but at the same time didn't tell them anything too",
          "We decided to do the lantern tour of the castle and prison as although local to the area we had not visited previously. It was a most enjoyable visit and this was helped greatly by our guide Alistair who was entertaining and informative. This is a tour that would appeal to all",
          "We went whilst visting Oxford in December for the Christmas market and after coming away was so glad we did. The tour itself is informative and entertaining at the sametime and the guide takes you through all the years of the castle from when it was first constructed in the 11th",
          "We enjoyed the tour, our tour guide Becca was funny and informative and made sure our sons and other children were involved to make it interesting for them too. Great view of Oxford from the top of the tower and good value for money!",
          "We found that even though the toor guide Robin was very good, the content overall was quite poor and definitely not good value for money. Not really worth visiting.",
          "The tour of the castle and the jail was very informative and interesting. The site itself is worthy of lots of great photos. The motte was easy to climb, and is worth visiting. Well worth the visit.",

          "We had the 3pm tour. Phil was an excellent guide and was exceptionally knowledgeable. He dealt with all of the group really well and was very patient. The tour was interesting and great to see the prison. Time to read the information boards would have been my only point to",
          "My husband and I went on this tour with our 21 year old son. Alistair was our guide and he relayed an incredible amount of facts, stories- some true!- with a great sense of humor. We left with a much better sense of the reality of earlier history of the castle, Oxford history",
          "Visited this place with guided tour. One of the packed history-telling of the building. Generous information and actual props which could be spent roughly 2-2.5 hours. Don\u2019t forget to purchase a medieval mug.",

          "Nice castle transformed into a prison, though quite small and not very unique or architecturally beautiful. One must arrive with at least half an hour before the next tour starts, or risk not finding a place in the group.",
          "We had Alistair as our tour guide and he was absolutely brilliant. Friendly, welcoming and very informative. He knew so much about all aspects of the castle and prison and delivered it in such a way that it was easy to take in and understand. It\u2019s definite worth the visit, it\u2019s",

          "I felt this site was well worth the visit. it's a guided tour that includes the prison and bell tower. Our guide, Alister, was very informative and made the tour come to life with his audience participation style. The bell tower is a climb, about 100 steps in a circular",
          "Bought tickets on the door rather than in advance and the next tour was in a couple of minutes they run every half hour for 1 hour! Robin was our fantastic guide who was informative but made it fun also! We walked around and learnt so much about the castle and prisons history!",

          "Great and informative tour, but odd given the use of we/us pronouns given the strong American accent. Clearly not a son of Oxford....",
          "We took a tour on the spur of the moment as we were browsing in the gift shop with time on our hands, and the tour was about to start. Our guide was Bekka, and she was excellent - first class attention to health and safety on the tour, knowledgable, amusing and personable. We",
          "First visit to this attraction. Fascinating and significant history of England, brought to life in an amusing and memorable way by Alastair, our guide. If you can do the steps to the top of the tower you will have panoramic views of the dreaming spires and Oxfordshire. Not to be",

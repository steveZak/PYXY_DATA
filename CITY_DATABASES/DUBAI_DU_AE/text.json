        "wiki": "The Dubai Frame (Arabic: \u0628\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0628\u064a\u200e) is an architectural landmark in Zabeel Park, Dubai. It has been described by The Guardian newspaper as \"the biggest picture frame on the planet,\u201d however is also controversial as the \"biggest stolen building of all time.\u201dThe project was conceived by Fernando Donis, and selected as the winner of a design competition by the Government of Dubai. It is alleged that the designer had his intellectual property stolen and was denied credit for the design. It holds the record for the largest frame in the world.\n\n\n== Architecture competition ==\nThe design was selected as the winner of the 2009 ThyssenKrupp Elevator International Award from 926 proposals. Participants from all over the world were invited to submit an emblem that would promote \u201cthe new face for Dubai\". It is near the Star Gate of Zabeel Park and stands at 150.24 m (493 ft)  and 95.53 m wide.The ThyssenKrupp Elevator Architecture Award is an international architecture competition first held in 1988 and sponsored by one of the world's leading elevator companies. An international panel of judges selected the winning idea from among 926 design proposals to create a Tall Emblem Structure for Dubai. The original jury consisted of 11 international architects \u2014 a former and current chairman of the International Union of Architects (UIA) and the regional chairman of ThyssenKrupp Elevator. Dubai Municipality\u2019s director general and H.H. Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum were listed as \u2018honorary\u2019 jurors.\n\nDonis' design was ultimately selected, for which he won an AED 367329.70 ($100,000) prize. According to Donis, when designing the structure he saw Dubai as a city full of emblems and rather than adding another one, they proposed to frame them all: to frame the city. Instead of building a massive structure, the purpose of the proposal was to build a void of 150 meters by 105 meters to continuously frame the development of the past, current and future Dubai. To become the structure that celebrates yet constrains the city.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe Dubai Frame is created out of glass, steel, aluminum, and reinforced concrete. It is positioned in such a way that representative landmarks of modern Dubai can be seen on one side, while from the other side, visitors can also view older parts of the city.The Frame opened in January 2018.\n\n\n== Lawsuit ==\nIn December 2016, the architect Fernando Donis filed suit in US court against the Municipality of Dubai and ThyssenKrupp Elevator. In his suit, Donis claims that he has not received either a contract or compensation for his design, despite it being currently under construction. As of 2018, the architect and the Municipality of Dubai were engaged in a legal dispute over ownership of the copyright for the building.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of development projects in Dubai\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDubai Frame Will Become the Most Visited Place in UAE UAE Business Finder.

          "Huge aquarium with plenty to see, paid for the VIP package and it was well worth it (skip the line really skip the line) the glass bottom boat tour was superb and the behind the scenes / fish feeding was fun for the boys. The VR experience was excellent and the underwater zoo",
          "The biggest draw is the huge fish tank. But you can see it for free in the shopping centre. We had a dual ticket for the aquarium & at the top. Annoyingly you have to queue twice, once for the Burj and then again for the aquarium even though it\u2019s a joint ticket!! The aquarium",

          "So, I bought comb ticket for Burj Khalifa and Dubai Aquarium and Zoo. Aquarium is not aquarium, just very big tank with a tunnel inside where you walk like 20-30meters. All that you can see for free from mall hallway. After that you need to go out back in mall hallway and go 2",
          "Spent an hour at the aquarium and could have done it in 15 minutes, far too expensive for so little I\u2019m afraid, thankfully we didn\u2019t have to Q too long, that\u2019s was the only plus. Staff were excellent all the same and the shopping centre was just incredible, not only in size but",
          "The Aquarium and Zoo are located inside the dubai mall and provide a short break from the bustle of city shopping. However it is quite a short trip required and having been to some magnificient aquariums this is sweet for being in a shopping mall in the middle of the desert.",

          "Not worth the money in our view. The \u201caquarium\u201d is actually a very large floor to ceiling fish tank with a tunnel walk through. It\u2019s about 25 metres long, and that\u2019s it! The Underwater Zoo is more interesting, though still not worth the money. We went on and saw many attractions",

          "We visited this place with our friends and we all were very disappointed. It is quite expensive to pay 120 aed for almost nothing and it\u2019s not worth even half of the price. We took the smallest package with aqua zoo and tunnel. But aqua zoo can be interesting only for kids, and",

          "Bought the explorer experience. Good for kids and not for adults. Not worth the extra money for the things listed (behind the scenes, submarine simulator - what a joke that is) . Completely dissapointed by this. Never again",
          "We did not skip the line as we still had to show our on line ticket before moving to entry point. The aquarium offered no more than can be seen from the Mall - the underwater zoo - two floors up after leaving the Aquarium - was quite interesting but only about 1.25 hours worth",

          "So many things to see and do in the one location. Huge Underwater tunnel Otters, Birds, crocodiles, frogs, freshwater fish, marine fish, touch pool, coral jellyfish so much to see here and more. Amazed how this is all found inside a mall. There is also a few encounters to",

          "Here you see a completely different world. Fish and other animal species I didn't even know existed. Here you get really close to this paradise. We got to look at the fish close by. It was also possible to take the inflatable boat on an expedition. I was too afraid of these",

          "Dubai Mall Aquarium is surprisingly good. Comparing to many visits to Aquariums globally I can say this compares well. There is a really interesting mix here, more than the usual selections, including otters and beavers, lots of reptiles and amphibians, freshwater fish as well",
          "Our son did the Shark Dive. He was really thrilled diving close to sharks and sting-rays. We can really recommend to buy the photo and video. Great shots and quality.",
          "What a nice experience to view wonderful nature without going far but right inside the Mall when you came for shopping. The aquarium and underwater zoo are exquisite, something not to miss out when visiting Dubai. You kill two birds with one stone.",
          "It is a small marine zoo and aquarium. good exhibits and well showcased to attract the kids (like an underwater peephole for kids to put their head through an exhibit with crocs)! Will kids have fun - yes. Of course it is ridiculously pricey and not enough value for money.",
          "Perhaps I am biased because I visited aquarium at Atlantis first, but I found the place to be crowded and smelly. The ticket management was hell. After standing in one queue with mobile tickets (combined ticket for burj khalifa and acquarium), the guard told us to go to the",
          "The Aquarium is just mediocre, I have visited Aquarium in Singapore which was way better, here they have a just a tunnel and then you have to proceed for underwater Zoo which is also fine.",
          "Part of the Dubai Aquarium is visible from outside when in Dubai Mall. We had taken tickets of Dubai Aquarium and Zoo. It has various types of fishes and Shark as well. Zoo is also good. It was an good experience although not an extraordinary one. Good for kids.",
          "This Aquarium is in the Dubai mall. Shockingly the view outside from the mall (without ticket) is just enough and that's all is the aquarium overall. Before even you realise that you are in the aquarium you are outside it.. it's just one stretch of tunnel and that's all it is.",
          "When u see aquarium from outside it will just blow your mind, it's insane. I was never in aquarium this was first time and i was not disappointed. Only one small thing is that first impressions is huge and nothing can compare to first impression.",
          "It's good. But same view as I saw from outside. I felt like it is a waste of money. Inside nothing but walking into the tunnel",
          "We enjoyed the visit, but it was quite overpriced. The best views are actually from the outside, from the mall and you don't have to pay to see the big sharks",
          "It is part of Dubai Mall an interior activity to see is the Dubai Aquarium and Under Water Zoo where you can live the show with creatures you never get closer to them",
          "Please be aware of the tourist photo trap at the entrance of the aquarium tunnel and at the debut of the glass bottom boat tour. They took photos of our family at the start and then charged us AED 220 (about USD 60) for one photo when we finish the experience!!",
          "The underwater aquarium is very large and has a wide variety of aquatic animals that one must barely seen. Although the Aquarium is not that big but Underwater Zoo was pretty big and features wide range of exotic and rare animals. The experience was thrilling and we had a lot of",
          "This aquarium is awesome! Located in the Dubai mall. A massive fish tank with rays, sharks, fish. Simply beautiful and if your on a tight budget you can still see the aquarium. The underwater zoo was nice we enjoyed seeing King croc and the barn owl :) Lovely",
          "Dubai Aquarium is located inside the Dubai Mall, its very entertaining not only for adults but mostly for childrens.",
          "one of the biggest in the world, many species, u can swim with sharks and attend rays feeding . the kids will enjoy it much.",
          "A beautiful view! I\u2019ve never experienced an aquarium and zoo the way I did in Dubai. Truly a unique facility with so many activities to offer!",
          "i would def. recommend to bring your kids and even adults who are interested in fish , a lot to explore for sure .",
          "I really didnt like it that much maybe because I've seen better places in other countries.. but it's not bad for kids .. they will enjoy it and it stays opened till late.",
          "Dubai\u2019s one of the best attraction located inside the Dubai Mall. Three floor with a great variety of specimens. Glass bottom boat ride you should not miss. Possibility of diving with an instructor. Wonderful views. Guided tours inside. Very organized. Tickets for sale on the",
          "It was a busy day but we had a wonderful time. Best aquarium in the world! Only thing is under 3s are not allowed in the glass bottom ride with the explorer package so we had to take turns taking our 5 year old.",
          "You can see the aquarium from the shopping mall not really necessary to go inside plenty to see from outside",
          "Visited the mall and saw the public aquarium view from the outside. Lovely aquarium, but personally I dont think it is worth paying to just walk through a glass tunell inside the same aquarium that you can see from the outside for free",
          "No prices displayed at either of the sales desk, rather odd. Asked 5-6 times for a standard ticket, cheapest option. The girl constantly tried to up sell and hid the fact that tickets can be purchased from 120 AED not 210 with Emirates ID which obviously every non-tourist will",
          "you can enjoy perfect photos inside the tube under the water and go into the boat to see and feed fish nice time went fast",
          "The aquarium in Sydney,Australia is way better.. The highlight was King Croc over 700 kg & 5m long!!",
          "I went with big hopes to see this and I must say it's not that big aquarium before I have seen other aquariums maybe because of that I felt so, if you guys have seen aquarium before it's not a must visit if you have time visit it that's it",
          "As one walk through the passage the blue aquarium aesthetically captivates ones curiosity as to how such a beautiful project was conceived. There are lots of different aquatic animals for one to feed his eyes on, and if you are daring enough could even step in the water tank",
          "Very good aquarium with lots to see - it is well worth a visit when in Dubai. The aquarium wall is amazing and free to see in Dubai Mall.",
          "Good for adults and children. Nice well kept areas. It wasn't too busy while we were there, but, could see it could be cramped when busy.",
          "Well worth paying for the underwater Zoo it was awesome fair play. First time witnessing some of the species of fish they have there. Just a great experience for the whole family",
          "The visit to Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa is never complete without a visit to this aquarium (more of a miniature oceanarium) and the underwater zoo. It is a brilliantly conceived and executed project. We can watch life in the sea and even feed some of the fishes/sharks.",
          "very well planned and organised. visit is a must while in Dubai.underwater tunnel is amazing and behind the scene events.",
          "Such a nice place. Can't even imagine. Very huge aquarium with lots of amphibian collection. Enjoyed a lot. A must do experience one time if you visit Dubai.",
          "We booked our tickets online via Headout, we made a short queue when we got there, the children loved it , it is 1-2 hours tour , great diversity of species and some guided tours inside, they have a small children play area, a stroller parking spaces and refreshments inside,",
          "Big is not always beautiful but in this case I must agree. Your breath is taken away before you enter by the sheer size of the aquarium viewed free from the mall. The under water tunnel and the rest of the exhibition is superb. If you have any interest in marine life, it\u2019s a",
          "Took the kids and my mom to visit the under water zoo and aquarium. we had an amazing experience. The boat ride was the best of them all. we could literally touch the fish. I have never seen such huge fish so close which made it a wonderful experience. I was in a different land/",
          "a must visit place with kids, under water tunnel and zoo visit has a lot attraction for kids as well as people of all ages.",
          "To see is to believe when your inside the mall you really can't imagine how it's done yeah right you heard me right, there's an huge aquarium inside the mall. You can also enjoy riding tjhe glass boat to see all the fish. Belle \ud83c\udf3b",
          "Great service and great family location for a holiday. The variety of aquatic animals to see is unbelievable.",
          "It wasn\u2019t cheap to get in here, but it was worth it! Lots of animals to see. They will let you touch a few. We got to pet a shark. Good exhibits. We also feed some fish. Staff was friendly and helpful. Huge crocodile!",
          "They have various tickets ..for entry to view and for various other activities. If u dont have kids ..a regular entry is sufficient. It is one of the activities included if u take a single day hoho bus ticket.. Totally worth it..but a two day pass is better..they have so many",
          "Thought there would of been more to see seen as how much you have to pay to get in there. The women charged us for all the excursions even though we couldn't do the boat ride with a 1 year old. To expensive for what is it. Not worth it!",
          "beautiful collection of underwater species, birds, gardens in the Dubai Mall was a feast to the eyes and thrilling experience.",
          "An aquarium located inside the Dubai Mall. Attractive point is the aquarium tunnel and you can see the outside part of the aquarium from the mall. I did not pay for the special experience but I guess that was amazing. Good to have a look.",
          "I stood there for hours. We got free tix when we booked in to the nearby hotel which was great but its even great looking at it from Mall side for free.",
          "Located within the Mall, you need a separate ticket to enter the Aquarium, but it is well worth it. Figure on spending about an hour to walk through the various displays, but what you will see is well worth it. In some places you will be surrounded by water and aqua life; in",
          "its the best place one can feel the under water sealife, A must visit for kids, A place time flies and real crocodile is the best.",
          "This is Wow for all to see and enjoy. the amazing different sea life, seen up-close and just to be able to admire all these different creatures from the sea in a safe environment. the setup is awesome and well worth a visit.",
          "Amazing picture perfect. Even if you don't go inside the actual aquarium u can still see the amazing huge tank from inside the mall free. Good picture perfect",
          "There is some beautiful fishes, sharks & creatures in the aquarium. I think its more for the kids to enjoy",
          "Good way to spend two hours of your time towards the end of your day. You\u2019ll get to see 80+ types of sea life.",
          "You can see fish really close and some exotic species It is really nice to see the sharks in front of you and some manta",
          "Well kept and maintaned displays. Very clean. Fish all seemed fat and well looked after. The facility not only holds fish and aquatics (which is most of it), but also birds, some mammals (water rats, otters, hedgehogs) and reptiles.",
          "We have taken additional tickets for underwater zoo and boat ride in aquarium. It was really great experience to see from different perspective. Fish feeding was amazing. jelly fish incubation is also amazing. Staff at these places are amazing, very patiently responded to all",
          "I can't begin to imagine the amount of planning that must have gone into the creation of this aquarium and zoo in a mall! It's absolutely fascinating to see such a wide variety of fish swimming around together you as you walk through the tunnel. In room after room an attempt was",
          "Me and my daughter had a few hours to kill and went to the Dubai Aquarium.... first plus is if you have the entertainer it is buy one get one free which drops the price considerably... we bought additional tickets for the otter experience which was amazing and educational... my",
          "It was wonderful to see the various fish and crocodiles but it is a very commercial place. Unlike green planet, the staff has limited knowledge of animals they handle. First we did the simulator and then the glass bottom ride. This was nice. Then we went for fish feeding which",
          "I love Dubai Aquariom since im living in the red sea area so i love fish and one ever under the sea or in ocean. If u are in Dubai u have to visit immedatilly",
          "So I did the total package. I was expecting something bigger and better. In the end I just felt like we were taken for a ride...literally. I felt like they were making much ado about not much. Still I enjoyed seeing animals I was unfamiliar with. That huge rat still has me",
          "Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo, at The Dubai Mall, so big, too many Marine life, or sea life or ocean life, the plants, animals and other organisms that live in the salt water of the sea or ocean, also too many deserts animals, at the end you will find the Official gifts store",
          "Really enjoyed the aquariums throughout the property. Really great that it was so accessible right in the Dubai Mall. Multiple species of shark and very unusual fish and reptiles throughout.",
          "No wonder why everyone amazed with this gigantic aquarium with real feel that you are inside a sea bed.",
          "Aquarium was nothing special, you could ss most of it from the mall viewing areas. The Underwater Zoo was one of the better Zoo experiences i have had. Compact with lots of great viewing of the fish, crocs, otters, and a billion other marine critters.",
          "Nice aquarium which is on one level you then have to visit the zoo which is on the second floor of the mall, you get to have a boat tour which has a glass bottom so you view the marine life more closely, after that you can see the massive collection of animal and marine life,",
          "Nice aquarium which is in one level you then have to visit the zoo which is on the second floor of the mall, you get to have s boat tour which has a glass bottom so you view the marine life more closely, after that you can see the massive collection of animal and marine life,",
          "The place is too small to charge a bomb that they do. The aquarium is a twenty feet walk in a mall. Rather than buying the ticket, you can watch the fishes through the outside in the mall passage. The underwater zoo is good but nothing unique honestly. I found the whole exercise",
          "Skip the aquarium. You can pretty much see more from the outside than just being in the tunnel for $27 and 5 min walk. Interesting for kids is the underwater zoo which houses aquatic animals, some more fish, and few birds.",
          "Located in the Dubai Mall, the aquarium is easy to reach. You can spend quality time with your children at the aquarium. Even adults love spending time in the zoo and aquarium. It is an ideal place to visit when you are bored from shopping.",
          "As a resident, i have to visit this place not only once as my daughter loves sharks (baby shark, mama shark, daddy shark, etc..) therefore why are u so pricy for us dubai residents???",
          "The inside is not much more spectacular than what you can see from outside. However, if you decide to pay for the tickets buy carefully, whatever extras their offering e.g. boat trip or feeding the fish, is definetly not worth the extra cash.",
          "As a solo tour for an avid aquarium lover it was a poor experience for the price. I bought the package for tunnel/ zoo/observatory/ behind the scenes. Do not buy tickets there! online is certainly cheaper. For children I think the zoo and tunnel would be entertaining but the",
          "Total fun & enjoyed by my family especially coral fish sharks colorful fish which I was gifted to see.",
          "Considering that this aquarium is in a Mall, the exhibits and displays inside the aquarium are very unique and interesting. The view of the tank from the Mall is amazing in it's own right however if you have the time then I would take the inside tour. We saw lots of species",
          "The aquarium is one walk-through tank. When we got to the end, we were wondering where the rest of it is. Good thing we bought tickets to the Underwater Zoo as well, where there is a lot to see. We especially liked the suspension bridge. I was saddened to see a large macaw",
          "I think it would be equally enjoyed from the outside, the mall view. The aquarium is literally the extent of the tunnel.",
          "Aquarium gives the opportunity for some spectacular photos, but the zoo is the most interesting activities, well - planned with a big variety of fish and animals, makes the visit a must. We combined the tickets with the visit to burj chalifa and got a better, price, it was the",
          "Great day out but the addins can be expensive. It could be difficult for those with limited mobility to manage to get around but there are plenty of staff to help.",
          "Lots of intersting exhibits and so many species...really enjoyed the visit and the free viewing from the Mall is quite amazing. Thank you to whomever put this place together.",
          "A must when in dubai I love visiting the underwater aquarium, mind you on this occasion we were met with some not so friendly staff however the experience was as awesome as ever,",
          "Very interesting & funny. This is one of the best place to visite in Dubai \ud83d\ude0d But the shark was just at the beggining ( in the tunnel ) We will come back for an completed tour , that for sure \u263a",
          "We had booked for this also along with Burj Khalifa visit and hence paid very nominal charges. Both the Aquarium tunnel and the night wild life in one level up are unique.",
          "little expensive but experience was great, once in a life time visit is recommemded for sure. for kids its a must place",
          "because out flight got in in the early morning, we had to find a place to kill time before we could check in. the dubai mall is great - the aquarium features a number of species that we don't generally see in north america - lots of sharks. the feeding tour is interesting -",
          "The Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo is located in the Dubai Mall. They have a number of sharks, stingrays, etc. The glass bottom boat, behind the scenes tour and whole tour was well worth it.",
          "We do not generally visit zoos, especially after. Going to Africa over many year, this proved to be a nice experience walking through the tunnels, and into the various areas where they have large display tanks. It is well worth the trip.",
          "Very disappointed with the aquarium and thought it was overpriced, the only good part was walking through the tunnel part .... sorry",
          "So you've paid your money, scanned your ticket and are walking in the inner circle to the entrance past the giant fish tank... you are stopped again to have a green screen photo taken then your in to the aquarium tunnel, what a start to this... lots of different sharks, ray and",
          "Biggest aquarium inside the mall with a walkable tunnel, You can see lost of big fishes closely .It has back of experience tour and much more activities to do..",
          "didn't get the layout - went in and you just go through a tunnel and that's it at that point. You then have to go 2 floors up to go to the underwater zoo part. Nothing special to talk about, just appeared a normal aquarium, but at least we didn't have to pay for it as it was",
          "Good to take guests when they travel to Dubai. Well organized, tidy, clean, educational. Would defo recommend it for a day trip.",
          "The Dubai mall is so large it has an enormous aquarium inside. You can watch scuba divers in the tank with rays and sharks from the ground floor or go to the top for a glass bottom boat ride over the tank and see the fish from above. Fun for all ages.",
          "It is definitely worth paying the basic entrance admission. The best aquarium experience in the world",
          "Went here as part of trip with sons school as well as with my family and there was lots too learn, see and enjoy. The boat right above the fish aquarium was quite a wonderful sight and tour.",
          "The Dubai Mall Aquarium may be bigger than the Atlantis Aquarium but I felt that the latter is better. I had dived in Atlantis Aquarium a couple of years back and was planning to dive in the Dubai mail Aquarium, but pleased that I didn't as it didn't seem to be as varied in fish",
          "It's definitely one of the best Aquariums you'll ever see in your life. Going into tunnel gives unique experience. I enjoyed it very much. Worth a visit.",
          "It is a good place. I never saw too many animals in one place and this aquarium is located in the Dubai Mall it is great\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d.",
          "Great experience. We will be back again. The food wad very delicious at mall your workers very nice to us Thank you. Good job.",
          "First of all the size of the aquarium is unbelievable and the types of fish and marines and really big in numbers. Some even i didn't see anywhere in my entire life. It was a really wonderful experience and enjoyable 3 hour tour where not only see mammals, little birds,",
          "If you love underwater creatures, a visit here is a must. We booked out tickets on Headout and got a great discount for the entire family. If you are using an international credit card, make sure your registered phone is available for verification. But the aquarium is such a",
          "The experience was worth the price but the only hurdle came when they told me that the tickets were are not 'appropriate'. So then we had to wait an hour and finally then we were allowed to go in",
          "Aquarium is not just loved by kids but also adults. Seeing so many species of fishes was worth it. A must visit place",
          "Read a lot of review stating that there is no point in buying the tickets as major part of the aquarium is anyway visible from outside for free. Still brought the tickets and am happy that we did. Yes take the free photos from outside and have a amazing experience from inside",
          "We stayed at the Address Boulevard hotel and as part of the stay we got free tickets to the, Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo. It was really great and to see the different species and varities of fish was amazing.",
          "We went as a couple and it wasn\u2019t overly expensive for Dubai. I would recommend the couples just watch from the shopp8ng centre but for families it\u2019s a must",
          "You can easily enjoy the huge aquarium glass wall from the mall, without entering the aquarium at all. If you choose to pay the (high priced) ticket, you can enter the tunnel below the big tank. It is ok, but average. After the tunnel you need to exit and find the other part of",
          "I had tickets for the tunnel free with hop on/hop off. I couldn\u2019t believe that they actually charge to go through that tunnel it\u2019s over in 60 seconds. There\u2019s much more to see stood outside in the mall.",
          "It\u2019s very nice to see all those see creatures in one place and to have a close look. Mainly it\u2019s that glass tunnel you see while walking around the mall, you will just get the chance to go through it, and the underwater zoo at Level 2 is just a lot of fish tanks. Tickets are",
          "This Aquarium looks so much better in photos. I was very excited to visit until I got there and it was a big disappointment. I loved everything I did in Dubai and this was the biggest let down. A tourist trap. Avoid this place.",
          "The huge water tank you see from outside the entrance which is inside the mall is the biggest tank of the aquarium which is disappointing. The tunnel is good but not great. The remaining of the attraction is in upper levels which is abit off as you need to take the normal",
          "I had a really good time visiting this aquarium. The glass were spotless so you can see every single detail on the fish. It doesn't seem too big but it's bigger than you think. Perfect place for all, kids will love it! The aquarium offers some (paid) activities with otters,",
          "The fish collection and the infrastructure was okay not too big or too small had decent collection, however the biggest disappointment was the attitude of the tour guides, they were not at all intrested in making any meaning ful experience, will not reccomend it",
          "Espectacular!!! beautiful fish and you get to see behind the scenes how they take care of the fish that Is included in your regular ticket.",
          "We visited zoo and relatively good for kids and later on visited aquarium which is disappointing as compared to view of all marine species more clearly seen from mall rather than buying ticket and see from inside. In my view don't waste money on aquarium it is better to from",
          "I like the fact that they didn't cover the front part where mall goers and passerbys can also see and enjoy a part of the aquarium without having to pay or go inside.",
          "We got free entrance for this with out city bus tickets and are so pleased we went, beautiful fish and animals.",
          "its nice to experience it but maybe they should drop the price, would you pay about 120$ to go see aquarium?",
          "The Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo was a nice touch to our relaxing vacation. I only wish they were bigger. Upon arriving and reviewing the website it seemed as if the facilities were larger than they acually were. But, overall it was nice",
          "entrance part of the Big Bus tour, not sure if I would pay for this alone. Interesting to see all the varieties of sea life, plenty of information on hand.nice way to spend 60/90 mins out of the sun.",
          "I went with my grandchildren who love fish, so to feed the fish and be able to walk through the tunnel was a highlight for them. Im not sure I would have done this attraction if I was on my own, but enjoyed seeing it through the eyes of the children.",
          "The Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo was hands down the most disappointing attraction experience of my 52 years on this Earth. I would say I have buyer's remorse but my ticket was complementary through my hotel. Still, it was 45 minutes I will never get back. I will say if",
          "if you buy your Burj Khalifa tickets on their website you should see an option to add on aquarium tickets. The cost to visit the aquarium is dirt cheap when you do it this way. Since the aquarium and the Burj Khalifa are both located near the Dubai mall, this is a good way to",
          "This is absolutely worth a visit when in Dubai. It is cheaper to buy tickets to visit Burj Khalifa together with the Aquarium on the same day as both are situated in the Dubai mall - this is called Combo ticket and it is for off peak visits therefore the tickets are cheaper.",
          "It's also possible to see a part of the aquarium just outside the entrance. The part which is visible is very large and you can see different parts from several floors of the Dubai mall.",
          "Buying the combo ticket with Burj Khalifa, it is value for money. It can be visited during noon time, when outdoor visits are not comfortable, due to heat. It has huge water tank containing millions of litre water and quoted as the largest suspended aquariums in the world. It",
          "We bought the Explorer package from Groupon and we really enjoyed it. The glass bottom boat tour was different. Lovely to see all the different species in the underwater zoo. The Aquarium was spectacular.",
          "Its way over priced even for Dubai. The tank can be seen without paying. You pay for walking though the tunnel which isn't specular by other aquarium standards. The Zoo is an utter disgrace and I don't know how they can justify the conditions of the animals and fish.. tiny",
          "It was a fantastic day while watching all the beautiful creatures both underwater and on land. It was a calm, serene and peaceful atmosphere once you enter this place. There were sharks, crocodiles, birds, snakes, reptiles, fishes of all kinds etc. An altogether different place",
          "Its a unique kind of experience which i got there seeing water animals in tunnel give u a very different feeling",
          "It's worth going once, 2 hours without rush. But if you don't have time, just stop by outside to view the aquarium, it's one story tall, pretty amazing.",
          "If you have been to aquariums in Singapore orBangkok, this would feel like a step experience. Nevertheless, it is quite interesting with young kids in the family.. there are some interesting exhibits but not great for older ones..",
          "this place is good, but I expected more. there are a lot of things to see and experience, but I liked to see more big fishes, I think this place needs some changes, It lacks some new features, like big halls of aquariums that you can see different types of fish together, a theme",
          "One of the marks in Dubai that no one should miss!! amazing and unforgetable!! you will never regret it and you will take as much amazing photos as u can...",
          "Aquarium in Dubai mall.. excites the kids for like 5 mins, mostly visible from outside as well (in the mall, without buying tickets)..Long queues, tickets..., not worth it :(",
          "We got free passes from our hotel, which was located right beside the mall, and we had a spare hour, so we dropped by. I\u2019ve been to some really impressive aquariums. This is not one of those, but for a mall attraction, it\u2019s pretty good. They have a decent number of critters ad",
          "L liked the marine world with the amazing views and nice aquarium. I recommend to try the experience, you won\u2019t regreat.",

          "A must visit in Dubai Mall. Kids would absolutely love this place. My kids loved the Underwater tunnel, exhibits and the small zoo. they were specially thrilled to see King Croc, 40-year-old huge australian saltwater crocodile measuring over 5 meter in length. A great place to",
          "We visited the Atlantis underwater zoo which was amazing. The fishes were beautiful and colourful. If you pay extra and were brave enough, you could actually go and swim with the fish which looked incredible! There were also plenty of designer shops, boutiques and fast food",
          "A must visit! a calming and interesting atmosphere it\u2019s a great time to have a rest from all that shopping!",
          "I have been there two weeks ago. The tour started from an underwater tunnel over which sharks and different fish pass over, then we went to an area where sharks were grown and fed. We went on a bottom glass boat around the area and after wards we went to see the zoo. The huge",

          "This was ok I do feel it is wayyyy over priced! We were in and out in a hour. And that was us being sick in there because they had let to many people in so we were made to stay in one part for 10 minutes starting at each other. Not a good experience. We did get some great",
          "But sadly quite a short tunnel trip from inside. Almost makes you wishctocjust gaze at it from outside without needing to spend for the short trip inside. On the plus side, it comes with underwater zoo i think it is called, which is a good introduction of basic sea life",
          "We pre bought the explorer package 2 days online before visiting. Worth looking around for tickets. The Aquarium is located in dubai mall. Please make sure you take a print out of your tickets. We explored the tunnel, a boat took us on top of the tank were we could see all",
          "The Aquarium is a real attraction, and very impressive size of a tank. But it\u2019s difficult to navigate with young children when you have to come in and out across the floors. Also it was extremely busy at all times meaning young children get pushed/knocked and viewing wasn\u2019t",

          "Fantastic location in Dubai Mall. Lovely little tunnel under the main aquarium (most if which can be seen without paying from the shopping centre). Is not the largest but defiantly worth a visit.",
          "Good but nothing special to see, only one tunel with fish! Poor fish in this aquarium, is better to leave them to live in nature.",
          "Fun expereince with the family. We did the Ray feeding activty which was quite interesting. They have you wear long fishing boots/suit and walk in the water to hand feed the rays. It's fun, but found it a bit expensive.",
          "We have seen this before but still marvel at how professional the whole set up is. The fish look contented and appear to be well cared for and fed. Worth the visit.",
          "We\u2019ve been here in October and it was a fantastic experience! All the species were beautiful to the sight and I loved Jellyfishes!

          "Its a wonderful place to visit, they have close to 22000 fishes and 85 species. The guides are very informative, and you can see almost every fish up and close. Children and adults will enjoy it alike. A must visit if you are in Dubai. Take time to explore the place keeping",
          "The Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo markets itself as a giant aquarium coming with all the superlatives that go with it. In reality, it is a rather disappointing experience. The giant aquarium is of course no small tank but it is out in the open of the mall. Why put your",
          "Im really sorry but didnt like it. Nothing special london aquarium far superior. Overcrowded and was too complicated process for entrance. We had bought the tickes in advance thinking we wouldnt have to que. Not only did we have to que but que 3 times. We had to show our ticket",
          "Luckily got a 2 for 1 offer on an explorer ticket as this place knows how to charge. It is informative and a good aquarium to spend a couple of hours at. Would recommend",
          "It is a very popular aquarium in Dubai. With a lot of tourists. The underwater zoo part is really nice and is surrounded by plants and makes you feel you are in a rainforest. The part that I did not like was the aquarium. It was a only one big container with fish in it, that you",

          "We visited this in October as a family.Our toddler, 3years old loved every moment of it.She was amazed at the sea creatures most of which she saw for the first time in her life. A definite must. It is very big since the while aquarium occupies about 3 to 4 floors.",
          "We went there with some friends and we all loved it. There are many extra activities you can do, like feeding the mantas and sharks which is amazing... The prices are affordable since you can spend two or three hours to see everything...",
          "It was amazing seeing this kind of place in the Dubai Mall! The Underwater Zoo was really neat as you see animals you\u2019ve never seen before. A worthwhile visit!",
          "My partner and I visited this Aquarium and Underwater Zoo after not doing it on our last visit too Dubai. It\u2019s actually a lot bigger than it seems and quite impressive with a lot of sea and land creatures to be seen. Well worth doing",
          "Not many malls can boast a world-class aquarium! I only wish we had been better informed. The first part is basically a short tunnel walk underneath the large aquarium tank. I wish we had not rushed it, but we were expecting more of the same. But you literally just walk from one",

          "How is this inside a mall? unbelievable. If your at the mall you might as well go. The Tunnel and Croc are the best bits.",

          "A part of the aquarium can also be viewed from the shopping mall without buying a ticket. With a ticket you can walk through the tunnel and you can go to the underwater zoo. It\u2019s really worth a visit. Beautiful water animals.",
          "Nice attraction with a varieties of fishes including a number of Sharks. You can view the aquarium from the mall . Not worth paying the 60 USD to go inside",
          "for about $50 each you will be entitled to sit in a boat on top of the aquarium and go inside to feed the fish but that's it. If you pay extra you can put on a diving suit and swim inside, now that's awesome. But if you only want to see the fishes and you check-out the aquarium",

          "It is different feelings when you walk through the aquarium sensing the life in the sea with all different kind of aquatic organisms, truly new experience for everyone. I recommend a long visit to this place and picture taking.",
          "A must do in Dubai (especially ad it isindoors and air conditioned). Well presented and easy to navigate way around. Great displays!",
          "You MUST go into the aquarium; don't just check it out from the outside. What an amazing place and fantastic experience. I too the cheaper option of the many available as I only had about an hour to spare. Totally awsome mix of critters.",
          "It is quite expensive but it is very interesting especially for the young children .it is very informative.",
          "Amazingly good aquarium considering it is located in the center of a shopping mall. Beautiful fish. Very healthy looking clean clear tanks.",

          "I visited Dubai in the month of February and it is worth a place to visit, and, personly recommended if anyone visits Dubai they must visit this place. They well preserved the fish and it is really different experience to see them very close. I never had such kind of experience",
          "Second visit after the first 7 years back. Good learning place for kids. Bit pricy, but cant complain being part of Dubai mall. Explorer package is worth the money.",
          "The aquarium is within the Dubai Mall and is worth visiting once. The experience was good but best if taken along with access to the underwater zoo. Good to spend atleast one hour inside. Pretty good collection of different fish species inside the underwater zoo and the walk",
          "we bought the hop on/off bus ticket and it came with free entry into the aquarium and we really enjoyed it, its quite big with walk though tunnel filled with loads of fish and sharks and again loads of tanks filled with fish including 2 large salt water crocs",
          "The aquarium itself it is not enough. But if it is combined with the underwater zoo then it is great thing to do in Dubai.",
          "I was excited for the aquarium. It was pretty cool, but I will say that it wasn't anything that I haven't seen in the US. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it was a decent experience. My family got in for free because of our City Sightseeing Dubai Bus Tour pass, so I was",
          "It's a beautiful experience, but definitely something I think kids would enjoy more than older youth or adults. It took about 30 minutes to walk through the entire thing including taking pictures and stuff. So while it was great, it's nothing more advanced than any other",
          "The aquarium is located in the Dubai Mall- as I\u2019ve said before the Mall has plenty of attractions. We chose the Dubai explorer pass as that was the option available on the entertainer app- definitely worth it- gives you entry to the aquarium tunnel (really beautiful- go",

          "Located at the Dubai Mall this aquarium features one of the largest fish tanks in the world and is truly impressive. it is actually a bit overcrowded with different species, but nevertheless great to look at. like a window into an ocean",
          "Really interactive and lots of different species which you can get pretty close to so great pics! Would recommend the \u2018behind the scenes tour\u2019 this was worth the bit extra admission. My 14 and 21 year old even enjoyed it \ud83d\ude01",
          "Average acquaruim.... Plz avoid if you are planned for atlantis hotel \"the lost chamber\" acquaruim.... Atlantis acquaruim is far more better bigger one than dubai mall Dubai mall just i liked salt water crocodile",

          "The visit to this place was not bad. My kid loved it. However I feel the tickets were expensive. The aquarium was only a tunnel. The zoo was good where you can spend more time.",
          "Very disappointed with the aquarium. -_- Tunnel is cute but not as impressive as you could think from the pictures. The underwater zoo is so disappointing. Have visited much more interesting aquarium in smaller cities",
          "You can see lot of beautiful fish and dangerous fish at Dubai Aquarium and underwater zoo . Need 20 Minutes to complete .",
          "I had seen aquarium of other countries, hence it didn't attract me.. Underwater zoo was good.. No need to buy tickets for Dubai Aquarium as most of the part is open and can be seen from Dubai mall, however if u r interested in diving with sharks etc, then it is worth to for",
          "A good experience to try with kids, you can visit this place with your kids, they can see lot of fishes in this massive aquarium, unique experience must try.",
          "One can view one side of aquarium from outside also. But going into tunnel gives unique experience . Further underwater zoo in combination with aquarium gives very good experience.",
          "Great location, lots to see and to go. Affordable and is a great family adventure. I enjoyed it very much",
          "Yes, it was good. We paid a bit extra for the boat ride and prices were not too bad although you can get a fair idea of what to expect from the Mall without paying. Bottom line is these fish and mammals should be free and I don't think the attempted justification with",
          "In one floor, this place has the tunnel in which we can go inside and have a view of surrounding fishes of different type. As we had already seen similar one in The Palm, this wasn't too exciting. Two levels above, they have different types of mammals which was a good",

          "This place just grabs your attention as soon as you walk into the Dubai Mall. It's definitely one of the best Aquariums you'll ever see in your life. There are just so many species big and small to be amazed at. Worth a visit.",
          "Defo worth doing while at the Mall. get the ticket which gives you a behind the scenes view of the operation. kids and adults alike will love it",
          "Not at all worth the money you spend to see the fishes in the tunnel which you can easily see free of cost from outside. A complete let down",
          "This is very nice place to visit everyone who is in Dubai go there ,highly recommend Dubai aquarium good",
          "It was my first time to experience the aquarium and the underwater zoo, it was great. Variety of species that I never knew existed. It was fun to watch them up close and was nice. If you\u2019re a fish lover you\u2019ll admire the whole experience.",
          "This Aquarium is filled with so many exotic species of marine life and so beautifully constructed too. It is a must see when you visit Dubai. You feel as if you are right in the middle of the ocean when you walk through the tunnel.",
          "Any one of my family visit Dubai the first thing on the list will be Dubai Aquarium. It's really a must to see place for every visitor and better to buy the tickets online.",
          "The experience was good, however the zoo elements felt a bit contrived as lovely to see animals and they looked well cared for but . . . Enclosures were small and obviously no actual daylight. Not sure about this one being an animal lover.",
          "It was a great option for the weekend and the tunnel is the best part! Really recommend the visit, specially for families with kids, they will love it!",
          "Firstly i would say, it is something you can visit, but the cost i paid was 7000 rs for two people, which i did not find worth If you are not a fauna lover you might get bored At the same cost, there are a lot many attractions in Dubai, or the best thing is do some shopping",
          "We did the explorer experience. It was worth the entry fee more than the lost chambers at Atlantis. Lots to see",
          "Staff will not tell you that you have to go to second floor to go and view the rest of the attraction. If I had to pay for this I would have demanded a refund. Mr Hafeez was not helpful and I hope he gets recognition for his poor customer service skills. We only saw half of the",
          "The aquarium is worth a visit set in the Dubai Mall . Hosts a variety of rare fish and sharks. It is possible to enter the aquarium inside a cage that lowers you inside the aquarium to get closer to the fish . Well worth a visit when shopping or eating at the Mall",
          "We mainly visited the waterpark to swim with the dolphins- which was an experience of a lifetime. Staff were well trained and very helpful and friendly. We spent the rest of the day at the water park. Great facilities, really enjoyed the lazy river.",
          "The adventure starts when we saw shark and stingray. When you enter the feeling is so awesome how the fishes dive around. The Dubai aquarium zoo is very attractive. So many other reptiles are also there to see. And in one place you can see the whole \u201cfinding nemo\u201d family. Mine",
          "Surprising find in the middle of a mall, but totally worth visiting. Staff super friendly and informative.",

          "One of a kind experience at the aquarium. There is a lot to see and learn from. The best part of the place is the feeding session. One can also choose and opt for underwater diving in the aquarium (which is situated within a the Dubai \u201cmall\u201d)When in Dubai please make sometime",
          "We went here on the first stint of our honeymoon tour, when I managed to drag my new wife away from the designer shops in the mall for just a short moment! Fantastic experience all round, I have to say I was very impressed. The famous tunnel surrounded by all kinds of sea",

          "Two different places in Dubai Mall: An overpriced aquarium - not that big - a walk through one tunnel under the tank. Was amazing to see the underwater creatures, especially sharks, so close to you but you can see most of the Aquarium prior your entrance...so no need to pay.",
          "We had high expectations but this attraction was definitely an oversell. Crowded and not as large as had been expected. And VERY expensive. And don't buy the photos taken at the entrance. Too expensive for what you get.",

          "An aquarium in a shopping mall..I wasn\u2019t expecting much, but this is Dubai! Fantastic collection of aquatic life with some really large sharks and rays! Great opportunity to view them even if you don\u2019t buy a ticket but you will miss the tunnel and zoo if you don\u2019t. Well worth",
          "Overpriced for what it was .... I was looking forward to viewing what I thought was an amazing Aquarium but was really disappointed. You can see most of what you need to from the shopping centre without the hefty price tag.",

          "A nice feature in the mall and something a little different you don\u2019t get to see in a conventional mall. It has some amazing features and activities to do, only gripe I would say it is a little over priced in our mind for what it is.",
          "Has to be seen to be believed. An absolutely amazing experience. However, I personally felt the view of the aquarium from the outside to be far more beautiful than what awaits you on the inside. The underwater zoo inside I felt was the better attraction.",
          "I have heard from people coming out. To pay 50-60 usd. Is frikkin crazy for a walk through a giant fish tank. Yes impressive but you can see lots from the outside. Too much for me",

          "We paid around \u00a345 each to go inside and visit. It was good but you get a pretty good look outside in the mall. You do go into a part where you see more and you see where they feed the fish. There is also a area you walk through with crocs and turtles etc. \u00a345 is a little steep",

          "The Aquarium provides a huge underwater tunnel which allows you spectacular views on several different kind of sharks, mantas and coral fish. The underwater zoo includes huge saltwater crocodiles (one of them 80 years old and I guess about 20 feet long) and dozens of other",
          "Currentmy there is a 25% discount for mastercard holders, but only if you purchase on line. The first part is going through a tunnel where the views are no better than those outside from the mall side which is free anyway. This first part seems like a prep for a digital photo",

          "Worth a visit to see so many amazing fish. Was amazing to see them so close and my 11 month old loved it.",
          "It is wonderful place where you can have fun and see and learn new things about sea life , we love it soooo much also see a very big big big alligator is wonderful , many animals there I am sure the old and young will fall in love with that place",
          "Good aquarium, takes about one and half hours to get round. The usual animals that you find in an aquarium, the underwater zoo is lovely. The king croc is just mind blowing, he is HUGE! Can feel a bit squashed when very busy. Definitely one for the list \u2018to do\u2019 in Dubai.",
          "What an unbelievable place to find in the middle of the mall! So many sharks and fish to look at. A surprise in the middle of the dessert!",
          "The price was relatively high considering the short time we spent here. I think it\u2019s probably better value for kids than adults. But we still had a good time and got some great photos.",
          "Access via the Dubai Mall. Underwater Zoo was very good, with more than fish. Aquarium, entry into tunnel only. Very disappointing. The Aquarium can been seen as you use the Mall. Other areas of the Aquarium at an additional charge.",
          "This is a must see. While enjoying the massive shopping mall, go into the aquarium and lose yourself to nature in this human created megapolis in the desert. It's very well done with really good collections of fish and so on. Recommended.",
          "Too expensive to go in.... but a good view for free in the shopping mall. Even saw someone in a diving suit in there",
          "We didn't go into the aquarium but we had a view of it from the cheesecake factory inside the Dubai mall, so it was a beautiful view whilst dining.",
          "We booked At the top and aquarium tickets together. The walk through the aquarium and underwater zoo was great experience, and had a various fish and other things to look at. Not a long stay but definitely worth while doing, and seeing the large alligator!",
          "amazing place to view the marina animals in dubai mall, in dubai have other place in atlantis the palm in lost chamber but like a tunnel is best option to view in dubai mall."

        "wiki": "The Burj Khalifa (Arabic: \u0628\u0631\u062c \u062e\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0629\u200e, Arabic pronunciation: [b\u028ard\u0361\u0292 xa\u02c8li\u02d0fa]; pronounced English: ), known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration in 2010, is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 244 m spire) of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its topping out in 2009.Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It is designed to be the centrepiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building is based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building was originally named Burj Dubai but was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest building in the world.\nBurj Khalifa was designed by Adrian Smith, of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, whose firm designed the Willis Tower and One World Trade Center. Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj Khalifa's central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs within each of the wings. The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.\nAt a certain point in the architectural and engineering process, the original Emaar developers ran into financial issues, and required more money and economic funding. Sheikh Khalifa, the ruler of the United Arab Emirates, granted monetary aid and funding, hence resulting in the changing of the name to \"Burj Khalifa\". The concept of profitability derived from building high density developments and malls around the landmark have proven successful. Its surrounding malls, hotels and condominiums in Downtown Dubai have generated the most revenue from the project as a whole, while the Burj Khalifa itself made little or no profit.Critical reception to Burj Khalifa has been generally positive, and the building has received many awards. There were complaints concerning migrant workers from South Asia who were the primary building labor force. These centered on low wages and the practice of confiscating passports until duties were complete. Several suicides were reported.\n\n\n== Development ==\nConstruction began on 6 January 2004, with the exterior of the structure completed on 1 October 2009. The building officially opened on 4 January 2010 and is part of the 2 km2 (490-acre) Downtown Dubai development at the 'First Interchange' along Sheikh Zayed Road, near Dubai's main business district. The tower's architecture and engineering were performed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill of Chicago, with Adrian Smith as chief architect, and Bill Baker as chief structural engineer. The primary contractor was Samsung C&T of South Korea.\n\n\n== Conception ==\nBurj Khalifa was designed to be the centerpiece of a large-scale, mixed-use development to include 30,000 homes, nine hotels (including The Address Downtown Dubai), 3 hectares (7.4 acres) of parkland, at least 19 residential skyscrapers, the Dubai Mall, and the 12-hectare (30-acre) artificial Burj Khalifa Lake. The decision to build Burj Khalifa was reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy to one that is service and tourism based. According to officials, it was necessary for projects like Burj Khalifa to be built in order to garner more international recognition, and hence investment. \"He (Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum) wanted to put Dubai on the map with something really sensational,\" said Jacqui Josephson, a tourism and VIP delegations executive at Nakheel Properties. The tower was known as Burj Dubai (\"Dubai Tower\") until its official opening in January 2010. It was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Abu Dhabi and the federal government of UAE lent Dubai tens of billions of US dollars so that Dubai could pay its debts \u2013 Dubai borrowed at least $80 billion for construction projects. In the 2000s, Dubai started diversifying its economy but it suffered from an economic crisis in 2007\u20132010, leaving large-scale projects already in construction abandoned.\n\n\n=== Records ===\nThe Burj Khalifa set several world records, including:\n\nTallest existing structure: 829.8 m (2,722 ft) (previously KVLY-TV mast \u2013 628.8 m or 2,063 ft)\nTallest structure ever built: 829.8 m (2,722 ft) (previously Warsaw radio mast \u2013 646.38 m or 2,121 ft)\nTallest freestanding structure: 829.8 m (2,722 ft) (previously CN Tower \u2013 553.3 m or 1,815 ft)\nTallest skyscraper (to top of spire): 828 m (2,717 ft) (previously Taipei 101 \u2013 509.2 m or 1,671 ft)\nTallest skyscraper to top of antenna: 829.8 m (2,722 ft) (previously the Willis (formerly Sears) Tower \u2013 527 m or 1,729 ft)\nBuilding with most floors: 163 (previously World Trade Center \u2013 110)\nWorld's highest elevator installation (situated inside a rod at the very top of the building)\nWorld's longest travel distance elevators: 504 m (1,654 ft)\nHighest vertical concrete pumping (for a building): 606 m (1,988 ft)\nWorld's tallest structure that includes residential space\nWorld's highest installation of an aluminium and glass fa\u00e7ade: 512 m (1,680 ft)\nWorld's highest nightclub: 144th floor\nWorld's highest restaurant (At.mosphere): 122nd floor at 442 m (1,450 ft) (previously 360, at a height of 350 m (1,148 ft) in CN Tower)\nWorld's highest New Year display of fireworks.\nWorld's largest light and sound show staged on a single building.\n\n\n=== History of height increases ===\n\nThere are unconfirmed reports of several planned height increases since its inception. Originally proposed as a virtual clone of the 560 m (1,837 ft) Grollo Tower proposal for Melbourne, Australia's Docklands waterfront development, the tower was redesigned by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. Marshall Strabala, a Skidmore, Owings and Merrill architect who worked on the project until 2006, said in late 2008 that Burj Khalifa was designed to be 808 m (2,651 ft) tall.The architect who designed it, Adrian Smith, felt that the uppermost section of the building did not culminate elegantly with the rest of the structure, so he sought and received approval to increase its height. It was stated that this change did not add any floors, which fit with Smith's attempts to make the crown more slender. The building opened on 4 January 2010.\n\n\n== Architecture and design ==\n\nThe tower was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), which also designed the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) in Chicago and the One World Trade Center in New York City. Burj Khalifa uses the bundled tube design of the Willis Tower, invented by Fazlur Rahman Khan. Due to its tubular system, proportionally only half the amount of steel was used in the construction, compared to the Empire State Building. Khan's contributions to the design of tall buildings have had a profound impact on architecture and engineering. It would be difficult to find any worldwide practices in the design of tall buildings that have not been directly or indirectly influenced by his work. The design is reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright's vision for The Illinois, a mile-high skyscraper designed for Chicago, as well as Chicago's Lake Point Tower. When Adrian Smith was conceiving the project at SOM, he looked out his office window toward Lake Point Tower's curved three wing layout, \"There's the prototype\", he said. According to Strabala, Burj Khalifa was designed based on the 73 floor Tower Palace Three, an all-residential building in Seoul. In its early planning, Burj Khalifa was intended to be entirely residential.Subsequent to the original design by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Emaar Properties chose Hyder Consulting to be the supervising engineer and NORR Group Consultants International Ltd to supervise the architecture of the project. Hyder was selected for their expertise in structural and MEP (mechanical, electrical and plumbing) engineering. Hyder Consulting's role was to supervise construction, certify the architect's design, and be the engineer and architect of record to the UAE authorities. NORR's role was the supervision of all architectural components including on-site supervision during construction and design of a 6-story addition to the office annex building for architectural documentation. NORR was also responsible for the architectural integration drawings for the Armani Hotel included in the Tower. Emaar Properties also engaged GHD, an international multidisciplinary consulting firm, to act as an independent verification and testing authority for concrete and steelwork.\nThe design is derived from Islamic architecture. As the tower rises from the flat desert base, there are 27 setbacks in a spiral pattern, decreasing the cross section of the tower as going upward and creating convenient outdoor terraces. These setbacks are arranged and aligned in a way that minimizes vibration wind loading from eddy currents and vortices. At the top, the central core emerges and is sculpted to form a finishing spire.  At its tallest point, the tower sways a total of 1.5 m (4.9 ft).\n\nThe spire of Burj Khalifa is composed of more than 4,000 tonnes (4,400 short tons; 3,900 long tons) of structural steel. The central pinnacle pipe weighs 350 tonnes (390 short tons; 340 long tons) and has a height of 200 m (660 ft). The spire also houses communications equipment. This 244-metre spire is widely considered vanity height, since very little of its space is usable. Without the spire, Burj Khalifa would be 585 meters tall. This was reported in a Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat study, which notes that the empty spire \"could be a skyscraper on its own\". Such a skyscraper, if located in Europe, would be the 11th tallest building on that continent.In 2009, architects announced that more than 1,000 pieces of art would adorn the interiors of Burj Khalifa, while the residential lobby of Burj Khalifa would display the work of Jaume Plensa.The cladding system consists of 142,000 m2 (1,528,000 sq ft) of more than 26,000 reflective glass panels and aluminium and textured stainless steel spandrel panels with vertical tubular fins. The architectural glass provides solar and thermal performance as well as an anti-glare shield for the intense desert sun, extreme desert temperatures and strong winds. The glass covers more than 174,000 m2 (1,870,000 sq ft) in area. The Burj's typical curtain wall panels measure 4'6\" wide by 10'8\" high and weigh about 800 pounds each, with wider panels near the buildings edges and taller ones near the top.The exterior temperature at the top of the building is thought to be 6 \u00b0C (11 \u00b0F) cooler than at its base.A 304-room Armani Hotel, the first of four by Armani, occupies 15 of the lower 39 floors. The hotel was supposed to open on 18 March 2010, but after several delays, it finally opened to the public on 27 April 2010. The corporate suites and offices were also supposed to open from March onwards, yet the hotel and observation deck remained the only parts of the building which were open in April 2010.\nThe sky lobbies on the 43rd and 76th floors house swimming pools. Floors through to 108 have 900 private residential apartments (which, according to the developer, sold out within eight hours of being on the market). An outdoor zero-entry swimming pool is located on the 76th floor of the tower. Corporate offices and suites fill most of the remaining floors, except for the 122nd, 123rd and 124th, where the At.mosphere restaurant, sky lobby and an indoor and outdoor observation deck are located respectively. In January 2010, it was planned that Burj Khalifa would receive its first residents from February 2010.The building has 57 elevators and 8 escalators. The elevators have a capacity of 12 to 14 people per cabin, the fastest rising and descending at up to 10 m/s (33 ft/s) for double-deck elevators. However, the world's fastest single-deck elevator still belongs to Taipei 101 at 16.83 m/s (55.2 ft/s). Engineers had considered installing the world's first triple-deck elevators, but the final design called for double-deck elevators. The double-deck elevators are equipped with entertainment features such as LCD displays to serve visitors during their travel to the observation deck. The building has 2,909 stairs from the ground floor to the 160th floor.\n\n\n=== Plumbing systems ===\nThe Burj Khalifa's water system supplies an average of 946,000 L (250,000 U.S. gal) of water per day through 100 km (62 mi) of pipes.  An additional 213 km (132 mi) of piping serves the fire emergency system, and 34 km (21 mi) supplies chilled water for the air conditioning system. The waste water system uses gravity to discharge water from plumbing fixtures, floor drains, mechanical equipment and storm water, to the city municipal sewer.\n\n\n=== Air conditioning ===\nThe air conditioning system draws air from the upper floors where the air is cooler and cleaner than on the ground. At peak cooling times, the tower's cooling is 46 MW (62,000 hp), equivalent to that provided by 13,000 short tons (26,000,000 lb; 12,000,000 kg) of melting ice in one day. Water is collected via a condensate collection system and is used to irrigate the nearby park.\n\n\n=== Window cleaning ===\nTo wash the 24,348 windows, totaling 120,000 m2 (1,290,000 sq ft) of glass, the building has three horizontal tracks which each holding a 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) bucket machine. Above level 109, and up to tier 27, traditional cradles from davits are used. The top of the building is cleaned by a crew that uses ropes to descend from the top to gain access. Under normal conditions, when all building maintenance units are operational, it takes 36 workers three to four months to clean the entire exterior.Unmanned machines clean the top 27 additional tiers and the glass spire. The cleaning system was developed in Melbourne, Australia, by CoxGomyl, a manufacturer of building maintenance units, at a cost of A$8 million.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n=== The Dubai Fountain ===\n\nOutside, WET Enterprises designed a fountain system at a cost of Dh 800 million (US$217 million). Illuminated by 6,600 lights and 50 coloured projectors, it is 270 m (900 ft) long and shoots water 150 m (500 ft) into the air, accompanied by a range of classical to contemporary Arabic and other music. It is the world's second largest choreographed fountain. On 26 October 2008, Emaar announced that based on results of a naming contest the fountain would be called the Dubai Fountain.\n\n\n=== Observation deck ===\n\nAn outdoor observation deck, named At the Top, opened on 5 January 2010 on the 124th floor. At 452 m (1,483 ft), it was the highest outdoor observation deck in the world when it opened. Although it was surpassed in December 2011 by Cloud Top 488 on the Canton Tower, Guangzhou at 488 m (1,601 ft), Burj Khalifa opened the 148th floor SKY level at 555 m (1,821 ft), once again giving it the highest observation deck in the world on 15 October 2014, until the Shanghai Tower opened in June 2016 with an observation deck at a height of 561 metres. The 124th floor observation deck also features the electronic telescope, an augmented reality device developed by Gsmprjct\u00b0 of Montr\u00e9al, which allows visitors to view the surrounding landscape in real-time, and to view previously saved images such as those taken at different times of day or under different weather conditions. To reduce the daily rush of sightseers, management allows visitors to purchase tickets in advance for a specific date and time, at a 75% discount on tickets purchased on the spot. Tickets start at 135 AED, or US$36.75.\nOn 8 February 2010, the observation deck was closed to the public for two months after power-supply problems caused an elevator to become stuck between floors, trapping a group of tourists for 45 minutes. When the tide is low and visibility is high, people can see the shores of Iran from the top of the skyscraper.\n\n\n=== Burj Khalifa park ===\nBurj Khalifa is surrounded by an 11 ha (27-acre) park designed by landscape architects SWA Group. Like the tower, the park's design was based on the flower of the Hymenocallis, a desert plant. At the centre of the park is the water room, which is a series of pools and water jet fountains. Benches and signs incorporate images of Burj Khalifa and the Hymenocallis flower.The plants are watered by water collected from the building's cooling system. The system provides 68,000,000 L (15,000,000 imp gal) annually. WET Enterprises, who also developed the Dubai Fountain, developed the park's six water features.\n\n\n=== Floor plans ===\n\n\n=== Ramadan observance ===\nOn the higher floors, the sun can still be seen for several minutes after it has set at ground level. This has led Dubai clerics to rule that those living above the 80th floor should wait 2 additional minutes to break their Ramadan fast, and those living above the 150th floor, 3 minutes.\n\n\n== Construction and structure ==\n\nThe tower was constructed by Samsung C&T from South Korea, which also did work on the Petronas Twin Towers and Taipei 101. Samsung C&T built the tower in a joint venture with BESIX from Belgium and Arabtec from the UAE. Turner was the project manager on the main construction contract. Hong Kong-based Far East Aluminum combined to provide the exterior cladding for Burj Khalifa.The contractor and the engineer of record was Hyder Consulting. Under UAE law, the contractor and the engineer of record is jointly and severally liable for the performance of Burj Khalifa.\nThe primary structure is reinforced concrete. Putzmeister created a new, super high-pressure trailer concrete pump, the BSA 14000 SHP-D, for this project. Burj Khalifa's construction used 330,000 m3 (431,600 cu yd) of concrete and 55,000 tonnes (61,000 short tons; 54,000 long tons) of steel rebar, and construction took 22 million man-hours. In May 2008 Putzmeister pumped concrete with more than 21 MPA ultimate compressive strength of gravel to surpass the 600 meters weight of the effective area of each column from the foundation to the next fourth level, and the rest was by metal columns jacketed or covered with concrete to a then world record delivery height of 606 m (1,988 ft), the 156th floor. Three tower cranes were used during construction of the uppermost levels, each capable of lifting a 25-tonne load. The remaining structure above was constructed of lighter steel.\nIn 2003, 33 test holes were drilled to study the strength of the bedrock underlying the structure. \"Weak to very weak sandstone and siltstone\" was found, just metres below the surface. Samples were taken from test holes drilled to a depth of 140 metres, finding weak to very weak rock all the way. The study described the site as part of a \"seismically active area\". Another challenging element was the shamal which often creates sandstorms.Over 45,000 m3 (58,900 cu yd) of concrete, weighing more than 110,000 tonnes (120,000 short tons; 110,000 long tons) were used to construct the concrete and steel foundation, which features 192 piles; each pile is 1.5 metre in diameter by 43 m in length, buried more than 50 m (164 ft) deep. The foundation was designed to support the total building weight of approximately 450,000 tonnes (500,000 short tons; 440,000 long tons). This weight was then divided by the compressive strength of concrete of which is 30 MPa which yielded a 450 sq.meters of vertical normal effective area, which then yielded to a 12 meters by 12 meters dimensions. A cathodic protection system is under the concrete to neutralize the sulphate and chloride-rich groundwater and prevent corrosion.The Burj Khalifa is highly compartmentalised. Pressurized, air-conditioned refuge floors are located every 13 floors (in floors G, 13, 26, 39, 52 etc.) where people can shelter on their long walk down to safety in case of an emergency or fire.Special mixes of concrete were made to withstand the extreme pressures of the massive building weight; as is typical with reinforced concrete construction, each batch of concrete was tested to ensure it could withstand certain pressures. CTLGroup, working for Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, conducted the creep and shrinkage testing critical for the structural analysis of the building.The consistency of the concrete used in the project was essential. It was difficult to create a concrete that could withstand both the thousands of tonnes bearing down on it and Persian Gulf temperatures that can reach 50 \u00b0C (122 \u00b0F). To combat this problem, the concrete was not poured during the day. Instead, during the summer months, ice was added to the mixture and it was poured at night when the air was cooler and the humidity was higher. Cooler concrete cures more evenly and is therefore less likely to set too quickly and crack. Any significant cracks could have put the entire project in jeopardy.\n\n\n=== Milestones ===\n\nJanuary 2004: Excavation commences.\nFebruary 2004: Piling starts.\n21 September 2004: Emaar contractors begin construction.\nMarch 2005: Structure of Burj Khalifa starts rising.\nJune 2006: Level 50 is reached.\nFebruary 2007: Surpasses the Sears Tower as the building with the most floors.\n13 May 2007: Sets record for vertical concrete pumping on any building at 452 m (1,483 ft), surpassing the 449.2 m (1,474 ft) to which concrete was pumped during the construction of Taipei 101, while Burj Khalifa reached the 130th floor.\n21 July 2007: Surpasses Taipei 101, whose height of 509.2 m (1,671 ft) made it the world's tallest building, and level 141 reached.\n12 August 2007: Surpasses the Sears Tower antenna, which stands 527 m (1,729 ft).\n12 September 2007: At 555.3 m (1,822 ft), becomes the world's tallest freestanding structure, surpassing the CN Tower in Toronto, and level 150 reached.\n7 April 2008: At 629 m (2,064 ft), surpasses the KVLY-TV Mast to become the tallest man-made structure, level 160 reached.\n17 June 2008: Emaar announces that Burj Khalifa's height is over 636 m (2,087 ft) and that its final height will not be given until it is completed in September 2009.\n1 September 2008: Height tops 688 m (2,257 ft), making it the tallest man-made structure ever built, surpassing the previous record-holder, the Warsaw Radio Mast in Konstantyn\u00f3w, Poland.\n17 January 2009: Topped out at 829.8 m (2,722 ft).\n1 October 2009: Emaar announces that the exterior of the building is completed.\n4 January 2010: Burj Khalifa's official launch ceremony is held and Burj Khalifa is opened. Burj Dubai renamed Burj Khalifa in honour of the President of the UAE and ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan.\n10 March 2010: Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat certifies Burj Khalifa as world's tallest building.\n\n\n=== Real estate values ===\nIn March 2009, Mohamed Ali Alabbar, chairman of the project's developer, Emaar Properties, said office space pricing at Burj Khalifa reached US$4,000 per sq ft (over US$43,000 per m\u00b2) and the Armani Residences, also in Burj Khalifa, sold for US$3,500 per sq ft (over US$37,500 per m\u00b2). He estimated the total cost for the project to be about US$1.5 billion.The project's completion coincided with the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, and with vast overbuilding in the country, leading to high vacancies and foreclosures. With Dubai mired in debt from its huge ambitions, the government was forced to seek multibillion dollar bailouts from its oil-rich neighbor Abu Dhabi. Subsequently, in a surprise move at its opening ceremony, the tower was renamed Burj Khalifa, said to honour the UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan for his crucial support.Because of the slumping demand in Dubai's property market, the rents in the Burj Khalifa plummeted 40% some ten months after its opening. Out of 900 apartments in the tower, 825 were still empty at that time. However, over the next two and a half years, overseas investors steadily began to purchase the available apartments and office space. By October 2012, Emaar reported that around 80% of the apartments were occupied.\n\n\n=== Official launch ceremony ===\n\nThe ceremony was broadcast live on a giant screen on Burj Park Island and on smaller screens elsewhere. Hundreds of media outlets from around the world reported live from the scene. In addition to the media presence, 6,000 guests were expected.The opening was held on 4 January 2010. The ceremony featured a display of 10,000 fireworks, light beams projected on and around the tower, and further sound, light and water effects. The celebratory lighting was designed by UK lighting designers Speirs and Major Associates. Using the 868 powerful stroboscope lights that are integrated into the fa\u00e7ade and spire of the tower, different lighting sequences were choreographed, together with more than 50 different combinations of other effects.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\n\n\n=== Fatalities ===\nWithin 17 months of the building's official opening, a man described as \"an Asian in his mid-30s\" who worked at one of the companies in the tower, died by suicide on 10 May 2011 by jumping from the 147th floor. He fell 39 floors, landing on a deck on the 108th floor. Dubai police confirmed the act as a suicide, reporting that \"[they] also came to know that the man decided to commit suicide as his company refused to grant leave.\"The Daily Mail reported that on 16 November 2014, a Portuguese national who was in Dubai on a tourist visa, fell to her death from Burj Khalifa's \"At the Top\" observation deck on the 148th floor. However, on 18 May 2015, Dubai police disputed the report made by the Daily Mail on this incident and said that this incident took place in Jumeirah Lakes Towers. A Dubai coroner's report stated her body was found on the third floor of the Burj Khalifa. Emails obtained under the Freedom of Information act from Portugal's embassy in the UAE also confirmed that she had committed suicide from the 148th floor of the Burj Khalifa.\n\n\n=== Labour controversy ===\n\nThe Burj Khalifa was built primarily by workers from South Asia and East Asia. This is generally because the current generation of UAE locals prefer governmental jobs and do not have an attitude favouring private sector employment. On 17 June 2008, there were about 7,500 skilled workers employed at the construction site. Press reports indicated in 2006 that skilled carpenters at the site earned \u00a34.34 a day, and labourers earned \u00a32.84. According to a BBC investigation and a Human Rights Watch report, the workers were housed in abysmal conditions, and worked long hours for low pay. During construction, only one construction-related death was reported. However, workplace injuries and fatalities in the UAE are \"poorly documented\", according to Human Rights Watch.On 21 March 2006, about 2,500 workers, upset over buses that were delayed for the end of their shifts, protested and triggered a riot, damaging cars, offices, computers and construction equipment. A Dubai Interior Ministry official said the rioters caused almost \u00a3500,000 in damage. Most of the workers involved in the riot returned the following day but refused to work.\n\n\n== Other uses ==\n\n\n=== BASE jumping ===\nThe building has been used by several experienced BASE jumpers for authorised and unauthorised BASE jumping:\n\nIn May 2008, Herv\u00e9 Le Gallou and David McDonnell, dressed as engineers, entered Burj Khalifa (around 650 metres (2,130 ft) at the time), and jumped off a balcony situated several floors below the 160th floor.\nOn 8 January 2010, with permission of the authorities, Nasr Al Niyadi and Omar Al Hegelan, from the Emirates Aviation Society, broke the world record for the highest BASE jump from a building after they leapt from a crane-suspended platform attached to the 160th floor at 672 m (2,205 ft). The two men descended the vertical drop at a speed of up to 220 km/h (140 mph), with enough time to open their parachutes 10 seconds into the 90-second jump.\nOn 21 April 2014, with permission of the authorities and support from several sponsors, highly experienced French BASE jumpers Vince Reffet and Fred Fugen broke the Guinness world record for the highest BASE jump from a building after they leapt from a specially designed platform, built at the very top of the pinnacle, at 828 metres (2,717 feet).\n\n\n=== Climbing ===\nOn 28 March 2011, Alain \"Spiderman\" Robert scaled the outside of Burj Khalifa. The climb to the top of the spire took six hours. To comply with UAE safety laws, Robert, who usually climbs in free solo style, used a rope and harness.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nSome scenes of the 2011 American action film Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol were shot on and in the Burj Khalifa.\nAn alternate version of the Burj Khalifa appears in the 2012 video game Spec Ops: The Line.\nIn the 2013 American animated film Planes, Dusty Crophopper and the plane competitors pass the Burj Khalifa in the stage from Germany to India.\nIn the 2016 American science fiction film Independence Day: Resurgence, the Burj Khalifa was seen where it\u2014along with many other structures\u2014is being thrown into London by the aliens using their mothership's anti-gravity pull.\nThe Burj Khalifa, alongside other Dubai landmarks, was featured in the music video of \"Thunder\" by Imagine Dragons.\nIn the 2017 American disaster film Geostorm, the building is hit by a massive tsunami, which causes the antenna to fall off and the building itself to tilt at a precarious angle.\nIn The Amazing Race 15, the season's competing teams visited the building during Leg 5 to retrieve a clue from the 124th floor, during which time the building was still under construction and still under its original name of Burj Dubai. The Burj Khalifa was featured again ten years later on The Amazing Race 31 and hosted one of the two Detour tasks in Leg 5.\nThe unique design and engineering challenges of building Burj Khalifa have been featured in a number of television documentaries, including Big, Bigger, Biggest and Mega Builders.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn June 2010, Burj Khalifa was the recipient of the 2010 \"Best Tall Building Middle East & Africa\" award by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. On 28 September 2010 Burj Khalifa won the award for best project of the year at the Middle East Architect Awards 2010. Awards Chair Gordon Gill, of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, said:\n\nWe are talking about a building here that has changed the landscape of what is possible in architecture \u2013 a building that became internationally recognized as an icon long before it was even completed. \u2018Building of the Century\u2019 was thought a more apt title for it.\nBurj Khalifa was also the recipient of the following awards.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n\"The Burj Dubai Tower Wind Engineering\" (PDF).

          "I have been to the viewing platform 'At The Top' of Burj Khalifa a few times, occasionally taking friends and relatives to see the incredible views from the 125th floor of the world's tallest building. The elevators are impressively fast and the panorama is undeniably",
          "This is just a great activity to do. Lifts are super fast and once you are at the Top the view is fantastic. Kids also loved it. Bit tedious with the photo taking but we bought one anyway. We were up during the day and you get a great view of the Dubai Fountains from one side.",
          "Go to the top of the world's tallest building! 154 floors with a stop on a lower floor for the outside platform. My visit included some drinks and a snack which I wasn't interested in. I just wanted to experience the height.",
          "A once in a lifetime place to visit. Being the tallest building in the world and in Dubai you expect it to be luxury and very grand. It did not disappoint. Very nice models and details on the build on your way into the lifts which gives you a feel of how this building came to",
          "Take a morning ride a see the sunrise. It's worth getting up early and see the sun breaks the horizon.",
          "This was an amazing experience to visit floor 124. The views are wonderful. The lift to floor 124 only takes 60 seconds. Brilliant",
          "we're glad we did this. We did the 3:00 in the afternoon tour up...but there were still too many people up at the top when trying to take photos. The information about how we were supposed to get there were very unclear. A well dressed driver met us at our hotel in a nice car",
          "My two friends have already visited here last year and loved it, they recommended it again saying its a must whilst in Dubai. So they came again with me, who hates heights. We got to see everything from the 125th floor, the views are great even though I didn\u2019t see much, but my",
          "Great family experience At the top. Some great family photos came out of fun we had at the terrace in a windy morning. A must see and visit when visiting Dubai! Don\u2019t miss by any chance!",
          "2 hours for this visit and 1 hour and 45 minutes was spent queuing. Buying a ticket in advance saved no time. In my opinion, this attraction was a waste of time. If I\u2019d have known that the queuing was going to be like that, I would never have booked, young children or not.",
          "Took both the on the top and with the afternoon tea and loved it . I visited with my friend visiting me with her two teenage children from the US and we were a family of a total of 5 older teens and 2 adults . We visited in the afternoon and we were super lucky as we had clear",
          "The view from 148 floor was amazing and the building it self was beautiful. We had vip tickets which should have included some beverages and more peaceful experience at floor 148, but: didnt get any beverages, because staff were too busy, everyone were nice but they didnt have",
          "My family came for a nice vacation in Dubai and I took them to the Burj Khalifa. They really liked the view from up the 124 and 125 floor. My mom is not able to walk so much anymore so she had her rolator with her. When the staff saw my mom we were guided past the lines and were",
          "Skip the line and even get a VIP elevator! We went for the best option and afterwards came back down to enjoy the VR experience, followed by a skip the line exit. Oh my lord, I almost felt sorry for those people!",
          "I heard mixed reviews about visiting the Burj Khalifa during my stay in Dubai. Some people warned they felt it is overrated, and others said it is a must. I\u2019m glad I listen to the latter. Looking out the window of the tallest building in the world, is a once in a lifetime",
          "We knew there would be queues, but to get up wasn\u2019t too bad at 3.30 on a Sunday afternoon. Dubai may have been quieter due to there being no Chinese tourists at the time of our visit. The lifts accelerate rapidly but are smooth. Once up, you can stay as long as you want. The",
          "Amazing views even on a hazy day! Definitely a must when in dubai, but manage your expectations. Queues everywhere. Firstly you queue to collect your tickets around 10-15 minutes, then you leave to go back at your allotted time, where the queue can be around 30 minutes + Home",
          "A must do if you\u2019re in Dubai - I booked tickets before leaving UK and paid about \u00a335 with the booking fee - that got me to level 124/125 - you can go higher but was nearing double the price - would it look any different from another 23 floors ? I personally don\u2019t think so -",
          "Unfortunately we had a hazy late afternoon / evening so the view was not as far as we would of liked, it was still breath taking. What an amazing feat of engineering and beautiful architecture. Liked it so much we may go back later this week.",

Do try and go for the morning slot sunrise + breakfast \u2665\ufe0f\ud83e\udd29 The benefit is less people you get lot of easy time to cherish",
          "Bypass the lines and go to the top. Make sure you ask for your tea/coffee and sweets and stay for awhile. A lovely view of course but make it the experience you paid for.",

          "This was a wonderful experience for my son and I. We were able to go up top about 9:00 at night. The view at night was spectacular. The lights and panoramic views of the city were breath taking. We were able also to watch the water / light show from the top and then make it to",
          "It was a must to visit the Burj. Lift is super fast and ears pop going up and down. Slightly underwhelmed with the experience but glad I did it. Better to regret things you have done rather than those you haven't. Souvenir shop extortionate. Staff can be a little pushy for photo",

          "We booked online and had a time slot but soon realised what a total waste of time that was. The mall queue was chaos. Only 1 staff member & he made the online customers wait while he streamed everyone else through without barely checking their tickets. So why offer a slot? Next",
          "The tallest tower currently in the world. The public viewing deck is approximately at 124th floor. There are multiple fast elevators to take people upto that floor within few seconds. Large glass panes have been installed on viewing terrace for safety but due to these glasses",
          "After reading a lot of other reviews, I was confused as to whether it would be worth the price to go to the 154th floor for the high tea...after all how many tiny sandwiches could we eat?? many reviews said the 30 extra floors didn\u2019t make a difference... let me just say that\u2019s",
          "Excited to be on the tallest building, the overall experience was however just about okay. The view is good from 124/125th floor, the weather defines what you see or what you miss and there is no predicting that. Discussed and debated whether we should go in the morning or",
          "Visiting Dubai for the first time my husband and I decided to visit the Burj khalifa. We looked at various options before traveling there and came across tea in the clouds. This allows you VIP access to skip the queues and you get to visit floor's 152/154. On arrival you are",
          "We heard that the queues were terrible for At The Top so we wanted to avoid at all costs. However, we then saw that there was an early morning option 'sunrise and breakfast' which we thought was a better idea - less queue, 'free' croissant and drink and you get to see the views",
          "Bubbly Sundowner is a fraud. They offer Champagne, canapes and live music in 2 hours in a Lounge. 1) the took my glass of Champagne to be able to go outside and when returned they wanted to charge me for another glass of Champagne. 2) I never saw a canape, I asked for one and",
          "I joked on their official website for 1230 and arrive 30 minutes early. It al does not matter. Expect a 90 minute wait in line or longer. They offered an expedited line for an additional 100 is dollars. No queue management by staff. Just mayhem. One of the worst tourist",
          "This is a must do for visitors, the trip of a lifetime. Tickets can be ordered in advance by your travel agent or hotel. I have to use a wheelchair and was given assistance to jump the line and was guided past the huge crowds. The Burj deserves all the hype. An engineering",
          "We booked on line in advance for the \u201ctea in the clouds\u201d experience. It\u2019s expensive, Dubai is expensive. But this is the tallest building in the world and afternoon tea seemed one of those bucket list must dos. It was great. Don\u2019t get me wrong. There\u2019s hassles downstairs and",
          "Once we got to the top it was great , really good views and was amazing to be there. However arriving to buy the tickets was a drama. We didnt know we had to pre book so arrived at the ticket desk to be told the cheapest tickets for the day were $648AED each and couldn't get a",
          "You've travelled all this way to Dubai and its probably a one-off trip so you've got to go up the Burj Khalifa. Yes, the wait might be a bit longer than you hoped for but boy was it worth the wait. The lift didn't feel as though it was moving, however, we were told its moving at",
          "I visited at the top on 29th December and am throughly disappointed with my visit. After waiting a very long time to get up to the top there was no way to see the view as there were so many people, totally overcrowded. Most of the people were only trying to leave! Not only did",
          "Burj Khalifa - At The Top was the highlight of the Dubai trip. We had pre-booked the combo tickets to the Burj and underwater zoo & aquarium. We had booked the 3 pm slot with an idea to enjoy the view during daylight and also get to see the sunset before descending down. We",
          "Burj Khalifa is one of the most prominent structures of Dubai. First of all to go to the gate you need to walk more than a kilometer in Dubai Mall. There are multiple check posts where you need to show the tickets and queues are very very long. From one check post to another it",
          "The views from the Burj were awesome. We decided to see the evening look. Although most of us were jumping over each other to grab the handle on the periphery, it was good . The bad part- 2 days in advance I could not book the tickets online unless I combined it with",
          "I purchase tickets for At the Top online at least 1 month prior to visiting. We booked the afternoon slot at 1pm. Despite having booked online we still had to wait in a very long line to pick up the tickets which took around 30minutes then it took a further 20 minutes to go",
          "I did the top of the world lounge which included snacks and drinks and have your long and seeing the 360 views of Dubai from top of burj Khalifa!!! Def worth the price as the bottom floors is so crowded and it\u2019s best come early too!!",
          "124 floors above reaches in about 90 seconds the lift is super fast. Loooon que of tourist from all over the world. Super money making tourism spot for people just to enjoy the view. Once at the top you can enjoy the view and that's about it. I would have preferred to do much",
          "We went to the 124 floor as a family of 4. The original date when we had to travel got postponed and the team at burj kindly allowed us to reschedule the tickets as they have no refund policy. The experience - entrance is through the dubai mall and usually at holiday season is",
          "I paid for tea at the top which was worth by passing the lines for a general ticket. You also get to go the 154th floor whereas the general ticket is only to the 124th! Buy online to streamline it all and allow a couple of hours for the whole experience.",
          "Honestly I liked the view of Burj Khalifa at normal time as it was clear transparent and breathtaking as the Sunset Prime tickets are 40% higher than normal time, and there is great hype of viewing it during sunset. Photography will be a pain during the night as the view is",
          "A very beautiful view from the 124 and 125th floor. But dont miss aquarium and under water walk that is tunnel.",
          "We had tickets to the Lounge, which lets you visit floors 152, 153 and 154. The views are great, especially after dusk once the city lights come on. Most of the views are through glass windows though, which creates difficulties for photographers due to marks on the glass or",
          "4 people \u00a3350 to queue for 40 min to look out of a window, So dirty i could not even take a photo.. really rally not worth the money.",
          "After you take the amazing 100+ levels up in the lift, you see the wonders of Dubai, with a beautiful landscape stretching out as far as the eye can see. You can view out across Dubai, and see the incredible beaches stretching down the coastline. In the middle of downtown Dubai,",
          "We did the online reservation thingy, and when we got there we had to line up to retrieve our tickets then another line to go through security and lastly another line to the elevator that takes you either to the 124th or 125th floor. The experience was great and views were",
          "We have been in At The Top today at 7pm . This is not the first time I\u2019ve been but it\u2019s my last time for sure . They are overselling tickets , they don\u2019t care if thousand of people are coming at the same hour , like my case . I bought 4 tickets online . So I have to wait in a",
          "Never seen anything like that. Sunrise along with the breakfast on the 124/125 floor was the ultimate. Thank you EMAAR.",
          "It\u2019s beautiful view and beautiful building but you feel rushed to get through it. You want to take in the experience. We also tried to upgrade but it was the end of the night and they said it was sold out. But it\u2019s worth going and experiencing",
          "We heard wonderful reviews and decided to go to Burj Khalifa - At the Top. We had purchased tickets online and the slot given to us was 2.00 pm. We were at the venue at 1.45 pm. There was no proper queue. People were standing in what it looked like 3 separate queues. We were",
          "In short, this is a complete and utter waste of your precious time and money! The queues are terrible (more than 2 hours despite the ticket reservation). Even worse, it is really crowded and after waiting in line to reach the windows, the photos come out blurred and under",
          "Despite the crazily overpriced tickets, we went there thinking it would be like going to the old Trade Center or the Sears Tower. Not a bit of it. Horrific queues from start to finish and staff who say and do very little to help. Stupidly overpriced tat in the shops. Very poor",
          "Despite buying tickets for a time slot, the queues to get up the tower were at least 45 minutes long. The queues are poorly managed, with people queuing for the wrong thing being sent back to the start of other queues. No staff to provide direction or information. The balconies",
          "We had tickets for the 124 and 127 floor. We were only shown to the 124 floor. We couldn\u2019t get all the way around and the balcony wasn\u2019t open so we took pictures through dirty glass windows. We were up there for less than 30 minutes and saw all it had to offer. It really was",
          "It was simply a waste of me and my family\u2019s time and money. It is way to expensive, disorganized (took us 1 hour just go get up in the tower) and it was simply a horrible experience",
          "Horrible. The price did not match the experience. Spend three hours there, however, most of the time was spend in queues. Very unpleasant.",
          "Nice view, but my family and I spend +2 hours in various queues on the way up. Despite the fact that I showed up at the exact point in time where my slot was according to the ticket I bought on-line. We again spend +1 hours just to get down. There are two queues - a priority",
          "The queues begin in the mall. Booking online is a waste of time, it means nothing. You still have to queue to collect a paper ticket. We queued for 2 hours to get to the top. Once there it was so busy you had to fight to get near a viewing window. The queues to get back down",
          "A truly amazing building being the tallest free standing structure in the world. We booked the VIP experience which whilst expensive we considered value for money as it included a fulsome afternoon tea and allowed us to go to the very top of the building. Remarkable to be one",
          "Well I bought my tickets on line. Turned up to collect tickets and due to haphazard queuing system waited for an hour just to exchange my online voucher and get to the desk to collect the actual tickets. Once I had my tickets I had to go to the back of the same line I\u2019d just",
          "It was a beautiful experience to stand so high in the skies. Seeing the world from the Burj is a great thing. Advisable to everyone. One setback was the waiting time, our booking was at 6 and that coincides the sunset. We went there and we had to wait for so long to go up which",
          "Terribile experience. 1 hour to get at the top and 1 hour to come down. In addition it was so crowded that it was very difficult to have a comfortable view...",
          "We visited 124/125 ,29 Dec. It was not a good experience. There were far too many people. The lines were huge and when at 124 we could not get to view due to the sheer volume of people. Most of them sitting on the floor in front of the glass . Families sitting on the stairs and",
          "We really enjoyed the view from the 148 floor. We did not pay the additional money to go to 154. I dint see where the view would change much for double the price. I would pay more for the 148 floor though. The lines were ridiculous. Buy your ticket online ahead of time. I",
          "Terrible experience at a very high price! We came with a \u2018normal\u2019 ticket at 5.30 pm. The nightmare started already in the mall. We exit the metro and there are no instructions of how to reach the burj Khalifa. We finally got there and we queued almost one hour before managing",
          "My family of three bought the \u201cTea In The Clouds\u201d package for 600AED apiece, and we regret it. I had read reviews for the tea that Atmosphere restaurant does and I assumed our experience would be comparable and I was very wrong. Queuing for this event, even with VIP status",
          "Overall I\u2019m glad I went, but the 60 min wait to get to the lift is just too long and there are no toilets during that wait. There are at the top on the 125th floor. Only three elevators and they let 20 people on at a time. It\u2019s badly organised to get people up and down. You",
          "We booked the tickets on-line which didn't go too well. We eventually got the time we were after (17.30 in order to be there for when the sun set - apparently the best time). The instructions said we needed to get there 15 mins beforehand, but we actually got there at 17.00,",
          "What a great experience and adventure to be on top of the highest tower in the world. My family and I have greatly enjoyed being there while having a cup of complementary Arabic coffee on top together with some Arabic desserts and dates. The scenery from the top of Burj Khalifa",
          "Overcrowded disappointing experience. Spent more time (hours!!) queuing to get in and out, than battling through the hundreds of people to see the views. My advice would be to spend a bit more money and have a helicopter tour!",
          "Top ticket is absolutely worth it - you can skip the lines to elevators and security check. It is also more calm on 148th floor - you can also visit the lower floors. There is coffee, tea and snack service on the VIP lounge.",
          "Disappointing, overcrowded. More time waiting in queues than checking the view. They have urgently to review the procedures and capacity.",
          "This visit in May was great, sunset views, 360 degrees... you can see the lights starting to glow as the sun sets in, making it all more exciting as you see the Dubai fountains start dancing... We were able to go up to the higher level then go down to another level. We were",
          "Complete waste of time and money. If you like being cut in line, shoved, and breathing in a city\u2019s worth of germs, this trip is for you. Poorly organized and over rated!",
          "We as a family of 4 people were interested in the Burj Khalifa and wanted to see it. We waited for 2 painstaking hours to get there. We went up to the building and were shocked at the poor services and attractions there. When we stepped out of the lift, a person told us to take",
          "Unlike others in the review column, we had the tickets booked beforehand online which stated a given time to enter the attraction. While there were still lines within the complex, the lines were still moving. We only went up to 124th floor because we didn\u2019t find the additional",
          "We visited in November and chose to visit at night. We couldn't decide which ticket to book and in the end booked the one that included level 148 as well as 124/125. This was quite a lot more expensive and the view was not really any different. One of the reasons we booked this",
          "Definitely worth a visit to this attraction and the views are pretty spectacular however felt the price dosent warrant the experience. Spent about 90 mins queuing throughout",
          "Make sure to check the weather and try to go when it\u2019s clear, the sunset is beautiful so depends on the season go earlier or later. Park in fashion parking on Dubai Mall to be closer. Totally worth the visit !",
          "Great view from the top. But the queue to get there was terrific. Plenty of information is provided about its construction .observation decks are well planned .panoramic views are stunning Staff are very friendly and informative.",
          "Wanted to go to the very top and lounge and other facilities very good there but extremely expensive on the day, but frankly the view is little different at 148 level as it is on 124/125 levels and latter - if you have kids - has more stuff for them. Definitely better to book",
          "It was amazing, when we reached the top the views was awesome you can see lots and lots of buildings. You will enjoy the fountain in the night time. Never missed this place when your heading to dubai one of the best spot to visit. Belle",
          "This is the most important place everyone shoud visit when comes to Dubai. On the top of Burj Khalifa,124 floor, view is stunning . Try to make reservation in advance !",
          "So booked the breakfast option thinking Oooh top hotel this should be good... instead we get to see one floor at 8 and then told next floor is shut for half an hour so opt to go straight for breakfast. Best part of trip was the lift! The breakfast was not a sit down affair -not",
          "The Dubai Burj Khalifa is one of the worlds most important buildings. Towering over 2000 feet, you cannot miss it while you visit Dubai. Even when you come in to land, the Burj Khalifa stands out. The view from the TOP was amazing, you could see for miles and miles.",
          "Came here for the first time - que was quite long to get in but once in straight to the lifts which are a little crammed but literally get to the 125th floor under a minute - which was good experience At the top big viewing platform inside and out with fantastic views of Dubai",
          "I have to be honest, the building per se it\u2019s outstanding, you look at it and you don\u2019t want to take your eyes off it anymore, it\u2019s beautiful and the surrounding and the fountain makes it even better, but...once you\u2019re at the top, you step out in the terrace for the view",
          "The normal at the top experience is way below my expectations. If you are someone like me and hate to waste your time with waiting in lines for 40-60 minutes just to get in an elevator you should not visit the place or buy the expensive packages where there's no or not this much",
          "The Tower is a master piece. Albeit, the venue \"at the top\" is totally overrated and the supervision team is unprofessional and unorganized; i.e. you send email to the venue you receive a reply. you go to the venue reception concierge the don't acknowledge at the top management",
          "Went to level 148, 124 & 125 with my sisters kids, 16 & 14. Prices was higher than the value. Yes, it\u2019s the highest building in the world and of cause are on the bucket list. If the price was lower, the experience would probably been better.",
          "My friend and I had the worst high tea experience ever in the most over priced restaurant. There were no instructions at the reception for online booking customers. There were no proper queue system and we had to intercept the walk in queue to enquire at the counter. Next we",
          "We did 124/125 and truly enjoyed the views! A bit crowded but it was worth the experience! The fountain show below was also great! Worth the time and money!",
          "We booked a 6:30 slot for the sunrise tour. At this early hour, there are no queues. Don't underestimate the walk from the metro to the Burj khalifa at the top entrance. At a brisk pace, it is at least 15 minutes. The Dubai mall does have security to direct you if you get lost",
          "Visited\"at the Top\" experience. WOW! Brilliant day, stunning views, very pleasant staff.an experience not to be missed. The Dubai Fountains also amazing to see from the 124 floor.",
          "Worth a visit! Excellent views and itbwas not too crowded on the day we visited. My grand daughter loved the floor which 'cracked' when she ran across it",
          "Last minute addition to our trip but was totally worth it. We booked the SKY VIP tour (approx 8pm) which included floors 148 c/w tea/coffee as well as 125 & 124. This tour isn't very expensive and we preferred it given you're in a smaller group and bypass the normal queue. Nice",
          "The views from the Burj Khalifa were amazing! You can see the city and gain a real perspective on the scale of buildings within the city. We had prebooked our tickets but there was still quite a bit of time queueing to get in (although not too long). At the top it was super",
          "We visited Burj Khalifa couple of days ago. We took the VIP tickets that let you to visit 148 floor. It was great experience because it is more private and bot so hectic. You don't need to wait in line for the elevator and the lounge above is also not so many people. They served",
          "Queue to collect tickets, queue an hour for the lifts, shuffle around the viewing decks in a queue, and then queue another half hour for the lift to descend. In the meantime, get harangued by queue control staff and then by persistent photographers. Do you really want a faked",
          "It took us a while to find the entrace in the mamoth Dubai Mall and while there was a queue it was not an unreasonable wait. As expected with a popular attraction it is a bit crowded and you may have to jostle to gain access to the vantage points for pics. You can have your",
          "Like the title says, its overpriced and overrated. Be prepared to queue for hours before you enter the actual viewing deck. And then there is gonna be a lot of people squeezing at the windows to get that 'perfect' picture. The view itself is just ok... If you do your research,",
          "Read the screen shot of my email below. Be warned. Bring snacks and water. And whatever anti anxiety meds ur on. I had heard some poor reviews but to the experience is a whole other level",

          "It's at money making machine, stay away. Queued for 1 hour to get up and over 1 hour to get down. Chaotic and terrible. It's so crowded up there, photograhers taking up too much space and selling you overpriced photos. Expensive cafe and a souvenier shop also taking up a lot of",
          "Good view from 124th and 125th floors of Burj Khalifa. But it's too crowded in the evenings. Best time to go 'At the Top' is early morning for a relaxed visit, good view and short queues.",

          "As the same claims one is at the top of the world when at Burj Khalifa- At the top. The view either during the day or night is mesmerising. Must visit opportunity once in a life time. The elevator takes you to the destination in a minute with no trace of movement and the entire",
          "Paying more to skip the line was well worth it to me. We got to sit in a comfortable lounge waiting area while eveybody else stood in a crowded line. Then we were escorted directly in front of the queues to the elevators. We went to floors, 125, 145 and 148. It this included",
          "Although I\u2019ve been to the top of the Rockefeller Center and the Empire State Building, this view was so much better. Perhaps because we visited at night....perhaps because we chose a time with fewer people...perhaps because everything was new and well-planned out....I\u2019m not",
          "It is better to see it from outside. Nothing interested inside and long ques and time waste. enjoy it from all sides.",
          "This is a must do. If you go right to the top you miss all the cues. You get to go outside on a platform which takes your breath away. Tea coffee and other drinks free. But alchole you have to pay for.",
          "This is the 2nd time visiting the Burj Khalifa & it\u2019s still surreal. The views are amazing & the experience is speechless. My boys loved it & so did I (again) This is a must for everyone.",
          "I was taken to Dubai for a week for my 70th birthday by my daughter Karen and her partner Paul. This was one of the exceptional trips out that we had. We had a tour and were taken to I think the 148th floor where not everyone gets to go. The views were amazing and of course you",
          "Tickets bought online helped to jump the queue. But still inside the was a long queue. A bit tiring and exosting if you are with small kids. Overall good experience.",
          "Wey cheaper than official tichets. The view fromnup there is amazing, if you visit the tower between 12:50 and 13:25 you can see the fountain show from up there. There are 2 shows, 13:00 and 13:30.",
          "The worlds tallest building isnt something to take lightly... looking up at it will make your eyes water and give u a sore neck. Completely amazing how they managed to building with breathtaking views from the At The Top point. Atarted by collecting my ticket from the ticket",
          "This was a must do in Dubai and the views were beautiful! We did book online, while we were out in Dubai. We went through the official website which I\u2019d recommend. We did quite for 40 mins or so to go through security and head to the lift but once you\u2019re out there, there is",
          "If you have been to a few towers around the world, the experience of visiting yet another may not be novel - but still the views from the Burj Khalifa is quite something! We opted for the budget friendly access to floors 124 & 125. The lines can get long and slots can get",

          "Will probably never go up anything taller again in my lifetime. An amazing experience - makes you realise just how far ahead this country is",
          "Worth to visit. They present also the history of this place and the construction process. In 1 min you are on the top (124/125 floor).",
          "I\u2019d read a few reviews on here before visiting but I have to say it\u2019s well worth paying the extra for the afternoon tea, not only is the food great(and you get a lot more than stated on other reviews including refills and unlimited drinks), the best part was the exclusivity",
          "I can talk as well that I have been in the tallest building of the world. the view fro the top is so amazing . I just got fascinated by the tall and beautiful out the world buildings .",

          "I visited the top of burj khalifa with my brother, its amazing, first of all I like the elevator idea, once the elevator start going up, it shows the tallest towers in the world till reach the cloud and give quick information about burj khalifa. The view from the top is super",
          "Got the rather expensive tickets for level 148 + 124/125, which was a good decision. We had plenty of time at the upper level, where it was nice and calm, before we went down to 124/125, where it was a lot more crowdy and noisy. View is fantastic!",
          "Visited 10/1/19 It was not worth the extra cost for the sunset. It was a very hazy and foggy day. They should not have charged extra knowing that you would not be able to see anything outside. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!",
          "We were lucky as there were no queues at the time so it was all pretty straight forward. Amazing views from above, definite recommend.",
          "I went as I wanted to see what they build from a sandy dessert, in fact this is my second visit in 2 years, so this visit was to see how that Had progresses with the new hotels and Expo 2020 buildings. There is spectacular views of the city and coast line and yes there are",

          "There are several combination tickets available online. I got cheaper options on groupon, but it has time restrictions. Mine was for a visit to 124th and 125th floor with fast track entry and VR. Fast track seemed like a joke may be due to mismanagement of the staff. It was",
          "It\u2019s a must do in Dubai to go to the top of the tallest building in the world. It is all very well organised and unlike other similar attractions the queue time to get up and down was very short. We arrived not long before sunset and due to how hazy Dubai it, the view wasn\u2019t",

          "A must when in Dubai. After all the tallest building in the world. Fear of heights? not to worry, they have big glass enclosures so you will never fall :). Its an experience worth the Dhirams you pay for.",

          "You cannot visit Dubai without visiting the tallest tower in the world. Don\u2019t just stop at the 125th floor, as it\u2019s worth paying a few dollars more and going all the way to the top and seeing level 148 for the quiet, comfort, and extra appeal of the highest (man made) vantage",

          "We done the lounge trip which is floor 154 it cost a little bit more money but so worth it. You get a free drink wen entering and there was a lady singing live while the waiters passed out canapes. The views were amazing it was like something out of a movie.",

          "Was looking forward eagerly to this visit, having heard so much about it...went at sunset, which is peak tourist time. Looooong wait for the elevators, with cranky kids in line. The elevators themselves are impressive, with projectors and piped audio, as is the view from the",

          "Enjoyed the whole experience. It was interesting to seee the planning and execution of the building of this tower",
          "Well it wasnt as smooth as i expected. The waiting line was so long and took us almost 2-3 hours easily. They were operating 1 lift when we were waiting to go down and skyward members could interfere and freely go down without waiting in the que because maybe they paid more.",

          "I had been to 124th floor at the top of Burj Khalifa tower. The view was simply superb, expecially between 5:30 to 7:00 where you can see sunset and the night view of Dubai from top. A must visit for any tourist or anyone living in UAE.",

          "It was really not as expected or as described in the website, the worst experience ever!!! Tables were busy and if not they were totally dirty! Staff is very bad and not friendly or professional at all Bad experience",
          "Having taken the more standard over crowded burj Khalifa tour twice before we decided to try the vip tour that goes higher than the 124 level and goes to 154 level. Far less crowded , champagne and canopies and well worth the premium ticket if you can afford the extra cost it",
          "It\u2019s too expensive to take the ticket for the 154 floor, almost same can be viewed from the package that leads to only upto 145 floor. Rest is amazing, breath taking views and definitely once in a life time thing.",
          "we visited at 6 pm which was the perfect time of visit because we could see the sunset, the illumination of the whole city and fountain show from top",
          "The best advice to give here is to book your tickets online (reduced price) BUT buy them on the day you intend to go. This way you can check the weather conditions more accurately. Many days during our holiday, I saw dust and low cloud over Dubai at different times of day - and",
          "It is enough to go up to 124/125 floors. The best time to go up before sunset, when it is still clear. You will have a great view. When it gets dark, nice to see the illuminated fountain game from the top. The only negative is you have to queue a lot to get down...",
          "We paid for the sky level expecting a special experience after already visiting the 125th floor a few years ago. Save your money as this is not worth paying the extra, even for bypassing the queues. We arrived at 6.45 pm for a 7pm tour and were told to move over towards a door",
          "Amazing structure! So glad I went to the top. The main attraction in Dubai! Anyone who comes to Dubai needs to visit this for themselves!",
          "Book your tickets to visit Burj Khalifa upto 126th floor a day before your plan, same day tickets is not available sometime. Plan it at evening time, in day time view is not very good by the evening when all the lights in city is on its look very good. Spend time in main lobby",
          "Great place to go to visit! But please don't waste your money on the photos! 250 aed ($69 usd) for one photo or 3 for 600 aed ($164 usd). The people this place attracts are not millionaires and they take almost 20-30 photos of you during your visit",
          "Luckly I have now been able to view the city from both levels and I have to say the lower level ( 125 ) is in my opintion the better view This experiance is expensive unless your there during Ramadan when cheaper rates are usally offered do to it being much less busy dont",
          "Great views of Dubai with many opportunities top take photos. There are many professional photographers available to capture those amazing shots. A little pricey, but worth it",
          "We loved our trip to the Burj Khalifa. Some other reviews have said it just an elevator ride but that\u2019s nonsense in my opinion! There\u2019s quite a lot to experience before the lift to the top - info and interactive exhibitions about the building and what it stands for, how it was",
          "it was really experience being at the top, and one of the fastest left i have ever seen and nice photographers inside to take your pictures, on the way back its one of the best cookie and coffee you will get.",
          "Probably a little less impressed than my first time. But it\u2019s still an epic building. The view from the 124 floor is amazing. However this time I found the number of people trying to sell photos really off putting. There must have been 3 sets of people trying to drag families",
          "Much hyped trip for nothing. We went to125th level. Very crowded.though we bought ticket for sunset, nothing was checked. There was a huge queue. More people at the top, many who had come long before and waiting for sunset. This added to more waiting times while getting down. On",
          "An amazing view and experience. I did feel a bit unsteady but so glad I went for it. Well worth a try.",
          "Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest building in the world; and as I was in the United Arab Emirates, I thought I would give it a try and explore the observation deck\u2026 \u2026but there are two experiences: one which involves going to Level 124 for that observation deck known as At",
          "Burj Khalifa.WOW!!!! What a great day my wife and I had visiting the world's tallest building.The walk through from the ticket office was very informative telling you of each stage in it's construction.Very well laid out and the elevator is so fast ,but very smooth taking you to",
          "Be prepared for airport level security checks and a fairly long queue but it moves quickly and efficiently. Well worth the fairly high price.",
          "We pre booked for 10am and there were no ques at all. It was not over crowded at the top and you could spend as much time as you like looking round. views were amazing and well worth seeing. very information, interactive things as you are going round.",
          "Smoothly operated and well worth the trip, this remains a top tourism venue. With the extended viewing areas and the historic vision telescopes, the view of the city is astonishing. 2 tips If you got kids, pay for the photographs of them hanging off girders! They are lots of",
          "This was a good experience. We went to the 154th floor at sunset which yes costs more money but so glad we did (especially after reading other reviews!) No queues, up to the top in maybe 20 minutes from buying the ticket to getting to the top. Greeted with champagne on arrival",
          "Can honestly say this was the thing that I was most looking forward to visiting in Dubai but I was very disappointed, its very expensive costing over \u00a340 just to visit the first level. All you get for this is the lift up to the first viewing level. Don\u2019t get my wrong the views",
          "Tallest building in the world would said enough of this place. We went At The Top around 10 am which is not the peak hour, lesser crowds but morning sun would be a bit bothersome. We only went on the 124th -125th floor package, high enough to see a lot of view. 125th is walkable",
          "We visited the Burj Khalifa yesterday. Like many others we booked tickets in advance and whilst it is expensive it's something we really wanted to visit given its the tallest building in the world. We visited at around 3.30pm on a Saturday afternoon and there was no queuing",
          "Just pay the extra $100 and go to the top. Don't think about it, just do it. You will regret if you don't go all the way.",
          "You get great views from the top (well, the lower of the observation decks - I can't see that paying even more to go to the higher one would make much difference). The price is high. You can mitigate it somewhat by booking in advance (online) for an off-peak time slot (up until",
          "The Burj Khalifa is a highly suggested experience but my wife and I feel that we didn't have the best experience. I feel that more should be offered at $40 USD per person. This price just gives you access to the observation decks of the 124 & 125 floors. One of the main issues",
          "The experience is really cool. You get some historical perspective through during the walk if you spend some time to read the stuff on the wall. Just go, you cannot visit Dubai and not.",
          "A magnificent view of the city the worlds tallest building. It\u2019s a must visit place and a great tourist attraction there is also a restaurant At the Top which makes your visit the most memorable one",
          "Another of the must do attractions. Entered through the Dubai Mall, our tickets were bought for a specific time, which was necessary to allow the large amount of visitors to access the building. The ride on the lift was swift, with an interesting commentary and on arrival at our",
          "One of the best experiences ever ! Got a fantastic deal for the Burj Khalifa and the Aquarium in the Dubai Mall online (look into this) Went for first slot very quiet and temperature was bearable. All the staff were so polite and kind and really made you feel \u2018On top of the",
          "For someone that doesn\u2019t do heights it was a great experience. the elevator didn\u2019t feel like you were moving although you could see by the floor number increase as you went up that you were and at a great speed, they do squash you in so wouldn\u2019t advise if you don\u2019t like that.",
          "I booked a Fast Track Entry ticket in advance on internet. The checking of tickets went quickly in the fast lane but despite my priority I still had to queue for the elevator. This elevator brings you with a speed of 12 m/s to level 125 or 456 m. The observation deck was very",
          "Was told by the lady at the desk (located in the Dubai Mall) that we could not buy tickets at the mall - they are ONLY available online as it was easier for her to print them at the desk. So after the rude and seemingly reluctant service my family and I received (note they were",
          "An experience of a lifetime but you do get hearded like cattle! The views are breathtaking but felt that there could have been more interactive stuff along the way as the queues are very long! But the view is awesome when you get there!!",
          "As my subject of that review this is actually A Roof Top of the World..Amazing journey from ground to 123 Stories in just few seconds Bullet speed Lifts make your journey fastest from 0 level to 123rd floor of the world tallest building. and after that you can witness the bird",
          "We took in a trip to the view at the top of the Burj whilst on a 2 day stop over. The trip up happens in around 30 seconds climbing to the 124th floor, once there the viewing platform is outside the building so be prepared for heat once again ! The open air platform spans around",
          "It's an amazing architectural wonder. It has the fastest lift in the world. The mall has the biggest indoor aquarium in the world. Everything in this building is definitely worth a visit",
          "originally was going to skip this during my short layover in dubai, but im glad i didnt. We went around 6 or 7 at dusk. No lines no crowds great time to go.",
          "It was only worth it for the view but that too has to be well planned. The period I was there, there were sand storms which meant visibility was poor at certain times of the day. Although well managed, the queue was rather long. It took us almost 45 minutes to reach the 124/125",
          "the view from up there at night is amazing. I did it and lived just I'm not good with the height of things. it is a must do.",
          "Ok but not much to do after a long rigmarole to get there. Went to 124 /125 level which gives plenty of picture opportunities.",
          "If you want To be able to say you went in the world highest building then go there. If you want To admire the view go to the frame instead. Much cheaper and less crowded and fun for kids. At Burj kalifa you have nice angel wings To take pictures with but i wont go back there.",
          "Great experience to be on top of the tallest building and structure in the world! Make sure to make prior arrangements before going to the site to avoid long lines. Tickets can be purchased online.",
          "Had seen it in videos & photographs from friends many time, but standing at top was a different experience all together. While there is nothing much to do there, but 30 minutes that we spent there were memorable. We went in afternoon & unlike many reviews, we personally like a",
          "If you go to Dubai you must see this attraction, it\u2019s amazing! It\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve seen. The experience was wayyy better than I thought, the elevator barely feels like you\u2019re moving, you wouldn\u2019t know if your ears didn\u2019t pop. The building doesn\u2019t shake or sway at all",
          "Great day out spent seeing dubai at the top of burj khalifa. Amazing view and great information across the venue. Love the lift to get to the top and vice versa.",
          "It was a great app experience with the at the top burj khalifa Floor we reached is 124th and the view from there is amazing The staff was also good The lift from which we go up was very fast that we reach the 124 floor in 1 min and some seconds more , but it doesn\u2019t feel",
          "Absolutly amazing\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1. Visiting the tallest building in the world is such a wonderful experience. I had the VIP ticket (very expensive though\u00a1\u00a1):before going up, they take you into a special waiting lounge where they offer you a very strong arabian coffe. Getting up was smooth",
          "Definitely worth booking, with the fast track. It\u2019s a once in a life time experience so make the most of it by booking the option - staff are superb, and it\u2019s amazing to share the space without being crowded. The canap\u00e9s and drinks are also fab.",

          "the tallest building with the fastest elevator- a treat!! the views are out of this world. I would advise to pre book to avoid crowd and reach on time to minimize the rush. It is situated inside the Dubai mall and easy transportation. On your way out, do see the pictures of",
          "good view of immediate surroundings. for farther range of view, check the weather before going up the tower.",
          "The view from the top are simply amazing. The high speed lift takes you to the top and you are transferred to the top of the world in a few minutes. The views are amazing and dusk view are even better. There is shopping and resturant on the top floor. A few hours well spent.",
          "What does one say about an experience that takes you to the 148th floor of the world's tallest building. Dizzying. The views from that level are like no other and you can see all over dubai and beyond. The open air area is great. We were surprised to learn that there are more",

          "I have to agree with a few of the other reviews - we felt The Burj trip was highly average.. it\u2019s nice views and yes you can take photos at the top but it\u2019s not as spectacular as it is made out to be and certainly, in our opinion, there are far better city views we\u2019ve",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the Burj Khalifa. Spectacular views at night and we also watched some of the Fountain dancing (a little far away as we were up so high).... Great staff and well organised.",
          "I recently had an extra day in Dubai before returning to work and I had always wanted to see this.The ticket price for one person was $44 US.A little steep but still within reason considering the prices of other tours and activities.First,make sure you are wearing comfortable",

          "Great view if a clear day, however our hotel was very tall had a great view of the Khalifa and was free to go to the top floor. I don\u2019t know why anyone would pay the money they demand for the view. Yes it\u2019s stunning but not \u00a360 approx per head stunning.",
          "While planning our stay in Dubai, we read several reviews about Burj Khalifa - At The Top here at Tripadvisor and several other sources. Finally we decided for the tickets for the 148. floor and of course with those you can then also proceed to levels 125 and 124. We also had",

          "Yes, this is the place where you can say I am on the top . Seriously. We pre booked our tickets a month ago and opted for evening time. They have different charges as morning, afternoon, evening,night . You have to be there atleast 1 hr before to collect the physical tickets.",
          "I had to do it at least once. Worth every dirham and every meter! Outstanding view!!! once i get courage back i'm going back!",
          "After half a day of running around the amazing city of Dubai, we decided to cap our day with a trip to the 148th floor of the Burj Kalifa. What a treat it was! You must head up there to experience it yourself. What an amazing building this is. 125 floors in 1 minute! change",
          "Get up there, enjoy the views (360 degrees) and have your picture taken. While hanging on to the building you will make spiderman look like a fool. Check the poses you want before taking the pictures. The very friendly staff will basically take as many as you want time and",

          "Recently took a trip up the Burj in the evening, it was ok, I was expecting more after going up the shard and rocker fella centre previously. The views were good but for the price charged I wouldn\u2019t recommend to be honest. The Burj is much more impressive from the outside.",

          "Don\u2019t see the value of getting to the floor unless it matters much to you. A hassle of having to go through many security checks and queue. Expensive entrance and if the weather is not good, can hardly see anything up here. Also kind of stuffy and claustrophobic as the area is",

          "Certainly \"At the Top\" as it's referred to - spectacular views. Dizzying height, brilliant for photos.",
          "Yes, you are paying a lot to go up and look at the view, but it is pretty amazing to be up that high. We booked 10:00am and got right in, but when we came out we saw HUGE lines to get in. So glad we went early in the day!",
          "Booked the Burj experience followed by dinner for my husband\u2019s birthday. Our tickets were for 7:30 and we got to Dubai Mall about an hour prior. Long line up, maybe because it was around sunset when the views are better. Took us more than an hour to get to the top. The views are",
          "The building is stunning. A true marvel of engineering and architecture, well worth a visit for that. However, At the Top is not actually at the top, its about 2/3 of the way up, although impressive, the title is somewhat misleading. During your visit you are subjected to",
          "We visited at 9.30pm and watched the fountains from above at 10pm which was amazing! The views are incredible and i would love to visit again",
          "After booking online, we still had to change them at the Dubai mall into little tickets. At the building there was a super long queue before reaching the elevator. The elevator can only take a particular amount of people at a time ,which was understandable, when it got to our",
          "Reached the top 124th floor quickly and had 1/2 hour orughly to see all, very good views of the city from all sides, and had access to the 125th floor. Very Very busy when we went up, cant think when it would be quieter, but would go back up at night if we went again. Would book",
          "From this viewpoint you understand what was they able to build in the desert from sand. really impressive.",
          "Apart from the fact that is not worth the money spent! We had a booking for 18:30, (and were advised to arrive at 18:15), we arrived at the line at 18:10 to collect our tickets. We managed to arrive at the top at 19:15.....that was fast! 15/20 minutes to look at the nice view.",
          "An average experience, yes great views but oh the pain in getting to the top. I could hear the \"bahing\" of sheep as we were herded from area to area. Now I know that the building is amazing and has to be paid for but $100 for one photo? Extortionate entry prices leave you with",
          "You are at the top of the world and ist so cool to see so far and to see just about all of Dubai. If you are afraid of heights, you will be freakingout as this is high and so cool to see.",
          "It's a pleasure visiting Burj Khalifa - At The Top and I love to do so with my Guests. It has a Spectacular view from all 4 sides and the best part of Dubai is that most days are Clear and Sunny so your visit is not wasted due to bad weather.",
          "Do not get me wrong, the experience was very nice. From the express elevator that bypassed the crowds to the little snacks and beverages enjoyed in a comfortable chair at the highest man made vantage point in the world, the experience was very pleasant. Just not worth the",
          "You can\u2019t go to Dubai without a visit to the top of this. Queues can be a bit annoying but it is probably the most popular tourist attraction so are expected. We waited around 40 mins before we entered lift. Lift took around 60 seconds to get to the top then you were treated to",
          "The view at the top is so cool. Being able to go there is a wonderful feeling. The elevator ride was amazing! A must try",
          "Visited At Night time and view was amazing.Had to stay in long queue while going down but was worth it.",
          "What an amazing view! 149 floors up!! That is almost 250 stories! Dont for the faint of heart! We did the vip tour!",
          "After a long queue and fast lift the views failed to impress. Sorry but this is my own impression. Very disorganised and spoilt by others pushing and shoving.",
          "I would highly recommend a visit to the Top. It offers the best views of Dubai and should not miss it.",
          "We wanted to experience \u201cthe Dubai by night scenery\u201d and we went up to the 148th, 125th and 124th floor at 10 PM. No queuing at all, we bought tickets at Bur Khalifa. Security went smooth as well. You get refreshments and a nice lounge experience at 148th floor. Go out on the",
          "In hindsight perhaps I expected too much of going up the tallest building in the world. We went up a sunset. There were quite long queues, the sunset wasn\u2019t very good, the view wasn\u2019t very interesting and it was overcrowded at the top to the point where it was annoying. For the",
          "We went to Dubai to celebrate my wife\u2019s birthday with some friends and, whilst the ladies enjoyed some retail therapy in the Dubai Mall, my fiend and I decided to see Dubai from on high. The tickets had been booked online a month in advance, the earliest that it is possible to",

          "If you visit Dubai, you must put in your itinerary the Burj Khalifa - At The Top. It has 125 floors and you arrive at the top in under 1 min with the elevator and the view is breathless. You can also enjoy the fountain show or shop in one of the biggest all in the world. But I",
          "Do not miss the Khalifa experience and the view from The Top observation deck located on level 124 of the world's tallest building. Fantastic views in all directions. The elevator rises 124 floors in 60 seconds.",
          "This is an architecture marvel, and a very high end lifestyle building. They designed the elevator ride to be pretty entertaining and the view from 125 is amazing. I booked mine through a tour, so I was able to get a discount and skip the lines. If you had to book full price and",
          "We did this as an organised tour from the cruise ship we was on. We had a morning trip up the Burj the queues hadn't built up so was quick at getting to the 125th floor. Wow this has some view and a good drop down. The photo opportunities are incredible, the 124th floor is the",
          "If u still think by any remote chance that the earth could be flat.... go n do this. U can practically see the curvature of the earth as the sun rises... n u can marvel the layout of Dubai... it fills like looking at real time google map on ur iPad... don\u2019t miss this for nethng",
          "Well organised once we found it within the massive Dubai Mall, and the queue went in quite quickly for the amount of people waiting. At the top it was remarkably similar to the Freedom Tower in NYC, but felt more crowded and difficult to get to the window to take any photos.",
          "The view from the top is amazing and it has got the highest Resturant in the world. The tallest tower in the world is in the name of Burj Khalifa.",
          "It\u2019s not for clients! Ugly service! You can\u2019t change or close your action even in first five minutes.... then they will say - HAVE A NICE DAY))))) don\u2019t book with that service.... or be strong and careful",
          "I bought tickets online in advance for 8pm. We showed up at 7:45pm and it wasn\u2019t until 8:45pm that we finally got up to the 125th floor. The was a line to collect the online tickets, separate male and female lines for security, lines to take pictures, lines to get to the lines",
          "The architecture and what it took to build the Burj Khalifa which is placed along the walls is extremely fascinating. Then you will know this is part of the wonders of the world when you get to the top. The sky indeed is the limit. Dubai is beautiful",
          "A brilliant built skyscraper and loved to be on top of it. View was awesome from the top. We switched from non peak hours to peak hours by paying some extra cost. We went on the top at 5pm in the evening. We wanted to see whole of Dubai from the top in natural light so we went",
          "I guess it\u2019s one of those thing you have to do in Dubai but we wouldn\u2019t do it again. Of course, the views were great once you got up there but getting up to see them was somewhat painful. We obviously picked a busy time (2.30pm) as we had to queue for the elevators for about",
          "The Burj Khalifa was the first thing I wanted to see when my sister and I went to Dubai. The elevator to the top is smooth and fast! it was a big hazy out due to a light sand storm, but the views were still spectacular. Purchase your ticket in advance, so you don't have to wait",
          "We had to wait in line about 1 1/2 hr. But it was truly worth it. The view at the top is truly breath taking. You can see for miles and miles. Photographers take beautiful pictures showing you doing ll kind of crazy things. like climbing the building, etc. But whooping price",
          "Visitors can book tickets online for appropriate schedule, or just wait to stand in line on that day. The entrance to Burj Khalifa is on the ground floor through the Dubai Mall, we got the ticket from group tour leader, just wait in line and it was go from start to finish. From",
          "This is a rather pricey attraction, but if you book online in advance, you can shave a lot off the cost! It is another must see in Dubai, as you can appreciate much better the scale of this architectural masterpiece from this perspective. Be smart and don't let price be the",
          "Probably THE THING to see in Dubai. Incredible architecture, amazing view. The platform at the 123 is partly outside and very windy..",
          "The views are excellent and the higher observation deck provided a better experience. Ridiculously expensive though and that keeps this for being a \u20185\u2019 rating. Buy tickets online in advance. The home page did not work when we tried and we were forced to go to the counter where",
          "This is a must if visiting Dubai. Book your tickets online in advance to save time on the day. You can make a day or evening of this as it's located at the Dubai Mall and Dubai fountain show.",

          "148th floor ... wow what a view! What can I say but just do it! Best time is around 5 o\u2019clock where you also can enjoy the sunset. Not much to see in Dubai but this experience is absolutely a Must See. The tallest skyscraber in the world.",
          "Almost didn\u2019t get to go up. Be warned, if you buy tickets at the booth in Dubai Mall, they sell out quick. We were told tickets were sold out for the next 4 days by staff and we were soooo disappointed. He said our other option was to pay 3 times the regular price to have drinks",
          "Today I visited the much hyped Burj Khalifa The Top. But had one of the worst experience of my life due to totally unprofessional and untrained staff at the elevators. Had absolutely no idea how to manage queues. While coming down after completing our trip we saw a very long",
          "It was a dream to visit the highest building in the world.Hats off to the architects.The evening laser show is must see to see the moods of this building",
          "Not really worth the money and the time that goes in to getting to the top. Over Hyped. I would say avoid it if you can - go to Dubai Frame instead. Also do not buy the combo tickets with the Aquarium. Aquarium is a complete waste of money cos its too small lol",
          "Well worth the money, make sure you pay to go as high as you can though, fabulous experience. The lift is very fast and you hardly feel any movement. You are greeted with a drink and nibbles, the staff are lovely the views amazing. Also by paying to go to the top, you are given",
          "I feel this is very overpriced for what it is. The ques can be long so they encourage you to prebook, however watch the weather reports, Dubai often gets a sea fog which burns off... you really need clear weather to see the views properly.",
          "Overall experience is ok, maybe one would expect bit more for the money. It is convenient to skip the lines and go in smaller groups up and down. Guide was nice and informative. The ride up is a fast elevator ride up - it would be much more if any other multimedia was involved,",
          "Its a good activity for a one time experience. You get nice views of the downtown from above. Personally, I would like to visit Burj when Dubai fountains are going on so that you get an excellent view from the top.",
          "The fastest elevator in the world. I believe? This is a must do trip and the elevator alone is worth the ride.",
          "Having visited the New York one world observatory we had high expectations for the Burj. I must admit it was a bit of a none event and very expensive considering we was in and out within the hour- like many other reviewers I wouldn\u2019t bother with sunset. Dubai has 2 modes, sunny",
          "lots to do At The Top - even during a sandstorm when the views were somewhat limited - lots to read and learn",
          "great views , watch the weather report before , take the 5pm tour then you can relax , enjoy the views while the sun sets and also get the night views .",
          "great tour, amazing coffee, we got some really good photos, just make sure you have a jacket if you plan to be on the deck",
          "Paying to much to go all the way to the top. In norwegian krones we payed 2.800,- for two persons. About 270 Euros But the building was great and nice staff serving tee, coffee and petit fours. It is a lot cheaper to go half way, so that is my advice.",
          "It took exactly 1 minute to climb the 124 floor. The first view was amazing. Lucky that the weather was clear and not dusty. Had good photo session.",
          "We booked the sunrise tour which takes place only on Fridays and Saturdays in the early morning and it was a good decision. Not only are the tickets cheaper than primetime sunset tickets and with equally good views if not better, there were almost no lines and we actually had",
          "Great VIP tour! No waiting in line, just book tickets online before you go. Went with 6 year old and he loved it. Live music, 1 alcoholic drink included and continuous appetizers. You are free to roam around between 3 different floors for 2 hours and go out to the outdoor deck.",
          "Very crowded and long line but worth it. The design interiors are truly amazing. Also there is a terrace where you can for even more amazing pictures.",
          "Very nice experience on the tallest building of the world!! You can see a 360\u00b0 view of Dubai and try the emotion to be so high! Price little bit expensive but it's one time experience.",
          "Yes it's the tallest building.. but really... paying $461aud for a ride in a lift to see a very murky view of a city half way up a building. No thank you",
          "Don\u2019t book at the Burj ticket office we got 2 tickets on the LG floor of the mall by the fountain exit with Arabia horizon tours who have a stand there. We paid 560 dirhams for 2 with a coffee and pastry at the cafe which would have been this price for 1 person if we had booked",
          "I watched the weather to get the clearest day. Went in the morning. If wind is in the forecast, expect haziness. I reserve online and had a quicker queue. Went about 10:30am. They don\u2019t do a good job of moving the crowds along so be patient with rude tourists who take their",
          "I went to The Burj Khalif for afternoon tea. This was superb, everything was so well presented and tasted amazing. With fantastic views too. The staff were so pleasant and made this a special afternoon. From start to finish I loved it. Would recommend this to everyone.",
          "This is a once in a lifetime trip. The views are terrific and the guide very informative. Many great views and photo opportunities. A fabulous experience for all.",
          "Lines were very long to get both up and down from the 125th floor. Very crowded but worth the visit. I would recommend you buy the express pass so you can bypass the line ups.",
          "We booked the dinner/at the top combo for my partner's Birthday, with a pre-arranged time. Once at the top, the queue to get to the lifts (to return down) was 1 hour and 20 minutes. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were advised the able was being prepared- after 5",

          "Once you\u2019re up there you have the most amazing views even though the weather was overcast. Great museum showing before and after shots and lots of interesting info about the building. Trouble booking though so cost more on the day but worth it in the end.",
          "What a place to visit. Burj Khalifa at the top. Beautiful sunset view over the Dubai. It\u2019s the tallest building in the world. Visit Dubai to get this wonderful experience.",
          "What amazing views from up at the 154th floor! Went up for the Bubbly Sundowner on Saturday night for sunset. Unfortunately, it was cloudy and a little rainy but the views were still spectacular. Even being outside on the viewing deck, 152nd floor, in the winds, was amazing",
          "My second experience now of levels 124/125. The queue wasn't too bad (our slot was 2pm) and would say we were up between 3-3:30pm but the queue keeps moving. Anyone going at the moment look out for the angel wings! There is one outside on level 124, one up on level 125, and one",
          "What an amazing experience. Fantastic views. Speed of lifts to the 800 metres top was 124 floors - so swift and no feelings at all. Wow. Expensive but well worth the trip. We had afternoon tea and cakes etc. There are lots of apartments there and offices so you can only",
          "The second from Last time we were in Dubai, we saw on of the first stones being laid on this Building, the next time (on a stop over) we saw the finished article and said we have to come back to go to the top. this happened a few days ago. because my Partner had difficulty in",
          "Another great experience in Dubai. Although a little bit pricey, I think it worth every penny. Great views, specially at night when all the city lights up.",
          "This view is nice. you can purchase ticket for Floor 125 and can walk down to 124 and can enjoy the view from both floor. Suggested to go before sunset , so that you can spend perfect time to view city in daylight, sunset as well night view of Dubai from top . There are",
          "It was made to be an evergreen memory by accommodating people not only for viewing, but also with entertaining photographic options and a breakfast option. There are interesting facts like the elephant to concrete comparisons etc.. where also",
          "For some unfathomable reason, even if you have paid for your tickets online and are issued an e-ticket, the venue makes you stand in queue to swap this out for a paper ticket. This results in a huge wait to get to the top (it took me 50 minutes from arriving to the queue, to get",
          "Really nice views from the top, but the city of Dubai is not as impressive as NY or Singapore, so it's just nice. Bit of a faff to get up there, though.",
          "We did the bubbly sundowners on the 153rd floor. We thought it was worth the price difference to skip the queues and go to the highest possible lounge. The view is definately something to experience.. Our one comment was that the space felt over booked for the amount of seating",
          "A must visit if you are in Dubai.The thrill of being at the top of the world is just superb.The view from up there is really magnificent! Make sure you climb up in the evening when the sun sets! Extremely glorious view! Also make sure you spin out a memory coin with the Burj",
          "This was my second visit to the top. It could not have been different. While my first visit was enjoyable this time round it was anything but. Having bought our tickets in advance we arrived for our designated time slot. The queuing was unorganised and chaotic with people trying",
          "I was intrigued what the view would be like from the top of the highest building in the world, Burj Khalifa. As it was only 5:30am, there were hardly any people around and no queues. We were guided through the arrival area learning about the construction of the building and",
          "Great view from top, when sky are clear you'll see tip of horizon sharply. Many spots for photography. Good historical story about construction.",
          "A must do in Dubai, but one time is definitely enough. You should see if you can find some cheaper tickets on Groupon or other deal places, so you can go into the fast lane. You save so much time on that, you wont believe it! The views are amaxzing.",
          "We were able to make two visits to the Burj Khalifa during our stay in Dubai . Once through the VIP tour to the 148th floor and to the 124/125th floor on the second visit . The VIP tour is definitely faster as you skip all lines and you are accommodated by a guide that does a",
          "I have to admit I was kind of disappointed after my visit to Burj Khalifa tower. We bought the fast lane ticket and it\u2019s worth for skipping the long lines to go up. But for all the rest the attraction is not worth the ticket price. We reached the 124th floor with the super fast",
          "Great time but I enjoyed the lights and music better! That was great! 125th floor is better for the view",
          "It's hard to resist going up the tallest building in the world - at least for now. Great walk-through tour. A bit expensive but worth it. Must make reservations!",
          "We visited the Burj Khalifa as a family of 4 - the children are 12 and 10. We booked tickets in the UK before we flew to Dubai ... I joined the Dubai Groupon page and they were offering tickets 'At The Top' for half the price I'd seen anywhere else. So I bought them. We found",
          "As with other reviewers, definitely something to see when in Dubai - very impressive piece of engineering but the queues both to get to the top and come down are significantly long and quite stressful with people pushing etc. Perhaps the vip, queue jump option is the way",
          "The afternoon.... at the atmosphere restaurant was such an amazing experience with such wonderful service from the lovely staff it\u2019s a place with great food and lovely views",
          "I bought a discounted fast-track ticket on Groupon and as a result queue jumped several very long queues. As a result I was able to get up and down the Burj in 40 minutes as I didn\u2019t hang around very long at the \u2018top\u2019 (level 124/25). Without that ticket it would have taken",
          "We've been up to the 124th floor many times in the past 7 years. But the experience has changed dramatically in the past 12 months. At a minimum you pay about US$45 per ticket online to reserve a time and date. The Burj is a marvel of engineering. However, what plagues the",
          "Was very impressed with the design and forwarding think design that was used to build the Burj Khalifa. The staff were very friendly and flow within the building was we\u2019ll organized.",
          "While the view is quite awe inspiring, and the overall experience is quite enjoyable, I do feel it is way over priced. Especially compared with what most other activities cost. Still, I have no regrets... After making it to the 148th floor, you\u2019ll be served a refreshing",
          "We were so excited to visit the Burj Khalifa - At the Top. Since you have to pre-purchase tickets with specific times, I thought they were regulating how many people at a time were visiting here. Maybe they are, but the crowd size compared to the open area size was on the verge",
          "This is a tremendous. By going VIP you don.t neet to stand in the long lines of folk waiting, you get \"fast tracked\" to the top. There is an \"outside\" terrace you can go out on for an uninterupted view of Dubai. Awesome views from the tallest building on the planet.",
          "We visited in the evening. I enjoyed it, but I would definitely recommend visiting during the day as photo opportunities are much better. You can also probably see more? However it was great to see Dubai all lit up as it is a beautiful city. The queues were very long but well",
          "Its one of those visits so that one can say 'I have been there'. Tickets are pricey for what in essence at a very basic level is they ship you up in a lift to the 124/5th floor and you get to see the sites of Dubai though not clearly in day time due to the low mist depending on",
          "As the title says, an expensive attraction considering that all you get is an elevator ride. The views are good but still, it is a bit more than half-way up (Level 124) so you are not \"At the top\" - it is more like \"Halfway up\". I understand that there a practical limitations",
          "Amazing place to go up enjoy Good Aspects: Panaromic Views Nice place to go with family and freinds Take a nice insta pic with freinds and family and thats it... Bad Aspects: Pricey Not really lived up to?",
          "Now firstly, I'm not stupid. When it's called 'At the top', I didn't think you would actually get to the actual top- theres about 30 metres of spire on the top of the building, so that'd be mad! But I did think, quite reasonably I thought, that you'd be anywhere between 85%",
          "We took the sunset trip. If we are going to go up the Burj K - you might as well go to the top right? The downside this trip was 600AED each. This included a glass of wine at the top (I say wine because I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t champagne in the flute) or one drink of your choice.",
          "Fantastic experience for me and my family to see the beauty of Dubai from the top. There was gift shop which was rather expensive however most things were in Dubai but its well worth the experience.",
          "Hi world tallest building, wake up early heading to The Top to see sunrise, too bad, cloudy in the sky, can't see the sunrise today. Complimentary coffee and mushroom and ham croissant very nice.",
          "Views were amazing, we were lucky it was a clear day, worth spending a bit more money to go to the 148th floor, less crowded.",
          "We booked this on line. It was visit to the highest point accessible and then afternoon tea/canap\u00e9s and a glass of fizz. We were met on time which was great. The info was excellent and we went up in the double decker elevators. Lounge was lovely and tea and canap\u00e9s really",
          "This year was my second time At The Top. Chose Sundowner tickets this time. Took us to a different floors, even higher than Sky Tickets. Had glass of bublly and a great view. I personally reccomend to pay more and have the better and greater expreince than to wait in loooong",
          "At the top is not even close to the top. For some reason I tought it would be even higher beeing at the 125th floor, so I was a little dissapointed. You are higher than everything else arround but still I would have liked to get a even more tickeling feeling than I did.",
          "This is a must do activity when visiting Dubai. The buiding is stunning and can be seen from all of Dubai and from 148th floor all of Dubai unfurls like a carpet below you. We visited twice once in the day and in the evening. The view in the day is beautiful but by night the",
          "Amazing piece of architecture... the Burj Khalifa stands towering over Dubai! Worth a visit both day and night ... to see the lights of fountains around it... loved every minute!",
          "I would recommend this over the cheaper packages, not because it is amazing but just to skip the queue's. Yes the views were great and it was a good experiance but the tour guide told us nothing about the building I left knowing nothing more than I came knowing! I would",
          "We went for high tea... I know that you think that you have to do it, it is the tallest building in the world. But don\u2019t it\u2019s overpriced, you have to go through 8 checkpoints to be stuffed like sardines in an elevator to see dubai through dirty windows. The only good thing is",

          "Very impressive view from At The Top (148th floor). Very pricey though. It's nice that you don't have to spend a lot of time in a lane. But USD 140 is just too much for what you get. (Basically just a great view and a fast elevator ride.) Please be aware that if you book a tour",

          "We purchased the VIP passes to the 148th floor and got to skip all the lines plus go to all three viewing decks. The view from the top is amazing to say the least. It was interesting how the viewing angle was better from the top than the lower deck. Was it worth the extra money?",
          "Today we visited the Burj Khalifa we had paid for our tickets online and then waited in a queue to collect the tickets which to be fair went very quickly. On the way up the queue was ridiculously long took about 45mins just to get up to the viewing platform. The view itself is",
          "This is a must to do if never done before. The view from above on a clear day is beautiful, but the journey up itself in the elevators is an experience itself. However, lines can be crazy and the same for the tickets. Try and get your tickets online. If you have the ability,",

          "Wonderful experience",
          "Amzing is the least of what can be said. You'll go for 3 levels . The 148th then the 125th then the 12th. Don't forget to pass by the balconies in the 148th and 124th and the gift shop.",
          "Superb experience",
          "Average experience going up. Long queues, only two floors for standard ticket.Shops should have been moved downstairs as make the walking space really tight and overcrowded. nothing really spectacular about the views. You're always hunted for pictures..",
          "The price is big, but it worth it(evening price is higher). With each ticket included free unlimited drinks at the top viewpoint and private walk on a bridge between singing fountains.",
          "Way too expensive. Not really at the top at all. No specific animation or feature like a glass walkway above the city or anything spectacular like this which would worst that crazy price",

        "wiki": "Dubai ( doo-BY; Arabic: \u062f\u0628\u064a\u200e, romanized: Dubayy [d\u028a\u02c8bajj], Gulf Arabic pronunciation: [d\u0259\u02c8baj]) is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai.Located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf, Dubai aims to be the business hub of Western Asia. It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo. Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a major mercantile hub. Today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue comes from oil. A centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. According to government data, the population of Dubai is estimated at around 3.38 million as of January 2020.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nMany theories have been proposed as to origin of the word \"Dubai\". One theory suggests the word was used to be the souq, which was similar to the souq in Ba.  An Arabic proverb says \"Daba Dubai\" (Arabic: \u062f\u0628\u0627 \u062f\u0628\u064a\u200e), meaning \"They came with a lot of money.\" According to Fedel Handhal, a scholar on the UAE's history and culture, the word Dubai may have come from the word daba (Arabic: \u062f\u0628\u0627\u200e) (a past tense derivative of yadub (Arabic: \u064a\u062f\u0628\u200e), which means \"to creep\"), referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland. The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word, but to its alternative meaning of \"baby locust\" (Arabic: \u062c\u0631\u0627\u062f\u200e) due to the abundant nature of locusts in the area before settlement.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of human settlement in the area now defined by the United Arab Emirates is rich and complex, and points to extensive trading links between the civilisations of the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia, but also as far afield as the Levant. Archaeological finds in the emirate of Dubai, particularly at Al-Ashoosh, Al Sufouh and the notably rich trove from Saruq Al Hadid show settlement through the Ubaid and Hafit periods, the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods and the three Iron Ages in the UAE. The area was known to the Sumerians as Magan, and was a source for metallic goods, notably copper and bronze.The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland, becoming part of the city's present coastline. Pre-Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th centuries. Prior to the introduction of Islam to the area, the people in this region worshiped Bajir (or Bajar). After the spread of Islam in the region, the Umayyad Caliph of the eastern Islamic world invaded south-east Arabia and drove out the Sassanians. Excavations by the Dubai Museum in the region of Al-Jumayra (Jumeirah) found several artefacts from the Umayyad period.An early mention of Dubai is in 1095 in the Book of Geography by the Andalusian-Arab geographer Abu Abdullah al-Bakri. The Venetian pearl merchant Gasparo Balbi visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai (Dibei) for its pearling industry.\n\n\n=== Establishment of modern Dubai ===\nDubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century and was, by 1822, a town of some 700\u2013800 members of the Bani Yas tribe and subject to the rule of Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi.In 1833, following tribal feuding, members of the Al Bu Falasah tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves in Dubai. The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by Obeid bin Saeed and Maktoum bin Butti, who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836, leaving Maktum to establish the Maktoum dynasty.Dubai signed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 along with other Trucial States, following the British punitive expedition against Ras Al Khaimah of 1819, which also led to the bombardment of the coastal communities of the Persian Gulf. This led to the 1853 Perpetual Maritime Truce. Dubai also \u2013 like its neighbours on the Trucial Coast \u2013 entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the United Kingdom took responsibility for the emirate's security in 1892.\n\nIn 1841, a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality, forcing residents to relocate east to Deira. In 1896, fire broke out in Dubai, a disastrous occurrence in a town where many family homes were still constructed from barasti \u2013 palm fronds. The conflagration consumed half the houses of Bur Dubai, while the district of Deira was said to have been totally destroyed. The following year, more fires broke out. A female slave was caught in the act of starting one such blaze and was subsequently put to death.\n\nIn 1901, Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum established Dubai as a free port with no taxation on imports or exports and also gave merchants parcels of land and guarantees of protection and tolerance. These policies saw a movement of merchants not only directly from Lingeh, but also those who had settled in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah (which had historical links with Lingeh through the Al Qawasim tribe) to Dubai. An indicator of the growing importance of the port of Dubai can be gained from the movements of the steamer of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, which from 1899 to 1901 paid five visits annually to Dubai. In 1902 the company's vessels made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on, the steamers called fortnightly \u2013 in 1906, trading seventy thousand tonnes of cargo. The frequency of these vessels only helped to accelerate Dubai's role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference. Lorimer notes the transfer from Lingeh 'bids fair to become complete and permanent', and also that the town had by 1906 supplanted Lingeh as the chief entrep\u00f4t of the Trucial States.The 'great storm' of 1908 struck the pearling boats of Dubai and the coastal emirates towards the end of the pearling season that year, resulting in the loss of a dozen boats and over 100 men. The disaster was a major setback for Dubai, with many families losing their breadwinner and merchants facing financial ruin. These losses came at a time when the tribes of the interior were also experiencing poverty. In a letter to the Sultan of Muscat in 1911, Butti laments, 'Misery and poverty are raging among them, with the result that they are struggling, looting and killing among themselves.'\n\n\n=== Pre-oil Dubai ===\nDubai's geographical proximity to Iran made it an important trade location. The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen, chiefly those from Iran, many of whom eventually settled in the town. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was an important port. At that time, Dubai consisted of the town of Dubai and the nearby village of Jumeirah, a collection of some 45 areesh (palm leaf) huts. Dubai was known for its pearl exports until the 1930s; the pearl trade was damaged irreparably by the 1929 Great Depression and the innovation of cultured pearls. With the collapse of the pearling industry, Dubai fell into a deep depression and many residents lived in poverty or migrated to other parts of the Persian Gulf.In the early days since its inception, Dubai was constantly at odds with Abu Dhabi. In 1947, a border dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on the northern sector of their mutual border escalated into war. Arbitration by the British resulted in a cessation of hostilities.\n\nDespite a lack of oil, Dubai's ruler from 1958, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, used revenue from trading activities to build infrastructure. Private companies were established to build and operate infrastructure, including electricity, telephone services and both the ports and airport operators. An airport of sorts (a runway built on salt flats) was established in Dubai in the 1950s and, in 1959, the emirate's first hotel, the Airlines Hotel, was constructed. This was followed by the Ambassador and Carlton Hotels in 1968.Sheikh Rashid commissioned John Harris from Halcrow, a British architecture firm, to create the city's first master plan in 1959. Harris imagined a Dubai that would rise from the historic center on Dubai Creek, with an extensive road system, organised zones, and a town center, all of which could feasibly be built with the limited financial resources at the time.1959 saw the establishment of Dubai's first telephone company, 51% owned by IAL (International Aeradio Ltd) and 49% by Sheikh Rashid and local businessmen and in 1961 both the electricity company and telephone company had rolled out operational networks. The water company (Sheikh Rashid was Chairman and majority shareholder) constructed a pipeline from wells at Awir and a series of storage tanks and, by 1968, Dubai had a reliable supply of piped water.On 7 April 1961, the Dubai-based MV Dara, a five thousand ton British flagged vessel that plied the route between Basra (Iraq), Kuwait and Bombay (India), was caught in unusually high winds off Dubai. Early the next morning in heavy seas off Umm al-Quwain, an explosion tore out the second class cabins and started fires. The captain gave the order to abandon ship but two lifeboats capsized and a second explosion occurred. A flotilla of small boats from Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman and Umm al-Quwain picked up survivors, but 238 of the 819 persons on board were lost in the disaster.Construction of Dubai's first airport was started on the Northern edge of the town in 1959 and the terminal building opened for business in September 1960. The airport was initially serviced by Gulf Aviation (flying Dakotas, Herons and Viscounts) but Iran Air commenced services to Shiraz in 1961.In 1962 the British Political Agent noted that \"Many new houses and blocks of offices and flats are being built... the Ruler is determined, against advice [from the British] to press on with the construction of a jet airport... More and more European and Arab firms are opening up and the future looks bright.\"In 1962, with expenditure on infrastructure projects already approaching levels some thought imprudent, Sheikh Rashid approached his brother in law, the Ruler of Qatar, for a loan to build the first bridge crossing Dubai's creek. This crossing was finished in May 1963 and was paid for by a toll levied on the crossing from the Dubai side of the creek to the Deira side.BOAC was originally reluctant to start regular flights between Bombay and Dubai, fearing a lack of demand for seats. However, by the time the asphalt runway of Dubai Airport was constructed in 1965, opening Dubai to both regional and long haul traffic, a number of foreign airlines were competing for landing rights. In 1970 a new airport terminal building was constructed which included Dubai's first duty-free shops.Throughout the 1960s Dubai was the centre of a lively gold trade, with 1968 imports of gold at some \u00a356 million. This gold was, in the vast majority, re-exported - mainly to customers who took delivery in international waters off India. The import of gold to India had been banned and so the trade was characterised as smuggling, although Dubai's merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.In 1966, more gold was shipped from London to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (Only France and Switzerland took more), at 4 million ounces. Dubai also took delivery of over $15 million-worth of watches and over 5 million ounces of silver. The 1967 price of gold was $35 an ounce but its market price in India was $68 an ounce \u2013 a healthy markup. Estimates at the time put the volume of gold imports from Dubai to India at something like 75% of the total market.\n\n\n=== Oil era ===\n\nAfter years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring Abu Dhabi, oil was eventually discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966, albeit in far smaller quantities. The first field was named 'Fateh' or 'good fortune'. This led to an acceleration of Sheikh Rashid's infrastructure development plans and a construction boom that brought a massive influx of foreign workers, mainly Asians and Middle easterners. Between 1968 and 1975 the city's population grew by over 300%.As part of the infrastructure for pumping and transporting oil from the Fateh field, located offshore of the Jebel Ali area of Dubai, two 500,000 gallon storage tanks were built, known locally as 'Kazzans', by welding them together on the beach and then digging them out and floating them to drop onto the seabed at the Fateh field. These were constructed by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company, which gave the beach its local name (Chicago Beach), which was transferred to the Chicago Beach Hotel, which was demolished and replaced by the Jumeirah Beach Hotel in the late 1990s. The Kazzans were an innovative oil storage solution which meant super-tankers could moor offshore even in bad weather and avoided the need to pipe oil onshore from Fateh, which is some 60 miles out to sea.Dubai had already embarked on a period of infrastructural development and expansion. Oil revenue, flowing from 1969 onwards supported a period of growth with Sheikh Rashid embarking on a policy of building infrastructure and a diversified trading economy before the emirate's limited reserves were depleted. Oil accounted for 24% of GDP in 1990, but had reduced to 7% of GDP by 2004.Critically, one of the first major projects Sheikh Rashid embarked upon when oil revenue started to flow was the construction of Port Rashid, a deep water free port constructed by British company Halcrow. Originally intended to be a four-berth port, it was extended to sixteen berths as construction was ongoing. The project was an outstanding success, with shipping queuing to access the new facilities. The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972, although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built. Port Rashid was to be further expanded in 1975 to add a further 35 berths before the larger port of Jebel Ali was constructed.Port Rashid was the first of a swath of projects designed to create a modern trading infrastructure, including roads, bridges, schools and hospitals.\n\n\n=== Reaching the UAE's Act of Union ===\n\nDubai and the other 'Trucial States' had long been a British protectorate where the British government took care of foreign policy and defence, as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Gulf, the result of a treaty signed in 1892, the 'Exclusive Agreement'. This was to change with PM Harold Wilson's announcement, on 16 January 1968, that all British troops were to be withdrawn from 'East of Aden'. The decision was to pitch the coastal emirates, together with Qatar and Bahrain, into fevered negotiations to fill the political vacuum that the British withdrawal would leave behind.The principle of union was first agreed between the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and Sheikh Rashid of Dubai on 18 February 1968 meeting in an encampment at Argoub Al Sedirah, near Al Semeih, a desert stop between the two emirates. The two agreed to work towards bringing the other emirates, including Qatar and Bahrain, into the union. Over the next two years, negotiations and meetings of the rulers followed -often stormy- as a form of union was thrashed out. The nine-state union was never to recover from the October 1969 meeting where heavy-handed British intervention resulted in a walk-out by Qatar and Ras Al Khaimah. Bahrain and Qatar dropped out of talks, leaving six of the seven 'trucial' emirates to agree on union on 18 July 1971.On 2 December 1971, Dubai, together with Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Quwain and Fujairah joined in the Act of Union to form the United Arab Emirates. The seventh emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the UAE on 10 February 1972, following Iran's annexation of the RAK-claimed Tunbs islands.In 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency: the UAE dirham. In that same year, the prior monetary union with Qatar was dissolved and the UAE Dirham was introduced throughout the Emirates.\n\n\n=== Modern Dubai ===\n\nDuring the 1970s, Dubai continued to grow from revenues generated from oil and trade, even as the city saw an influx of immigrants fleeing the Lebanese civil war. Border disputes between the emirates continued even after the formation of the UAE; it was only in 1979 that a formal compromise was reached that ended disagreements. The Jebel Ali port, a deep-water port that allowed larger ships to dock, was established in 1979. The port was not initially a success, so Sheikh Mohammed established the JAFZA (Jebel Ali Free Zone) around the port in 1985 to provide foreign companies unrestricted import of labour and export capital. Dubai airport and the aviation industry also continued to grow.\nThe Gulf War of 1990 had a negative financial effect on the city, as depositors withdrew their money and traders withdrew their trade, but subsequently, the city recovered in a changing political climate and thrived. Later in the 1990s, many foreign trading communities\u2014first from Kuwait, during the Gulf War, and later from Bahrain, during the Shia unrest\u2014moved their businesses to Dubai. Dubai provided refuelling bases to allied forces at the Jebel Ali Free Zone during the Gulf War, and again during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Large increases in oil prices after the Gulf War encouraged Dubai to continue to focus on free trade and tourism.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nDubai is situated on the Persian Gulf coast of the United Arab Emirates and is roughly at sea level (16 m or 52 ft above). The emirate of Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi in the south, Sharjah in the northeast, and the Sultanate of Oman in the southeast. Hatta, a minor exclave of the emirate, is surrounded on three sides by Oman and by the emirates of Ajman (in the west) and Ras Al Khaimah (in the north). The Persian Gulf borders the western coast of the emirate. Dubai is positioned at 25.2697\u00b0N 55.3095\u00b0E\ufeff / 25.2697; 55.3095 and covers an area of 1,588 sq mi (4,110 km2), which represents a significant expansion beyond its initial 1,500 sq mi (3,900 km2) designation due to land reclamation from the sea.Dubai lies directly within the Arabian Desert. However, the topography of Dubai is significantly different from that of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai's landscape is highlighted by sandy desert patterns, while gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country. The sand consists mostly of crushed shell and coral and is fine, clean and white. East of the city, the salt-crusted coastal plains, known as sabkha, give way to a north\u2013south running line of dunes. Farther east, the dunes grow larger and are tinged red with iron oxide.The flat sandy desert gives way to the Western Hajar Mountains, which run alongside Dubai's border with Oman at Hatta. The Western Hajar chain has an arid, jagged and shattered landscape, whose mountains rise to about 1,300 metres (4,265 feet) in some places. Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases; however, Dubai does have a natural inlet, Dubai Creek, which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through. Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes, which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains. A vast sea of sand dunes covers much of southern Dubai and eventually leads into the desert known as The Empty Quarter. Seismically, Dubai is in a very stable zone\u2014the nearest seismic fault line, the Zagros Fault, is 200 kilometres (124 miles) from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai. Experts also predict that the possibility of a tsunami in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami.\n\nThe sandy desert surrounding the city supports wild grasses and occasional date palms. Desert hyacinths grow in the sabkha plains east of the city, while acacia and ghaf trees grow in the flat plains within the proximity of the Western Al Hajar mountains. Several indigenous trees such as the date palm and neem as well as imported trees such as the eucalypts grow in Dubai's natural parks. The houbara bustard, striped hyena, caracal, desert fox, falcon and Arabian oryx are common in Dubai's desert. Dubai is on the migration path between Europe, Asia and Africa, and more than 320 migratory bird species pass through the emirate in spring and autumn. The waters of Dubai are home to more than 300 species of fish, including the hammour. The typical marine life off the Dubai coast includes tropical fish, jellyfish, coral, dugong, dolphins, whales and sharks. Various types of turtles can also be found in the area including the hawksbill turtle and green turtle, which are listed as endangered species.Dubai Creek runs northeast\u2013southwest through the city. The eastern section of the city forms the locality of Deira and is flanked by the emirate of Sharjah in the east and the town of Al Aweer in the south. The Dubai International Airport is located south of Deira, while the Palm Deira is located north of Deira in the Persian Gulf. Much of Dubai's real-estate boom is concentrated to the west of Dubai Creek, on the Jumeirah coastal belt. Port Rashid, Jebel Ali, Burj Al Arab, the Palm Jumeirah and theme-based free-zone clusters such as Business Bay are all located in this section. Dubai is notable for sculpted artificial island complexes including the Palm Islands and The World archipelago.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nDubai has a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh). Summers in Dubai are extremely hot, windy, and humid, with an average high around 41 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) and overnight lows around 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in the hottest month, August. Most days are sunny throughout the year. Winters are comparatively cool with an average high of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) and overnight lows of 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January, the coolest month. Precipitation, however, has been increasing in the last few decades, with accumulated rain reaching 110.7 mm (4.36 in) per year. Dubai summers are also known for the very high humidity level, which can make it very uncomfortable for many with exceptionally high dew points in summer. Heat index values can reach over 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F) at the height of summer. The highest recorded temperature in Dubai is 49.0 \u00b0C (120.2 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nDubai has been ruled by the Al Maktoum family since 1833; the emirate is a constitutional monarchy. Dubai citizens participate in the electoral college to vote representatives to the Federal National Council of the UAE. The ruler, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is also the Vice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and member of the Supreme Council of the Union (SCU). Dubai appoints 8 members in two-term periods to the Federal National Council (FNC) of the UAE, the supreme federal legislative body.The Dubai Municipality (DM) was established by the then-ruler of Dubai, Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, in 1954 for purposes of city planning, citizen services and upkeep of local facilities. DM is chaired by Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum, deputy ruler of Dubai, and comprises several departments such as the Roads Department, Planning and Survey Department, Environment and Public Health Department and Financial Affairs Department. In 2001, Dubai Municipality embarked on an e-Government project with the intention of providing 40 of its city services through its web portal, [dubai.ae]. Thirteen such services were launched by October 2001, while several other services were expected to be operational in the future. Dubai Municipality is also in charge of the city's sanitation and sewage infrastructure.The UAE has a Minister of Happiness, appointed by Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The UAE has also appointed a Minister of Tolerance to promote tolerance as a fundamental value of the UAE, a country filled with a diverse range of faiths and ethnicities, and also a Minister for Youth Affairs.\n\n\n=== Law enforcement ===\nThe Dubai Police Force, founded in 1956 in the locality of Naif, has law enforcement jurisdiction over the emirate. The force is under direct command of Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum.\n\nDubai and Ras al Khaimah are the only emirates that do not conform to the federal judicial system of the United Arab Emirates. The emirate's judicial courts comprise the Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Cassation. The Court of First Instance consists of the Civil Court, which hears all civil claims; the Criminal Court, which hears claims originating from police complaints; and Sharia Court, which is responsible for matters between Muslims. Non-Muslims do not appear before the Sharia Court. The Court of Cassation is the supreme court of the emirate and hears disputes on matters of law only.\n\n\n=== Alcohol laws ===\nAlcohol sale and consumption, though legal, is tightly regulated. Adult non-Muslims are allowed to consume alcohol in licensed venues, typically within hotels, or at home with the possession of an alcohol licence. Places other than hotels, clubs, and specially designated areas are typically not permitted to sell alcohol. As in other parts of the world, drinking and driving is illegal, with 21 being the legal drinking age in the Emirate of Dubai.\n\n\n== Human rights ==\n\nCompanies in Dubai have in the past been criticised for human rights violations against labourers. Some of the 250,000 foreign labourers in the city have been alleged to live in conditions described by Human Rights Watch as \"less than humane\". The mistreatment of foreign workers was a subject of the difficult-to-make documentary, Slaves in Dubai (2009). The Dubai government has denied labour injustices and stated that the watchdog's (Human Rights Watch) accusations were 'misguided'. The filmmaker explained in interviews how it was necessary to go undercover to avoid discovery by the authorities, who impose high fines on reporters attempting to document human rights abuses, including the conditions of construction workers. Towards the end of March 2006, the government had announced steps to allow construction unions. UAE labour minister Ali al-Kaabi said: \"Labourers will be allowed to form unions.\"Homosexual acts are illegal under UAE law. Freedom of speech in Dubai is limited, with both residents and citizens facing severe sanctions from the government for speaking out against the royal family or local laws and culture. Most of the low paid labourers are victims of human trafficking or forced labour while some women are even trafficked into the growing sex trade in Dubai, a centre of human trafficking and prostitution.Defamation on social media is a punishable offence in Dubai with fines up to half a million dirhams and jail term for up to 2 years. In January 2020, three Sri Lankan expats were fined AED 500,000 each for posting defamatory Facebook posts.\n\n\n== Crime ==\nDubai has one of the world's lowest crime rates, and in 2019 was ranked the seventh-safest city in the world. The Security Industry Regulatory Agency classified the crimes into six categories. These crimes include theft, forced robbery, domestic burglary, fraud, sexual assault and abuse, and criminal damages.As per Gulf News, Dubai Police stated that the crime in Dubai is reduced by fifteen percent during 2017. However, the cases of drugs operation increased by eight percent. Major-General Abdullah Khalifa Al Merri, Commander-in-Chief of Dubai Police, hailed the force which solved 86 percent of criminal cases.The statistics also indicated that murder crimes dropped from 0.5 in 2016 to 0.3 in 2017 for every 100,000 population, while violent and aggressive crimes in the past 5 years went from 2.2 crimes per 100,000 and dropped to 1.2 by the end of 2017, pointed out Al Mansouri. General crimes have decreased since 2013, registering around 0.2 by the end of 2017. Robberies went from 3.8 in 2013 to 2.1 by the end of last year, while kidnapping cases also dropped from 0.2 in 2013 to 0.1 in 2017.\nVehicle thefts in 2013 were 3.8 per 100,000 population and fell to 1.7 in 2017. All the stolen vehicles were also recovered after being smuggled to neighbouring countries, in cooperation with the competent authorities there. According to the US Bureau of Diplomatic Security, petty theft, pickpocketing, scams, and sexual harassment still occur although they are usually not violent and weapons are not involved.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Ethnicity and languages ===\n\nAs of September 2019, the population is 3,331,420 \u2013 an annual increase of 177,020 people which represents a growth rate of 5.64%. The region covers 1,287.5 square kilometres (497.1 sq mi). The population density is 408.18/km2 \u2013 more than eight times that of the entire country. Dubai is the second most expensive city in the region and 20th most expensive city in the world.As of 2013, only about 15% of the population of the emirate was made up of UAE nationals, with the rest comprising expatriates, many of whom either have been in the country for generations or were born in the UAE. Approximately 85% of the expatriate population (and 71% of the emirate's total population) was Asian, chiefly Indian (51%) and Pakistani (16%); other significant Asian groups include Bangladeshis (9%) and Filipinos (3%). There is a sizeable community of Somalis numbering around 30,000, as well as other communities of various nationalities. A quarter of the population (local and foreign) reportedly traces their origins to Iran. In addition, 16% of the population (or 288,000 persons) living in collective labour accommodation were not identified by ethnicity or nationality, but were thought to be primarily Asian. There are over 100,000 British expatriates in Dubai, by far the largest group of Western expatriates in the city. The median age in the emirate was about 27 years. In 2014, there were estimated to be 15.54 births and 1.99 deaths per 1,000 people. There are other Arab nationals, including GCC nationals.Arabic is the national and official language of the United Arab Emirates. The Gulf dialect of Arabic is spoken natively by the Emirati people. English is used as a second language. Other major languages spoken in Dubai due to immigration are Malayalam, Hindi-Urdu (or Hindustani), Gujarati, Persian, Sindhi, Tamil, Punjabi, Pashto, Bengali, Balochi, Tulu, Kannada, Sinhala, Marathi, Telugu, Tagalog and Chinese, in addition to many other languages.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nArticle 7 of the UAE's Provisional Constitution declares Islam the official state religion of the UAE. The government subsidises almost 95% of mosques and employs all Imams; approximately 5% of mosques are entirely private, and several large mosques have large private endowments. All mosques in Dubai are managed by the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department also known as \"Awqaf\" under the Government of Dubai and all Imams are appointed by the Government. The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates provides for freedom of religion. Any person held preaching religious hatred or promoting religious extremism is usually jailed and deported.Dubai has large Christian, Hindu, Sikh, Bah\u00e1'\u00ed, Buddhist and other religious communities residing in the city.Non-Muslim groups can own their own houses of worship, where they can practice their religion freely, by requesting a land grant and permission to build a compound. Groups that do not have their own buildings are allowed to use the facilities of other religious organisations or worship in private homes. Non-Muslim religious groups are also permitted to advertise group functions openly and distribute various religious literature. Catholics are served pastorally by the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia. British preacher Reverend Andrew Thompson claimed that the United Arab Emirates is one of the most tolerant places in the world towards Christians and that it is easier to be a Christian in the UAE than in the UK.\nOn 5 April 2020, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced the building of one of their Temples in Dubai. As part of the announcement, church President Russell M. Nelson said that \u201cThe plan for a temple in Dubai comes in response to their gracious invitation, which we gratefully acknowledge.\u201d\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nOne of the world's fastest growing economies, Dubai's gross domestic product is projected at US$107.1 billion, with a growth rate of 6.1% in 2014. Although a number of core elements of Dubai's trading infrastructure were built on the back of the oil industry, revenues from oil and natural gas account for less than 5% of the emirate's revenues. It is estimated that Dubai produces 50,000 to 70,000 barrels (7,900 to 11,100 m3) of oil a day and substantial quantities of gas from offshore fields. The emirate's share in the UAE's total gas revenues is about 2%. Dubai's oil reserves have diminished significantly and are expected to be exhausted in 20 years. Real estate and construction (22.6%), trade (16%), entrep\u00f4t (15%) and financial services (11%) are the largest contributors to Dubai's economy.Dubai's non-oil foreign trade stood at $362 billion in 2014. Of the overall trade volumes, imports had the biggest share with a value of $230 billion while exports and re-exports to the emirate stood at $31 billion and $101 billion respectively.By 2014, China had emerged as Dubai's largest international trading partner, with a total of $47.7 billion in trade flows, up 29% from 2013. India was second among Dubai's key trading partners with a trade of $29.7 billion, followed by the United States at $22.62 billion. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was Dubai's fourth trading partner globally and first in the GCC and Arab world with a total trade value of $14.2 billion. Trade with Germany in 2014 totalled $12.3, Switzerland and Japan both at $11.72 billion and UK trade totalled $10.9 billion.\n\nHistorically, Dubai and its twin across Dubai Creek, Deira (independent of Dubai City at that time), were important ports of call for Western manufacturers. Most of the new city's banking and financial centres were headquartered in the port area. Dubai maintained its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s. Dubai has a free trade in gold and, until the 1990s, was the hub of a \"brisk smuggling trade\" of gold ingots to India, where gold import was restricted. Dubai's Jebel Ali port, constructed in the 1970s, has the largest man-made harbour in the world and was ranked seventh globally for the volume of container traffic it supports. Dubai is also a hub for service industries such as information technology and finance, with industry-specific free zones throughout the city. Dubai Internet City, combined with Dubai Media City as part of TECOM (Dubai Technology, Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority), is one such enclave, whose members include IT firms such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Google, EMC Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Dell and IBM, and media organisations such as MBC, CNN, BBC, Reuters, Sky News and AP.\n\nThe government's decision to diversify from a trade-based, oil-reliant economy to one that is service- and tourism-oriented made property more valuable, resulting in the property appreciation from 2004 to 2006. A longer-term assessment of Dubai's property market, however, showed depreciation; some properties lost as much as 64% of their value from 2001 to November 2008. The large-scale real estate development projects have led to the construction of some of the tallest skyscrapers and largest projects in the world such as the Emirates Towers, the Burj Khalifa, the Palm Islands and the most expensive hotel, the Burj Al Arab. Dubai's property market experienced a major downturn in 2008 and 2009 as a result of the slowing economic climate. By early 2009, the situation had worsened with the Great Recession taking a heavy toll on property values, construction and employment. This has had a major impact on property investors in the region, some of whom were unable to release funds from investments made in property developments. As of February 2009, Dubai's foreign debt was estimated at approximately $80 billion, although this is a tiny fraction of the sovereign debt worldwide.\n\nThe Dubai Financial Market (DFM) was established in March 2000 as a secondary market for trading securities and bonds, both local and foreign. As of the fourth quarter 2006, its trading volume stood at about 400 billion shares, worth $95 billion in total. The DFM had a market capitalisation of about $87 billion. The other Dubai-based stock exchange is NASDAQ Dubai, which is the international stock exchange in the Middle East. It enables a range of companies, including UAE and regional small and medium-sized enterprises, to trade on an exchange with an international brand name, with access by both regional and international investors.DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Centre) was established in 2002. It's world's fastest-growing free zone and been nominated as \"Global Free Zone of the Year 2016\" by The Financial Times fDi Magazine.\nDubai is also known as the City of Gold because a major part of the economy is based on gold trades, with Dubai's total gold trading volumes in H1 2011 reaching 580 tonnes, with an average price of US$1,455 per troy ounce.A City Mayors survey ranked Dubai 44th among the world's best financial cities in 2007, while another report by City Mayors indicated that Dubai was the world's 27th richest city in 2012, in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). Dubai is also an international financial centre (IFC) and has been ranked 37th within the top 50 global financial cities as surveyed by the MasterCard Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index (2007), and 1st within the Middle East. Since it opened in September 2004, the Dubai IFC has attracted, as a regional hub, leading international firms and set-up the NASDAQ Dubai which lists equity, derivatives, structured products, Islamic bonds (sukuk) and other bonds. The Dubai IFC model is an independent risk-based regulator with a legislative system consistent with English common law.In 2012, the Global City Competitiveness Index by the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Dubai at No. 40 with a total score of 55.9. According to its 2013 research report on the future competitiveness of cities, in 2025, Dubai will have moved up to 23rd place overall in the Index. Indians, followed by Britons and Pakistanis are the top foreign investors in Dubai realty.Dubai has launched several major projects to support its economy and develop different sectors. These include Dubai Fashion 2020, and Dubai Design District, expected to become a home to leading local and international designers. The AED 4 billion first phase of the project will be complete by January 2015.In September 2019, Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum ordered to establish the Higher Committee for Real Estate Planning to study and evaluate future real estate construction projects, in ordered to achieve a balance between supply and demand, which is seen as a move to curb the pace of construction projects following property prices fall.Since the economy of Dubai relies majorly on real estate, transportation and tourism, it was highly exposed to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In April 2020, the American business and financial services company, Moody's Corporation reported that the coronavirus outbreak is likely to pose acute \u201cnegative growth and fiscal implications\u201d in Dubai. It was reported that in order to bolster its finances and overcome the impact of coronavirus on its economy, Dubai was in talks to raise billions of dollars of debt privately, where it was seeking loans of 1 billion dirhams ($272 million) to 2 billion dirhams from each lender. On 6 May, Dubai\u2019s businessman from the hospitality sector, Khalaf Al Habtoor stated that the coronavirus pandemic left the economy and his companies \u201cbleeding\u201d. The owner of seven hotels in the country, including the Waldorf Astoria on the man-made island Palm Jumeirah, Habtoor stated that Dubai\u2019s economy cannot afford to wait for the vaccine, before resuming the major activities.\n\n\n=== Tourism and retail ===\n\nTourism is an important part of the Dubai government's strategy to maintain the flow of foreign cash into the emirate. Dubai's lure for tourists is based mainly on shopping, but also on its possession of other ancient and modern attractions. As of 2018, Dubai is the fourth most-visited city in the world based on the number of international visitors and the fastest growing, increasing by a 10.7% rate. The city hosted 14.9 million overnight visitors in 2016, and is expected to reach 20 million tourists by 2020.\n\nDubai has been called the \"shopping capital of the Middle East\". Dubai alone has more than 70 shopping centres, including the world's largest shopping centre, Dubai Mall. Dubai is also known for the historical souk districts located on either side of its creek. Traditionally, dhows from East Asia, China, Sri Lanka, and India would discharge their cargo and the goods would be bargained over in the souks adjacent to the docks. Dubai Creek played a vital role in sustaining the life of the community in the city and was the resource which originally drove the economic boom in Dubai. As of September 2013, Dubai creek has been proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Many boutiques and jewellery stores are also found in the city. Dubai is also referred to as \"the City of Gold\" as the Gold Souk in Deira houses nearly 250 gold retail shops.\n\nDubai Creek Park in Dubai Creek also plays a vital role in Dubai tourism as it showcase some of the most famous tourist attractions in Dubai such as Dolphinarium, Cable Car, Camel Ride, Horse Carriage and Exotic Birds Shows.Dubai has a wide range of parks like Safa park, Mushrif park, Hamriya park, etc. Each park is uniquely distinct from the other. Mushrif park showcases different houses around the world. A visitor can check out the architectural features of the outside as well as the inside of each house.\nSome of the most popular beaches in Dubai are Umm Suqeim Beach, Al Mamzar Beach Park, JBR Open Beach, Kite Beach, Black Palace Beach and Royal Island Beach Club.\nMastercard's Global Destination Cities Index 2019 found that tourists spend more in Dubai than in any other country. In 2018, the country topped the list for the fourth year in a row with a total spend of $30.82 billion. The average spend per day was found to be $553.In October 2019, Dubai loosened its liquor laws for the first time in history, under which it allowed tourists to purchase alcohol from state-controlled stores. Previously, alcohol was only accessible for the locals with special licences. The crucial policy shift came as the United Arab Emirates witnessed severe economic crisis that led to a drop in alcohol sales by volume in a decade.\n\n\n=== Expo 2020 ===\n\nOn 2 November 2011, four cities had their bids for Expo 2020 already lodged, with Dubai making a last-minute entry. The delegation from the Bureau International des Expositions, which visited Dubai in February 2013 to examine the Emirate's readiness for the largest exposition, was impressed by the infrastructure and the level of national support. In May 2013, Dubai Expo 2020 Master Plan was revealed. Dubai then won the right to host Expo 2020 on 27 November 2013. The event will bring huge economic benefits by generating activities worth billions of dirhams and may create over 270,000 jobs.The main site of Dubai Expo 2020 will be a 438-hectare area (1,083 acres), part of the new Dubai Trade Centre Jebel Ali urban development, located midway between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Moreover, the Expo 2020 also created various social enlistment projects and monetary boons to the city targeting the year 2020, such as initiating the world's largest solar power project.The Dubai Expo 2020 is to take place from 20 October 2020 till 10 April 2021 for 173 days where there are to be 192 country pavilions featuring narratives from every part of the globe, have different thematic districts that would promote learning the wildlife in the forest exhibit to many other experiences.Due to the impact of COVID-19 the organisers of EXPO are seeking to postpone the EXPO by one year to begin in 2021.Dubai is trying to build an inclusive, barrier-free and a disabled-friendly city by the time it hosts Expo 2020. The city has already brought in changes by introducing wheelchair friendly taxis, pavements with slopes and tactile indicators on floor for the visually-impaired at all the metro stations.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nDubai has a rich collection of buildings and structures of various architectural styles. Many modern interpretations of Islamic architecture can be found here, due to a boom in construction and architectural innovation in the Arab World in general, and in Dubai in particular, supported not only by top Arab or international architectural and engineering design firms such as Al Hashemi and Aedas, but also by top firms of New York and Chicago. As a result of this boom, modern Islamic \u2013 and world \u2013 architecture has literally been taken to new levels in skyscraper building design and technology. Dubai now has more completed or topped-out skyscrapers higher than 2\u20443 km (2,200 ft), 1\u20443 km (1,100 ft), or 1\u20444 km (820 ft) than any other city. A culmination point was reached in 2010 with the completion of the Burj Khalifa (Khalifa Tower), now by far the world's tallest building at 829.8 m (2,722 ft). The Burj Khalifa's design is derived from the patterning systems embodied in Islamic architecture, with the triple-lobed footprint of the building based on an abstracted version of the desert flower hymenocallis which is native to the Dubai region.The completion of the Khalifa Tower, following the construction boom that began in the 1980s, accelerated in the 1990s, and took on a rapid pace of construction during the decade of the 2000s, leaves Dubai with the world's tallest skyline as of 4 January 2010. At the top, Burj Khalifa, the world's second highest observatory deck after the Shanghai Tower with an outdoor terrace is one of Dubai's most popular tourist attractions, with over 1.87 million visitors in 2013.\n\n\n==== Burj Al Arab ====\n\nThe Burj Al Arab (Arabic: \u0628\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628, Tower of the Arabs), a luxury hotel, is frequently described as \"the world's only 7-star\", though its management has said it has never made that claim. A Jumeirah Group spokesperson is quoted as saying: \"There's not a lot we can do to stop it. We're not encouraging the use of the term. We've never used it in our advertising.\" The hotel opened in December 1999.\n\n\n==== Burj Khalifa ====\n\nBurj Khalifa, known as the Burj Dubai before its inauguration, is a 828 metres (2,717 ft) high skyscraper in Dubai, and the tallest building in the world. The tower was inspired by the structure of the desert flower Hymenocallis. It was constructed by more than 30 contracting companies around the world with workers of a hundred nationalities. It is an architectural icon. The building opened on 4 January 2010.\n\n\n=== Palm Jumeirah ===\n\nThe Palm Jumeirah is an artificial archipelago, created using land reclamation by Nakheel, a company owned by the Dubai government, and designed and developed by Helman Hurley Charvat Peacock/Architects, Inc. It is one of three planned islands called the Palm Islands which extend into the Persian Gulf. The Palm Jumeirah is the smallest and the original of three Palm Islands, and it is located on the Jumeirah coastal area of Dubai. It was built between 2001 and 2006.\n\n\n=== Dubai Miracle Garden ===\n\nOn 14 February 2013, the Dubai Miracle Garden, a 72,000-metre (236,000-foot) flower garden, opened in Dubailand. It is the world's largest flower garden. The garden displays more than 50 million flowers with more than 70 species of flowering plants. The garden uses retreated waste water from city's municipality and utilises drip irrigation method for watering the plants. During the summer seasons from late May to September when the climate can get extremely hot with an average high of about 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F), the garden stays closed.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nTransport in Dubai is controlled by the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), an agency of the government of Dubai, formed by royal decree in 2005. The public transport network has in the past faced congestion and reliability issues which a large investment programme has addressed, including over AED 70 billion of improvements planned for completion by 2020, when the population of the city is projected to exceed 3.5 million. In 2009, according to Dubai Municipality statistics, there were an estimated 1,021,880 cars in Dubai. In January 2010, the number of Dubai residents who use public transport stood at 6%.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nFive main routes \u2013 E 11 (Sheikh Zayed Road), E 311 (Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road), E 44 (Dubai-Hatta Highway), E 77 (Dubai-Al Habab Road) and E 66 (Oud Metha Road, Dubai-Al Ain Road, or Tahnoun Bin Mohammad Al Nahyan Road) \u2013 run through Dubai, connecting the city to other towns and emirates. Additionally, several important intra-city routes, such as D 89 (Al Maktoum Road/Airport Road), D 85 (Baniyas Road), D 75 (Sheikh Rashid Road), D 73 (Al Dhiyafa Road now named as 2 December street), D 94 (Jumeirah Road) and D 92 (Al Khaleej/Al Wasl Road) connect the various localities in the city. The eastern and western sections of the city are connected by Al Maktoum Bridge, Al Garhoud Bridge, Al Shindagha Tunnel, Business Bay Crossing and Floating Bridge.The Public Bus Transport system in Dubai is run by the RTA. The bus system services 140 routes and transported over 109 million people in 2008. By the end of 2010, there will be 2,100 buses in service across the city. In 2006, the Transport authority announced the construction of 500 air-conditioned (A/C ) Passenger Bus Shelters, and planned for 1,000 more across the emirates in a move to encourage the use of public buses.All taxi services are licensed by the RTA. Dubai licensed taxis are easily identifiable by their cream bodywork colour and varied roof colours identifying the operator. Dubai Taxi Corporation, a division of the RTA, is the largest operator and has taxis with red roofs. There are five private operators: Metro Taxis (orange roofs); Network Taxis (yellow roofs); Cars Taxis (blue roofs); Arabia Taxis (green roofs); and City Taxis (purple roof). In addition, there is a Ladies and Families taxi service (pink roofs) with female drivers, which caters exclusively for women and children. There are more than 3000 taxis operating within the emirate making an average of 192,000 trips every day, carrying about 385,000 persons. In 2009 taxi trips exceeded 70 million trips serving around 140.45 million passengers.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nDubai International Airport (IATA: DXB), the hub for Emirates, serves the city of Dubai and other emirates in the country. The airport is the third-busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic and the world's busiest airport by international passenger traffic. In addition to being an important passenger traffic hub, the airport is the sixth-busiest cargo airport in world, handling 2.37 million tons of cargo in 2014. Emirates is the national airline of Dubai. As of 2018, it operated internationally serving over 150 destinations in over 70 countries across six continents.The development of Al Maktoum International Airport (IATA: DWC) was announced in 2004. The first phase of the airport, featuring one A380 capable runway, 64 remote stands, one cargo terminal with annual capacity for 250,000 tonnes of cargo and a passenger terminal building designed to accommodate five million passengers per year, has been opened. When completed, Dubai World Central-Al Maktoum International will be the largest airport in the world with five runways, four terminal buildings and capacity for 160 million passengers and 12 million tons of cargo.\n\n\n=== Metro rail ===\nDubai Metro consists of two lines (Red line and Green line) which run through the financial and residential areas of the city. It was opened on September 2009. UK-based international service company Serco is responsible for operating the metro.\nThe Red Line, which has 29 stations (4 underground, 24 elevated and 1 at ground level) running from Rashidiya Station to UAE Xchange Station in Jebel Ali, is the major backbone line. The Green Line, running from the Etisalat Station to the Creek Station, has 20 stations (8 underground, 12 elevated). An extension to the Red Line connecting the EXPO 2020 site is due to open in April 2020. A Blue and a Purple Line have also been planned. The Dubai Metro is the first urban train network in the Arabian Peninsula. The trains are fully automated and driverless.\n\n\n=== Palm Jumeirah Monorail ===\n\nA monorail line connecting the Palm Jumeirah to the mainland opened on 30 April 2009. It is the first monorail in the Middle East. An extension to connect to the Red Line of the Dubai Metro is planned.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nA tramway located in Al Sufouh, will run for 14.5 km (9.0 mi) along Al Sufouh Road from Dubai Marina to the Burj Al Arab and the Mall of the Emirates with two interchanges with Dubai Metro's Red Line. The first section, a 10.6 km (6.6 mi) long tram line which serves 11 stations, was opened in 2014.\n\n\n=== High speed rail ===\nDubai has announced it will complete a link of the UAE high-speed rail system which will eventually hook up with the whole GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council, also known as Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf) and then possibly Europe. The High Speed Rail will serve passengers and cargo.\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\nThere are two major commercial ports in Dubai, Port Rashid and Port Jebel Ali. Port Jebel Ali is the world's largest man-made harbour, the biggest port in the Middle East, and the 7th-busiest port in the world. One of the more traditional methods of getting across Bur Dubai to Deira is by abras, small boats that ferry passengers across the Dubai Creek, between abra stations in Bastakiya and Baniyas Road. The Marine Transport Agency has also implemented the Dubai Water Bus System. Water bus is a fully air conditioned boat service across selected destinations across the creek. One can also avail oneself of the tourist water bus facility in Dubai. Latest addition to the water transport system is the Water Taxi.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe UAE culture mainly revolves around traditional Arab culture. The influence of Arab and Islamic culture on its architecture, music, attire, cuisine, and lifestyle is very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques which are scattered around the country. Since 2006, the weekend has been Friday and Saturday, as a compromise between Friday's holiness to Muslims and the Western weekend of Saturday and Sunday. Prior to 2006, the weekend was Thursday-Friday.\nBecause of the touristic approach of many Dubaites in the entrepreneurial sector and the high standard of living, Dubai's culture has gradually evolved towards one of luxury, opulence, and lavishness with a high regard for leisure-related extravagance. Annual entertainment events such as the Dubai Shopping Festival (DSF) and Dubai Summer Surprises (DSS) attract over 4 million visitors from across the region and generate revenues in excess of $2.7 billion.\n\nDubai is known for its nightlife. Clubs and bars are found mostly in hotels because of liquor laws. The New York Times described Dubai as \"the kind of city where you might run into Michael Jordan at the Buddha Bar or stumble across Naomi Campbell celebrating her birthday with a multiday bash\".The city's cultural imprint as a small, ethnically homogeneous pearling community was changed with the arrival of other ethnic groups and nationals\u2014first by the Iranians in the early 1900s, and later by Indians and Pakistanis in the 1960s. In 2005, 84% of the population of metropolitan Dubai was foreign-born, about half of them from India.Major holidays in Dubai include Eid al Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, and National Day (2 December), which marks the formation of the United Arab Emirates.The International Festivals and Events Association (IFEA), the world's leading events trade association, has crowned Dubai as IFEA World Festival and Event City, 2012 in the cities category with a population of more than one million. Large shopping malls in the city, such as Deira City Centre, Mirdiff City Centre, BurJuman, Mall of the Emirates, Dubai Mall (the world's largest) and Ibn Battuta Mall as well as traditional Dubai Gold Souk and other souks attract shoppers from the region.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nArabic cuisine is very popular and is available everywhere in the city, from the small shawarma diners in Deira and Al Karama to the restaurants in Dubai's hotels. Fast food, South Asian, and Chinese cuisines are also very popular and are widely available. The sale and consumption of pork is regulated and is sold only to non-Muslims, in designated areas of supermarkets and airports. Similarly, the sale of alcoholic beverages is regulated. A liquor permit is required to purchase alcohol; however, alcohol is available in bars and restaurants within hotels. Shisha and qahwa boutiques are also popular in Dubai. Biryani is also a popular cuisine across Dubai with being the most popular among Indians and Pakistanis present in Dubai.The inaugural Dubai Food Festival was held between 21 February to 15 March 2014. According to Vision magazine, the event was aimed at enhancing and celebrating Dubai's position as the gastronomic capital of the region. The festival was designed to showcase the variety of flavours and cuisines on offer in Dubai featuring the cuisines of over 200 nationalities at the festival. The next food festival was held between 23 February 2017 to 11 March 2017.\n\n\n=== Entertainment ===\nDubai Opera opened its door on 31 August 2016 in Downtown Dubai with a performance by Pl\u00e1cido Domingo. The venue is a 2000-seat, multifunctional performing arts centre able to host not only theatrical shows, concerts and operas but also weddings, gala dinners, banquets and conferences.  \nArabic movies are popular in Dubai and the UAE. Since 2004, the city has hosted the annual Dubai International Film Festival which serves as a showcase for Arab and Middle Eastern film making talent. The Dubai Desert Rock Festival was also another major festival consisting of heavy metal and rock artists but is no longer held in Dubai.\nOne of the lesser known sides of Dubai is the importance of its young contemporary art gallery scene. Since 2008, the leading contemporary art galleries such as Carbon 12 Dubai, Green Art, gallery Isabelle van den Eynde, and The Third Line have brought the city onto the international art map. Art Dubai, the growing and reputable art fair of the region is as well a major contributor of the contemporary art scene's development.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nMany international news agencies such as Reuters, APTN, Bloomberg L.P. and Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC) operate in Dubai Media City and Dubai Internet City. Additionally, several local network television channels such as Dubai One (formerly Channel 33), and Dubai TV (EDTV) provide programming in English and Arabic respectively. Dubai is also the headquarters for several print media outlets. Dar Al Khaleej, Al Bayan and Al Ittihad are the city's largest circulating Arabic language newspapers, while Gulf News, Khaleej Times, Khaleej Mag and 7days are the largest circulating English newspapers.Etisalat, the government-owned telecommunications provider, held a virtual monopoly over telecommunication services in Dubai prior to the establishment of other, smaller telecommunications companies such as Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC\u2014better known as Du) in 2006. Internet was introduced into the UAE (and therefore Dubai) in 1995. The network has an Internet bandwidth of 7.5 Gbit/s with capacity of 49 STM1 links. Dubai houses two of four Domain Name System (DNS) data centres in the country (DXBNIC1, DXBNIC2). Censorship is common in Dubai and used by the government to control content that it believes violates the cultural and political sensitivities of Emirates. Homosexuality, drugs, and the theory of evolution are generally considered taboo.Internet content is regulated in Dubai. Etisalat uses a proxy server to filter Internet content that the government deems to be inconsistent with the values of the country, such as sites that provide information on how to bypass the proxy; sites pertaining to dating, gay and lesbian networks, and pornography; and sites originating from Israel. Emirates Media and Internet (a division of Etisalat) notes that as of 2002, 76% of Internet users are male. About 60% of Internet users were Asian, while 25% of users were Arab. Dubai enacted an Electronic Transactions and Commerce Law in 2002 which deals with digital signatures and electronic registers. It prohibits Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from disclosing information gathered in providing services. The penal code contains official provisions that prohibit digital access to pornography; however, it does not address cyber crime or data protection.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nFootball and cricket are the most popular sports in Dubai. Three teams (Al Wasl FC, Shabab Al-Ahli Dubai FC and Al Nasr SC) represent Dubai in UAE Pro-League. Al-Wasl have the second-most number of championships in the UAE League, after Al Ain. Dubai also hosts both the annual Dubai Tennis Championships and The Legends Rock Dubai tennis tournaments, as well as the Dubai Desert Classic golf tournament and the DP World Tour Championship, all of which attract sports stars from around the world. The Dubai World Cup, a thoroughbred horse race, is held annually at the Meydan Racecourse. Dubai also hosts the traditional rugby union tournament Dubai Sevens, part of the Sevens World Series Event pictures of Rugby 7 Dubai 2015. In 2009, Dubai hosted the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens. Auto racing is also a big sport in Dubai, the Dubai Autodrome is home to many auto racing events throughout the year. It also features a state-of-the-art indoor and outdoor Kartdrome, popular among racing enthusiasts and recreational riders.\n\n\n=== Dress code ===\nThe Emirati attire is typical of several countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Women usually wear the \"abaya\", a long black robe with a hijab (the head-scarf which covers the neck and part of the head-all of the hair and ears). Some women may add a niqab which cover the mouth and nose and only leaves the eyes exposed. Men wear the \"kandurah\" also referred to as \"dishdasha\" or even \"thawb\" (long white robe) and the headscarf (ghotrah). The UAE traditional ghotrah is white and is held in place by an accessory called \"egal\", which resembles a black cord. The younger Emiratis prefer to wear red and white ghotras and tie it round their head like a turban.The above dress code is never compulsory and many people wear western or other eastern clothing without any problems; but prohibitions on wearing \"indecent clothing\" or revealing too much skin are aspects of the UAE to which Dubai's visitors are expected to conform, and are encoded in Dubai's criminal law. The UAE has enforced decency regulations in most public places, aside from waterparks, beaches, clubs, and bars.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe school system in Dubai follows that of the United Arab Emirates. As of 2009, there are 79 public schools run by the Ministry of Education that serve Emiratis and expatriate Arab people as well as 145 private schools. The medium of instruction in public schools is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language, while most of the private schools use English as their medium of instruction. Most private schools cater to one or more expatriate communities.More than 15 schools offer an international education using the one or more of the four International Baccalaureate Programmes for students aged 3\u201319. Several schools have introduced the new IB Career-related Programme that can be combined with a vocational qualification such as a BTEC. The Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) signed an agreement with the IB in efforts to widen the options offered for parents and to meet the different needs of students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Additionally a number of schools offer either a CBSE or an Indian Certificate of Secondary Education Indian syllabus. The Indian High School, DPS, DMHS are some examples. Similarly, there are also several reputable Pakistani schools offering FBISE curriculum for expatriate children in Dubai.A number of schools also offer British primary education up to the age of eleven. British style eleven-to-eighteen secondary schools offering General Certificate of Secondary Education and A-Levels include Dubai Gem Private School, Dubai British School, English Language School Pvt. Some schools, such as The American School of Dubai, also offer the curriculum of the United States.The most well-known universities in Dubai are American University in Dubai, Hult International Business School, Al Ghurair University, The American College of Dubai, University of Wollongong in Dubai, British University in Dubai offering courses in Business Administration, Engineering, Architecture and Interior Design. American University in Dubai is one of the six UAE universities featured in QS World University Rankings 2014/2015. In 2013 Synergy University Dubai Campus opened its campus in Jumeirah Lakes Towers being a first University in Dubai to be located outside of Educational Zones (Knowledge Village or Academic City).\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nHealthcare in Dubai can be divided into two different sectors: public and private. Each Emirate is able to dictate healthcare standards according to their internal laws, although the standards and regulations rarely have extreme differences. Public hospitals in Dubai were first built in the late 1950s and continued to grow with public health initiatives. There are now 28 hospitals in Dubai, 6 public and 22 private, with 3 more major hospitals scheduled to be built by 2025.By the end of 2012, there were also a total of 1,348 medical clinics, 97% of which are operated privately. In 2015, Dubai phased in mandatory health insurance for all inhabitants, thereby leading to increased demand for medical services.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nDubai is twinned with the following cities:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nArchaeology of the United Arab Emirates\nAl Sufouh Archaeological Site\nDubai Desert Conservation Reserve\nList of buildings in Dubai\nList of people from Dubai\nSustainability in Dubai\nOutline of Dubai\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSyed Ali.

          "Best advice I can give you is DO NOT stand in the heavy crowd at the bottom near the fountain, jostling for a spot. It's not worth it. Instead, pay about 60 AED (15EURO) to take a small boat out during a song you enjoy (you can ask the playlist at info desks in the mall).",

          "The show lasts for barely a few minutes but the energy in the are at the time of the show and afterward, is simply magical. It's therapeutic to stand there and live the moments a little longer. Walking around looking at people clicking pictures, the sound of water, the breeze",

          "The spectacle is really impressive. You get chills on your spine. \ud83d\ude00 besides the fountains we also had a light show on burj khalifa. The restaurants nearby are strategically positioned for tourists to see the fountain show while enjoying a meal or a glass of whine.",
          "Nice show and nice fountain. was very busy and full of people which was nice but annoying at the same time",
          "It's really amazing to see such a great fountain show in Dubai. Its the best fountain show I have ever watched it.",
          "The fountains are a staple of Dubai, you cannot visit without seeing the fountain. I would recommend going to see it as night is falling in so you can see them lit up, they are on every 30 minutes I believe, and they dance to different music each time. It's great to stand and",
          "I watched the show in the afternoon. It lasted just a few minutes. It is nice to see when you are in the neighborhood. I would not bother to go there when you have to travel from far.",
          "always worth seeing when you go the the city. a great display, day or night, with very good viewing points to take it all in.",
          "These are very powerful and nice fountains. They go off regularly and you can get a good spot to watch similar to other fountains around the world. I suppose these types of fountains have lost their luster. At least for me, after I've seen similar fountains, they just aren't",
          "Enjoy the music and show every 30 minutes from 6PM. they are plenty of restaurants with a view on the fountain.",
          "This place is just an Amzing place to spend time with family. This is a must see when you visit Dubai and make sure to take your little ones, they will love it too!",
          "Fantastic light show with dancing fountains on the music. The show runs every 30 minutes for about 15 minutes. Plenty of spots to view it from. Some tourists would like to do a small boat ride around the fountain (don't know the cost). A must watch show. Ideally can be done when",
          "The timings change during the weekend, better to check them but roughly every 30 minutes. The show of music and lights change constantly, so you can visit often and still impress you.",
          "Great light show every 30 minutes. Free to view from Dubai Mall. Can get very busy as the evening goes on. Lots of restaurants nearby.",
          "The melodi,the music the synchronisation from everything was something amazing and relaxing. Really fantastic show",
          "It was an absolute joy to view the magnificent fountain show in the evening from the balcony of a restaurant on the 3rd level of Souk Al Bahar.",
          "I had heard good things about the Dubai fountains so after visiting the mall, we waited for 30mins amidst the gathering crowds to see the spectacle. We were left slightly underwhelmed - mainly because the show is very short and only a few minutes long. It's good, and it's free",
          "Dubai Fountain at the Dubai Mall. a MUST to visit, great fountain show at evenings from 6PM on the hour.",
          "Dubai visit is not complete without visiting Dubai Fountain. Enjoy the music from all over the world every half an hour with the dancing fountain.",
          "Great to have a meal/drink at a restaurant overlooking lake and watch display. Starts at 6pm and think it is every 30 minutes after that.",
          "when 1st time I visited this place, I never can imagine anywhere else in the world, So I try for many other places, but not found a place like this, now weekly I went there and I love to pass 1 hour just to see this.",
          "We went to Dubai Mall and accidentally exit to Dancing Fountain. It\u2019s was Amazing to watch. Wonderful!!!",
          "Is something special, very beautiful place, like in heaven is very difficult to discribe in words just unbeliveble!",
          "Pleased that we saw the fountains but it\u2019s fair to say it was a little underwhelming. Well worth a watch but not a magical as expected.",
          "The fountains is always a fantastic spot to take friends and family whilst visiting. Lots of restaurants near by to sit and watch/listen. If you\u2019re lucky you might also be treated to a light show in the Burj Khalifa too.",
          "I had a very nice experience in Dubai. I appreciate the environment, the level of hygiene, the cleanliness.",
          "It was a nice experience to see this water show followed by restaurants and shopping mall the only thing that I dint like is that the show was to short They need to make it longer and increase the sound to make it more attractive",
          "Really good show, touching and emotional, music is great, similar to the Bellagio fountains in Vegas. Right outside the Burj Khalifa so can be doubled up with going up there, (can also be seen from in there) Walk through Dubai Mall to get to it",
          "The Dubai Fountain right next to Dubai Mall and world-known Burj Khalifa creates unique mix of super modern city and Arabic vibes! For sure must point while visiting Dubai. The Fountain does not have ultra-modern special effects, everything is pretty classic as well as music in",
          "The dancing fountain with om kalthoum song was great. Its too crowded there but nice and easily accessed.",
          "I visited with family at night. What an eye catching view it was. Dancing fountains on music. Huge crowed it was.",
          "reminds me of Las Vegas. cool, nice to visit but the fountain show wasn't as impressive. plus points only cause Burj Khalifa was in the background. if you've seen Singapore's Marina Bay Sands' fountain show, this can't hold a candle to it. other than that, you can visit to say",
          "Pick you spot and pass the evening watching the different shows. Fantastic and free. Just amazing. If you can get a table at a restaurant overlooking the fountain and watch while eating dinner even better.",
          "Beautiful dancing fountains reminded me of the ones at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. Total show was about 5 minutes long with the fountains dancing to \"Baby Shark\".",
          "Part of the attraction to The Dubai Mall is the marvellous water fountain display which lasts for a few minutes but is a visual treat for the eye with the music,the lights and the dancing fountains all synchronized in perfect harmony. This is a must see on any visit to Dubai and",
          "After waiting for dusk to set... the dancing fountain started to work... its comparing to bellago of las vegas... every hour performance with different music as background ... area was filled with guest but not crowded... its a relief experience after a hard day of shopping at",
          "I visit Dubai Mall last week me and my friend I watch Water found is very good amazing light arrangement any body vist dubai defnetly visit Dubai foundian",
          "We visited the fountain in the day time. the best time to enjoy the fountain and music is at night. The music was in sync with the water surge and it was still enjoyable in the daytime.",
          "A fantastic water show every 30 mins, karting approx 3 mins. I think only at night from 6PM. Check!! Stunning musical and water show with the adjoining Burj Khalifa joining in aswell with it's own light show all over the tower",
          "May be because I saw it during the afternoon; but it did not impress me at all. It just big. It was also a new routine. We saw it by the Apple store balcony, also got a clear view of the tower as well.",
          "If you new in Dubai, or if you watched it before, you still will be amazed by this show, different music composition with light effects make your experience unique",
          "The show was really great. The area was first class with eating places where you can eat and watch at the same time.",
          "The setup is very big but they do not do justice with it. The music is extremely ordinary and in fact cheap! The duration is too short and the many of the time the choreography does not match with the music. I rather found fountain dance in Singapore way better than this!",
          "Me and my husband visited Dubai fountain following the Burj khalifa experience. We had been advised to find restaurant high up so that we can view the fountain. We chose the Colt Cafe. The view was amazing. The Dubai fountain is a must visit. Doesn't cost anything to view it",
          "You may have watched this kind of fountain in Las Vegas. But, seeing this for the first time infront of Burj Khalifa is certainly an experience. It lasts for a few minutes but you will love the way they have designed it. The nearby places to watch gets crowded, so find yourself",
          "It's a very nice place to visit as a tourist or when you have relatives or friends coming for tourism.",
          "If your are watching it live for the first time, it amazes you how perfect the timing if the song and the water works is! Leaves you in awe! Its a perfect place to visit as a tourists or when u have relatives over as tourists. I wouldn\u2019t say the same for people watching it the",
          "No trip to Dubai is complete without a visit to the Dubai Fountain. The show lasts no more than 5 minutes but I daresay the memory lasts a lifetime. The sound of water gushing and \"dancing\" is a sight to behold. Lots of dining options nearby. You will be glad you visited.",
          "Amazing Music and Water/Fountain Sync. Loved our experience and always pleasure to visit during non weekends as there is less rush",
          "Enjoy a meal on the water front and watch the spectacle of the fountains to music (make sure you know what time the music starts).",
          "Synchronised water fountain to beautiful music. Just outside of Dubai Mall every half hour from 6pm a light and fountain show for all ages.",
          "It was lovely to see the fountains when at the Dubai mall better when you see them as it gets dark . Crowded but still was able to find a space to see .",
          "One of the Icon of Pride. Without any doubt it\u2019s only possible in Dubai till someone builds better and taller one. My preferred time in evening, largest shopping mall, food courts, food outlets all around with the tallest tower in the World. And the breathe taking Dancing Water",
          "The fountains operate every 30 minutes after 5.30 pm, for about 5 minutes at a time. They are a good effort but lack the height and energy of the Bellagio show at Las Vegas, and are not synchronised to the music",
          "Dubai Mall was made better by seeing the fountains at night. The routine, lighting and with Burj Khalifa as a backdrop makes for a great display. its amazing to see different people here from across the globe, families, couples etc. A must to anyone visiting Dubai....",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the show, several times in fact over dinner, to different music each time. Plenty of nearby dining options.",
          "The Dubai fountain is one of the must see in Dubai. It is very nice water performance. There were a lot of people but we were able to find a spot and see everything. We recommend it very much.",
          "We watched the fountain while we had dinner at the burj Khalifa it was very good would see again Great evening",
          "excellent show , different every half hour, 5 mins long superb, different song and show all teh time , as well the show from the tower",
          "One of the best things to watch in Dubai.....kids just love it...bt I felt v had one of the best watch when v sat at wafi gourmet ND saw the entire show having the best falafal....ND the best part is kids can easily watch it from there",
          "what an amazing experience and tour, thankyou to miss denica for my booking and the instructor sir chris",
          "Mostly all attraction in the world I believe requires some kind of payment / fees. The mesmerizing foundation is free for all to watch . I always feel like I want to watch again and again - some visits I stayed more than 1 and hours to see 3 shows in a row.",
          "This is one of the must visit locations if you are visiting or residing in Dubai. A truly spectacular experience - definitely a memory forever! The Access for the fountain is via the Dubai Mall where you can get directions by asking any of the helpful service desk personnel for",
          "It is best viewed in the twilight in the evening hours to late bight. First u see the scenery in twilight & then u see only fountain dancing in the night..",
          "Waqas was great tour great guide waqas, gave great information on Dubai history and i did Desert Activities, Excellent!!!",
          "Memorable place with nice music staff and seating area and dancing fountain Nice place to add on your calendar when you are planning to visit Dubai",
          "we were surprised at how short this show actually runs...one song. It's pretty while it lasts...but it's no Bellagio.",
          "Amazing show of lights and sound and the fountains. It is repeated every half an hour in the evening and lasts about five minutes. It is free. May enjoy it before or after visit to Burj Khalifa. In the pics you will have Burj Khalifa as the backdrop. The word EMAAR is displayed",
          "Good. Water fountain show with music. Gets crowded in the evenings best to be seated in one of the man restaurants around the fountains.",
          "An excellent trip to the Dubai Mall was made better by seeing the fountains at night. The routine, lighting and with Burj Khalifa as a backdrop makes for a great display. It was great to see such a varied group of people here, families, couples and groups taking this in,",
          "Highly recomended and a must-See in Dubai. Turns on every half hour and the Music and water show is different every time. But do not go away. Around 10-15 min after the watershow ending, there Will be a light show on the Burj Khalifa. The only disapointing thing is that they are",
          "a very beautiful place to go on a date, their music is beautiful and the way how the fountain moves is so therapeutic. definitely would recommend",
          "Took an Abra onto the water to watch the fountain display. Very cheap and brilliant to watch the display without having to navigate the crowds. Well worth it",
          "When I visit burj khalifa I see this water dancing show. It last for 10 minutes. What a creativity!!. I want visit again in the burj khalifa and see this.",
          "Where do you see something so amazing with the only cost being your time well spent. Stay for one show or come back everyday for a new one",
          "This was one of the highlights of our trip. A must see when you are in Dubai. The shows on Fridays evenings are the be",
          "Amazing ....crowd, song and the visuals.....\ud83d\udc4d.... A must visit for all Dubai visitors... Would like to visit again...",
          "Love the Dubai Fountains!It is even better than the Bellagio Fountain in Vegas. DF is a 'must do' category recommendation to all our friends and relatives who come as tourists to Dubai. The music and experience of watching the dancing water especially when it's at a crescendo",
          "The memory of the water dancing to the music tunes shall forever run in my brains. Wow, it's spectacular. Can't forget the people I saw proposing to their fiances",
          "I was lucky to be at Burj Khalifa just when the amazing spectacle of dancing fountains was to begin. It was impossible not to dance at the rithm of Michael Jackson.",
          "Love going here especially so much to do from Dubai mall to Burj Khalifa and water fountains all in one place. Very expensive but beautiful",
          "The show is so good, they dancing fountains are just so much fun to watch. Theres loads of restaurants in the mall to watch them from (I got a drink in five guys and watched from their patio) but the crowds around the lake can get big. Stay and watch a few for different music.",
          "Nice and amazing views perfect for sight seeing and pleasing the eyes with a great show and for free.",
          "Its an experience to see something like this. Visit at night. The lighting makes it just an awesome visual experience",
          "Amazing Experience. Music + Dancing fountain + the environment ... it is a different idea. Watch the show but don't miss to take a stroll around the area (thank me later :).",
          "We went to watch the fountain show during the day (only on twice during the day) and at night (on every 30 mins from 6pm - 11pm) would definitely say its more impactful at night. Each time there is a different show to different music so would recommend having dinner outside at",
          "Not a typical dancing fountain you will witness at Dubai mall exterior area as the fountain will dance according to the music together with the led lights of the epic background of the most tallest building in the whole world \"BURJ KHALIFA\".",
          "We sat at the top of a garden/viewing area in Burj park and had a great view of the fountains and surrounding buildings, also a great view of Burj Khalifa from here",
          "Make sure you stop by, its really amazing and worth your time! Every 20 minutes, and a different musical theme each time!",
          "We visited dubai fountain next to dubai mall in the evening after visiting burj khalifa. The fountain show is superb. The ambience is very good . The facade lighting of burj khalifa also keeps changing and the view is nice. Dubai mall, burj khalifa and fountain is a combined",
          "The Dubai Fountain is definitely a must do - whilst we really enjoyed it I am not entirely convinced that it is as good as the Fountain show at the Bellagio in Las Vegas.",
          "After visiting Burj Khalifa in the afternoon, we continued our walk along the chanting and dancing fountains!",
          "Truly an amazing experience, both day and night. Very impressive, would recommend everyone to watch .",
          "A must see whilst shopping the massive mall. On every 30 minutes once the sun goes down and the music changes each time.",
          "Dubai fountain commences the show at 6:30 pm and has a presentation every 30 min till 11:00 pm. Rich sound, beautiful lights and rhythmic patterns in which the jets of water move make this a beautiful sight to watch.",
          "I recommend you sit at one of the cafes facing the fountain & enjoy the music & view of the fountain every half an hour after 6 pm!",
          "It\u2019s a treat to watch. Repeated every 30 mins from 6:30pm to 10:30pm. Music, light and water dancing to the tune of music. Good. Weekends are crowded. So better try to catch up on weekdays.",
          "This is a very calm sight after the rush of Dubai. We were there about 2 hours we enjoyed it so much.",
          "Dubai fountain is a spectacular treat for those who wish to visit Dubai and Dubai Mall. Light and sound show and dancing fountain as music played will entertain you . It is a world class show. Children will like it more.",
          "The Burg is amazing plus the shopping and fountains display makes you always want to be back in Dubai.",
          "The fountain is conveniently located right outside the Dubai Mall.Get there a little early to get a good viewpoint. It is a nice show with music and water lasting about 10 minutes. Then you can go back to shopping or to one of the many restaurants to eat.",
          "This is a must. It takes place every half an hour and is beautiful to watch. A must for anyone travelling to Dubai",
          "Worth the time to see. Beauitful setting amoung towering high-rise buildings. Viewing from anywhere is excellent. Not quite the Bellagio Hotel in Nevada. But worth it.",
          "The fountains play at regular intervals especially in evenings the fountains show lasts over 5 mins and is accompanied by loud music and lighting of surrounding buildings , the music keeps changing and water fountains dance to tune of each music , so does the lighting that keeps",
          "We were lucky enough to see the show whilst eating at a nearby restaurant. The water moves in perfect unison with the music playing. The choice of music varies greatly and this is a must visit.",
          "This was very interesting with a backdrop of the tallest building overlooking! Show starts at 6 o\u2019clock last about 5 mins and is lit up,this is repeated every half hour so again you need a lot of time to see show then shop or have something to eat ,or go round indoor aquarium in",
          "Had a great time watching it with a drink in hand with good company . enjoyed the music . Sheer grandeur of the fountains was lovely.",
          "Amazing ! !!I visited the fountains 3 times to see them! Such a pleasure! Great place , have to see!",
          "While the fountains cover quite a large area, they are only on for a single song. Much preferred the fountains in Barcelona.",
          "The dancing fountains are a must to see. The fountains are so special. Great music too. I have been to see the fountains everyday. I have been in Dubai for 3 weeks and I can\u2019t get enough of the fountains.",
          "have lunch at mall then watch fountains , go when its dark for best effect . very busy at weekends so go mid week . see aquarium as well",
          "amazing, very nice to see this. Everybody needs to go and check this.Dubai is nice, very clean and I recommend everyone to go visit",
          "I have been staying in Dubai for nearly 4 years and the fountain still amazes me. i find the music, the light and the colors very fascinating .",
          "We visited Dubai fountain along with my family including kids (18 and 11) and my mother in law. It is something which all of us enjoyed. Try to visit when day light is there as u can get great pictures with Burj Khalifa in the backdrop. Must see! It\u2019s amazing",
          "Excellent place for a hang out in the evening. Head out after sunset to watch the fountain and then grab a dinner at the Dubai Mall",
          "I have been staying in dubai for 8 years and never get bored watching dubai fountain, the fountain dance is always so graceful and beautiful",
          "The fountain, the music and the lights and colors at Burj Khalifa is amazing. The show starts every half hour from 6 pm. A must see in Dubai.",
          "A thoroughly enjoyable experience- worth walking for 5 or 10 minutes around the lake towards the opera house to get an uninterrupted view from the big crowds that gather!",
          "This was my second visit to the fountains. Really enjoy watching this spectacular sight. The fountains are breathtaking to watch against the backdrop of the Burj Khalifa to a selection of good music",
          "After the Burj khalifa, we walked through the Dubai Mall to the Fountain Show. This is a family friendly experience because the music catered from Disney to contemporary songs.",
          "We got the tip to find a restaurant on the second floor with a view on the fountains for lunch. It worked out great!",
          "As it\u2019s on every 30 minutes after sunset till 11pm it\u2019s something you\u2019ll always have a chance to see and while exploring the Dubai Mall you should do that, but I wouldn\u2019t pay extra to go closer as you\u2019ll always be able to see it as the viewing decks are huge.",
          "If you seen the fountains in Vegas .. I would say are similar .colors and Arabic music . Crowd more inclined in letting tourists to take pictures.there are several restaurants that you can sit and watch the fountains, they start at every 2 hours .",
          "I would recommend picking a spot to stand away from The Mall dining areas. Try to stand by the wall as people rush to see and can push you out of the way. I didn't do it but if I had my time again I would do the dhow trip. Best views and no pushing. Which did spoil our enjoyment.",
          "Genuinely beautiful and quite moving. I recommend going as close as possible to truly appreciate the scale of it all.",
          "Beautiful show...similar to the fountains in Las Vegas in front of the Bellagio. Stunning experience with the Burj as the backdrop!",
          "its nice like dancing water & the fountain awsome i like to go there again . im new in dubai its beautiful place",
          "fantastic show, these dancing fountains are a must to see.they start about every 30 minutes.its a must see.",
          "It was the best Fountain show ever we have seen with lights and music Jay Ho and kissing the kind of rain fall as well its just wow. Don't skip if you are dubai visitor",
          "Don't know what all the fuss is about. Hundreds of people queuing up for three minutes of a water show.",
          "It's a wonderful idea and executed well. The show is definitely watching even a couple of times for its movements, lights, sound and the feel it generates. You will definitely love it the first time and will not miss to take video for sure. Yes, it can get boring after a couple",
          "Very beautiful show with music. Whole family enjoyed. I was hoping for some light show included, but there wasnt any.",
          "Dubai fountain is one of the nicest place in dubai great fountain there its located in downtown dubai and I totalltly loved it amaze me",
          "A must must must!! Get there early, go for a meal on the terrace of one of the restaurants and simply enjoy your food while watching the show. You will not be disappointed!",
          "magical experience with a lively crowd and really good vibe. very friendly and overall a great experience in Dubai",
          "from 6pm onwards get a seat and view the spectacular show of the fountains. every time there's different music and a different dance by the fountains",
          "Stepping outside for this 5 minute fountain show is a nice change from the retail mania inside the Dubai Mall.",
          "While watching the fountain show you can have dinner in many of the restaurants. A great option is to have a boat ride during show time. It can be at pick hours. Shopping, dinner, watching the fountain show you can spend easily 3-4 hours.",
          "The light effect on the Burj Khalif and the water fountain was amazing. Highly recommended We watched it after a great meal in the mall .",
          "Excellent display of water fountain synchornised to varying music tracks and lighting. A must see during the daylight hours as well as after dark. visitors to Dubai must not miss the dubai fountain.",
          "Given that Dubai seems to pride itself on having the biggest and best of everything, this show was a disappointment. I do not recommend going out of your way to see it.",
          "This is well worth seeing if you are in the area or visiting the mall. We had dinner at one of the restaurants just across from where the fountains are and watched the first show whilst we ate. After we had finished we went closer and watched again and got some great",
          "Try to pass further if you approach from Dubai Fountain Street for the best view, lots of people at the entrance and far less if you take a walk around, there are many spots to observe the show. I am not impressed easily, but these fountains were stunning at some songs moments.",
          "The visit was too good. Enjoyed the experience. Was an amazing experience to travel with trip advisor. Was a memerising experience. The services were amazing and no heptic arrangements had to me made as everything was preplanned by trip advisor and thnx to them for making it",
          "waited and waited then the fountains came on for 1 song and finished!! Beautiful whilst it lasted.............",
          "A must visit. One of the best I have seen. They play all kind of music. Well maintained and attracts every visitor to dubai.",
          "It can be considered one of the many flashy things in Dubai, and it sure is, but it is like Las Vegas: maybe you won't go twice, but you definitely have to go once. It attracts hordes of tourists and it is not hard to understand why. A true must in the city of musts.",
          "We've been enjoyed, specially during the winter weather, you can repeat it again and again, you'll interest",
          "Went here in the daytime but expect it's even more entertaining at night. Water set to music. Well worth a visit, think its on every 30 mins.",
          "A nice free show in Dubai after the long labyrinth of Dubai Mall. It takes 2-4 minutes every half an hour and it's a show of music, light and water fountains.",
          "Located just outside the Dubai Mall with Burj Khalifa in the background, Dubai Fountain is one of the topmost attractions of Dubai. Every evening there is a 5 minute musical fountain show at this site which is breadth taking. Huge crowds turn up for the fountain show, so it is",
          "February 25, 2020 \u201cGood Service\u201d Total score 5 out of 5 5.0 Cleanliness 5 out of 5 5.0 Dining 5 out of 5 5.0 Location 4 out of 5 4.0 Service 5 out of 5 5.0 Amenities 5 out of 5 5.0 Value for the Money 5 out of 5 5.0 The staff was excellence, however the shower head",
          "the show is about 4-5 minutes every half hour in the evening. Each time a different theme of music but the water \"dance\" is not as majestic as it is described in touristic guides. I can tell you that I enjoyed much more the water lay and music in Barcelona . since everybody is",
          "We were present during the bollywood song show at the fountain and it was awesome. The show was for approximately 5 mins and we enjoyed it very much.",
          "This too is a must visit by tourists. The entry to the courtyard at Dubai Mall to see the fountain is free. There are a couple of restaurants that also has seating area with a view. You can enjoy this the most in the evenings when the lights come on.",
          "Very well organised, this is an absolute treat to your eyes, starts every evening around 6:30 pm. Nice view from Dubai mall, apple store first floor.",
          "Goes for the length of a song, but was so cool to see! Would have liked it to be longer, but would see it again if I had time. Goes every 30mins from 7pm.",
          "It is highly recommended to visit the Bur Khalifa. The view is fantastic with the sunset. It is well organized when you go inside the tower.",
          "While you can see like fountains in other parts of the world, you will not see fountains at this scale and especially surrounded by the beauty of the Souk, Burj Khalifa or any of the surroudning structures. We were able to see this show a few times over the course of our stay",
          "I've visited this place several times and every time the experience is exciting. Good place to visit",
          "every 30 mintues new song starts, usually 2-3 minutes in duration. best way to see it either from Burj Khalifa or just grab a chair in the resturant in evening across from fountain and enjoy.",
          "We were in the Dubai mall and heard music, so rushed out to catch the show. Dancing fountains - fun , with great views of the Burj Khalifa.",
          "This is in front of Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa. Every half an hour in the evening, the fountain dance is performed and it is really mesmerizing. It is free of cost.",
          "The Dubai Fountain has great shows during the day and night and it's a great place to hang out and experience Dubai night.",
          "Have dinner in front of this fountain is an incredible experience that you will never forget! I was a solo traveler and enjoyed so much",
          "A wonderful experience with a fantastic show with music and water. Like a fireworks simply replaced by water and air - magnificent. Can be experienced just as well from land as from boat",
          "It seems to me Dubai is just trying to copy and outdo other places that already have nice fountains, etc. Overall, I would say skip Dubai and find another place to visit.",
          "Definitely something you will want to see if you are visiting Dubai, the sheer size and quality is awesome. Show starts around 6pm and then every 30 mins until 11 pm. Lots of viewing points, but I would suggest you go into one of the restaurants that overlook from the opposite",
          "First time visit to Dubai and to see the fountains. I was blown away by the dancing fountains and the accompanying music which changed every half hour. It is really entertaining and mesmerising. Right outside the Dubai Mall, it gets very crowded but we dined at one of the",
          "it is amazing place, you can set in restaurant or coffeshop and watch the fountain. i like it a lot.",
          "If you want to have the best view, book a table at one of the restaurants in the mall with an outside table on the balcony.",
          "it was an amazing experience .... this place gets crowded and especially in summer days or vacations, people from all over the world visit Dubai and this attraction is a must-see which is located just by Burj Al Khalifa ... very well-orchestrated music and fountain dance - bravo!",
          "Amazing amazing amazing. The fountains dance on half an hour, always on different music. With the fountain dance you can watch Burj Khalifa with different laser show.",
          "When I\u2019m Dubai the fountains are a must. We visited in the day time and the evening and would definitely recommend doing both.",
          "This is a must see if you ever visit Dubai. The dancing fountains just take your breath away.I was left amazed.",
          "The show it is nice but not to die for. Seemed kind of short to me but together with the music was ok. Viewed for outside the D.Mall",
          "Really great to see how they manage the fountain and related shows. Songs, lighting and fountain effects are really nice and were an unexpected surprise. Ample room to stroll, walk, sit, lounge or take a boat ride whilst enjoying the show. Well done!",
          "A truly must see show for any visitor to dubai. Have visited the fountains on many occasions over the years and have always been mesmerised by the beautiful experience. The shows begin at 6pm and run every half an hour until late evening. To get a nice view you need to get there",
          "Really glad we visited this, and it was cool while it lasted, but disappointing that the fountain display was only about 5 minutes in duration. Was expecting a much longer and more elaborate display. Still worth the visit. Loved the backdrop of the Burj Kalifa as well -",
          "We booked an outside table at Thiptara with a view of the fountains. Definitely a great spot for viewing. We got to see around 5 of the shows, each show is coordinated to different music. Fountains are breathtaking, the best we\u2019ve seen and that includes the Vegas Bellagio",
          "Definitely a must see. On a sunny day this place is spectacular. It is a bit crowded, but hang out and find a spot to watch the next show. It\u2019s a pretty great way to people watch and when the fountains go off it\u2019s amazing. We dined at one of the restaurants over looking the",
          "This can be a whole day trip if you go into the massive mall of Dubai. Stay until near sunset so you can watch the fountains during the day and at night. They go off about every 30 min to different music. The surrounding view is just as stunning as the fountains.",
          "The Dubai Fountain is yet another must see while in Dubai. It is located at the back of the Dubai mall, (another amazing place) and you can see the worlds biggest building The Burj Khalifa from the bottom up. The fountain area is large and has areas that are perfect for taking",
          "We visited the fountain twice, once during the day and again at dusk. The dancing waters came on at 1 pm and then on the hour in the evening. The show is only about 5 minutes long but worth seeing. The setting is wonderful with the Burj Khalifa in the background. We watched from",
          "The scenery in the Dubai Tower complex, although crowded, can still find a corner to enjoy the music fountain",
          "1st evening show started at 7pm rather than 6pm as on some websites. Quite crowded for this first show which we viewed outside the entrance near Five Guys. However if you walk over the bridge, turn right and then stand on the steps between two hotels, a much better view",
          "The Dubai fountain is one of a kind show to see and experience the combination or technology used in it.",
          "Spectacular displays, and even more so when sitting in one of the restaurant balconies! We visited nearly every evening and it made it worth staying in Downtown as this was literally on our doorstep!",
          "Average fountain show. Repeats every 30 minutes so lots of people get opportunity to watch. Similar to Vegas.",
          "We watched this from TGI Fridays in the mall, we got a table on the balcony and it was like having a private show. We arrived at 5.45pm in time for the 1 at 6pm. We could also see the Burj Khalifa and once the sun had set the Burj Khalifa lit up with different colours. We also",
          "The show runs every half hour on the half hour and a good way to spend 10 minutes away from the mall. We viewed at night excellent light and water show set to music which can be a surprising choice. The Burj Khalifa lit up in the background with its own light show before the",
          "The Dubai fountains have easily got to be one best free attractions of Dubai. First show 6pm then every half an hour. Each show lasts 3-5mins with dancing fountains twinkling lights and fog and water canons that shoot high into the sky. All shows are set to differing music",
          "a real show of spectacular water movements with a range of colours and great music to accompany it. The water was hypnotic close up and must have looked great from a distance too.",
          "It is obligatory for everyone visiting Dubai to see these Fountains. It's inspiring to see them. I have seen them several times and didn't get bored of it. The view of Burj Khalifa and the Fountains is simply breathtaking!",
          "After 20.00 it's possible to stare at the light and water show just by the fountain and it's absolutely amazing and free of charge. Don't miss it!!!!",
          "One of those quirky Dubai impressive installations. We managed to catch three shows as we had lunch and loved it!",
          "Loved the fountains both in sunlight at 6pm and later in the evening with lights on. Show is only about 5mins long but well worth a visit",
          "enchante we really enjoy the beautiful fountain and the beautiful color very peaceful and relaxing wound love to go back",
          "A wonderful spectacle, well worth it during the day and night time too. Every display is different from the other one and the music they choose go with the show. A must see if you are in Dubai",
          "It\u2019s Fabulous Amazing superb & more rated excellence for TA for a reason & rightly so! couldn\u2019t recommend it high enough if ever in Dubai watch it & you\u2019ll see what I mean",
          "I was at Apple Store in Dubai Mall from where you have nice view to Dubai Fountain. You can avoid paying ticket for that show. It is nice, but nothing special for that 4-5 minutes.",
          "Its was a nice experience. kids love the water show and lighting on the Burj. There was minimum wait time.",
          "Visited the fountains at the Dubai Mall. Absolutely fantastic water show every 30 mins. Played out to varying music tracks. It really can be quite emotional. Watched by a couple of thousand people it really is a sight to behold. We went in the evening with the Burj Khalifa lit",
          "Best musical fountain ever. The flow of water in fountain depends on the song played. It was an amazing experience for us",
          "The show is a 15 minutes musical extravaganza and Burj Khalifa musical lights. The show starts daily from 6:00 pm onwards. It is in the premises of the Dubai Mall in front of the Burj Khalifa. The colorful Fountain heights view is amazing to watch.",
          "This was spectacular! Make sure you watch it in the evening. The show is beautifully breathtaking. And, it\u2019s just a doorstep from the Dubai mall.",
          "What a wonderful place to sit and relax watching this stunning water show. Lots of lovely cafes with a great view",
          "What a superb show. We have seen the dancing fountains in Las Vegas but , as everything is in Dubai, these are bigger and better. You can easily get excellent views and access to them as there are so many places to watch the stunning sights. I\u2019d recommend dining in a restaurant",
          "This is a truly superb water show well with waiting in the Mall for the next showing. we saw some of the show from 126 floors up on the Burj Khalifa it looked like a toy fountain. If you have kids they will be mesmerised",
          "My best dance was the Baby shark song. I was breathless the whole time. Coming back next visit for more.",
          "Great fountain water show in front of Dubai Mall. It feels vibrant with music in front of Burj Khalifa.",
          "Dubai Mall Fountain Show Is a Must See Once in a life time Treat for the eyes.Truly marvelous engineering, programming and show of Amazement",
          "Nice to watch once, but nothing so breathtaking that one would like to watch it once again. Pretty repetitious stuff.",
          "Really recommended , is super nice show with music and light , and is for free , and is quite long show.",
          "went there for dinner in one of the restaurants around the fountain and enjoyed the show. every 20 to 30 minutes we had a different kind of music from all around the world and the fountains were dancing on the rythem",
          "It shoul be showed more frequently . Together with a nice view of burj khalifa ,it is mesmerizing but 5he fountain alone is not a masterpiece.",
          "If I say excellent , still it will less for the Dubai fountain. The rhythm , the music , the water jet are so melancholic. It is a must place to visit in Dubai",
          "Runs every half an hour in the evening but would definitely advise getting there 15minutes before the 00 or 30 as the best spots to see the fountains will already be gone. Great 3-4 minute show in front of burj al Khalifa well worth seeing whilst you in Dubai. Very similar to",
          "If you visit Dubai, you must go to visit this place in Downtown Dubai. Good for solo or family visit. I experienced Sky Fall by Adele whish was absolutely amazing show. The fountain is in an amazing location in between the Dubai Mall and Burg Khalifa. Starts at 6pm and takes",
          "A little overcrowded and doesn't hold up against the likes of vegas though certainly worth a visit..",
          "We watched three different shows. Two in the day and one after sunset. They were all to different music - but were all equally impressive. Well worth watching.",
          "It\u2019s worth paying a visit to watch these dancing fountains, we caught the show at 6pm. It was very busy there, but great atmosphere, lots of restaurants , and great little food stalls too. Adjoining the Dubai mall, u can easily spend a day just in this area, shopping , eating",
          "Three minute fountains dancing to music against the backdrop of the Burj Kalifa. A show every half hour. Music varies. Delightful ambience. And it\u2019s free! Great family fare.",
          "I stopped by for couple of shows at Dubai Fountain. One of the shows was choreographed with Pavarotti's Nessun Dorma and thats where i think this was much better than other fountain/water shows i have been to. Maybe i am biased since i love Nessun Dorma but it was very powerful",
          "We have been to Dubai twice now and each time we have been to the Dubai Fountains. Can get a busy at times especially in the evenings but well worth a visit.",
          "How can one miss to see such a great musical fountain put up by the management of dubai mall. I saw people dancing with the fountain and that relaxing feeling it gives you is out of this world. Must place to go.",
          "It's free.Its beautiful.Awesome.Try to go after you have been to Burj khalifa.Go 20 mins before the start and hold your place on the railing.Its so enjoyable, Don't spoil with your mobile phone, just cherish it.Speakers are good and fountains goes in sync with opera.Wonderful",
          "It\u2019s of course a must do in Dubai There is a different d\u2019show every 30 minutes and sometimes in between a laser show in burj Khalifa The best to profit of this show is to go at the terrace of one of the restaurants face to the burj Khalifa",
          "The fountain show with music and light is simply magicals.couldnot get enough of it!!a realy experience for me first time the show are from 6 pm ..every 30 minute last for 5 minute...must visit if you go DUBAI",
          "A very popular attraction which is free and runs daily go early to avoid disappointment a spectacular show",
          "Overall, another Dubai must see. We saw 3 shows & each song (\"Thriller\" being the most dynamic showing) displaying the engineering brilliance of coordinated waterworks, lights & music.",
          "Better view from Apple balcony store. You can find the apple store at 2nd floor and there will be quite line. So make sure you have a comfortable shoes.",
          "Always entertaining. good crowd of people. Must visit place while in Dubai Mall overlooking Burj Khalifa",
          "we tied the fountains in with a visit to the burg kaliffe We were told that the fountains operate every hour although a second show was after half an hour. The show is magical and a must see",
          "Must visit this while in Dubai - amazing water and lights show overlooking Burj Khalifa and the restaurants can access it from the dubai mall",
          "A really lovely experience , the shows are from 6pm, every 30 minutes and last for 5 minutes. Each show is different.",
          "The fountain show with the music and lights is simply magical. Couldn't get enough of it! Don't miss it!",
          "The entrance to the show was through the Dubai Mall and entrance tickets were bought. Actually it was a 20-30 minutes show but no words to express sight of it, so fascinating. It started by sharp 7.30 pm., the crowd gathered very early as there will be no room for latecomers.",
          "Make sure to visit it once and the time of the show is 8 30pm during new year the place becomes very wry crowded (avoid it).",
          "Like the Bellagio in Las Vegas, it attracts mobs of visitors. We happened to catch an afternoon in mid January when it decided to dump \"buckets\" of water on everyone. Still beautiful. Recommend arriving by 4 pm or so if you plan to find a photo worthy light & water show",
          "Although the shows were quite short, they were very beautiful. Regretfully we only got to see the day shows but heard from other tour group members that the night shows were even more spectacular. Must see in Dubai!",
          "Great fountain show, we stayed for 2 hours and every half our they play a different show, there are several nice spots to watch.",
          "A must see when visiting Dubai. A go to when in Dubai Mall. Highly recommend dining at Tribes to watch the show.",
          "If you want to see the fountains from a great vantage point then why not try one of the many restaurants around the fountains. We had a great meal and amazing views of the fountains which start after 6pm every 30 minutes. The music is varied each time.",
          "The fountain by Burji Khalifa was epic. Burj Khalifa is perhaps the tallest building in the world. Very beautiful especially at night. However, the walk from Dubai Mall to the fountain was long. Highly recommended",
          "I found it completely underwhelming and I wasn't sure what all the fuss was about? It lasted roughly 2-3 minutes but perhaps it's better in the evening after dark, as I saw it at 1800 whilst it was still light. The fountain is located right next to the main shopping mall and",
          "We got to the fountain at 18:00 hours to see a show.... and in the end we stayed for four shows... \ud83d\ude0d The light and music combination is spectacular and gave us both goosebumps each time A must see in Dubai\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Loved the fountains! Our apartment gave us a spectacular view but they are worth seeing from the ground too. Great show and enjoyed the range of accompanying music.",
          "When I went, it was EXTREMELY crowded. I mean nothing out of the ordinary. I would recommend to come see it in morning as the crowd wouldn\u2019t be that extreme, although I\u2019m not promising no crowds in morning, a ton of people would visit it every time they pass by.",
          "An experience hard to top! During the day the fountains offer an awesome view, but during the night comes the real deal: a wonderful show combined with music every half an hour. Something I have never seen!",
          "What quite amazed by the sheer scale of the show. It was crowded but at this time of year perhaps not a much as it could have been. We ate in one of the restaurants so were able to see several shows - all with different music and different fountain patterns - plus the light show",
          "Recently we visited this fountain which is quite known allover the world It was very nice to the huge crowd of people waiting the music and the show I would love next time to hear Arabic music in the show",
          "We went last night while on holiday, be prepared for crowds ! There must have been 5000 people all trying to see and take pics. It was fantastic, Celine Dion and Bocelli ! They are all trying to video it as well, I didn\u2019t have a clear view but my husband who is taller managed to",
          "Beautiful show in front of Burj Khalifa, we stopped here during our jeep city tours of Dubai, very spectacular and romantic place !",
          "Its just 5 min. And dont have laser show. Dont get me wrong if you are there anyway and see it its ok. But i would not recommend you to wait not even 10min for this show.",
          "Beautiful experience you can\u2019t miss out on. Top it with a dinner at the Italien Restaurant Serafina. You can book a table online and request for a table so you can enjoy the show first row!",
          "Water fountain synchronized with music. 5 minute production every 30 minutes. Can be viewed and enjoyed by all ages from many vantage points. Romantic!",
          "It lifts your mood. Around Dubai fountain we are all equal. Only smiling faces and there is always one song that gets you.",
          "The setting is magnificent, adjacent to the Burk Khalifa and the Dubai Mall. If you mange to get a good viewing spot, you cannot fail to be impressed. The whole experience with the fountains, the illuminations and the music was certainly one to be remembered. Recommended",
          "The music, lights, fountains and show are all incredible here and you must take the time to watch the show. Shows are every 40 minutes starting about 6 pm in the rear of the Dubai Mall by the Burj Khalifa and it is worth the watch. It is even better if you have dinner on one",
          "I wasn't wowed i'm afraid. Go and see it but if you have experienced the Las Vegas fountain which always leaves me in tears, i'm afraid this one will be over before you even find your tissues. A bit weak",
          "At the Dubai Mall? Take the time to walk out and watch the show. Go back for a few different ones as the music is different. It's free and the kids like it. Plenty of photo ops with the Burj Khalifa in the background.",
          "Worth staying for a few shows as they differ every 30 minutes. Also intermittent light show on Burj kalifa",
          "The fountains are beautiful and the sheer height that the water is propelled up in front of you is astonishing. The choreography to the various songs is also a treat. The key to enjoying this experience, however, is your vantage point, as it can get extremely crowded on the",
          "This is my first visit to Dubai. Everyone, advised me not to miss this fountain show. Really fantastic. I went there after shopping at Dubai Mall. Tired because of walking. It is located next to the entrance. In fact, it is part of the mall. When the fountain show started the",
          "Been to this place many times still every time it amazes me. Beautiful to look at .. synchronization is just top level and Burj Khalifa background just makes it awesome!",
          "I loved it! the water motion with the music is Epic! You can go into Apple store and watch it from top!",
          "I am a pride resident of Dubai since over 11 years. Have been watching Dubai fountain since long. Great thing about this fountain and it\u2019s surrounding is that when ever I am visiting I am getting rejuvenated. Apart from being one of the highest fountain in the world it\u2019s the",
          "The fountains are located out back of the Dubai Mall, which is, by itself, a pretty amazing place. Every half hour in the evening, the fountains start dancing to music, very similar to the fountains at The Bellagio in Vegas. The backdrop of lit skyscrapers, and especially the",
          "What can I say? The Dubai Fountain show is simply spectacular display of creativity and enjoyable display! Yes the place is crowded, yes it is busy but you will love it!",
          "Beautiful show but I thought it was longer. But worth to see it if you are going out dining in the area anyway.",
          "Impressive to see such giant sized fountains spraying up from the water. We had dinner at Tribes upstairs and watched the fountains from above every 30 minutes. We were pleased we weren\u2019t in the crowds on the waters edge.",
          "Outstanding water fountain show between Dubai Mall and Soukh Al Bahar. The fountains dance in the rhythm of different music trailers. The acoustics are stunning and the lights of downtown with a light show as well on Burj Khalifa make it an unforgettable and unique experience,",
          "The fountain was amazing. The dancing fountain show was astonishing. My kids loved watching it again and again. \ud83d\udc95",
          "What a fantastic view and can be seen from so many restaurants while being enjoyed. I highly reccomend seeing it. Music along with lights and water.",
          "You will definitely enjoy it while you are listening to selected wonderful music and watching dancing water with beautiful movements .... that is just wow \ud83e\udd29",
          "The best dancing fountain especially with Arabic songs. Perfect in winter and summer. \u0623\u0631\u0648\u0639 \u0646\u0627\u0641\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0631\u0627\u0642\u0635\u0647 \u0648\u062e\u0627\u0635\u0629 \u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u063a\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629. \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062a\u0627\u0621 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0635\u064a\u0641",
          "Wherever u choose to view the fountains (balcony deck at a restaurant or just a passer by) they are magical. Allow yourself to me mesmerised by the dancing towers of sparkling water. Hack - walk away from the mall underneath the burj Khalifa and round to the viewing steps at",
          "a great show that u can see every time without forgetting the view of Burj Khalifa with its astonishing shows as well",
          "There's a lot of places and even country who tried to copy Dubai fountain but they failed. They're just copy cut! Once you see, you will feel the intense of the whole show. So come and visit to Dubai, see buy yourself. Don't forget to bring your friends and family.",
          "Great water show, beautiful lights at night, perfect weather to enjoy outdoor activity, some seating for people, not too long",
          "Pick a non weekend day to go here as it is very crowded. Keep control of your belongings as pick-pockers are frequent. Take a taxi there as garage is very crowded and if your are leaving late in the evening with you car it might take hours to get out.",
          "Best place to watch the fountain show without the crowds is by booking a table at a restaurant at Souk Al Bahar. My favorite restaurant is Abdel El Wahab. Their food is delicious and they have to most stunning view.",
          "Something to visit in combination with Burj al Khalifa. A little bit over the top and very crowded but still great to see?",
          "Seen this about a dozen times but well worth watching from one of the restaurants either in the Dubai Mall or else in a neighbouring hotel. Each time I\u2019ve been the show has been different and the lights on the Burj Tower has made it even better",
          "This is a must see in Dubai. Best part is that it it free of charge. There are many different shows. I stayed here 2 hours and saw 4 different shows. I recommend to walk around because there are many different places to watch the show.",
          "Lovely colours and music Captivating A bit crowded so arrive ahead of time for a good spot On regular days the show is disappointingly short",
          "Saw the spectacular fountain today.... A must see for all ... relaxing and enthralling.... photo opportunities aplenty.",
          "This visual masterpiece of water fountains and music is a must see event. Starts at 6pm and is repeated every 30 minutes with different music and displays each time. Only lasts for 5 minutes but is well worth seeing.",
          "This is a great display of water, colors and music. I have been quite a few times and still love it, recommended. Be on time, make sure you stand on the bridge.",
          "Mesmerising. Watched it from the balcony of a superb Japanese restaurant (will review later) which added to the overall enjoyment.",
          "GREAT TO see what the have make time between 6 till 11 in the night every half out great show for 3 minutes Its A beautiful water show.",
          "Loved it, every evening from 6pm onwards...very nicely synchronization of lights water and music along with the LEDs on Burj khalifa....",
          "Excellent ambiance, lots of people..... Vibrant atmosphere.... New lights on the walkway looking nice....",
          "Nice show in the afternoon close to Dubai Mall. A little bit crowded but if you show up in time it possible to get good view",
          "It's the sight in Dubai you can't miss as at one point you will be at the Dubai Mall, facing the Burj Khalifa. Best seen in the evening for the light show, a good tip is to go up the Apple Store and get on the balcony for a better view without facing a wall of people.",
          "A must visit! Generally a high-end environment, especially at a time when fountains have their dance. An environment full of restaurants, beautiful Arab features and magnificent Burj Khalifa is breathless, especially at night.",
          "A must if you\u2019re in Dubai, shows run every 30 minutes in the evening. Plenty of places to eat and shop",
          "This is a spectacular water fountain show, the area is great to walk around, the show is stunning, it\u2019s one of the best in the world",
          "Like Vegas but bigger and better, like everything in Dubai. Fun water show set to music every 30 minutes. And free!",
          "It was one of my Dubai highlights. I saw the early afternoon performance from \u2018stair / benches\u2019, which was just coincidence of being on the right place at the right time. I did research on google & decided to come back to see it at night. It was even better with all those",
          "Oh yeah, definitely go and see this amazing fountain in the heart of Dubai x very busy place but for 5minutes it is worth staying and watching it x I have never had the chance to see one of this famous fountain face to face but when I had it I did enjoyed x \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcaf",
          "Despite being next to the tallest building on the world, the fountain still manages to impress you. The show starts every half an hour during the working hours, so make sure you are there exactly on time. I would suggest visiting around 5-6 pm to get the both the day and night",
          "Having seen the fountain show at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, I expected something bigger and better. I was disappointed. The show was short, about 5-7 minutes. Musical accompaniment was to be expected. Only white lights, no colour. Also, not much to see from the top of Burj",
          "Wonderful and joyful really amazing, Makes you happy with its dancing movements especially with the special lighting of burj khlifa Wish be there again soon",
          "Nothing in Vegas has anything on this show. Tailored to different themes (Chinese New Year was one while we were there) there is no bad viewing spot. The sights and sounds are amazing. The best follow up on seeing it at ground level is to go up to the tope of the Burj Khalifa",
          "The fountains are still balletic and amazing but the sound system has deteriorated badly since we first saw/heard the splendid dancing fountains five or six years ago. We visit Dubai yearly and always visit the fountains. Unfortunately, the music now is far from a pleasure",
          "Absolutely unmissable in your tour a Dubai. i have had possibility to watch that one in the evening. It was very amazing",
          "wonderful show! A very good place with a beautiful view. \u0130 highly recommend this show to everybody!!",
          "We just happened to be in the right place at the right time. Don\u2019t pay to see these you can catch a good view with very little effort........ great balcony view from the Apple Store in the Mall. Nice addition to the mall. Worth stopping by for...... enjoy",
          "The fountain show is only for 10-15 minutes and is definitely not as spectacular as the one in Barcelona. Most of the balconies outside Dubai mall are jam packed and it becomes quite annoying when people keep shoving and stamp your toes.",
          "We watched the show twice , once from the shore and then from a boat on the lake (well worth doing) The show varies so you don\u2019t get bored with seeing it more than once. I particularly enjoyed the salvo near the end which was almost like water fireworks!",
          "I stopped here only because I was taking the top floor tour of the Burj Khalifa so seeing the mall and the fountain were just logical must do's while I was here. It was crowded and hard to see (9pm at night) I went through the Apple Store to see it. The show is every hour and",
          "a must place to visit, amazing view, nice people with diverse culture, one of a kind fountain experience",
          "Find out the time of the next show and get a seat in Five Guys Burgers and enjoy the fantastic show. Get to see both daytime and night-time shows if you can.",
          "You need to watch more than one show (they happen every 30 minutes). Arabic, classical and modern music put the rhythm to the water :).",
          "Every 30 minutes a different show with different music. Massive people wait to watch the shows but you can always find a place for you to see it. Highly recommend !!!",
          "The display runs every half hour in the evening and is free. It is spectacular for photographs with plenty of vantage points from the walkways. It is a fairly short show, maybe five minutes, but certainly worth making the effort to see it.",
          "We stayed near the Dubai Mall on our visit to Dubai so were fortunate enough to see the Fountain Display a number of times. If you can see it more than once we'd recommend it as they change the music - we didn't hear the same music twice. It can range from classical, to pop, to",
          "Dancing water in every hours. The dancing water is syncronizing to different music. We could see Chinese , traditional Arabic etc. I like it. Well composed and attractive. The night view from direction of Souk is the best due to nearly 900m high Burj Kalifa transforming a full",
          "Me and my wife visited the fountain one evening and witnessed the show. The water was coordinated together with the lights to Whitney Houstons song \"I will always love you\". This was almost magical. A must see when you are in Dubai",
          "Standing under the towering Burj Kalifa, the fountains dance and sway, explode in bursts and all to choreographed music at no cost!! Its quite a show when paired with the electrronic show on the Burj itself. Go just before sunset and stake out a spot on the small bridge walkway",
          "Amazing experiance and well worth a visit and its free the display is every 30 mins with a differnat theme each time",
          "As everything gets more and more expensive, this free event is worth visiting. By night it is even more exciting, but it gets also more crowded then. Good view spot is from the Apple Store in the Dubai Mall, but you also get a good spot if you search and walk for a few minutes",
          "The cheapest mode of transport for travel around Dubai. The trains are always on time but can get a bit packed during peak hours.",
          "Excellent, mesmerising, a joy to watch. Highly recommended. Easy to get to. Three shows per evening.Well organised for safe viewing.",
          "This is the most most magical fountain I have seen. If you need to have a full view of it, you need to be at the place at least an half hour early. Its worth it.",
          "Just wow.... the fountain at night is something that cant be missed during a visit to Dubai. The area is hustling and bursting with life at night and the light / music show to the fountain is crazy. The backdrop of the burj khalifa just makes it a visit to remember.",
          "It was really breathtaking! We were there in February 2020 and the show was every 30 minutes starting from 6 pm.",
          "I so enjoy the fountain show it was so different than I expect! I\u2019ve seen a lot of fountain shows but this one was my favorite. I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it",
          "Spectacular show. Very tastefully displayed in accordance with each different type of music Joy to sit and view and admire the display of light sound and fountain Well worth a visit",
          "The fountain isn\u2019t working all day and night - it\u2019s best to go on the website to check times as we went one day and it wasn\u2019t working until 7pm because of cleaning. We went another night and we saw the fountain at 6pm in the daylight which was ok but not brilliant. It was",
          "The Dubai Fountain show takes place outside Dubai Mall, under the Burj Khalifa and is an absolute must for any visit to Dubai. There is generally one show during the day - at 1:30pm - and then shows every 30 minutes from 6pm onwards. The fountain display is free to attend,",
          "Fountains are impressive but the management of the crowds left a bit of room for improvement. Dubai Mall really busy place, they need to think harder about how to work it in. Three of us left by cab and got directed to a limo cab which is 30+ % more expensive without a chance",
          "I would recomend people going to it and enjoy a cup of coffee there, It\u2019s a beautiful fountain but best to go see it at night I starts dancing every thirty min.",
          "I have ,first,seen the fountains a decade ago and been amazed at them. This year I returned with my wife and we were blown away by the show. Very complex and in sync with the music. We stayed for 3 shows in one night as the songs change every time. A must see in Dubai",
          "The dubai fountain show was really nice show to see. If you are on the Dubai mall side it is hard to find a spot to watch the show unless you get the early but if you walk over the bridge to the souk area then you can find more empty spots to watch the show. Each show is",
          "Excellent water show blended with enjoyable global sounds. A fun environment which is even better from the balconies of surrounding restaurants. Well worth the visit and complimented by the light show on the nearby buildings.",
          "On the hour and half hour, walk a bit further away from the mall to get a clear view with less people around you",
          "The place was very very crowded so we used the boat tour inside the fountain and we watched the show from inside, it was great. Also we went to the fountain walk and it was very nice to view the show from their too.",
          "We didn\u2019t not claim a spot early enough to get a good view of the fountain show, so only saw what we could see the went up high enough to be seen over taller people\u2019s (or people standing up up on the raised side of the bridge) heads. We had been up the Burj & had just come down",
          "Large fountain show choreographed to music with over 6,000 lights and color projectors. 1pm and 1:30pm afternoon shows and every 30 minutes from 7pm to 11pm.",
          "Lovely to sit & watch but always very, very busy so unless you manage to get a seat in one of the restaurants overlooking the fountains you have to squeeze yourself into a good spot",
          "Its fantastic , You can just watch and meditate ... Crowd surrounding the fountain fence , you have to avoid visiting it on weekends.",
          "The Dubai fountains is a must see if it\u2019s your first visit in Dubai. I recommend to view the fountains at night time and have a meal at one of the restaurants over looking the fountains.",
          "This is 100% worth seeing it was a amazing sight. Think we timed it spot on we went around 7pm and I think dusk is probably the best time to see it to get a good effect would highly recommend this.",
          "I love the Fountains! Every time I visit I always make sure to stop by and watch them. Amazing at any age \ud83d\ude0a",
          "This is a do not miss. The Dubai Fountain is right outside the Dubai Mall & The Burj Khalifa. It is a beautiful water dance show with amazing music, also night time it becomes a light & sound show. That is a must watch. The first one starts at 6.pm sharp and then every hour",
          "Really cool and entertaining water and light show (like a smaller Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas). Runs every 30 minutes but only for a few minutes (1 song). Especially impressive as Burj Khalifa lights up in background.",
          "The fountain show with the lake ride was marvelous. A must visit while in Dubai. It is a dancing fountain.",
          "It was worth waiting for in the waterfront atmosphere on a lovely evening. I would have liked it to be longer. The fodd places along the waterfront helped the atmoshphere.",
          "The best fountain show i ever saw. Come before shows, because while it goes - you will not find a place. And take water with you, cause this place is crowded by people and there\u2019s nothing to breathe.",
          "It\u2019s lovely to see the dancing water. Definitely a \u201cmust\u201d when you are in Dubai. Located within the Dubai Mall area at the base of the Burj Khalifa (accessible through the Dubai Mall). With plenty of places to eat and drink whilst enjoying the show. You can also check out the",
          "Great experience even very crowded but this the lagacy of life music with dancing the water as per the lyrics of music is so impressive. Great experience.",
          "We checked Dubai Fountain as we had a chance, while we were in DUbai Mall. It was really nice experience and there is something magic in music and water splashes :)",
          "Very amazing and atmosphere for all ages, we enjoyed alot with my kids, the music and colors were really stunning while the fountain is dancing with the music. A must visit place.",
          "Must see, even day and nighttime. The fountain start in every 30 minutes, the song is changing! You csn see it from the Apple Store of Dubai Mall very clearly",
          "Whats a visit to Dubai without the Visit to the Dubai Mall and the Fountains. The shows never Disappoint. I love visiting the fountains over and over and am always amazed at how beautiful it is",
          "Absolutely worth visiting. It happens every half an hour. You can also opt for a boat to take you around. The show lasts for about 5 minutes or so. Make sure you are around the railings to get a better view of the show",
          "Such an amazing experience! The dance, the atmosphere, everything! Stay longer so you can hear all the songs.",
          "Best time to see the fountains is at dusk, they are free to watch, and you can access them from many directions, hoever most popular (not necessarily the easiest due to all the people) is through the Dubai Mall, which is accessed from the other side by buses, taxis or the Metro",
          "Piece of art..this place suits every person at any age it dances with music different types arabic/English/orchestra i love this place it plays every 30 min there is a show at one afternoon 1:30 and 2 then it takes a break and start again at 6 pm then every 30 min up to 11 pm",
          "A place you can't miss if you are visiting Dubai. Perfect place for iconic pictures and a truly beautiful",
          "You won\u2019t be disappointed in the Dubai fountains, a definite thing to see whilst you are here. It does get crowded but just be patient & you can get to the front even if you have to watch it a few times but it\u2019s always different each time.",
          "one of the most impressive non-firework-displays - should be a fix must-view for every visit. Water art at its finest",
          "Its abt 5-10mins show with fountains,music & a lot of gathering around. One must attend it during visit to Dubai mall. Evening timings are better to visit this place",
          "Great work of innovation. Who would imagine that a water in a fountain could dance along with the music. Very elegant. Amazing. A breakthrough invention. You would always want and wait to see more.",
          "For something that is rated #1 among things to do in Dubai, I would probably not be so gung-ho about it. Yes it is a good show, runs every 30 minutes, free for everyone to see, but have seen many others which were far better, like the one at Sentosa in Singapore which lasts",
          "THe music-timed fountain show wasn\u2019t very long, but pretty impressive. The fountains shoot really high and the overall show was pretty impressive.",
          "It's a must to go and see the fountains they are a wonderful sight. It does get very busy though . They are every half hour from 6.30 onwards . I think they do a couple of showings during the day .",
          "The best fountain show in the world. We booked the boat tour and had excellent views of the show. It last only 5 minutes but must see when in Dubai",
          "Stunning fountains coupled with the lovely music, different each time the fountains play. Surrounded by many eclectic cafes and restaurants. A lovely walk through to the Burj Khalifa and not far from the opera house,",
          "Free water show at The Dubai Mail, by the Apple Shop. Every 30 minutes on the hour and half hour. Water show to Music, very dramatic and extremely well executed.",
          "Magical music and dancing fountain, so relaxing and mood lifting at end of a busy day, cant rate highly enough \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",
          "Being next to The Dubai fountain gives you the chance to see Dubai mall, Burj Khalifa, the opera, and the beautiful high rise buildings surrounding it while enjoying the amazing movements of the fountain that goes with the music. Hundreds of people gather to watch the dancing",
          "A must if you find yourselves nearby! The shows start every half hour from 6 to 11 pm and alot of them are different. Some of the shows include traditional arabic music, others pop hits and instrumental tracks. The water moves with the music and is a great experience for all",
          "we had a lovely time at the dubai fountain,the show is great and its a place to visit.its very close to the dubai mall .",
          "We saw this in the evening both from the top of the Burj and from ground level. I found viewing it from above less fun than on the ground. The Burj is simply too high to really get much of a feeling of this sight from above.",
          "Well worth a visit, a must if you're travelling to dubai. The display runs every half hour with a light display on the Burj Kalifa to match. Its a busy tourist area especially in the evenings.",
          "You expect such a site will endure having a lot of attractions,but this is an additional flavor added to it . Nothing is more enjoyable than to listen to a symphony played loudly with the people around gazing & staring at the see-nary . Its the music that to be enjoyed .",
          "Always love to go there and enjoy the fountain.. any one visit Dubai must visit it and enjoy the experience!!!",
          "it was really a great Show, have seen it several times but is always great. Can recommend it to view.",
          "I'm not sure this attraction requires a review... I've seen it so many times and it takes my breath away every time. I walk around Dubai Mall and just wait for 6 o'clock for Fountains to start its magic. I normally enjoy it from one of the restaurants in the terrace or walk",
          "This is the one of the best show in the dubai it was really amazing show i really enjoyed with my family",
          "For all the hype and the effort to watch one of the World's most famous fountain show....well it was disappointing. Waited for almost 20 min, jostling between the huge crowd to get closer to the railing, the result....it was over in less than 5 min. The next show was another 30",
          "Every half hour in the evening there's an amazing and different show with music from various countries. Check out the YouTube excerpts. Some classics are Whitney Houston's \"I will always love you\", and Sarah Brightman singing \"Time to say Goodbye\" with Andrea Bocelli.....Enjoy",
          "This is biggest Fountain of the world with great piece of technology beautiful expirence with lots of show every day Free of cost amazing experience Must visit place for everyone",
          "I\u2019ve seen the fountains numerous times being a regular visitor to Dubai. I often bring colleagues and customers to view this half hourly event. Good tip is to watch from the Apple store as they have their own public viewing area.",
          "a super show that cost's nothing to watch, at the moment there is a fantastic laser show on the Burgh Khalifa which is breath taking. how long it will be on far I am not sure but if you are going now do go see it . the shoe starts at 6.00pm",
          "Seriously this fountain is even better then the one in bellagious Vegas. Love the place anyways check it out",
          "If you have visited the Bellagio in Las Vegas this is much larger. They play music and many people come to see this.",
          "We thought this fountain show was amazing. Every 30mins it goes getting a good spot for photo is hard as this attraction draws so many ppl. So after watching one we hung around wandered over to eatery where we could sit down outside and watch next performance up close with no",
          "The place is perpetually too crowded and the show is nothing more than just a few minutes of lights shooting up and down. Do not bother visiting it. You are better off spending the time shopping in the mall instead.",
          "We stood on the bridge and watched the fountains was really good and emotional as I've heard every one saying how great they are and to see it for my self well what can I say but WOW. I wouldn't pay to go on the board walk as you have a fantastic view without buying g or you can",
          "We had dinner in a restaurant, the balcony of which looks right to the fountain. They play music in every 15 or 30 minutes and it's very beautiful, especially at night. Wonderful experience.",
          "The dancing fountains near the Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa is a delight to watch. Anything a short one (about 3-4 minutes), the show results every half hour we were told. It is an amazing show and worth the wait. The last time we saw it, it was more colorful. Wonder why this",
          "One of the greatest fountains in the world, the sound effect is amazing which suits the movement of the water. Around that there are many nice restaurant and coffe shops. Great view on Burj Khalifa",
          "the place during the evening is very crowded. very short duration. Average place. small kids will like.",
          "Its a amazing experience to See the beauty of Fountain and heard the song during the performance of the fountain.also relaxing when we saw the beautiful Creature.#DubaiFountain",
          "When the show starts, the areas around the fountain get very crowded, so make sure to go there in advance and get a good spot. She show is very beautiful and the music is in sync with the water dance. It's a must do while you are around Burj Khalifa. If you can get on the top,",
          "I always check out fountain waterfall in Dubai it\u2019s truly amazing and beautiful to see , had dinner at Todd English and can a nice view while having dinner",
          "Worth a visit if in Dubai. Very crowded but the atmosphere is amazing lots to see and plenty of restaurants to choose from if eating",
          "We waited for atleast an hour for the show to start.It was extremely crowded and no place to sit or stand.However,the show was good,but lasted for a very short time.Hardly 8 minutes.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Different show every thirty minutes, so a restaurant with views recommended.",
          "Waited around quite a long time for this, but managed to get a sat which made it manageable. Beautiful show with lovely music. Highly recommend.",
          "Nice huge fountain show, great to see from te top of Burj Khalifa and also on the ground. Different songs are played throughut the day.",
          "Very nice show, the music is really good and the water moves in sync with the music, it is really nice, and the song changes every 30 minutes.",
          "Go straight to the Fountains when visiting the Dubai Mall. Try to get a lake side view so turn up well before each (30 minute) show. Or find seating at one of the restaurants overlooking the Fountains to enjoy at liesure.",
          "I went there so many times and always enjoy. Every person I took there was impressed. There are smoking and non smoking areas around the fountain so families with children would better check about those areas.",
          "We were lucky enough to be sat at a restaurant table overlooking the fountains so got to watch maybe 4 shows and it was just incredible! Definitely go and watch, it's beautiful! Every half an hour they go and in the meantime the light show on the Burj Khalifa is every half an",
          "It is always crowded, so that's a good sign right? Personally I think they are beautiful. There are many places from where you can see them, even from a boat inside the lake, but it will cost you. Having a free full panoramic view is tricky. Either you see one side or the other.",
          "Every 30 minutes an amazing fountain show a must visit one evening if your in town. Each show is different so hang aroudn for a few",
          "Perfectly on time, extremely clean and safe. You could not ask for any more. It was also very easy to find your destination and get tickets.",
          "I was impressed by the fountain play with the music, Light and the amazing view of the Burj Khalifa. I would recommend going while its dark! Look at several performances as they are different every time!",
          "Must watch Dubai fountain, exclusive and it's amazing in lights (evening time). Every show is different and be on time to get good view",
          "Easily accessible from Dubai mall. Lots of great restaurants on the waters edge. It\u2019s great fun. Kids and visitors love it.",
          "These fountains are no Bellagio (Las Vegas). We saw 2 different shows. The first was the night show. The first show starts at 6:00pm. We viewed this show just outside the Dubai Mall entrance. This location wasn't the best because it's at the end of the fountains. Yes there was",
          "I have been to the fountain twice and I absolutely loved it both times. It is crowded but you can still find a good place to see the show from many locations, especially if you take the time to hunt for a spot. The music is wonderful and the show is spectacular!!!! I would",
          "Really great amusement for families with children! Show goes every 30 minutes mixed with laser show on Burj Khalifa",
          "Every hour if i am not mistaken there was the show. We were their to see the show at noon, very nice its huge and perfect synchronised with music.",
          "One of the few things to do in Dubai for FREE and that really will take your breath away! The Dubai Fountains show is happening every 30 minutes accompanied with best music tunes for the pleasure of Dubai tourists and residents! At night, enjoy a spectacular view of Burj Khalifa",
          "Dubai fountain (or Spring in Hindi) located in the lake between Souk AI Bahar and The Dubai Mall. Dancing water performances are held daily last up to 5 minutes, free of charge and visible from every point nearby the fountain lake. The water robots make the water seem to dance",
          "If you are from litle country-as I am-it is so interesting to see all those people..and listeng to nice music.",
          "Definately worth the wait (and crowds) to see the dancing foutains of Dubai. Every 30 minutes from 6pm and there are various points you can view it from. They do a different show/song (I think there are 7 different ones) so even if you have seen it once, the odds are you see it",
          "The Dubai Fountain show is a must visit when in Dubai Mall. Burj Khalifa, Dubai Fountain with a view of Burj Khalifa from the outside, Underwater Zoo & Underwater Aquarium are all inside the mall. The fountain show starts every 30 mins for 5 mins. It is magical. Dancing fountain",
          "Visited Dubai in January, Burj Khalifa is very impressive! Water shows from 6.30 just outside the mall definitely worth a visit. Party their was no Khalifa show on the night we were there",
          "It is the second time I have visited the Fountains, the first was some 2.5 years ago while on a trip to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. I am sure that the first time there was coloured lights enhancing the visual experience with pop music as a backing track. This time, it was some",
          "Very artistic and beautiful. Enjoyed watching it however you need to be very early, get a good standing position so you can watch it all. The best position is to watch it from the apple store upstairs.",
          "lovely. but best views are from the mall's Apple store - above crowd's heads and perfecting cool with a/c haha July is way too hot, even in the evening!",
          "The shows are every half an our but if you want a good view you need to get there as 1 show ends and wait for the next show so you can stand at the front. Definitely go through the week and not on weekends as it's way too crowded then.",
          "If you are planning to see the tallest building in the world or go shopping at he biggest mall in the world, try to plan your time to see the dancing fountain which is near. The first showing of the dancing lights start at 6 PM. The later the better. Seven PM is a good time.",
          "We visited in January 2020.it was raining that day.i didn't think it was that great as I found fountains better in other places",
          "We ate dinner on the outside patio of the Bebabel restaurant during the fountain show. It was quite impressive and not to be missed but is only about 2 minutes long so pay attention and don\u2019t dally if you\u2019re going to watch or photograph/video any of the show. We have heard",
          "A nice choreographed display of lights with accompanying music. Watched it at night and during the day, both beautiful. Pretty area with nice reflections off the lake as the sun was setting.",

        "wiki": "The Dubai Miracle Garden (In Arabic: \u062d\u062f\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u0628\u062f\u0628\u064a) is a flower garden located in the district of Dubailand, Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The garden was launched on Valentine's Day in 2013. The garden occupies over 72,000 square metres (780,000 sq ft), making it the world's largest natural flower garden featuring over 50 million flowers and 250 million plants.In April 2015, the garden was awarded the Moselle Award for New Garden Experiences of the year by the Garden Tourism Award 2015.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe concept of the first miracle garden project was formed under an agreement between Dubailand and the Dubai Properties Group destination. The project development was done under an agreement with Akar Landscaping and Agriculture Company, led by Jordanian businessman Abdel Naser Rahhal. The cost of the project was estimated at AED 40 million (US$11 million).Phase one of the project was completed and opened in February 2013 which consisted of 21,000 sq. ft. outdoor facility including vertical and horizontal landscaping design where each of them have their own design. The development of phase one took two months and required 400 workers. Phase two of the project was initiated in mid-June 2013 and was completed in October, where it involved the 70 percent expansion of the 21,000 sq ft and construction of the 850,000 sq ft multistory car park, which increased the total area of the garden to 2 million sq ft. Phase two development also included the addition of the floral clock, the butterfly garden, retail stores and mosques.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nThe Dubai Miracle Garden operates from October to April and remains closed from May to September due to high temperatures with an average of 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F), which is not conducive for flower viewing.\n\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe flowers are maintained by re-use of treated wastewater through drip irrigation method with an average amount of 757,082 litres (166,535 imperial gallons; 200,000 US gallons) of water per day. According to the officials of Dubai Miracle Garden, the Dubai municipality retreats the grey water of the city and sends it directly to the garden. The garden again re-filters the water and converts it to a very high quality water for its usage at the garden. The garden is only watered after the closing hours at night. \n\n\n== Dubai Butterfly Garden ==\nIn 2015 Dubai Miracle Garden opened the Dubai Butterfly Garden, the world\u2019s largest and the region\u2019s first indoor butterfly garden and sanctuary for over 15,000 butterflies from 26 species.\n\n\n== Agreement with Disney ==\nAs part of a licensing deal between the Dubai Miracle Garden and The Walt Disney Company, a topiary of Mickey Mouse was unveiled in February 2018. Flower structures of Minnie Mouse, Goofy, Pluto, Daisy Duck, Donald Duck,  and Huey, Dewey, and Louie were installed later that year.\n\n\n== Guinness World Records ==\nThe Dubai Miracle garden has so far made 3 Guinness World Records. In 2013; the Dubai Miracle garden was declared as the world's largest vertical garden. Currently; an Airbus A380 flower structure in the garden is listed by Guinness World Records as the biggest flower structure in the world. The 18 metres (59 ft) topiary of Mickey Mouse, which weighs almost 35 tonnes, is the tallest topiary supported sculpture in the world.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nA scene of a Bollywood film Hamari Adhuri Kahani, starring  Emraan Hashmi and Vidya Balan, was shot in the garden. The director, Mohit Suri, stated that though Dubai was generally known for its high-tech buildings and modern landscapes, he wanted to romanticise it and show its softer side.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nDubai Miracle Garden Blog\nDubai Miracle Garden Pictures\nDubai Miracle Garden Photo Gallery\nDubai Miracle Garden Images\nDubai Miracle Garden: A Heavenly Feeling",

          "This might be a place to visit for the people who are in love with Bollywood movies. This Park was well planned and well organized. The main attraction of this park was its entrance. It was very spacious and well designed. Also, I liked the way they welcome the tourist. A",
          "That place is not very good for my family . Only on Bollywood theme park which is a little a bit expensive only for entry . Other wise its just different theme parks here which can,nt explore in one day",
          "Visited bollywood theme park in Dubai last year in December. Thanks to my friend who took our son to Lego land which is adjacent to this park, as it gave my wife and me to enjoy this place which is not best place to take small kids as they can't enjoy all the rides or shows.",
          "Beautiful park, very well maintained, excellent service from the staff. The shows are very entertaining and the rides are great, highly recommended for kids and adults. If it's crowded try Krrish and Lagaan rides. The Rajmahal Theatre is amazing! I definitely will come back",
          "I really liked the idea but certainly not the service.....the staff saw us pushed out of our place in the line more than ones and didn't say a word and that pushed us outside of our comfort zone....was really disappointed. The dance was a good idea but wasn't enjoyable....over",
          "It was my first time visiting bollywood parks dubai, its a good place for family and lots of active crew dancers were there to entertain all the guests, my nephew was very excited and most of all he enjoyed krrish ride, sholay the hunt for gabbar, & lagaan.",
          "We have visited Bollywood parks Dubai on 29th march 2020 and it was amazing experience. I will suggest you to visit and watch 4D rides (Karish and RaOne). Place was little crowded but if you have Q-pass you can watch all rides without any queue.",
          "Entertainment package!!! Kids from 5 years and up are allowed to go in the rides and less than 4 yeras are not allowed because there is height limit !!! They have less entertainment for kids. Its very far from paking to the gate ..",
          "The most useless thing to visit in dubai!! Please don't waste ure valuable time and hard earned money!!",
          "i visited with kith and kin and each of us had a fabulous time. a huge shout-out to all the dancers who kept us entertained the entire day not only with their well trained, energetic and rhythmic moves but also stole my heart with their broad smiles and a wide range of facial",
          "should visit at least once, the theme rides are nice experience for kids and adults. In summer I dont know how it would be as we have to wait on long queues and much rides we cant enjoy due to this in weekends. Week days would be probably the right time to visit as the lines",

          "Extremely poor quality of the 3D Glasses for Don The Chase. Visuals are hazy and its definitely not worth waiting for 55 mins for a 5 min ride which isn't even enjoyable",

          "you must visit it and discover it and you will learn a lot about Indian culture through visiting Bollywood.",

          "Can't say if worth its original non-discounted price as I went on a promotional ticket price of AED 29 only. But worth going once for the live performances by the artists.",

          "We had free tickets from staying at the nearby Lapita hotel and so decided to check out Bollywood Park! Not knowing many Indian movies or the stars, we went along with an open mind and really enjoyed our time here! There are a few good rides, good photo opportunities, great",
          "Wouldn't go there again and wouldn't recommend unless you have nothing better to do in Dubai. Some rides and posters, that is it. The kids (ages 15 to 10 years) wanted to leave within 30 min of getting in.",
          "We visited Bollywood parks in February 2020, it was a great experience. The shows were very good and well choreographed, the shows repeat many times during the day so you won\u2019t miss any. The Krish ride was ok but the performances are definitely the best. My favourite was Hero",
          "The theme is nicely built-in to the park, with every nook and corner filled with minutely detailed Bollywood things. The rides are also unexpectedly nice, fun & thrilling to an extent. Went on Valentine's day so got to enjoy the live performances of Sanah Moidutty & Sanam Puri's",
          "1st time visited this park, it was nice to see dancing show, every time we have been there dancing group was changing costumes and moved to different places of the park, they created the atmosphere of Bollywood. There are just 5 rides, not so much attractive, however it\u2019s",

          "We have never been to an amusement park which is so pathetic. It should be shut down immediately. There are no rides....only shows. The quality of the shows is worse than street plays in India. And most of the shows were closed on the day we went.",
          "The theme park is good concept,very well maintained and entertaining too.Especially enjoyable for kids.They would love the Krrish,Ra one,sholay,Don rides. But it seems authorities have heard about only Shahrukh khan,Amir khan,and Salman khan,and ofcourse Farhan Akhtar.One ride",

          "I chanced upon an add offering an entry to the park with unlimited access to all rides, a meal voucher and a screening of a just released movie. As we have been to all the other parks in Dubai Parks and resorts except for Bollywood Park, I took this opportunity to try this out.",
          "I'd like to start by saying that I am not a Bollywood fan and that I have not seen a single Bollywood film featured in the park, and yet my family and I had tons of fun. The park is considerably smaller compared to Motiongate, but will still take you a good 6 hours to see all",
          "I been today Visit to Bollywood park all experience is fine but when we enter to watch the movie they cancel the show . It\u2019s really terable. When we go out with high expectations specially watching the Movie Bharat, I really not happy with that it\u2019s really bad experience for me",

          "Dubai is place of experience, with plenty of different activities and options for travellers. Shortlisting few is definitely very difficult. But bollywood theme park should rate right up there alongside ski world or Ferrari World as such. Unique bollywood theme, plenty of 4D/5D",
          "We found the Bollywood park an overly priced attraction in Dubai when compared to others, the value is not great as the hefty ticket price, there are only 5 rides and couple of shows. The major attraction and entertaining show is the live shows and live dances they perform on",
          "The best time to visit Bollywood Park is after 4pm. After enjoying all the 3d/4d/7d rides, the main attraction which is the live dance performances start in the evenings. We happened to be in the right place at the right time and did not miss any of the shows. The 360 Krish ride",

          "We had a great day Bollywood parks. It was not at all crowded so got to see the shows and try all the (limited number of) rides. Decor is done nicely. Don't come here expecting a theme park with lots of high adrenaline rides. They could put more rides and shows in the park",
          "The Dubai parks & resorts was a revelation! Themed in line with Disneyland, the facility is spacious and spread out, with lots of parking area and a tram system ferrying visitors to the various individual parks. We visited the Bollywood parks and spent over 4 hours there",
          "Bollywood park is a theme based park where VR technology is used to give us a feeling of going on ride. We went on Don't which was amazing. Lagaan has rides for children, which was loved by my son. The VR ride was good,but it wasn't connected to the movie. We loved the Sholey",
          "A waste of time and money. I dont know what possessed us to go here but it is a shambles. Boring rubbish virtual reality rides that are all the same. Spent 15 minutes in here and got bored. Im not surprised it was dead and there were no more than 4/5 people queuing for each",
          "Bollywood themed rides and attractions . The rickety rolller coastor simulator ride Lagaan- The Thrill of Victory and Krish-Hero's flight are the unique ones. Do not miss the Jan-E-Jigar musical which will enthrall you with light and sound effects. Plan your visit on a",
          "This is the first Bollywood themed park in the world and features rides and attractions from popular Bollywood franchises like Don, Sholay, Krissh etc. There are several rides, a shooting game based on Sholay, stunt shows, live music shows and a Bollywood type show at night in",

          "Heard that Dubai Park is going bankrupt and the Bollywood park will be shut soon. It totally deserves it - what a waste of time and money. Nice ambience (if the weather is good) but there is nothing beyond that - the shows and the 3-4 rides they have are a joke. Very poor",
          "This theme park is very entertaining and full of activities and musical shows and dance performances. Rides are very less but worth trying. Half day is enough for this park so it is better to combine it with Motion Gate. Buy combine ticket to save price.",
          "Again we got the tickets as part of staying at the Lapita It's fantastic to look at, we never went on the rides to be honest as we had alot to do in a short time :) Will certainley revisit when we go back Watched a live show which was pretty cool also.",
          "Spend half day here and was totally worth it. The live shows that pop up all the time are great and also a chance to meet a few look alike actors. The hall of hero\u2019s is awesome and the 3D rides are great. Fun day out",
          "The place has 7 rides of different kind which has made an excellent mix of technology and Bollywood movies. The theme of various Bollywood movies is used for rides and is done nice excellent way. Also there are cafeterias and restaurants for food. Some shows have specific times",

          "We were picked up from our hotel around 2.30 PM and reached around 3.30 Pm. We had to wait for a while since the live dance started only at 4 Pm. We watched two live performances and also saw two shows which were good. But it was nothing compared to Universal studios Singapore",

          "A great evening of entertainment . Definitely something different . A range of indoor and outdoor shows. A couple of 4d rides alll based around Indian movies. I would suggest this for children over 6 yrs , little ones might not be able to go on the 4d rides. I would also",
          "Not too great, its just an average park, no need to spend or waste a whole day here, park can be done in maximum 3 hours, there is nothing wow there, not such great rides, you\u2019ll just find too many restaurants inside instead of attractions. I\u2019d recommend to take one more park",

          "Rides are not up to the standard accept Krish . Entry price on higher side , suggest not to go alone better to take one day 2 park ticket just to pay 45 dhs extra",
          "It is a small theme park with music, dance and colour. The timings are limited as the park closes at 9:00 pm. A good show Jaan-e-Jigar of live performances. Various live dance shows....Very expensive for the amount... full of Indians only",

          "We were travelling with a child (Under 3 Yrs) was looking for not so much of thrill rides like in other theme parks so opted for Bollywood Park and it was indeed an amazing time we had. The Indoor rides are actually quite fun and exciting. The Dance performances inside the park",
          "We all really enjoyed this park. As we were staying at Lapita we covered the park for a couple of hours over 2 days. There are 4 of 5 rides and they are all 3D/4D of which my 6 year old son loved the Sholay and Krishh rides the most (He doesn\u2019t watch much Bollywood but still",
          "It\u2019s good if you\u2019re Tamil. Otherwise don\u2019t bother. Hardly any rides, most shows that don\u2019t start for hours after you arrive. And when they do start they are extremely boring. My advice would be to stick to the other parks.",
          "There is like 5-7 rides and 2 are for children. The left 5 for the adults is more like 3d and 4d experience. And that can you get at an movie Theater as well. We bought souvenirs from one off the shops, and one off them is broken. It was 2 cups and one handle is broken. We spent",
          "Me and my girls went to Bollywood theme park, it was a huge let down. First I thought it was overpriced at 99 dirhams.As we went in there seemed just souvenir shops selling souvenirs from old fillms like krish . But for 99 dirhams entrance fee was not worth it. The only saving",
          "After the ho~hum experience at Motiongate, there was a bit more life in Bollywood Park, but no shows as they reduced down to 1 show a day, and barely any ambience. I'd used the Entertainment app to get discounted 2parksin1day tickets so shrugged off the scaled back",
          "I am a big Bollywood fan and this place is just for someone like me!! Was there with my girlfriend and had a great time! The top show is of course the musical show in the Rajmahal!! Definetly recommended.",
          "This place has 4 to 5 rides and lots of plays and shows (all inclusive in the park every ticket). There main attraction warrants another ticket (didn't had time to watch it, so can't comment on it). If you can spend say a complete evening then only it's worth to go there",
          "I loved the park was amazing however I feel that it can improve. To have more shows rides faster. \u201cRoller Coaster \u201c DVD/CD of the Park ie The Activities at Bollywood Parks according to day. Bhangra Music. Camera which customers wristband detects the customer and to make a DVD of",
          "I visited today with my partner. I'm a westerner with a great love for Bollywood and India in general. The park needs to have better rides and not just rely on tired 3 and 4D. The rides are all too similar and with the home tech coming out inside the next 18 months it will",
          "A nice day out if all the shows, street theatres and attractions are going. Visited on a weekend and was spoilt for choice with entertainment but out of the weekend shows and times were limited and the rajmahal theatre show (which is A - MAY - ZING!) wasn't on. Our only slight",
          "The parks are quite a distance away but free shuttle bus from selected hotels and shopping malls. Wasn\u2019t too busy so managed to get on all the virtual reality rides. Paid a bit extra to include unlimited drinks and food every hour from the three different restaurants definitely",
          "Views retail person and their welcoming especially Sita and Faizan.enjoy zindagi na milegi dobara. Everything was nice dance shows and rides.",
          "Went to the much talked about Bollywood park with two of my friends. Ticket is way pricey for what is offered at AED 175. When we reached at 4 pm the place looked like a ghost town. Few rides which are nothing to write home about. RA ONE simulation ride was probably the worst",
          "I loved the fact that there was a theme park dedicated to Bollywood at all! My husband and I enjoyed it greatly but wished there was a little more to be offered, on the scale of universal studios in the U.S. We were there for only about 2.5 hours and I expected to be there",
          "We went here in September 2018 and got to the place at 6pm. Decided we didn't want to brave the sun too much. We purchased tickets at the gate, however it is cheaper to buy online 3 days in advance. There are more simulations, rather then rides e.g. 4D and 3D seating. But we had",
          "Visited this park after reading the positive reviews and I am so glad I came here. A park filled with rides to go on...dances to see and food to eat. Highly recommend purchasing the unlimited food and drinks card. The rides were great fun...some were 4D rides. All the dancers",
          "Was really excited to visit this place, but it did not live up to the expectations. The architecture is absolutely amazing and without fault. The service is great and everything is accessible. Food is amazing with little stalls placed every few feet away and indoor cafes aswell.",
          "Personally I am a HUGE Bollywood fan! I know songs and dialogues of several movies at the tip of my tongue. I have visited the park 5 times already and every time I go, I have more fun than the last time. There is just so much to enjoy at the park - random dances happening at",
          "This is a tricky review- the park is beautiful but if you like me have no idea about Bollywood hero\u2019s and movies, it\u2019s hard to get into it. Some rides are great like the superhero 4D one. But we did not get into the shows at all and we tried three including the stunt show and",
          "Me and my family have visited bollywood Parks last weak. We had a very great time our kids enjoyed a lot in the attractions. The staff working is very approachable in the park. I really appreciate specially your staff. B'cos they are very helpful. We bought some stuffs in the",
          "We went to bollywood park with my 7 years old in the afternoon as it opens at 3 pm What an amazing place what a great idea Krish ride is the best Raj Mahal looks beautiful specially when you are passing by on the motorway And definitely worth trying the punjabi samosa It",
          "We have been in the Bollywood park it was very nice. Cinema making was very nice and krish ride. And the retail staff was very nice too much friendly they were talking with us like we were friends like we already know each other's thank you",
          "One of its kind and probably the only Bollywood theme park. The place is for somebody who loves Bollywood. It opens up in the afternoon going till evening, adjoining couple of other parks like Legoland etc. It has an entry fee, which you might feel on a higher side. Couple of 4D",
          "Had an awesome experience at Bolywood parks, full of excitmemt and thrills. Definitley a place you must visit, plenty of entertainment and surprises. If you visit Dubai and don\u2019t visit Bollywood parks you haven\u2019t lived! ;)",
          "If you are an ardent indian bollywood fan. You won't like it much. There is nothing great to do here. There are some 4d rides all with the same concept only the movies they choose are different and they have taken some historic movies and tried to depict some shows about it. But",
          "The Bollywood Park Dubai is a unique experience. Enjoy this great park and watch a bollywood show. Very nice",
          "Went to Bollywood park not knowing what to expect but so glad we did. As we entered the park a caddy car pulled up To take us to the park. Wow no Walking in the heat. We were the first ones to arrive at 3 pm so it was a little quiet. Park Itself is very clean. The Rajmahal is so",
          "What a great afternoon. Park opened at 3pm. 20AED to park car We when just after the park had opened was not very busy, did not have to queue to get in. We went for the unlimited food and drinks in the park. Get shows, and great rides. Food was good aswell.",
          "Get a thrill of Bollywood in Dubai.This park is now days one of the top most attraction when you are in Dubai.Park time is normally from afternoon 2 to 12 AM.This is away from the city and hence always recommended to book taxi.",
          "Really enjoyed the trip, specially all the street performances. Rides were average. They had average quality food.",
          "One of four parks at the Dubai Parks and Resorts. Great experience as you feel like you\u2019re at the heart of India with the Taj Mahal museum, the music, the small traditional shops and the rich Bollywood art.",
          "Full of fun, Amazing virtual rides related to bollywood movies, must go to unlimited food and drink deal really worth it. Must try zindagi na melay dubara experience.",
          "Its a miniature of Kingdom of Dreams Gurgaon with a some more masala of Salman Khan old age Dabaang drama. Very loud with OK OK acting. Ticket prices are high not just for this one but overall in Dubai too expensive for these parks.",
          "If you are a Bollywood fan then you will love this place. We got a good deal on tickets which included food and drink. We arrived about 3pm and the park wasn't that busy so we were able to go on all the rides without having to queue. The Sholay ride we went on twice as my 4",
          "Great rides, food is good! go for the fast express tix or you will spend time waiting around in queues! Loved the ZNMD bit!",
          "Average park for Indies. Must appreciate the effort in fan service. But it's a shade below expected compared to other parks and mostly copies ideas. Would recommend only to combine and finish in 2 hours. The film making process in ZNMD is immersive",
          "Opened at 3pm, we were the only ones on two rides, great experience felt like VIP. We were able to go on the rides twice with less than five minutes wait. The theme park was beautiful, the lights at night was breathtaking. This place would be great for an hen do, family day out",
          "I celebrated my birthday with family last Saturday and being Bollywood aficionados, we enjoyed every moment of our stay there. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The park ambience is very vibrant with catchy filmy tunes being played and dance shows. The VR rides based on",
          "Point of reference - June 2018 family of 5 We thought it would be exciting but as we entered the adviser asked are you sure you want to come in here, there are no rides. Positives The cinema building is spectacular and there is a live dance show. hence I gave this place a",
          "Great park but very empty. The architect is amazing but very few food places. Rides are decent but all of them ate virtual. Would go again but maybe later just before sunset as the heat in June is unbearable",
          "When we arrived, it was like a ghost town. At 3:30 pm, there were no queues or people. There was no waiting to purchase the tickets which are not cheap! Entering the park, we were still confused as there was nobody about. Onto to the first ride - DON. Again, no queuing,",
          "First ever Bollywood park ever. Great fun for all ages. They had some amazing shows with live performances. The rides weren't all that great but The krrish Ride will just blow you away. Took alot of souvenirs from here as it was on sale n really good quality stuff which i could",
          "Bollywood park it's big and amazing park in Dubai You can taste the \"bollywood atmosphere\" around you staff is friendly and you have a lot of attractions Bollywood music, dance and \"actors\" are everywhere The souvenirs shops are expensive and what you will find there you can buy",
          "First experience involving Bollywood. If you go during Ramadan, the park is pretty empty. Got on every ride in less than 5 minutes. Learned how to dance and danced on the street. Better to go with someone with an Emirates ID so you can save 80 dirhams each. Even enjoyed the",
          "So we were a little late, reached around 7pm and the park is open till 10:30. Keep in mind it takes you atleast 30mins to reach the actual park from the parking. A tram picks you up from the parking lot and takes you to 3 different stations. After getting off at the station its",
          "We visited last week and our experience was pleasant. Staff were all very friendly. With it being ramadan, a few rides were closed and there was less entertainment on the streets than there should have been due to it being ramadan, which was a little disappointing. Other than",
          "Spent about 5 hours in bollywood park thoroughly enjoyed it did not have to queue a lot as the park was quiet due to the hollymonth -The music shows and dances were fabulous-I loved chasing Don along the street of Dubai.If you like bollywood the Park is a must",
          "We had been only the 2nd last day of our trip to Bollywood park. There was less rush due to Ramadan. The must 1. Zinadagi Na Milgegi Dobara. 2. Sholy Ride for fun 3. The dance performances - Just amazing 4. Lagaan We had a very good time here. One will Have all the drama",
          "Spent a day here, was a little quiet but had a great time. Just needed better info on transport!!!!!",
          "It is a highly underrated theme park which is gaining popularity.The atmosphere and the design is reminiscent of a typical bollywood studio. All rides based on Bollywood superheroes are electric. The 4d shows based on popular movies are thrilling especially the lagan ride makes",
          "If you don't have any plans to do in Dubai then I would suggest that you should go to Bollywood Park. There were some awesome dance and act performances which were worth watching. There are 3D and 4D halls which is well enjoyable. You can enjoy the food and drinks at cafe just",
          "Booked a day at Bollywood park and was very disappointed. Was told that some rides not open until 7pm and were asked to try another ride. We went on Ra One which was good but a bit short. Were then told to go to Krissh. Waited in the queue for 10 minutes to be told that this",
          "Most Indians here as you\u2019d expect Great live shows and although park is small it\u2019s well done We featured in a live movie take which was a buzz It wasn\u2019t great for us but then we didn\u2019t expect it to be given the reviews we read Enjoyable",
          "Am Shabana Malekkudy. This was my First Visit in Bollywood Park, I visit Motiongate also before couple of months. But Bollywood Park is really amazed me and my family, like good awesome experience us for Family Fun. My opinion is A Must Visit and Watchable Park, all the rides",
          "This was my second visit at Bollywood Park. The place is amazing for people who love the Indian culture and Bollywood. True to bollywood it is very colourful, happy and fun place to go. True there are not a lot of rides, but there's so many Bollywood and Indian themed stuff to",
          "I\u2019m giving this 3 stars because we had a 2 day all parks access pass, had we have purchased a pass specifically for Bollywood Park it would be more like a 2. The place is pretty impressive to see, and there is music playing around the park, but other than this and the",
          "Had been to Riverland in Dubai during April end 2018. It is a long walk to the Bollywood Park. Nevertheless the place is awesome with huge replicas of film sets especially Rajkamal and Mughal-e-Azam. Since I am wheelchair bound, was disappointing to not be able to take any",
          "I gave Bollywood Parks a 4 rating because I purchased a special combo ticket deal with Motiongate. If I purchased a ticket for the park on its own then I would had marked it down a lot. Bollywood Parks only becomes alive in the evening when the colourful spectacle stands out",
          "We had a very enjoyable day at Bollywood parks... The kids had a wonderful time. The rides were absolutely amazing...",
          "No words to explain actually the experience. I lived my childhood in those short 9 hours at the park. One of the first to enter, one of the last to leave. If you love all things Bollywood, this place is a must go. Interesting souvenirs, foot-tapping music all around, dancing in",
          "It is not my first time at Dubai Parks and Resort and in Bollywood Park, which I really enjoy it however this last time, was a completely disappointing and frustrating experience. My whole family is in town for vacations and we decided to go to Bollywood Park on Sunday 22nd",
          "We visited the place on a Friday. When you enter you need to pay 20 AED for the parking ticket. Post which you can take a tram which will drop you at the park entrance. Motion gate and Bollywood parks are close by. They have various movie based performances which is a god",
          "Very Clean... new experience, plenty of meal options and NOT that expensive. For Family Fun. A must visit for those who watch Bollywood movies... minimum 4 Hrs during week days and around 7 Hrs during weekend required to spend within Bollywood park only. Best time to go morning",
          "Its India's attempt at a theme park... on the right track but still needs to come a long way... limited attractions and if you time it right you can be done in about 3 hours.",
          "Loved this place. Loads of innovative rides and shows with fantastic planning and lay out. A really interesting and engaging park.",
          "They have Bollywood movies based theme rides. Most of the rides are virtual where in with their sound and 3d/5d/7d image gives you a virtual story based rides. Most of the rides are similar with different levels. Krish ride is the best one. They keep on doing open air theatre as",
          "Every hall is designed on different bollywood movie and gives a different experience. 7D experience in krish hall, Dabang performance and Zindagi na milegi dobara were the best I could experience. You need 1 entire day at least to experience all the attractions within bollywood",
          "I wasn\u2019t a fan. We arrived kind of later in the day and you would think they would do partial prices for half days but they didn\u2019t. The rides were all virtual and pretty boring. It should have been 30 AED instead of 260. 6 maybe 7 rides but they did have a replica of the Taj",
          "The Bollywood Park is really fun and lively. I'm not Indian, and for me the food, music, and ambiance is exotic, colourful and fascinating. However, the best thing is the Jaan E Jigar show, which is a Bollywood musical. It is the best show in Dubai! The music is fantastic,",
          "What a lifeless and activity-less place which doesn't even deserve to be called a park or resort !!! Two thumbs down",
          "Great place if you are familiar to bollywood. Covered almost all shows. Make sure you have at least 8-9 hours to cover everything. Had an awesome experience.",
          "Bollywood Parks, Dubai offers Virtual rides with 4d-5d effects based on Bollywood movie themes. We specially enjoyed Krish and Zindagi na milegi dobara themes. The whole park is designed like a mini India and revolved around popular movies like Sholay, Lagaan, RA-1, etc",
          "Fan of Indian music and dance, I was really intrigued to go visit the Bollywood Park. We arrived there around 6 PM and got a ticker for the evening show at the theater as well. The place was very cleaned, interesting to walk around. We had two hours before the show start and it",
          "Situated at Dubai parks,its smallest among all but worth a visit for a bollywood fan.It can easily take 6-7 hr to enjoy the park leisurely. The park is situated away from Dubai city,best is to visit by taxi but if wants to save some bucks then take metro to UAE Exchange (Jabel",
          "Bollywood Park is really an exciting place for families. As per my knowledge The main attraction is 'Dabaang' Live Show, but no show on last Monday when we visited the park so we are little bit disappointed. Secondly one must try the 'Sholay' Ride. Suitable for any age group,",

          "Though resident in UAE, we did not get an opportunity to visit the park till now. The visit was really worth it. The park is well designed and well maintained. The rides were very nice and gave wholesome family entertainment. The layout is not too big and walking across",
          "I visited with my two kids today to the Bollywood park. its a very entertaining place but I am not happy with customer service including the staffs at the tram stops. my 4-year-old son got excited to get on the merry go round ride inside the lagan area. It was very quiet and",

          "Paid 150 dirhams for the VIP ticket of jaan-e-jigar show inside Bollywood park. It was the worst hamming I have seen. Lack of story, lack of talent and just a medley of hit Bollywood Songs. I wouldnt pay more than 15 dirhams for this. That too if I don't value my time.",
          "Very much enjoyed it , everything be it the rides , staff people , cleanliness , dance shows it was mind blowing ! A must visit place for Bollywood freaks like me !!!",
          "I always travel between Abudhabi and Dubai, from the highway I kept seeing this park under construction until completed but never expected this huge park. We really enjoyed all the shows and 3D rides with bollywood heroes.",

          "I purchased the tickets from the dubai parks n resorts website for aed 85 per person at the time of some offer. We visited in march. The general parking is aed 20. You have to catch a tram to the main park. It was very convenient. The walk through riverland towards india gate",
          "Maybe we were lucky. The drizzly rain gave up the ghost at about 2pm and, although the sun didn't shine, it dried up nicely. Good job, really, because the throwing of the multi-coloured powder to celebrate the Hindu Spring Festival of Holi would have gotten extremely messy if",
          "The Bollywood park is a very good idea and very entertaining but lacks the atmosphere. We went on the weekend and the park was almost empty. A lot of the small food stalls which I was looking forward were closed. We ate at one place where we had a veg and non-veg thali. Food was",
          "We came to this park on 28th February. Really enjoyed the few rides they had. The place was bit life less. Lacking atmosphere, hardly anyone around and a lot of stalls were closed. I thought they would have had live dances on the open stage but not much happening, is it off",

          "..a great place specially for those who r not indians and have spent their lives watching bollywood movies.",
          "The live entertainment was great. Amazing dancers and stunt show for Dabang. The rest of the simulation rides were average. Hardly any of the street food stalls were open on our visit. We went on a Tuesday until 7.45pm. Also this park opens at 2pm, this was not mentioned",
          "There are several parks here with, including a water park, legoland etc so check what your ticket allows, allow at least a day per park (come with a Dubai resident and get massive discounts) Everything you would expect of a theme park but with live shows. The rides are 3 and 4 D",

          "If you plan to visit just the bollywood theme park then not worth visiting it. If its part of your stay at Lapita or you will visit other theme parks with it then it makes sense to go there. Indians would not like it much, especially those who have been to Ramoji might not find",
          "It is all Bollywood based, so in case Hindi films are your flavour, then this is the place. Good simulation rides and experiences in the Park. Enough to keep you and your family busy for the whole evening and even till late night. Good eating options as well on the park.",
          "This park teaches us a lot about how filming is done and has live shows. I think its best to go on weekdays so that there are no waiting lines as weekends are quite busy. I think older kids would enjoy this more and if you enjoy Bollywood movies then definitely go at least once",

          "This is a place full of promise but ultimately disappointment. The food is disappointing. The atmosphere is disappointing. I wanted to find authentic, genuine bollywood / hindi themes, food and people. Food is way overpriced and shows in english is a real shame. The saving",
          "We reached this park at the fag end of the day at about 10.0 PM.It closes at 11.0 PM. We could experience only two shows. Krrish was a hi fi technical experience and so was the RaOne which was a 3D show. We could actually feel the thrill sitting snugly in our seats.We could also",

          "We had a very high expectations for this park but disappointed. All rides are almost same type with different themes. No roller coasters but simulated rides. As such not many rides. Dance competition was boring. ZNMD was good. It\u2019s definitely not worth AED175.",

Or perhaps because with regular tickets priced at AED 285 ($78) per person, I expected more rides. The park is clean and safe. There is a massive parking lot. It\u2019s",
          "I have to say we had a good time. The lagaan movie based roller coaster, the krish, the Sholay were all good experiences but I don't think people not used to Bollywood would enjoy as much. Still some rides are to start which should make it better. It's a long way from Dubai",
          "Many have thought that Bollywood Park may not be as interesting as it may seem especially to those who are not a big fan of bollywood movies. However, these thoughts don't really matter once you get there. The fascinating designs and architecture is exceptional. Not to mention",
          "The park is a good fun filled family day out with a nice atmosphere. Although it is very quiet at the moment that is no bad thing as you don't have to wait too long to get on to the attractions. The street shows and talented dancers are awesome and want to make you dance.",

          "Surprise surprise! We were reluctant to actually visit this park and we wrongly assumed that it wouldn't be interested for us since we don't have any knowledge about Indian movies, actors nor language and Bollywood in general. We walk late , thingking that 2 hours is enough but",
          "Every ride, show and production is a unique experience and I would highly recommend people spend at least half a day there. Special mention MUST be made of the quality of the food there. Rarely does one expect to eat a 5 star level food in theme parks. Bollywood Parks",
          "We took advantage of the special offer 3 parks in 1 day for 295 AED, which we thought was money well spent. As it is not that easily accessible we took a taxi from JLT to the parks, we arrived at the parks around 1030 Am and departed at 7pm!! We visited on a weekday, therefore",

          "A great themed park. Transports you to Mumbai the home of indian cinema in a riot of colour and design that is really second to none. The two main rides open during our visit Ra One and Krrish Hero's Flight are spectacular and rival anything at Universal. During the off peak",
          "This park consists of a few rides and shows although it is very small and there isn't much to do there. There are around 4 rides but some are pretty good. You could at max spend around 2 hours there. The good thing was that the lines weren't that long. Bollywood was a nice park",
          "The park is still being developed so there is not much to do at this point. We visited using a 3-parks-for the-price-of-one pass; otherwise, it would be a very costly to buy a ticket to this park that has limited attraction options. The day we were there, only three simulator",
          "One of its kind this theme park is !! For people who love Bollywood. The park caters to all genre of people. The park has rides / shows and godd food too. The best show was for zindagi na milegi dobara and the worst was Lagaan.",

        "wiki": "Dubai Marina (Arabic: \u0645\u0631\u0633\u0649 \u062f\u0628\u064a\u200e) is a district in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Dubai Marina is an artificial canal city, built along a 3-kilometre (2 mi) stretch of Persian Gulf shoreline. As of 2016, it has a population of 45,395. When the entire development is complete, it will accommodate more than 120,000 people in residential towers and villas. It is located on Interchange 5 between Jebel Ali Port and the area which hosts Dubai Internet City, Dubai Media City, and the American University in Dubai. The first phase of this project has been completed. Dubai Marina was inspired by the Concord Pacific Place development along False Creek in Vancouver, BC, Canada.There have been many instances of marine wildlife (especially whales and sharks) entering the marina, because of its proximity to the open sea.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nIn order to create the man-made marina, the developers brought the waters of the Persian Gulf into the site of Dubai marina, creating a new waterfront.\nThere is a large central waterway, excavated from the desert and running the length of the 3 km site. More than 12% of the total land area on the site has been given over to this central public space.\nAlthough much of this area is occupied by the marina water surface, it also includes almost 8 km of landscaped public walkways.The marina is entirely man-made and has been developed by the real estate development firm Emaar Properties of the United Arab Emirates and designed by HOK Canada. Upon completion, it is claimed to be the world's largest man-made marina. The current largest man-made marina in the world is Marina del Rey in California, United States. There is a publicly accessible foreshoreway around the marina and some sections of public oceanway along the beach with views to Palm Jumeriah. Its largest development is the Jumeirah Beach Residence. Dubai Marina opened doors to its only mosque Masjid Al Rahim in October 2013, which is situated in the southern end of the Marina.\n\n\n=== Phase I ===\nThe first phase of Dubai Marina covers 25 acres (100,000 m2), which includes six freehold apartment buildings, the Dubai Marina Towers. The phase I of Dubai Marina cost more than AED 1.2 billion. Three of the towers are named after precious stones, Al Mass, Fairooz, and Murjan, and the other three are named after Arabic scents, Mesk, Anbar, and Al Yass. The scheme was designed by HOK and the contractors were Al-Futtaim Carillion and Nasah Multiplex.\n\n\n=== Phase II ===\nThe Phase II of Dubai Marina will consist of high rise buildings, which are mainly clustered into a block, known as \"Tallest Block in the world\" with the majority of the skyscrapers ranges between 250 metres (820 ft) to 300 metres (984 ft), which includes Cayan Tower, Ocean Heights, Marina Pinnacle, Sulafa Tower and Ciel Tower, which rises to 366 metres (1,201 ft) meters and few are taller than 350 metres (1,148 ft) meters and 400 metres (1,312 ft), which includes Elite Residence, 23 Marina, Princess Tower, Marina 106, Marina 101, DAMAC Residenze, and the supertall Pentominium, which rises to 516 metres (1,693 ft) meters.\n\n\n=== Jumeirah Beach Residence ===\nJumeirah Beach Residence is a 1.7 kilometres (1.1 mi) long, 2 square kilometres (0.77 sq mi) gross floor area waterfront community located against the Persian Gulf in Dubai Marina. It is the largest single phase residential development in the world and contains 40 towers (35 are residential and 5 are hotels). JBR can accommodate about 15,000 people, living in its apartments and hotel rooms. The Project has 6,917 apartments, from 900 sq ft (84 m2) studios to 5,500 sq ft (510 m2) penthouses. Jumeirah Beach Residence was launched in August 2002 from the developer, Dubai Properties (a subsidiary of Dubai Holding) with the cost of 6 billion dirham and was completed in 2007. The Walk at JBR restaurant and shopping strip, which is adjacent to the beach behind JBR, is a very popular location for Al Fresco dining. There are five hotels, rated as 5 star or 4 star, three of which are purpose-built hotels, while the other two are converted residential towers.\n\n\n==== The Walk ====\n\nThe Walk at Jumeirah Beach Residence is a 1.7-kilometre strip at the ground and plaza level of the complex, it was developed by Dubai Properties, and was completed by 2007 and opened officially in August 2008.\n\n\n==== The Beach ====\nThe Beach at Jumeirah Beach Residence is a retail complex being constructed on the beach in front of JBR by Meraas Holding, a company owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. The development, comprising four plazas, will occupy the bulk of the beach between the Hilton and Sheraton hotels. The complex houses a number of levels of parking as well as seventy retail and food and beverage outlets, together with entertainment facilities.\n\n\n=== Al Sahab ===\nAl Sahab is a residential high rise development that consists of two towers; Tower 1 is a 44 story structure, and Tower 2 is a 24 story structure. The complex is on the waterfront and directly overlooks the largest bay of water at Dubai Marina. The buildings are in the northern end of the marina across from the Al Majara Towers near the Marina Quays. The complex features a gymnasium and squash court, swimming pool and open community area, a mini-theater, sheltered assigned parking, multi-function rooms, and eeting rooms.\n\n\n=== Al Majara ===\nAl Majara is a five-building residential complex comprising high-rise waterfront apartments adjacent to where the old Dubai Marina Yacht Club used to be and overlooks the largest part of the bay.\n\n\n=== Marina Promenade ===\nMarina Promenade is a  residential enclave in Dubai Marina. Nestled within the panoramic confines of Dubai Marina, it overlooks the widest and most scenic part of the bay and is ideally located opposite the Dubai Marina Yacht Club. The Marina Promenade comprises six residential towers and villas with views of the bay.\n\n\n=== Marina Quays ===\nMarina Quays is a complex designed by Arif & Bintoak, also responsible for the Concorde Tower. Along with apartments and villas, the development has shops and other outlets. The three residential buildings are joined by shared a podium. It has luxury apartments with panoramic views of the marina. The buildings are Quay East, Quay West and Quay North. The two shorter buildings are cantilevered, extending 20m over the Dubai Marina waterway. Amenities include a movie theatre, 24 hour security, a pool, concierge service and a swimming pool. As of 2016, luxury penthouses in the buildings sold in excess of 10 million Dirham. In 2018 five million tonnes of rock was added to create a breakwater for Marina Quays.\n\n\n=== Park Island ===\nPark Island is a four tower residential development comprising Blakely, Bonaire, Fairfield and Sanibel. The towers within Park Island have been placed with parks and landscaped gardens.\n\n\n=== Dubai Marina Mall ===\n\nDubai Marina Mall is a shopping mall located in the center of Dubai Marina and is one of the main shopping malls in Dubai. It features 140 retail outlets, spread over 390,000 sq ft of gross leasable space, making it one of the largest shopping malls in Dubai. The mall has been completed and opened in December 2008. The mall is linked to the 5-star Dubai Marina Hotel.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Dubai Marina (Dubai Metro) ===\n\nDubai Marina (Arabic: \u0645\u0631\u0633\u0649 \u062f\u0628\u064a) is a rapid transit station on the Red Line of the Dubai Metro in Dubai. It opened on 30 April 2010 as part of an extension to Ibn Battuta. Dubai Marina station is located near Interchange 5 of Sheikh Zayed Road, around 20 kilometres (12 mi) southwest of Downtown Dubai. It lies to the east of the northern half of the Dubai Marina and to the west of the northern portion of Jumeirah Lake Towers. Dubai Marina station lies on a viaduct paralleling the eastern side of Sheikh Zayed Road. It is categorised as a type 2 elevated station, indicating that there is an elevated concourse between street and platform level. Pedestrian access to the station is aided through walkways above Sheikh Zayed Road, connecting to developments on either side of the road. In September 2014, Damac Properties acquired the naming rights for the Dubai Marina Station, which resulted in it being renamed as the Damac Station.\n\n\n=== Dubai Tramway ===\n\nAl Sufouh Tramway is a tramway that operates in Al Sufouh, Dubai Marina. It runs 14.5 kilometres (9.0 mi) along Al Sufouh Road from Dubai Marina to the Burj Al Arab and the Mall of the Emirates. It interchanges with two stations of Dubai Metro's Red Line.  The Sufouh Tram also connects with the monorail of the Palm Jumeirah at the entrance of the Palm from Sufouh Road. After completion in 2014 it serves the residences of Dubai Marina and Jumeirah Beach Residence.The name was later changed to Dubai Trams.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nA zipline advertised as the \"longest urban zipline\" was installed here, which links Dubai Marina with the Dubai Marina Mall.\n\n\n== Education ==\nEmirates International School is close to Dubai Marina.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nOn 27 April 2006, a protest broke out among workers in Al Ahmadiya Contracting that caused the blocking of the company's construction site at Dubai Marina, damaging eight cars and two buses, destroying office property and documents, and roughing up a site engineer. The riot control wing of Dubai Police had rushed to the scene to control the situation and the police later succeeded in dispersing the agitating workers.In August 2015, various people (including police officers) were arrested, after they were caught with prostitutes and illegal alcohol, on a boat in Dubai Marina.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBluewaters Island\nList of tallest buildings in Dubai\nList of tallest residential buildings in Dubai\n\n\n== References ==",

          "A brand new souk... because obviously there just aren\u2019t enough of the things in Dubai already! This place was actually busier than the older souks and I think the reason is that you just don\u2019t get hassled here. It was a much more relaxed experience but ultimately the whole thing",

          "This is a fun place to visit filled with shops -- mostly touristy shops with stuffed animals, t-shirts, replicas of Burj Khalifa, shot glasses, postcards and such but it's also got some authentic pottery, jewelry and other more local flavor stores. It's architecturally",

Definitely worth a visit though and there are loads of great bars and restaurants, the theatre is also there.",

Souk shops were nice, but over pricey. Toilets very clean, WiFi good once you work out which one to",
          "This place is by far way more civilized and upscale than that of the old town city souk. It's a place that sells some beautiful Abaya dresses, scarves, middle eastern lamps and other wares. They also have wifi, Starbucks, ice cream stalls, and there is also an area that",

          "We spent a lovely afternoon with lunch and the boat tour. Many tourist shops and items without the craze and hassle of the Souks in Old Dubai City. The boat tour was expensive for what it was. You could probably take a boat taxi and see the same things for less.",
          "We stopped off here on the bus tour It\u2019s a beautiful souk, indoor mostly with some outdoor vendors Great variation of goods sold here Would definitely visit here again if ever in Dubai",
          "Except for the gold souk, I don\u2019t think there are trinkets being sold in the other souks that you couldn\u2019t find here. They have everything from souvenirs to medicine in this one-stop-souk. Just be patient and try to compare prices before you buy from the first stall you see.",
          "It is mainly a shopping area where one may find all sort of things with prices for all pockets ; it includes a lot of local traditional products But it could also be seen as the wider area including the restaurants and bars around the shopping area and , especially on the night",
          "Highly recommended if you are staying in hotels nearby. Beautiful set up of souk and attached to stellar hotels and Promenade restaurants. You will find all things whatever you looking for if you are visiting Dubai.",
          "I always visit Souk madinat Jumeirah but during festive season has a different touch! All places lighted up. Best outdoor place to be during Christmas season, with all the huge trees and lights, full of positive vibes. Also these time of the year best time to visit as the",

          "We wanted to visit a traditional Souk and this is not that type of place at all. Yet, it is still very fun and has all of your souvenir needs and nice places to eat and drink while being able to get a clear view of the Burj Al Arab. We visited here on a night tour and wish we",
          "Well, this is a depressing tourist trap. Thankfully we were staying in the hotel so just next door but if I'd have paid for a taxi or tour to come here I'd be massively disappointing. Basically a small shopping mall full of souvenir shops!",
          "Behind a modern-old-souk, we\u2019ve found a peaceful place to truly enjoy. The parking lot is very handy, however, the shopping experience is a little pricey. Strolling through the souk, we've been rewarded with some prime spot view of the Burj Al Arab, near to Costa Coffee. The",
          "I visited this Souk 14 years ago and was so happy to be back! Much more comfortable and friendly than the Gold and Spice Souks and the environment is not pushy at all! Highly recommend a visit!",
          "We had been recommended coming to the Jumeriah complex from many online sources extolling the virtues of riding the abra round the waterways of the hotel. Abdul, manning the sales desk for the tickets was the most unhelpful, unfriendly and surly person I have encountered during",
          "Most visitors make a point to go to the gold and spice souk, but don't miss Souk Medinat. We found great beaded handbags, jewelry and scarfs. This is also a great place for a leisurely meal by the man made canal.",
          "So many reviewers mention Souks are terrible places, with many being hassled - NOT at Souk Madinat! This is a lovely way to wander around, stop for a coffee, or a meal by the beautiful waterways inside the gorgeous buildings which are very authentic - you will love it!",
          "Plenty of bars and restaurants in a really beautiful and relaxing setting. The waterways and lighting make it a really relaxing place to socialise, however it's also a great place for a night out (particularly McGettigans).",

          "Authentic atmosphere, many shops and restaurants. I liked Folly on the top floor, Belgian cafe with live music in weekend and Lebanese restaurant. Also there is a big underground parking and no problem to find a taxi. Note that the prices for goods are higher than in Gold Souk",
          "Every little shop you can think of, souvenir heaven. We could get everyone at home a little something, and prices were really good. Beware of the fake brands though ;)",
          "Had a fantastic dinner in the restaurant. Waji was a tremendous host, ever so kind and helpful. The food alone was absolutely perfect made even better by the exceptional service.",
          "This is such a relaxing and classy Souk right near Madinat and La Burj. The restaurants and little shops are so special. The beach is magnificent here too. It is definitely worth a visit as it is so quaint and beautiful.",

          "Needed to get some gifts and was told this is the place. It\u2019s undercover most of the time and caters for all budgets. There is every shop you can imagine. There\u2019s an amazing antique shop, many clothe shops, jewellery, crystal and ceramics. There are small stalls selling, brass",
          "Souk Madinat is a mix of restaurants, cafes and small retail shops that have souvenirs and other local products. The souk is a myriad of passages, at times easy to get lost. There are a couple of restaurants that are by the water or have outdoor seating which is quite nice.",

          "This souk is unique and matchless in Dubai as you cannot find anywhere similar in town. It is also close to Burj Al Arab, the greatlandmark in town.",
          "If you dont fancy the 45 degree souks then this is the answer. Really nice mix of old and new Dubai in air conditioning. Lots of restaurants and a couple of bars. Get a dhow from one end of the soul to a restaurant on the other end, all under the watchful eye of the burj al Arab.",
          "A pleasant way to spend a couple of hours out of the Heat. Numerous stalls, stores and markets with something for everyone and a fabulous array of restaurant to stop and refresh. Set in the resort but plenty to see and do. Pick up a great souvenir for home.",
          "Nice air conditioned little mall but if you\u2019re expecting a soul bargain this isn\u2019t the place for you as it\u2019s a Souk in name only . Close to Burj al Arab",
          "Beautiful Evening with plenty to see. Boat trip was fun and beautiful surroundings. Pay Thai restruarnt was exquisite.",
          "Ok. They took a typical Souk market and fabricated a synthetic version and jacked up the prices of typical tourist stuff. The only nice thing is that on a hot summer day it had AC which was a relief. The place was empty on a Tuesday evening. We decided to head over to the Mall",
          "Nice traditional air-conditioned souk. A little expensive though. It has a beautiful view of the Burj Al Arab. It worth going for an hour maybe. Not many things to do in the summer, because you can't really go outside cause of the hot weather.",
          "I visited Souk Madinat Jumeirah after having a Thai lunch at Pai Thai (SEE review). The souk is built to resemble a traditional Arabian market with stalls and venders on large scale as in a resort. It is an atmospheric mall, with Promenade restaurants, that is truly a great",

          "This area is called Madinat Jumeirah. Even if you are not staying at the luxury hotel, Jumeirah Al Qasr,defenitley its worth visiting. Personally I love the atmosphere here. You can escape from a reality and feel like a vacation. you can take canoe ride or you can enjoy a lunch",

          "This place has been here for a while but it stands the test of time. its still one of the best in Dubai. you must ride the boat (Abra) at sunset, its just divine. plenty of restaurants to choose from, standout favorites are Meat Co, Trader Vics and Belgian Cafe.",
          "Beautifully architectured and home to quaint little shops all under one roof. It\u2019s a very peaceful and great place to get those one in a life time gifts for family and friends back home. The restaurants in the area are great. A must try is the ice-cream from Gelato Divino.",
          "What a cool place. Air conditioned souk! Lots of stalls with cool stuff. Prices are reasonable and you can barter here. It is quite a maze with lots of little alleys to go down. Heaps of restaurants and bars. If you get a chance go to the turtle sanctuary, most of them are",
          "Of course the prices here are sour but the place is just amazing, peaceful and you'd love to stay all day sit by the water side and just enjoy life. We stopped and eat there, prices are very very very expensive comparing downtown.",
          "I would like to recommend the Souk Madinat Jumeriah to everyone, This is somewhere i have wanted to visit on my last few trips but never got around to it until Wednesday but boy its worth the visit. This place is wonderful its a fantastic way of seeing what the original state",
          "A very beautiful place, filled with places to eat and shop. One can also have a ride in the Abra. Food joints sell very good food. The appearance of the place changes as lights come on. One can head to Costa to enjoy and great views of Burj al arab.",

          "Although not like the original Deira souks it is worth a visit as its mostly inside with aircon which is ideal in July & August when its so hot outside. Lots of stalls to get souvenirs & there are several places to eat it. Good photo opportunities to get pics near the Burj al",
          "When you walk around you will feel the authentic old time souk. You have to take the canal tour. Very nice and highly recommended.",
          "Nice architecture, diverse shops and stalls, aircon and plenty of cafes and restaurants. Stall owners are keen, but not as persistent as in more traditional souks. Prices are of course negotiable, but not as flexible as in some other souks I suspect. We bought some beautiful",
          "This is what I like to call a \"man-made\" experience that is trying to be a natural, organic one. Souk Madinat Jumeriah is a bit like the Disneyland of souks. If you want the real experience, try Deira.",

          "With most things during Ramadan, the shops within this souk were in the main closed. However, rather than being a disappointment, it was actually a bonus as we were able to walk around without hawkers or sales people bothering us. The architecture within is a photographers must",

          "You must visit the Souk Madinat Jumeirah preferably in the evening. You can view the Burj Al Arab from this place on level 2 (you may wish to ask the staff there on the precise location for the perfect view of the Burj Al Arab). There are many perfume and jewellery souk stores",
          "This is a lovely spot to visit. Watch out for the mesmerizing Arabic charm ladies! Remember it\u2019s all about the money. You must be money savvy here and no when you are been swindled, lol! Brilliant experience though I had great fun. There is a lovely lady there that does",

          "Don't understand why people care for this market so much. Yes, it's built differently in that it's not a tall building but has a village like feeling. Other than that, there's not much to do here.",
          "Souk Madinat Jumeirah is the perfect place to spend a leisurely evening in Dubai. Walking around the waterways at sunset, the ambience is so tranquil and serene, but as soon as night hits and you reach the main restaurant area the atmosphere is buzzing. We absolutely loved",

          "The Cinnabon in Dubai is just amazing the best ever I have tasted. We went to the Cinnabon in Souk Madinat, which was within our resort. I wouldn\u2019t recommend trying their hot food. It\u2019s just average and taste isn\u2019t exactly great.",

          "This souk, even though new, was built in a traditional elegant style using a lot of wood in the decorations. The goods are rather expensive goods, good quality and very nice. All the bazaar is a pleasant place, but the big surprise comes when you suddenly reach an outside",
          "The souk is located in between 4 Jumeirah hotels. The goods offered are very mixed, there are very touristic things - low level - but there are some hidden gems like tailors, clothing shops and also pharmacies. Last time I bought a nice suit. The shop owners and staff are",

          "This is a 100% touristic place in Dubai. The crowd is huge (especially on weekends). It\u2019s a place of luxury restaurants and souvenirs shops. But it definitely makes an impression. The beauty of traditional architecture and canals strikes!",
          "Really nice shopping center... is a must-see if you are new to Dubai. It looks like a traditional Arabic market, in a new and upscale setting. There are a number of modern shops, high end restaurants, and a few smaller local shops. While I really enjoyed going there and",

          "This place is really interesting to visit and walk around, it is very smart and modern - made to be a bit like the actual souqs in Dubai. Nice looking restaurants and coffee shops, with a great view of the Burj Al Arab. But you're limited as to how much you can visit unless",
          "It's a modern revamped Souk with a Venice sort of feel to it. With Burj Al Arab lurking the walls are scenic but some pretty good shops around. Not that you can shop and have food since it very expensive. The boat ride too isn't worth the price tag.",
          "Its a modern air conditioned mini souk kinda. If want to experience the actual ones then should visit the ones around bur dubai. The shops are fine but highly priced for obvious reasons. Ambience is fabulous & has coffee shops,bar,restaurant etc for relaxation. There is a",

          "First things first: it is not a genuine souk. So as long as you keep in mind that it is built to look genuine, you will not be disappointed. Having that said, the vibe of the place is awesome. It is like an upperclass souk to give you the experience of visiting a souk without",

          "This place is so difficult to navigate. They have map boards that don't say \"You are here\" which is not useful. A colourful place but the food outlets are very pricey, even by Dubai standards and the shopping is not great",

          "The concept of the Souq Madinat is simply quite brilliant, and when considered with the Jumeriah hotels that abut it on both sides, the complex is an all in resort. The old style souq mainly houses souvenir type shops, jewellery shops, a couple of fashion clothing shops and",

          "It wasn\u2019t too busy and we didn\u2019t have to queue for any of the rides. The family raft rides have to be the best!",
          "Excellent Waterpark we went 2 days before Christmas, it was not busy. Three really thrilling rides which we kept going on because there were no queues. Very expensive food and drink so take your own. Medium locker 70 AED and quite small! Take own towels and swim kit. Amazing",
          "Totally and utterly wonderful for kids to teenagers to adults. So much to do and enjoy . We love it year after year it never gets tiring",
          "After Laguna water park wild Wadi isn't the cheapest and not the best because in my opinion Atlantic aquaventuer has the title of the best so I don't recommend it that much. Note: you can't get any drinks or food into the park other than a bottle of water you have to buy the",
          "Great place. Been here a couple of times now. Now, not anymore. Dull when waiting in lengthy queues. Before there use to be staff that use to entertain us whilst waiting. I got bruised really badly with the water jets. The water jets push you up a slide no matter how heavy you",
          "Absolutely fantastic day out for all the family. This water park is sooooexciting.....!! Conveniently situated next to the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, opposite the Burj, this water park complex is one of the best value for money experiences in UAE. Give it a go, you will not be",
          "This water Park is really good there are so many rides and all are different there\u2019s scary, slow & fast rides, they also have a wave machine here and a hazy river, but you are not allowed to bring any food or drink from the outside in they check your bags and remove it, but hold",
          "Every time we visit Dubai we always visit the Wild Wadi. We stay with the Jumeriah group so if you show your hotel room key and card holder they will let you in for free. Stayed quite far away at Jumeriah Creekside but there is a free shuttle bus. Handful of cool slides.",
          "Wild wadi in my option it\u2019s better than Atlantic water park I went their twice I can say it best water park in UAE only the price is expensive",
          "Had a lovely day with my family. Water is kept heated at a good warm temperature unlike other waterparks where my poor kids have been shivering! Unfortunately for the price there aren't as many slides as I would expect but thrilling none the less, especially Jumeirah Scream and",

          "We visited Wild Wadi during half term week - we chose this park after reading reviews about the long queues at Aquaventure at the Atlantis and having already visited that park last year. I booked tickets online with klook.com and saved around 100 AED on the door price. We",
          "Wild wadi has plenty of fun rides and adrenaline rushes on the thrillers like jumeirah sceirah which is a must do if you want to test your inner adventurer. They have a store for swim and bathwear, plenty of kiosks and very friendly lifeguards.",
          "Not worthy at all.. Knowing that no eating place yet they charge very heavily for the junk food at WWP. It was a huge disappointment for the place what we thought it was for water park..if come to Dubai next time won't visit WWP",
          "It's always a pleasure, a thrill and a treat to visit Wild Wadi Waterpark. It's been a favorite of ours for years. Second best waterpark in Dubai. Fun, fun, fun place. Well worth a visit, but only in the summer and warmer months. Highly recommended!!!",
          "We have visited this waterpark several times in the past few years. In August 2019 it was once again a lovely visit with my family. I would highly recommend this to everyone who visits Dubai.",
          "Too expensive to eat there and the rides aren't enough. You find yourself getting bored pretty soon. Better try out Ferrari water world.",
          "The best experience of my life as far as water park is concerned. Unique slides, great arrangements and wild enjoyment as equal to name. Love it",
          "Had a great time at the water park. It has a lot of rides and good ones too. My favourite was the jumeirah scarer. Awesome.",
          "Visited park under duress from daughter and her friend and although we had to wait for a bit to get in because people ahead in the queue had done no research and therefore had no idea what package they wanted for a party of 6, it was so much better than I thought it would be. I",
          "We visited here with the kids, met extended family here with theirs too and we all had an absolute blast. The changing room and facilities are beautifully clean, it is all so well kept. All rides had about 10 min wait time, we hopped straight onto the lazy river with no wait at",
          "When looking on line I didn\u2019t think there was a lot at this park ,but I was surprised as there was more than I thought ,2 teenagers loved it ,if you stay at a Jumeirah hotel you get free entrance ,lots of places to eat and drink ,photos are a bit expensive if you want one of you",
          "Visited Wild wadi with my family,the rides were thrilling but the long cues were a kill joy. Thanks to entertainer, we had a day of fun.",
          "I love Wild Wadi but there aren't many thrill rides for adult. Think they are 2 or 3 more rides short for being absolutely amazing. Food is very expensive. Changing rooms and toilets very clean. Myself and my kids had an awesome time.",

          "Luckily we got in free due to staying at a sister hotel. So pleased as we only stayed half a hour. Too busy for our liking. Sorry can't comment on the rides only the lazy river which wasnt pleasant due to all the empty tubes going round and being bombarded with staff trying to",

          "We visited here on a Sunday Arrived around lunchtime Was busy but we had booked online and got through quite quickly Got wristbands and went through to changing rooms which were clean. We had a medium locker between 4 people They do charge for lockers and it depends on size",
          "a greate place for friend and family to spend 4-6 hours of pure fun. The water slides were great. one thing to keep in mind is you need to bring your swimming cloths with you as they charge a lot when buying from the shop at the park.",
          "Stayed at a jumeriah hotel so free to enter. Not sure what the cost for 4 adults would be. Food and drink are pricey inside but it\u2019s Dubai and a water park so not much you can do. Kids loved it (teens age 14) it\u2019s safe and clean and they would love to go back",
          "Visited on a Saturday very busy due to school trips , went on every ride a couple of times and a few rides around the lazy river but couldn\u2019t find enough to do to spend al day there. Better with children and group. Coffee and ice cream all good but didn\u2019t eat lunch. Plenty of",
          "It has been over 10 yrs since we last visited the aqua-park and it is still a great day out. We were fortunate that it was not busy so managed to get on all the rides with little waiting time Staff are good and it had plenty of shaded seating",

          "We turned up to wild wardi about 2pm there was no queue to get in, they had a discount on for paying with visa so we got it a little cheaper, bought the locker when paying so was easy and convenient. The park was clean, not to busy and efficient. The best ride in the park is",
          "Great water park, very clean with plenty of places to sit and also to eat. We have complimentary tickets as part of our hotel stay. Would thoroughly recommend.",

          "Wild wadi is so much fun and amazing time we spent there with our friends But the food is not worth the money that we paid .. I used to come before the food was delicious and worth the money but this time is really bad Thanks",
          "We went several times for ladies night and it was so much fun. The only comment is that it starts abit late in the day so u can spend the whole day. But overall its super fun and a place to go with family and friends.",
          "We had the most amazing time at wild wadi, it wasn\u2019t that busy so we had enough time to keep going on the same rides over and over again. It was so much fun for everyone",
          "Great place for families & children to teenagers Food divine plenty to Do brilliantly laid out drfinayrjh a fab place to go if your in Dubai .. you forget you got kids around .. staff accommodating & life guards are situated everywhere .. Brilliant as I did have the place",

          "Wild Wadi Waterpark - was a fun day for two mature adults - we enjoyed the tube rides - spent about 2 1/2 hours at the park. We could have spent more time there if we had it available to us. Would be a great day out for families with children.",

          "overpriced entry fee  for a waterpark that does not have many rides. We had free entry that was included in our accommodation package hence why my husband and I went.  If you are staying with any of the Jumeriah chain hotels then entry to the waterpark is free. All you have to",
          "Look attractive at the start but not very impressive for the price paid and the marketing done to attract people. Staff was helpful, food was ok but still expensive. Boutique items are very expensive and prices are inflated thrice because u have no other option. Water",
          "We had free entry to the water park included in our accommodation package. We went at opening on a Saturday morning. There were no queues and we were able to fly through all of the rides. The park isn\u2019t huge and can be done in a few hours if there a minimal line ups. Plenty",
          "Wild Wadi is a theme park and water park much like Canada\u2019s wonderland, rides and water slides galore. The exceptional service and extremely amazing variety of water themed slides makes this worth the price for an all day fun pass for kids. Most rides have rider height limits.",
          "Nice place, clean and lots of lifesavers and people ready to help us. Our daughter is only 100cm at the time, and we believe the offers was more for kids above 110cm. Great place, almost no one in line. Signing inside the park could use a step up and the use a lot of plastic.",
          "We were treated by our company by getting tickets to wild wadi water park,, the water slides were something else,, it was so much fun, these area has the best views and well located, it's between the luxurious burj al arab and the beautiful Jumeirah beach hotel. You can access",

          "My husband and I are two big kids and obviously had to check out what Wild Wadi was all about and it was included in our holiday package- so why not! We had fun on the rides but I guess wouldn't have paid for it otherwise. Definitely a great location for a family :) We arrived",
          "Couldn't rate wild wadi higher, we visited aquaventure waterpark at atlantis in February however wild wadi waterpark hands down beats it in all fronts, the cabana service was first class however at a price but provided the perfect escape from the slides and a safe area for",
          "We came here for the day as we had the 2 for 1 offer with the Entertainer Dubai app, which basically made our entrance fee half price. The tickets are expensive but with the half price it is great value for money. The park was really quiet and was great fun. The blaster",
          "Great day full of fun staff are really good food is nice and priced well Well worth a visit a great day out",
          "The services here are quite good. The staff is very friendly and the changing rooms are tidy too. The rides although are not very great except the \"Jumeirah Sceirah\" which is a must try. Except this ride, all rides are pretty normal with no huge adrenal rush!",
          "We last visited wild wadi in 2001. No much has changed since. Rare to say about anything in Dubai but it feels a little old and tired. Kids will still have a great time. We went to aqua venture last year - this is a much much better day out.",

          "Great day out especially for adventurous teenagers. Good selection of rides for all ages. Clean and very well supervised. We were slightly disappointed with the food options available.",
          "I was actually there a bit before 2018, in June. The rides were very enjoyable, especially with the humidity. Do not forget you are riding a tube most of the time, so the sun screen gets rubbed off!",
          "I must say \"Amazing\" as always. My family love the Wild Wadi water park. Friendly Staff, lovely wave pool and other rides. One must go & visit.",
          "We got free entry to the park while staying at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, so we spent an afternoon at the park which was great fun. The only downside is that sometimes you did have to queue for awhile to get on some of the rides/slides.",
          "What a great day at Wild wadi , rides were brilliant , drinks and food were a great price , so glad we had a day out there , will defiantly do it again",
          "Boom! Children, activity no three on our calendar. What Dad, swimming, yes!one of the best places i have ever enjoyed swimming with my little children. The well trained and disciplined instructors, the shallow waters 1meter maximum height for the children swim. The swim suit",

          "Some people said that the Aquaventure park of Jumeirah is better, but I disagree. It is true that Wild Wadi has less slopes. But they have cold water shower, a big ocean-wave pool with also cooled water which Aquaventure doesn't have. Also in Aquaventure you can't run around",
          "Had a great time and kids loved it. Was a clean place and staff where very helpful. The cafe areas where kept clean and tidy as well couldnt fault the place at all",
          "It was a great experience, park is clean and a lot of staff, the only problem i found is i lost orientation many times and passing a game without knowing there is an entrance there, so i think they need to work more on the signage inside.",

          "We visited this water park from thd UK as husband, wife and two teenage boys (17 and 14). There were a good number of rides and thd queues werent too long. Getting sunbeds was easy, and the food was reasonably priced (a lot more reasonable then Atlantis Aquapark!). Thd park is",
          "Great for everyone all ages has alot of different rides to go on. They have a good section for young children too and a nice wave pool for everyone. Best to go early as it can get very busy later on in the day and then you have to queue to get on the rides.",
          "It was a really good day out, I went with my husband and my daughter and my son who is 5. I was worried that the rides may be too scary for the little one but he absolutely loved it. There\u2019s a kids section in the middle for the young ones. The only negative I can mention is",
          "We go to wild wadi every year in the summer as it\u2019s the best thing to do to beat the heat. Amazing fun for children, beautiful location and views and good value if you use the entertainer family app. Only downside for me is the overpriced lunch options... but for a special",
          "spend a few hours here and like all water parts was fun. The entry price I though was really too much at USD75 and of course food and drink prices were way too high. The place is looking a little tired in many parts and lacks new rides. Also found the signage small and hard to",

          "We had free unlimited access to the water park so we utilised it well. The park is huge and there are a lot of rides and paddling for the young. There are surfing rides for the more courageous. It\u2019s very hot so take precautions and take sun tanning lotion. Towels are included",
          "Enjoyed alot in the park, enty system is amazing rides are supercool staff is well behaving but males locker room was not clean. jumeirah sierah is extremely good. Lazy pool is also a impressive thing overall a good experience and well spent day with family.",

          "A very large well run water park but a lot of the rides were not working properly on my visit. Many of the rides that propel you upwards needed more power and sever guests got stuck causing kind delays. The wave park did not seem to open till midday however the park itself",

          "This is my 3rd visit- the last time being 8 years ago. When you walk away having paid 400 Euros for 3 of you to get in and have lunch and some drinks, it is an expensive day. They should let you take your own food in. Paying stupid prices for average food really annoys me- I\u2019m",

          "I love this waterpark! It's definitely worth looking online for a discount code or using someone's entertainer code, I don't think you ever need to pay full price. (Save your money for the outrageously priced water instead.) Arriving early means you can avoid queues, useful for",

          "The first time we visited Wild Wadi was approximately 15 years ago and it is still THE most fantastic place to visit. Compared to Atlantis Aquaventure I would say this place would always win as the facilities are so much better. The rides are incredible with plenty of rings to",

          "It was wonderful to finally return to Wild Wadi after 13 years. The last time we went, we were childless (plus I was pregnant so there wasn't a lot for me to do) but this time we brought our two kids 12 years and 7 years, with us. We went right at the opening time and were able",
          "Don\u2019t think i would ever return to this over priced establishment, i mean who comes up with such prices?! From entrance to lockers to food all of it outrageous. It\u2019s very unfair that they don\u2019t allow you to bring your own food inside. And to then charge a 7 year old an adult",
          "Had a great time went on a sunday with the visa deal. Good points not to busy. all rides working. got some shade and a bed .staff great. We would definitely go back. Bad points really slow to get in with the sun beating down. Anything you want to buy in the park is extortion",
          "This waterpark is perfect to have some fun with family and friend. In the summer time is the perfect place if you want stay out and cool. They have some nice attractions.",
          "The rides were incredible, the place was great, and most of the people working at Wild Wadi were incredibly friendly and helpful. All of this positive impression changed after we embarked on the Tantrum Valley ride (ride #4 if I am not mistaken) after almost spending two hours",
          "Everyone was able to go on everything and the staff were very friendly and helpful, wonderful experience",
          "Been coming to Dubai since a decade now and Wild Wadi has been a favorite vacation spot for us as a family always. However been observing that over the years, there has been an intense increase in the number of 'starers' there which is quite uncomfortable for the ladies. Not muc",

          "After visiting the other water park in Atlantis, I must say this has to be the best water park in Dubai. Easy to navigate, good staff, highly recommended would love to visit again",

          "Fantastic waterpark with great amenities. Very hygienic and welcoming staff. Food outlets could do with a revamp and require more seating.",
          "We went to Wild Wadi as we were staying at a Jumeirah hotel and entrance to the Waterpark was included. Having stayed at Atlantis the palm before with Aquaventure water park on the doorstep, Wild Wadi always seemed a bit second best to us - it\u2019s certainly not advertised as",
          "We were lucky enough to have free entry via our hotel. We have a 2 year old and a 10 month old. Very good for the kids. Recommend for the kids.",
          "This Waterpark is so much fun even in summer. There is also enough shade so that you must not be all the time in the sun. The slides are fun and also good for adults. The water is nicely cool and also there are good food and drink offers. If you are resident you get a very nice",
          "I\u2019ve visited Wild Wadi a number of years ago. At the time it was an awesome water park that the children (then 6years younger) really enjoyed. Now they are older this water park seems small and insignificant compared to Atlantis aquaventure in Dubai and Yas waterworld in Abu",
          "Brilliant day out here at Wild Wadi. Expensive but didn't disappoint. We bought tickets that included lunch. When we arrived the staff member took our tickets. Thankfully I asked if we needed to keep our tickets as a lunch pass. At first he said the tickets were admission only",

          "It is my daughter\u2019s birthday and she chose to go to one of her favorite water parks. I was surprised that even though the weather is hot , we managed to take the heat well. We had enjoyed most of the ride until our last chaotic ride. We had decided to go onto the lazy river .",
          "Probably my 30th time visiting and it was just as amazing as the 1st All staff are friendly and always there to help you The rides are amazing and well managed",
          "Great day out at wild wadi water park. I recommend getting there early it opens at 10am to get the best sun beds that are based around the main pool. We used buy one Get one free voucher out of the entertainer which meant the normal price of 300 dihrams was 150 for an adult day",

          "Absolutely fantastic water park! Recommend it to everyone! Family friendly for all ages. Everyone is welcoming, the queues aren\u2019t long at all. I believe I waited the max of 10 minutes. Some of the rides are long but well worth it! Love the fact you have life guards every 2",
          "We were staying at Jumeirah Beach hotel so the entrance from the club lounge wasn\u2019t even a minutes walk. Pick up towels, sign in & get wrist band - that\u2019s it. As we were staying for just over a week, we spent several times there & spaces out doing the rides. Queues were never",

          "This is a water park for the kids (and the adults who like the crazy rides ) - I loved floating away on the lazy river. There is a wave machine and various rides for all the familty. We found a nice little place to sit in the shade and have your feet nibbled little fish - we",
          "I was convinced I was going to hate wild waddy. I hate theme parks and I hate loads of people congregated in water ! However, on entry I was pleasantly surprised. The entrance staff are helpful and even though it was extremely hot - the water cooled is off very well. My terror",
          "Wonderful water park, high level of security and guards but food restaurants it's too bad quality also food and water not allowed to be taken inside.",
          "Worth to try again and again. I really had a joyous and fun the last time we went there . We enjoyed every rides especially the flowrider. Aside from that the crews are very helpful and always smiling. I am sure I will visit again soon.",
          "We stayed at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel and had free and unlimited entry to Wild Wadi Waterpark during our stay. When you enter the Waterpark, you receive a wristband on which you can put some money to pay for food and photos and whatnot. Whenever the professional photographers",
          "We visited this water park after recommendation of our another friend. And I definitely would recommend this place to everyone else. As it offers rides to everyone. It has so many sections. So, and families which small children will loves this place, and teenagers, and couples",
          "We had to choose between two water parks and on the advice of some friends who had already visited Dubai they had suggested Wild Wadi Waterpark because they felt there were more water slides to choose from but having been to neither couldn\u2019t confirm if this was the case. It",

          "We loved our day out here, stayed in kids area mainly. 3 hours max, then we got exhausted. Too too expensive, even with entertainer, 3 of us cost \u00a3123 Without the entertainer it would\u2019ve been \u00a3180-\u00a3185 Kids will love it here",
          "Wild Wadi water park great fun.but overpriced. Food a big disappointment and very expensive. Margarita pizza 75 dirhams and nothing special. Drinks are a hefty 27 dirhams .",

          "Not bad. Very good rides. Not a huge selection but enough to keep you entertained for a good few hours. Not worth the full 300 AED asking price. Only go if you get a deal. And do not buy food. One meal (burger chips) with a magnum ice cream, refillable all day drink and a",

          ".... was a great thing to do. The rides are good and not sooo many that you couldn't do in one day. I would advise going on a week day and starting early as the place gets pretty packed. We really enjoyed ourselves. The food, memorabilia etc. was quite pricey, but I guess",
          "Best place to go in a hot season. Great view. A lot of pulls for adults and kids as well. I was with my friends and we have an amazing time. We was swimming and relaxing. We have so much fun. In the evening time we get hangry and we have a delicious burgers with green salad and",

          "There are no words to describe how much I love this waterpark. I been there since I was a little child and I love it. Not much stairs not much walking. Just water, slides and fun! The price in my opinion is a bit high ... it increased over the year and reached 299DH as a",
          "We went there for team building and it was one of the best. Too many activists to play and the slide Re amazing. We love it and will come again.",
          "visited wild wadi for the first time and had lot of fun. Neat and maintained well, The distance between rides were very short and easy to cover up all the rides. Friendly staff ample place to relax. Few rides were really thrilling and fun..",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed this aqua park. It was extremely busy. There were 1 or 2 \u2018photographers\u2019 who I find quite creepy taking pictures of kids -the pictures they took were not that great and not cheap either plus I do not permit you take pictures of my children?!?! Food wise",
          "So water parks in Dubai are expensive, and unless you are staying at a hotel chain connected to one they really can take a chunk out of your wallet. I do have to say that Wild Wadi is my families favourite. Nice staff, lovely layout and just so damn relaxing.",
          "This water park is relatively small but has some good rides. The family rides are very good and the individual ring rides are nice given they pull you to the top before you then come down. The wave pool and younger children area are all good. The only real criticism I would have",
          "Every thing was fantastic except the security manager, he was tough person and noising me at the end of the great day",
          "What a fun way to spend time in hot month of June in Dubai. Loved Tantrum alley and Juma\u2019s journey, the uphill jets are so fun. And brace yourselves for the tunnel of doom. Fun family experience, even with teens. I liked being the cool mom, at least for the day.",
          "All our family loves this park: not to big (comparing to Aquaventure Waterpark in Atlantis), all in one space. Nice few quick lunch options available. Friendly and helpful staff. Clean. Plenty chairs available.",
          "It is good for families and friends who don't like too much thrilling. It has a great view. It is close to burj Al- Arab.",
          "Friendly cheerful staff. Variety of F&B outlet Trilling and exciting rides both for adults and kids. Very proactive helpful lifeguards",
          "Visited with my three children (age 6, 6 & 8) and it suited what we needed. I don't think it'd be enough for older children but my three loved the water jet rides and the large kids pool / slide area. We paid 99AED each using a Visa offer. I don't think I would be happy to",
          "It's fun, thrilling with amazing water activities and rides. The kids loved it and we easily spent close to four hours in there.",
          "this water park is one of the best I\u2019ve been. But I will not visit with my 4 year old. It\u2019s not worth the money for those little ones. For couples it\u2019s pretty cool, the slides are awesome.! Just a tip, if you stay in the jumeirah hotel the entree is included in your hotel rate.",
          "It\u2019s just one of those things to do once a year when the summer starts. They have a good deal for residents or it\u2019s also in the entertainer which makes it affordable. Tantrum Alley is my favorite ride! It\u2019s a good getaway from the norm in Dubai Food does tend to be",
          "Because we stayed at the Jumeirah Beach hotel, for us the entrance is free. Clean and well maintained park with a lot of cool waterslides! If you are waiting in line at the entrance its nice they bring you cold water. Also towels are available, sunbeds and lockers.",
          "Wild Wadi has not changed in the 8 years we have been going. It needs updating and improving. There\u2019s enough to keep you busy for a few hours, but not enough for a whole day.",
          "This is a very credible waterpark in its own right but newer water parks in Dubai have outdone wild wadi for some time now in my opinion. The park is big by European standards but small enough by Dubai standards to mean that you'll feel more in control of where your kids are in",
          "I have been to Wild Wadi on 4/5 separate visits to Dubai, and although it\u2019s great fun, I would say Aquaventure is the bigger better water park. This water park is better suited to children and youngsters in my opinion, however if you haven\u2019t been, no matter what age you are I",
          "We arrived at the entrance to WW at around 13:50 today, there was a large queue which is normally fine but we were very disappointed and very surprised that there was little cover for the queuing guests. No shade and no water, many young families struggling with the heat and",
          "We stayed at Jumeirah Beach Hotel this weekend and had a complimentary unlimited access to Wild Wadi. We have visited Wild Wadi several times before with friends and as a couple. This time with our 2 year old son. Attractions are very limited for small children but it didn't",
          "A really good family water park. Great venue for money, good food, great rides and secure locker system for storage.",
          "Most of the rides were not working unfortunately. The ones that were working are great and I really do enjoy going to Wild Wadi usually, but this was really disappointing.",
          "I have been here few times and it is one of a very good with variety of water rides water park. Very accessible as in the city surrounded with many good hotels specially Burj Al Arab. For sure will be going back again.",
          "Good for young children. It\u2019s a bit dated. I visited in 2004. Not changed. Atlantis is newer and better now. But it was free from our hotel",
          "We headed for Wild Wadi today with the intention of using our entertainer app and 2 of our group of 8 having the 299 Dirhams each off (\u00a365 each). The staff member stopped us and told us it was a special offer on Sunday and for people visiting the country (visa) were able to pay",
          "We went with our 5 year and 2 year old. If your children are anywhere around 110cm then do not bother and go to legoland waterpark instead, the children will have more fun as the lifeguards are so strict even 1-2cm over the ride height was not good enough",
          "it was a great experience. it is accessible by bus and you are gonna have a lot of fun.it could be more thrilling. it was a beautiful place with a great view.",
          "Absolutely loved this water park. The rides are amazing!!! The Fisho place is nice where you can have a foot spa done by fish...it really tiggles. Loved the slides. The water waves were really nice. We went at about 2.00pm on a Sunday and it wasn\u2019t too busy so we didn\u2019t have to",
          "Really fun day. Food was served even during Ramadan which is nice for non muslims. The pictures were good but a little overpriced. We lost our photo card but emailed and were sent all of our pictures.",
          "I\u2019ve been here a couple of times over the last 2 years. It\u2019s a really good waterpark which is probably more focussed toward children. There are some good slides for adults but they are limited. Still a really enjoyable waterpark but I think Atlantis is my favourite in dubai",
          "Visited this waterpark with a group of friends who all had different thrill seeking levels. Wild Wadi easily met the thrill levels of the whole group - mild thrill seekers to extreme thrill seekers, there was something for everyone. Wild Wadi is the perfect place for close up",
          "Aqua park is nice, we always have a good time. The only think I can\u2019t stand about this place are the photos. They keep taking pictures without even asking and than they ask you to select what ever you like and charge you like 600AED for 4 pictures. No price list available.",
          "Honestly this is a nice well organized aqua park. Just visit it and get lost there for a day! Not in Friday.",
          "lived in dubai from 2003 til 2010, was the highlight of my seven years living there. would 10/10 recommend!",
          "Many attractions but as the other water parks around the world. It doesn't match to Atlantis. They have a big surfing wave (which Atlantis does't have) but it's like the Flowrider of Royal Caribbean cruises. If you only want to visit 1 water park in Dubai, choose Atlantis but",
          "Positive points: \u25aa Nice design and architecture \u25aa Strong attention to safety \u25aa Children-friendly Negative point: \u25aa You can get lost easily and the staff does not always provide clear explanations on how to go to a specific attraction. If you have a question, they generally",
          "We got straight in to the lazy river and then straight out, floating faeces. Tried again in a different area, again straight out - more floating faeces. Disgusting. We have been to Aquaventure many times and never experienced it, if they can keep it clean why can\u2019t Wild Wadi?",
          "I've been to Wild Wadi many times before. Few days back went again with my colleagues from work as a team building. I have to mention Noah, who was very friendly and eager to help us and explain to us many attractions available throughout park.Some of my friends were visiting",
          "Rides are lovely but the place requires more cleaning and the ground is very sticky in the pool and does not feel good.",
          "My kids insisted on doing WW. We stayed for about hours and they were ready to leave. Didnt really get to enjoy much of the park. Slides were fun for the kids.They enjoyed the wave pool most.",
          "This water park is great for all ages, our party ranged from 64 to 4 and we all loved it, a fantastic day out for all the family.",
          "This is the second time I been here I really enjoyed this. I think this is better than Palm Atlantis water park. The rides for was very good. Floating a large donut from top to bottom took about 6 minutes or so but very enjoyable ride. The pool with wave every 10-15 minutes is",
          "Great day of fun at Wild Wadi. We went on a Sunday (which is the start of the working week in the UAE) and booked on line using the Visa offer of 99 Dirhams per person. This made it much more affordable for a family of 5. We arrived at 10am and it was a quick entry straight",
          "We were in a group of 5 and it was a lot of fun for all ages, so glad we made it to wild wadi. Lots of fun rides and slides for all ages, or just the wave rides for the lazy ones :) Plenty of options for small children too. We reached around 2 pm and had a great time for the",
          "With such choice in dubai for waterparks I am glad I made this choice for the family. I read loads of reviews and spoke to many who had been to Dubai and wild wadi water park is fantastic. For the mum's the lazy river is the best just bobbing around, for dad and the boys",
          "We had a great day at Wild Wadi. It's a good water park for children over 1.1m. Unfortunately there is not a lot for those under 1.1m who want to go on bigger rides! (I do appreciate the height is for safety reasons). We still had a good time but my youngest who is 105cm really",
          "We had a lot of fun and enjoyed the wave pool and tbh eventhough we havent got a chance to ride all the rides because we dont have enough time i will definitely come Back and invite my family and friends again. See you soon wild wadiwater park",
          "A good park that is quite compact and lots of rides on offer for all ages. Go earlier or later in the day to avoid a long wait . The system with the lockers is quite confusing though and the reception staff were not very friendly when ours did not work , they did not explain it",
          "The last time we visited here was 12 years ago before our wedding so it was fun to take our 10 year old on a visit during our holiday. In summary it was a great fun day on the rides with some giggles and thrills thrown in.... Tip #1 Book online in advance and save 20% Tip",

          "I've been coming back to Dubai and staying at one of the Jumeirah hotels on the beach every year for the past five years. Why? Wild Wadi Waterpark, and specifically the Wipeout Flowrider - so addictive and so much fun! It's one of just a few in the entire world that is a barrel",
          "We visited Wild Wadi today (21st April 2019) and it was a great day despite it being really busy. We chose Sunday as in UAE, that\u2019s equivalent to the UKs Monday, plus they have an online offer where you can buy tickets for any Sunday until the End of December 2019 for 99AED if",
          "As always a fun day out, but really expected it to be a bit better after all these years (first visited around 14years ago..). Whilst we saw some changes it really does need a bit of a \u2018facelift\u2019 and to be modernised a bit...However all the kids had a Good Day...",

          "We had a really fun day out. Tried all the rides, queues were not very long. 10 mins usually. There\u2019s plenty of places to sit and sunbathe if you need a break. Lockers are a good idea but quite expensive people did just leave their belongings on the chairs. Not much to choose",
          "this was an exciting and fun day out, don't bother with a fast pass. we enjoyed all the rides, there was not that many, but it was fun. the food was great and reasonably priced. would definitely go again",
          "Worth a visit, good rides for teenagers. Food is a bit expensive but you can take water in with you. The queues were not bad and the staff were friendly",
          "Water park was fun with too many long rides. Nice location which is very easily accessible. Rides with the view of Burj Al Arab \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d. Surfing was so fun but very long queue.",

          "This water park has a ride that takes you up and down and up and down to end up eventually in the lazy river. It seems to last forever and is super fun! It takes you all around the large park in your tube without having to stand in line again.",

          "Visited wild wadi again this week, think it\u2019s Dubai\u2019s first water park, it\u2019s great fun, good staff and can be done in a day. Find other parks too big to finish in a day, and don\u2019t have time to do 2 days on one thing in Dubai.",
          "we were staying in jumeirah creekside and we were allowed to use the wild wadi facilities, even we had free shuttle.we adults and kids had a great time there. The artificial wave was amazing .we really had a nice time. The place was clean and tidy. The changing room was clean",
          "Kids and us adults had such a great time here, I was very impressed with the staff and the children\u2019s safety vests which was everywhere to use, will definitely be back again soon",

          "Great place to spend one day in Dubai. Awesome for kids and toddlers, but also for adults. Most slides have a minimum height limit of 1.1m, but there is a special area for young kids, plus a wave pool. You have lockers inside and you can rent towels. There is a special lounge",
          "Went for the day with our 8 year old and 5 year old daughters. My 5 year old is petite so was a bit disappointed that we paid a lot for her but she could only go on a few things. The weather wasn\u2019t great so we were all quite cold in between queuing. The food was priced about",
          "This is a great water park and well worth a visit, especially if you\u2019re a Jumeirah Hotel guest. A compact park with awesome rides, well priced food offering and an idyllic location with views of the Burj Al Arab. A lovely day out!",
          "We had again an amazing time here.Love the slides,the whole place is just fantastic.Every time we going to Dubai we definitely returning.Staff very nice and helpful,food is a bit expensive though.",

          "Its a nice waterpark but comparatively lacked the variety that Atlantis offers. Water was warm and kids play area adequate. Would probably go back to Atlantis though !",
          "It is better to go during the low season and not on the weekends so that you do not stand in line a lot to try the slides. the group slides where 2 to 4 people can participate are the most fun because you can see your friends'reactions which is pretty funny.",
          "Wild Wadi Waterpark takes the idea of the waterpark so beloved by families everywhere, and enlarges and enhances it beyond the fantasies of any teenager. The slides are beyond belief, but there is also a lazy river.",
          "Very good park, surfing was very good and rides where very good. Highly recommended for children and adults.",
          "A very well kept and clean waterpark. Friendly life guards. Good to hear and see friendly fellow south africans (life guards) when abroad. Better signage to each of the slides would be appreciated. Overall a good adventurous day at the wild wadi water park.",
          "The Wild Wadi water park is a fun place to spend the day especially if you have kids. As an adult having a fun day out though I would suggest going to one of the bigger water parks. Wild Wadi has mainly tube rides which are really a lot of fun and full of excitement. The",
          "Will really come back next time. Staff was very hospitable and really cares for the guests. The security who was in the ladies washroom was so nice also the housekeeper on the PM shift. I really forgot their names but they were very accomodating!!",
          "Several decent rides with the Jumeirah Sceirah being the highlight. Nice and clean with good facilities although not the biggest so may not amuse for a full day. Plenty of kid friendly rides but do need to check heights before you go",
          "We had a nice trip. Enjoyed the rides, staff was friendly and helpful. Lockers are too expensive. 14 USD for very small locker. Stepped on glass, had to go to first aid for removal. Took good care of us. Very kind and nice.",
          "This place is my favourite theme park. It\u2019s nice and cosy and you don\u2019t have to worry about getting lost from your friends or family as all the rides are quite close. The children\u2019s play area is perfect for all ages and I myself went on some of the rides. The water area near the",
          "The weather played its part as we enjoyed a fantastic day at the waterpark. Staff were friendly and kind. The rides were thrilling and exciting and there was more than enough to keep us and our 7 year old entertained. Food was on the pricey side so I'd suggest getting lunch",
          "What a great time we had here , this is an amazing fun place for both adults and children. Lots of riding the rapids, or for the faint hearted like me a nice calm ride along the canal. Plenty of places to eat, and the best man made beach you'll find anywhere. The waves for the",
          "We sailed into Dubai on a Canadian vessel and spent ten days in Dubai. Wild Wadi was an amazing time. We got to the park when it opened, and stayed for 12 hours. When the sun starts to go down the big hotl next door lights up and the colors change. It was a very worthwhile",
          "We have been visiting Wild Wadi pretty much since it first opened, as a child i use to love having the day there whilst on holiday in Dubai. The fact you can just chill out on the lazy river, take a float in the wave pool or go on some fun rides makes it versatile for different",
          "This is fun place but aquaventure is better, they come up with new rides all the time. This place is average but good for someone going to water park for the first time.",
          "We have visited Aquaventure at Atlantis before and I much prefer Wild Wadi. A great selection of rides, lots of sunbeds to lie on as well when you are not enjoying the rides. Best thing is that the water temperature is regulated so its cold which is great. Unlike Aquaventure,",
          "The hotel is kind of far from everything, but that is about the only downside. It has a large children area as well as a large heated waive pool that was nice.",
          "Good Aspects: Very nice staff Good location Rides are safe People are nice there Nice restaurant in the entrance Rides were OKAY Views at the top of the ride was beautiful Bad Aspects: Not that many rides comapred to Atlantis Your slippers get stolen! Loads of people did and",
          "We visited in the middle of February on a weekday and on a non-sunny day, and it was like a ghost town. Barely anyone there and absolutely no queues for buying tickets or going on the rides - perfect! However after a couple of hours we were very chilly indeed and decided to head",
          "Could say anything more! These are best place to be with family! Thank you very much for the staff!!!",
          "Nice weekend spent here,came during promo period with friends so didn't spend much on entrance,we enjoyed all the rides,the restaurant inside are also good choices,one of the best water park in UAE!",
          "A day well spent on all the slides in the park, they have ladies and kids days as well, we enjoyed the swimming pools and had an amazing day out.",
          "We visited wild wadi a month before and it was an mesmerizing experience filled with fun and excellent hospitality from all the staff had one of the best outing ever will sure reccomend to friends and family.",
          "This is good but not great. It\u2019s expensive (over \u00a3200 for family of 4, one pizza \u00a315) and most of the rides are similar. I expected more for Dubai. Siam Park in Tenerife is still the best.",
          "We have visited twice this week using the reopening offer (99aed per person) and had a brilliant time. The food and drinks inside the park is expensive, but not unexpected for Dubai. It was clean and safe enough that my children (12 and 10) were able to go off on their own at",
          "Spent a day at the wild wadi and all I can say is, save your money and head to the Atlantis!! The food is mediocre, the cabana was expensive and had no locker and not really in great position. The best bit about the park is the wave riding machine.",
          "Visited daily for 5 days as had complimentary access as a Jumeirah Hotel resident. Easy access, towels were free but lockers charged. Chicken and chips restaurant was nice and not extortionate. Rides and attractions for all ages. Water could\u2019ve been a bit warmer in the lazy",
          "Literally go with the flow in this centric water park. Pricey as all in Dubai but a great fun and refreshing option for very hot days (don\u2019t forget your flip flops! ) You can leave the park and come back again as many times as you want with the day pass.",
          "We enjoyed a super day out at the park enjoying most of the rides and as it was February we didn't have to queue for anything. Well worth the visit.",
          "I went there with my friends and we had a great time. Amazing experience and a great place. Weary clean and all staff are so thoughtful and generous. Definitely recommend for everyone. Will visit soon again.",
          "This is my grandkids' favourite place after the boat tours. Fun in the sun, and safe for kids - I'm a worrywort of a granddad, and getting them to places where they can go wild and still be safe is the big thing for me. Life guards and hosts all over. The kids have fun. Makes me",
          "Had real fun better than atlantis water park because area is compact and rides are at power with atlantis where you have to walk alot",
          "wild wadi should be in the bucketlist for all. I went there during summer and it was a great experience..with nice jumeira views. the queues for paying are abit annoying and slow..especialy being summer u sweat waiting in a disorganized queue. the rides were however fun and",
          "I have visited wild wadi 3 times since 2014 and my last visit was november 2018 . Every time i visit dubai i go to wild wadi because its clean , fun and beautiful . You have lots of choices there. All of them are fun . If you go around the park you'll find a choice to have fun",
          "A fun filled water park but not the best. There is a very few shade spaces only available and the rest is all mainly under the sun. If you are in tanning mood then this is it, Not the biggest waterpark in Dubai - thanks Google. The good point was that there was not a lot of",
          "Wild Wadi was a great visit location. We planned to spend one to two hours there but ended up spending most of the day as the children simply did not want to leave. Clean, safe and efficient, the fun location will please any age.",
          "We went in Wild Wadi Waterpark 2 days ago with my family and we really enjoyed our time. We had access to different types of rides, for children and for adults! If you come with your family to Dubai this is the place you cannot miss. All the staff was very helpful :) We",
          "This park offers something for everyone, there is a lot of slides and some lazy rides on rubber rings. Would recommend getting your feet cleaned by the thousands of tiny fish in a pond inside the park great feeling as they eat all your dead skin!",
          "You can have a one day plan for this interesting amusement. Spending an unforgettable day in a nice water park and enjoy a lot. By the way, if you go for the tallest water-slide you can take a memorable photo with Borjolarab, an astonishing building just beside the water",
          "The waterpark is so packed with wonderful adventurers you will miss having your kids if you didn't bring them. It made me feel that next I should organize another trip, with the kids.",
          "If your kids are under 110cm there isn\u2019t a lot to do here......lagoon and the lazy river....but not worth it for that. If you pass the height test then some of the rides are pretty decent. Not as good as Siam Park in Tenerife....and I didn\u2019t go to Atlantis which I heard was",
          "This was the best of the two waterparks we visited in Dubai, lots of rides, a nice wave pool, plenty of places to eat and plenty of shade. We booked on line to ensure we had tickets and although had a problem with the bookign confirmation it was easily resolved by the team at",
          "The ticket prices are quite high to get in, but we were on holiday so wanted to have fun. You will definitely have fun at this place. With many different attractions to choose from, there is plenty to do. We especially loved the ride that shoots you up the slide in a double",
          "Sorry for the late review We visited in August 2018 when temperatures were in there 40\u2019s. This is the place you need to be in this weather. We took 2 teenagers with us one of them cannot walk and is in wheelchair. We were not sure how his would work out but it worked very",
          "OMG ! It was amazing...! The highlight of our honeymoon. Could do with more adult rides but still was great place to spend the day there. Jumeirah sceirah..... omg scary but a great thriller ride...! Highly recommend this place!",
          "We had unlimited pass from our hotel so we went twice, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Get there at opening time and you won\u2019t need to queue at all! We went on some of the rides multiple times. Start with the surfing / body board first as they have the longest",
          "It was super fun, most recommend place to enjoy water games, many options of activities and rides, the indoor beach is amazing ...",
          "i thought it was bigger ,there are several rides in it .the water was warm to swim in january and the park is clean and has many lifeguards.you can eat from there.they don't let you bring food in it.",
          "We visited Wild Wadi twice in December, courtesy of our Jumeriah Hotel which meant both visits were complimentary. The slides were amazing, both my children aged seven and five passed the height limit enabling them to experience all the slides bar the Jumeriah Scream of course.",
          "Long wait to buy tickets to get into the water park. Seemed as if just one kiosk was open for ticket sales! Very frustrating wasting an hour in a short queue! Once we were in, we didn\u2019t waste time. One ride after the other. And in the afternoon the wave pool attracted the",
          "The rides at the water park have a mix of thrills and spills that will entertain the little ones and older kids (aka adults) alike. Whilst the number of rides aren't many (say compared to Wet n Wild on the Gold Coast in Australia) it should still keep everyone occupied for a",

          "Got free unlimited entey as we were staying in a Jumeirah hotel. Dont think i could have strung more than 2 days out of it, but was defo enough to keep you occupied for a couple of days even if it was just lying about sunbathing. Great views of the burj al arab. Great choice of",

          "We all had a great day out here, 5 adults and 2 children. There are lots to do here including tube rides and a wave pool where buoyancy vests are provided free. There are also several food choices available. My only negative comment is that the entry fee is unfair in our",
          "So expensive. I always wish to visit this place. again and again But really so expensive I mean is just. Water park. Other things also it\u2019s very old things in Dubai not something new I don\u2019t got it why is still expensive",
          "We spend full day and enjoyed a lot. The park itself is clean and everything worked as expected. Not much queues even it was peak holiday season. Recommend large locker for the day as the small ones are really small. They had good facilities, change rooms and shower rooms. You",
          "A family of 4 of us (two 50 year olds and a 17 and a 19 year old) used the Entertainer App and got 2 for 1 entry into the waterpark for the day, which made it much more affordable. The Waterpark has good wifi all through the park but you're better to put phones in lockers and",
          "We had such a lovely time at this waterpark until my husband fell out the gate by one of the rest areas overlooking the wave ride. That was a scary moment. The bolt on the gate was obviously worn and nobody had bothered to do anything about it. Hopefully someone fixes this",
          "An amazing time we had! The place is engaging so much to enjoy!its a one stop place to be and one hardly realises time A must place to visit anytime in Dubai!",
          "First and all for us really great waterpark. Helpful staffs and friendly! We really enjoyed from open till close time. Good visit with family,friends or couples. Good place for relaxing.",
          "Average day out with little to do and not many attractions that were thrilling was clean and food was good though",
          "This waterpark is good for everyone, young children, teens and adults alike. I personally loved the Jumeirah Sceirah speed slides (3, 2, 1 scream!!!) and the 2 flowriders (bodysurfing). The life guards are very helpful and friendly. The view around the waterpark is simply put",
          "Wow, what can I say, i had an awesome experience at wild wadi water park. There were so many different water games and rides to go on, and some for the strong hearted. There can't be a dull moment there, plus the staff there are so friendly. We were there for over 6 hours and we",
          "Visited this place in the summer while staying at Jumeirah resorts. The overall experience of Jumeirah is great. However, the waterpark was not as big as I have expected. Probably, as there was an area closed for development. I have found that some rides would be really scary",
          "Excellent day out with the family, so much fun for all ages although it's better if you can swim (but even if you can't there's alot of rides to go on )",
          "Wild wadi and Atlantis are 2 of the most popular waterparks in Dubai Get too crowded on holidays, so get there early Priced a bit too steep Almost 30 rides so it takes almost a day to get through the entire park Enjoy the high waves of flood river to the lazy waves of Juhas",
          "We went to the water park with 3 generations. Everyone enjoyed the slides. The propelled jet slides were great to get higher up the levels to access some other slides with lots of stairs.",
          "It was our 2nd waterpark experience after Aquaventure at Atlantis Hotel in in Dubai. It is very different but as entertaining, clean and safe. This park is more compact but more charming too. We arrived 1/2 h after opening and there were not so many visitors in spite of holidays",
          "One of the best waterparks in the world. If you stay in a Jumeirah hotel you get early access an hour before it opens to the public, so great to go on the rides before it gets busy. Lots of rides to choose from, and plenty of sun loungers and 2 lazy rivers for those that just",
          "Had a great time with my kids. The photographers could improve on their skills would further provide good memories.",
          "It was hard to decide between wild wadi water park and Atlantis water park . After reading several reviews I choose wild wadi for its capsule ride. Although I don\u2019t find that ride much exiting but found lazy river with least expectation much better. Water park was not big but",

          "This is the 2nd time we have visited the Wild Wadi water park and there is definitely plenty to do for younger and older children. I would definitely recommend downloading the Entertainer app as this allowed us 2 for 1 tickets which made the park cheaper to enter however it was",

          "The park is clean and nicely located. The rides are very diverse. We loved Tantum Alley and the G-force slide. Best part: we had no queues and did as many rides in 7 hours. Great and truly recommended",
          "Very good It\u2019s in a good location With the beach view Water rides are very good The staff is help full But it\u2019s very expensive",
          "My 2 children 4 and 7 had a great time on the easier / simpler rides but the queuing and the tired presentation / repair makes it a bit shabby. The ticket cost is too high for the quality of the offering in my opinion. The toddler area is straight from CentreParc and the main",
          "Kids zone is the best part in my opinion besides the artificial beach , the kids enjoyed a ton ! Very well kept and maintained all over the park .. Has the : \" lets go and have fun \" mood . Can be really crowded sometimes .. And not very inviting then ..the quieter the better",
          "We loved this place. A good selection of rides from the high adrenelin to the fun family rides, and a nicely laid out place with great views of the Burj al Arab and of the sea. The two surf simulators were good too, one good for our older boys and one for our younger girl.",

          "For us, we\u2019re a family of five with three teenage girls, this is a must do in Dubai. Wild Wadi is our favourite water park anywhere, but it\u2019s perhaps most helpful to compare it to Atlantis and share why we personally we prefer it here. It has a more relaxed vibe, I think in",
          "Few of you gonna kill me.. but by my personal experience is the best park in Dubai. Even over Atlantis.. Its not overcrowded like mentioned before park. And the views are better. Slide next by burj al arab is outstanding!",
          "We went to Wild Wadi for the first time this week. The park is situated next to the Burj Al Arab and there are some fantastic views from within the park. We arrived at opening time and there were no queues. Following advice we took our own towels because rental was pretty",
          "This park is ok, the best part is the fact that there are no queues. There\u2019s not many slides at all. I managed to get round the whole park in 45 mins. It may be good if you want to go on things several times. However the single rider slides aren\u2019t that thrilling, it\u2019s almost",
          "Wild Wadi water park is very family centred fun It\u2019s smaller than I anticipated but filled with a long lazy river including rapids that spurt off of the lazy river at times, plenty of rides, a kids section with rides, main pool with waves and a smaller/calmer section that came",
          "Best of the best. Beat the heat with this park. Good rides and a view which cannot be beaten. Had a wonderful time. Kids would love this place :)",
          "Absolutely fantastic. I was reluctant to book as my son has asd. He went around the lazy rivers and children's areas. But we even went on burj surj, we thought we had made a mistake as soon as it flew down, lots of water splashing something he dislikes, it at the bottom. He",
          "Great day out with the kids, who thoroughly enjoyed the water park. Managed to do most of the rides in good time as queues were short early in the day. Kids then repeated the rides they enjoyed most. Friendly staff and good facilities. The kids section with the wave pool was",
          "The whole family loved Wild Wadi. All the staff were so nice to our 2 young children. Lots of different water slides for all sorts of ages. We went a whole day without any food and barely any water as the food prices were so high. It would be nice to see some free drinking",
          "This is a nice water park, it is particularly good to stay in the Jumeirah hotels and visit it as it is included with your stay! It has a few very cool rides for teenagers and older, and plenty of nice enjoyable rides for adults and kids alike. It can get busy at points, I",
          "I took my son and 5 friends here for his 7th birthday and it was great. I was able to hire a cabana with a private area and this was excellent to use as a base. We also had lunch served here which meant we could relax a bit more than having to worry about going to one of the",
          "Arrived at 10.30am on a Tuesday and was surprised how quiet it was. Literally had pick of spot to set up and went on rides without queueing. Lovely place, go every year and it's always clean and well maintained. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Went with my 8 year old. We stayed for 7 hours, but much of that was spent repeating the rides she enjoyed the best. Could probably do it all in a couple of hours. Get there early to avoid any queues. The park layout is very good, plenty of seating areas both around the main",
          "This was our first time In Dubai and it won\u2019t be the last since we came we sees only incredible building ,hotels, restaurants and finally wild wadi the rides there it\u2019s amazing and the staff is so helpful.",
          "I had stayed in Jumeirah Emirates Towers and entry is free for inhouse guests which is an awesome value given the ticket prices. There is a shuttle bus to and fro for Hotel guests at set intervals. Visited the park with my wife and 2 young kids. Thoroughly enjoyed the park. As",
          "The water park has free entry if you staying at the Jameria or Burj Kalifa hotels. The park is compact but has some good rides for all ages. Plenty of shaded and sunny areas to sit in. Great view of the Burj Kalifa. Downside is you can't take your own food in only water, so it",
          "Having come to both in the same holiday, the conclusions my wife and I drew were that Aquaventure is definitely better. We arrived early and had done nearly every combination of slide we could do in less than an hour and a half. The place is great fun but not as many varied",
          "One of the best waterpark in UAE, got into with a great discount as one of our friends works a hotelier, great selections of restaurant also. Staff are friendly, really loved thier rides.",
          "Its located next door to the Jumeirah Al Arab so the view from the park is excellent. The Good The rides were actually very good. The staff were excellent and the park overall was very clean. There are enough sun chairs to accommodate a large number of visitors. You can",
          "As we stayed in the Jumeirah Creekside we got free entrance for the Wild Wadi waterpark. We have been visiting here since 2001. It really is now looking a bit shabby here and there and looking a bit long in the tooth. A few rides were replaced some years ago but it is losing",
          "Just crazy and brilliant. We love it!!!!!! Very reasonable priced We went during the week and there was no queuing whatsoever We would return without question",
          "Avoid Atlantis Aquaaventure at all costs. It\u2019s absolutely rubbish! WW by contrast has great rides, very few queues, lots of shade, and you\u2019re not fighting in a taxi to get on and off the Palm which is full of roadworks.",
          "I initially wanted to go to Aquaventure as read that it was better but ended up visiting this attraction primarily as we used the citysightseeing tour and it was the quickest and easiest to get to. I was pleasantly surprised how well run this park is and found the facilites",
          "I went to Wild Wadi and it is the same needs something new. Dubai is meant to be international have a ride for country. The water has cherry seeds all over not clean.",
          "Great water fun for whole family. Enjoyed the experience. The gentle meander along the river was about the mark for a granny like me although I did go on the more hectic tube ride which included whooshing through a dark tunnel. wow. \ud83d\ude01",
          "This waterpark is fantastic. It\u2019s set out really nicely and it\u2019s very clean. I went down a pretty scary waterslide about four years ago, which totally put me off them. My husband loves the adrenalin rush and we had complimentary access due to staying at one of the listed",
          "Fun way to spend a day. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Like most water and theme parks, the food is just okay. I do suggest to look into the cost of staying at one of the Jumeirah group hotels, where most often the access to the park is free. In my case staying at",
          "The best water park I've been. Suberbly built and the fun starts right as you enter. The rides get more exciting as you go ahead. As you move ahead it just takes you from one excitement to another. The kids and everyone liked the Tantrum Alley the most and done that several",
          "I have been to Wild Wadi about 4 to 5 times being in Dubai for a long time. I love the place for its wicked rides, friendly assistance and the ability to wear swimwear be comfortable. Its facilities are very decent and the food is good too. During the summers it is operational",
          "Four friends and I visited Wild Wadi for a fun day and boy did we have some fun. Amazing, would love to take my boys here one day, they would love it. Fab place for the young and fun seeking older generation \ud83d\ude03",
          "FUN, FUN, FUN.... Great day out especially for kids, highly recommend it, food is expensive though so eat before you go if you can.",
          "With only one real \"thrill\" ride and a few others to get blood pumping I would be very disappointed if I had paid. Abu Dhabi waterpark infinitely better... however if staying at Jumeriah is free so easy to pop in and out for a few hours",
          "We had so much fun visiting Wild Wadi! Never too old to enjoy a water park. This place was a good size and fairly quiet when we were there so no queues for us and a great way to spend the day! We took towels with us and just bought one small locker for the both of us which was",
          "My friends and I go every year at this time of the year while the weather is slowly transitioning and somehow it never gets old! We enjoy quad biking and dune bashing in the desert but this is super refreshing, loved Wild Wadi! The only downside is that the food is super",
          "Entry was free as part of our Hotel stay at Jumeirah Mina A\u2019Salam. We had a great afternoon at the waterpark which is suited to all ages. Really enjoyed just peacefully floating around in the water on a tube but also had fun going on the waterslides and were in our fifties! It",
          "If you are staying in Jumeirah hotel or even visiting Dubai for the first time then this is not something to miss. Jumeirah guests gets free excess to this park. Many fun rides available but my favourite was lazy river and wave pool. Lot of things for kids as well and good food",
          "The best water park in Dubai. Although the food is slightly expensive but everything was perfect. Highly recommended to go on a week day, less people waiting in line for the rides.",
          "It\u2019s very good spot to have fun and relax with the view of Burj al Arab.the Tantrum alley ride and Jumeirah sceirah ride are the best at this place",
          "Huge water park with so much things to enjoy. We stayed at the nearby hotel so it was very accessible for us. Its very timely at this time as the weather still warm. Very good place to spend the summer. Food stalls, cafe and restaurants are everywhere so dont worry of getting",
          "It\u2019s not the biggest water park, but it has a few fun/more exciting slides. It doesn\u2019t take long to walk around, and we were lucky that it was not busy when we went so we had the chance to do some of the rides a couple of times.",
          "The park is nice and clean the staff are really friendly. On arrival bags are searched and any food and drink are removed but can be collected when leaving the park. We paid 426AED (\u00a388 uk pounds) and on booking I was happy to pay this but after about 2 hours of being at the",
          "Went there on monday 10.30 - 14.30 and didn't have to que any where. We went there three adults and i must say that there are only 4 rides for adults even so we had great fun and were able to spend 4 hours there like we were kids again. Prices inside are acceptable 10AED for a",
          "Nice place to spend a few hours. Not very thrilling attractions (good for me) but not boring. You can rent towels and lockers. Great views of Burj Al Arab from many of the attractions. If you are staying at a Jumeirah hotel the entrance is included.",
          "Im not going to lie, this water park dragged the child out from within me and frankly we had a great time at Wild Wadi! Free entry as a part of our stay at Jumeirah Emirates Towers. We went at 6pm on Friday and stayed until 10 pm. There were absolutely no queues, in fact we only",
          "Best water park in Dubai without a doubt ! Really clean and very well maintained ! Thoroughly enjoyed the entire day ! Only problem is that the food inside is super highly expensive and we cannot take our own food, so we are handicapped !",
          "We only went because we had no time to go to the Atlantis... but really we ended up going to the beach after a couple hours as we were a little bored. Our kids would love it though if we brought them. We stayed at the Burj Al Arab and so it was easy to just head to the beach",
          "Went to the water park a few weeks ago with the family, what a day out. Great rides. Nice and compact, very clean and friendly.",
          "We visited the park on our 1st day. We had got a a buy 1 get 1 free voucher. Which made the cost ok for the 4 of us. My son enjoyed the surf board slide. I relaxed by the pool. My husband and daughter done the rest of the slides. Great day had by all.",
          "Very nice aqua park Felt better than Atlantic aqua park More activities More people arround Cheaper And nice staff",
          "The kids had a fabulous day out! The rides were fantastic and well worth a visit....highly recommend it... HOWEVER....the service is utterly appalling. The disorganized chaos on entering to get tickets was infuriating to say the least...Getting lunch was equally as awful with",
          "Aqua Park Wild Wadi is located close to the Arab Burj. we were two people. The ticket cost 335 Aed with voucher entertainer for two people, plus one looker= 380 Aed. changing rooms, showers are available. slides are two very extreme, surfing and a few slides and a river with",
          "Visited here and must say it was a lot of fun. Visited for a few hours as I was staying at Madinat Jumeirah. This meant I was given complimentary access. The only thing that I would say is that there are only 11 rides and a couple of them are not actually rides so not as many",
          "We are staying in the city and decided to catch a taxi( 40 dirham) to the waterpark. We got a cheap rate through using a VISA debit card - 30% off we just googled wild Wadi ticket deals. There were literally no people there- we felt as if we had the whole place to ourselves from",

          "If you are visiting Dubai and can only visit one waterpark my recommendation would be Wild Wadi. It has great rides for all kids ages, toddles to teens and the set-up means you don't have to walk for miles to go from one ride to the next. In fact lots of the slides are accessed",
          "This is garest place to have fun and relax ( at least if it\u2019s not high season). Lot of nice rides and a chilling lazy river. But at Thebens what makes you feel unhappy is the totally overpriced offering for all extras. This starts with extra payment of ~ 12 \u20ac for a mid size",
          "Omg over rated - cost me over \u00a370 and guess what only major rides for adult where 3 - I was bored after an hour lol RIP OFF",
          "Went my friends and cousins more than once. Always had fun there without fail. It\u2019s just a shame it\u2019s only half day for ladies which means if the lines are long you only get to ride a some of the games. Never the less I highly recommend it for hijabis for the funnest summer",
          "Entry to the theme park is about \u00a380 in sterling. Hire smallest locker is about \u00a310. Theme park dont have that many attraction or ride. Compare with any theme park in UK, its far too expensive. You are not even allow to take quarter filled bottle or can drink. Have to purchase",
          "This water park is very good! One of the best! It has plenty of rides and there is so much to do. I recommend this to everyone I know when visiting Dubai",
          "Came here with the girls, we had an amazing time. Most waterparks are for single riders this place allowed duos and quads which made it even more fun as you shared the experience of the rides together",
          "Had a brilliant day here...rides are great fun. If you go early...the queues the alot smaller. The staff are super nice. Loved my day here. They provide 3 types of lockers for your belongings...pay for the size you require. Showers are also provided in the changing rooms. Highly",

          "One of the perks of staying at a Jumeriah resort is that you get complimentary access to the water park. The park itself is fairly large with good selection of rides that cater for all ages. We were there for around 5 hours which was plenty of time to see and do the rides.",

          "We enjoyed the rides. It is a bit of a free for all during busy times. You need to get there early to get loungers as there are not many. There can be long queues at rides. Food is expensive.",

          "I was a bit disappointed with this water park. The view of the burj hotel is beautiful. The rides are so so compared to the waterparks ee have in Toronto. The rides are all located all over the place and not marked with signs properly. Some of the rides are fun and other rides",
          "I\u2019ve tried all of the water parks in Dubai and I find that Wild Wadi is my favourite. They have more rides to offer than other water parks and the lines move faster too. It has been under renovation and is a nicer place to visit as it feels new and safer.",
          "It was a very good experience but not amazing. The kids were able to go on many rides and they enjoyed themselves. It was quite safe and the staff were pleasant. Could do with a bit more clean toilet facilities and locker rooms.",

        "wiki": "The Dubai Miracle Garden (In Arabic: \u062d\u062f\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u0628\u062f\u0628\u064a) is a flower garden located in the district of Dubailand, Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The garden was launched on Valentine's Day in 2013. The garden occupies over 72,000 square metres (780,000 sq ft), making it the world's largest natural flower garden featuring over 50 million flowers and 250 million plants.In April 2015, the garden was awarded the Moselle Award for New Garden Experiences of the year by the Garden Tourism Award 2015.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe concept of the first miracle garden project was formed under an agreement between Dubailand and the Dubai Properties Group destination. The project development was done under an agreement with Akar Landscaping and Agriculture Company, led by Jordanian businessman Abdel Naser Rahhal. The cost of the project was estimated at AED 40 million (US$11 million).Phase one of the project was completed and opened in February 2013 which consisted of 21,000 sq. ft. outdoor facility including vertical and horizontal landscaping design where each of them have their own design. The development of phase one took two months and required 400 workers. Phase two of the project was initiated in mid-June 2013 and was completed in October, where it involved the 70 percent expansion of the 21,000 sq ft and construction of the 850,000 sq ft multistory car park, which increased the total area of the garden to 2 million sq ft. Phase two development also included the addition of the floral clock, the butterfly garden, retail stores and mosques.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nThe Dubai Miracle Garden operates from October to April and remains closed from May to September due to high temperatures with an average of 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F), which is not conducive for flower viewing.\n\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe flowers are maintained by re-use of treated wastewater through drip irrigation method with an average amount of 757,082 litres (166,535 imperial gallons; 200,000 US gallons) of water per day. According to the officials of Dubai Miracle Garden, the Dubai municipality retreats the grey water of the city and sends it directly to the garden. The garden again re-filters the water and converts it to a very high quality water for its usage at the garden. The garden is only watered after the closing hours at night. \n\n\n== Dubai Butterfly Garden ==\nIn 2015 Dubai Miracle Garden opened the Dubai Butterfly Garden, the world\u2019s largest and the region\u2019s first indoor butterfly garden and sanctuary for over 15,000 butterflies from 26 species.\n\n\n== Agreement with Disney ==\nAs part of a licensing deal between the Dubai Miracle Garden and The Walt Disney Company, a topiary of Mickey Mouse was unveiled in February 2018. Flower structures of Minnie Mouse, Goofy, Pluto, Daisy Duck, Donald Duck,  and Huey, Dewey, and Louie were installed later that year.\n\n\n== Guinness World Records ==\nThe Dubai Miracle garden has so far made 3 Guinness World Records. In 2013; the Dubai Miracle garden was declared as the world's largest vertical garden. Currently; an Airbus A380 flower structure in the garden is listed by Guinness World Records as the biggest flower structure in the world. The 18 metres (59 ft) topiary of Mickey Mouse, which weighs almost 35 tonnes, is the tallest topiary supported sculpture in the world.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nA scene of a Bollywood film Hamari Adhuri Kahani, starring  Emraan Hashmi and Vidya Balan, was shot in the garden. The director, Mohit Suri, stated that though Dubai was generally known for its high-tech buildings and modern landscapes, he wanted to romanticise it and show its softer side.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nDubai Miracle Garden Blog\nDubai Miracle Garden Pictures\nDubai Miracle Garden Photo Gallery\nDubai Miracle Garden Images\nDubai Miracle Garden: A Heavenly Feeling",

          "This feels like quite an old place. There are 4 domes which are pretty much the same. Yes it is novel to have a butterfly come and sit on you, but for the 50 Dirham entry I expected a lot more. By comparison the Dubai Aquarium is AED100 and the far more impressive Dubai Miracle",
          "This place has a vast vast variety of butterflies and it's really nice. Sometimes, if you are lucky, the butterflies come and sit on your palm and it makes for a beautiful photograph.. The entry ticket is around 40-50aed per person. It is right across from the miracle garden.",
          "One dome was closed for construction, but the others were full of every kind of butterfly imaginable. Very nice arrangement of habitats to allow maximum interaction.",
          "excellent place for kids or for those who would love to spend some time with beautiful butterflies. It is within Miracle Garden, but you can buy separate ticket for it.",
          "This is near the Miracle Garden so you must allow time to visit both. There are different domes with beautiful butterflies flying around. If you are lucky they will land on you. Wear bright clothing.",
          "We were headed to the Miracle Gardens anyway and despite reading the very mixed reviews decided to give this a go. Very disappointing. As noted by others, three small domes but full of butterflies but nothing really educational, just members of staff with sticks making sure the",
          "Its nice ..but expensive.. 60 dirham for 1 adult .. Its just a black type of big butterflies.. i didnt see that 30 thousands types !! And it was sad to see the butterfly with half wing !! The souvenirs shop was stupid.. plastic jar with paper made butterfly fo 30 dirham !!!",
          "We went with family, with 2 boisterous boys and as soon as they saw the butterflies they were quiet as well as controllable through amazement. They loved it. A serious of a few large tents / rooms that are climatic controlled to high humidity. They are everywhere... Celing,",
          "Located just a short walk from Exit 2 of Miracle Garden, the Dubai Butterfly garden is truly a fabulous place to let the young ones come as close as possible to nature. There are actually 9 domes, but 6 were closed when we visited, but the 3 open ones still provided ample",
          "The Dubai Butterfly Garden is next door to the Miracle Garden in Dubai. It is a beautifully, well laid out, set up. The artwork made from butterfly wings is absolutely beautiful when one enters - it is so unusual. The domes that house the gardens with all the butterflies are",
          "While the butterfly garden had lush surroundings and is well set out, people were picking the butterflies up by their wings, despite signs telling them not too. I think staff members should be more vigilant to visitor behaviour. A lot of children were in the park but many were",
          "its literally a garden, full of butterflies!! it is one of the most magical places i have ever been to!!!",
          "It's something that we hadn't seen in the past. Hundreds of butterflies spread out in three enclosed domes. You can walk through the park and they would come and sit on your hands, back, dress....You can reach your finger out in front of a sitting butterfly and it may well",
          "There are some wonderful butterflies that can be seen, however the entrance fee is overpriced for what you get.",

          "Recommended by a friend, this place is hard to find but very worth it. Great for my daughters aged 9 & 11. A dusty car park next to a small entrance should not put you off entering into 4 huge domes with hundreds of butterflies. The atmosphere is humid amid the controlled rain",
          "My whole family had come all the way from Dar es salaam in Africa and they weren't happy at all. I recommended miracle garden for then and they absolutely love it! Unfortunately they also planned on going to the butterfly garden. First of all the pricing was crazy!!!: 50 DHS per",

          "Very unfriendly guy selling the tickets. We asked for a map and the guy at the ticket office answered us very rudely only to say that we didn't need one. Once inside, you find out that the guy is actually right ( but definitely could be a lot friendlier, considering its a family",

          "Too expensive for what you get. No combo ticket with Miracle Garden even though it is next to door. There are several viewing room and only in the last room you are able to sit and enjoy the surrounding.",

          "Once you have covered the Miracle World , cross over to the indoor Butterfly Garden from Exit 2. You need to buy separate tickets for admission to the Butterfly Garden@ 50 Dhs per person. A visit to the Garden that has a huge collection of butterflies from all over the world is",

          "We visited here when we discovered that the miracle gardens was not a long exhibition, and we needed to kill time before our driver returned. I like this place much better than the gardens. At first, I thought the price seemed too steep to see butterflies, but they were a lot",
          "Lovely place next to the Miracle Gardens. Great place to visit if you like butterflies or have kids. It is around a 20 minute drive from downtown Dubai. It is indoor and the butterflies fly around you. When I visited they also landed on my hand to personally meet us! Cheap",
          "Visited - Dec This place is next to Dubai Miracle Garden, you can get here from Mall of Emirates via bus in about 5 AED, Closing time - 6 PM Entrance free - 50 AED, but that is totally worth it. It is all indoor, with windows in each doom for sunlight, first thing you will see",
          "This place is marvelous, you get in to see all kinds of butterflies, a whole different world of a beautiful creature with multi colors and unique species. It is a must see if your go to Dubai...",
          "There were so many different types of butterflies. Each was area had a different type some large some small.",
          "Totally worth it. I enjoyed it very very much. Try to start in the butterfly garden then go to the miracle garden because it is easier to get a taxi there. We did take a picture with real butterflies on our hands. (We are a family of 3). The picture was worth it.",
          "Beautiful place, amazing colorful butterflies. Perfect for children and nature lovers. there is Starbucks cafe.",
          "I enjoyed the tour through 3 different areas . Butterflies are really visibile and you can take pictures everywhere. The 50 Aed for the entrance are a right fee considering the time that you can spend there with your family. Clean and well maintained, it's a tour that completes",
          "AED50 is ok value for Dubai. On this day though one dome was closed for renovation, so a third of the exhibit missing, so the price should reflect this and be reduced until it is 100% again. It is nicely kept and some great photo opportunities, staff were pleasant, could be more",
          "Maybe we just picked the wrong day but my family were very disappointed. The attraction itself is very small and not value for money for 50 dirhams. I went out to get our babies hat but was unable to go back in without 50 dirhams again! The security guards were untrained in",

          "The Butterfly Garden is adjacent to the famous Miracle Gardens. It was better than expected, though the AED 50 price was too much, and no discounts for kids! They place orange slices and other fruits strategically so as to attract the butterflies. If you ask, the staff will",
          "I didn't expect this beauty in the Middle East! What a lovely and a well-maintained garden. there were 4 domes filled with very beautiful butterflies of different colors and species. Many drawings hanging on the walls made of butterflies. It was a nurturing experience for the",

          "Entrance fee is exorbitant 50 AED per person. There is no discount even for a 5 year old kid. You go in with the expectations that you will see a lot of very colourful butterflies roaming around. These expectations are only half fullfilled. There are 4 sections. First section",

          "Amazing experience, Massive butterflies will just land on you. Small info. try to wear Green/ Red or Yellow color when you visiting. Staff informed us that the butterflies are more attached to these colors :)",
          "If you have an hour or two free and you would like to enjoy some beautiful butterflies , just go and enjoy.",
          "It was an enjoyable experience but 50aed is expensive for the entrance. the other domes are closed and the outside park. its was like we were only able to visit 40% of the whole place.",
          "Nothing much to see, nowhere to eat, nothing to do. Probably the biggest excursion error i have ever made Just today visited butterfly garden purely because miracle garden was closed and we had taken a cab there (despite google saying it was open). So not to waste the 80 dhirum",
          "Thousands of brightly coloured butterflies. Dubai Miracle Garden is open 9am to 9pm on weekdays and 9am to 11pm on Friday and Saturdays.",
          "A fantastic place to visit. It takes some finding though as it is hidden away So many different species that are quite happy to land on you for a photo shoot. 50aed entrance fee, and worth it",
          "Took a little trip to this lovely place on a weekend. The nice thing is that is not as crowded as the miracle garden but still a lot of people are on the go. The entry is 50 AED, that's fine. The garden exists of three differnt rooms with a lot of differnt butterflies and birds,",
          "Go here. The butterflies land on you, they're massive, colourful and highly engaging for all the family. It's a great change from the more typical Dubai attractions and and a great filler for an afternoon. Pack your camera!",
          "As the name suggests u will see butterflies everywhere. Its nice something different than your regular place visits. Entry Price is on high side though 50 Aed is too much & the stinky smell will bother u a lot with little bit of suffocation as well as the place is closed. Visit",
          "The number of butterflies in the garden is not enough to call it a butterfly garden. The variety of butterflies is also very less may be 3 or 4. Its away from the city as well and ticket of 50 AED is too much for what you get to see in the garden. The only good thing is that",
          "This place is great for kids and adults. Worth a visit, the dome where butterflies of all kind fly free is an experience.",
          "A lovely place to spend an afternoon. My toddler thoroughly enjoyed finding butterflies and waiting for them to land on her. Entry price was reasonable, the facilities weren't as flash as other Dubai venues, but the staff were helpful and friendly. They had a nice selection of",
          "If you need to escape the heat I would seriously consider this garden. The outside doesn't look promising, but do go in because it's worth it! Dome after dome of stunning butterflies! Wasn't sure about the art in first room... but the domes were lovely! Make sure you go in the",

          "I took some guests to the butterfly garden and they enjoyed it tremendously. However, having been to other butterfly gardens elsewhere, it was a bit disappointed. There are only four or five kinds of butterflies and the landscaping was not the best. Entrance fee is 50 dirhams",
          "We visited in August and it was a lovely morning out! (it is still open even when the miracle garden isn't) the temperature is refreshing as it is a lot cooler than outside, domes of butterfly's where you can freely walk around at your own pace- make sure you know where you are",
          "We took our grandchildren to this place. It proved to be worth it. It is of good size. Well organized and kept. Being indoors makes it suitable anytime of the day. I highly recommend this",
          "Before we came here we expected a lot of butterflies, but after we came it was less butterflies, the staffs were so friendly and helpful, even 1 lady catch 1 butterfly and gave us....",
          "a lovely a/c venue so good to visit all year around. There is no information about the butterflies type or life span. You would probably spend a max of 1.30hours there as there is nothing else there. There is a cafe. It is very pretty but at 60dhs per person with no children's",
          "Garden wise it good one . but we feel very artificial when we see the butterflies . It seems like they have been forced to be inside . Lot of People catching the butterflies also .Some times feel sad by seeing that !!!",
          "This is a must visit and more so if you have a small kids. It is difficult to explain the excitement when a butterfly just come and sits on your fingers. the place is a bit difficult to come back from , since cabs can be a bit difficult to get in busy times. But a must visit -",

          "Lovely variety of butterflies. Great outing for children. You get an opportunity for the butterflies to rest on the plam of your hands and click pictures. The place is well taken care off and a great home to the butterflies.",

        "wiki": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven states that has grown from a quiet backwater to one of the Middle East's most important economic centres.\nThough traditionally conservative, the UAE is one of the most liberal countries in the Gulf, with other cultures and beliefs generally tolerated. Politically it remains authoritarian, however.\nRelations with neighbouring Iran have been tense because of an ongoing territorial dispute over Gulf islands. The UAE was one of only three countries to recognise Taliban rule in Afghanistan.\nBefore oil was discovered in the 1950s the UAE's economy was dependent on fishing and a declining pearl industry. But since oil exports began in 1962, the country's society and economy have been transformed.\nThe UAE has diversified and has become a regional trading and tourism hub. UAE firms have invested heavily abroad.\n\n\n== Early history ==\n\n\n=== 7000 BCE \u2013 7th century ===\nRecords of the area where the emirate and city of Dubai is situated are very rare for any period before the 18th century.During the expansion of the Sheikh Zayed Road between 1993 and 1998, remnants of a mangrove swamp were uncovered which were dated to approximately 7000 BCE. It is thought that by about 3000 BCE, the coastline had moved seaward sufficiently towards the present-day coastline and the area became covered in sand.As it became more inhabitable, nomadic cattle herders used the area to live and herd in. The date palm began to be grown locally in 2500 BCE, and was the first instance of the land being used for agricultural purposes. The herders worshipped the god Bajir and various evidence suggests links to the mysterious Magan civilisation, who it is thought controlled the copper trade of this part of the ancient world, and of which there are archaeological sites in Bahrain.For the next about 2000\u20132700 years there are no more details, probably because of the desertification, insignificance, and remoteness of the area, until the area came part of the \"Maka\" satrapy, the southern most satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire, and followed by the Sassanian Empire, the last pre-Islamic Iranian Empire, several hundred years later in the 3rd century CE. Recent excavations of the Jumeirah area of Dubai have unearthed a 6th-century caravan station suggesting the area was sparsely inhabited during this period.\n\n\n=== 7th century\u20131800 ===\n\nThe Umayyads introduced Islam to the area in the 7th century and sparked the vitalization of the area, opening up trade routes supported by fishing and pearl diving to eastern regions such as modern-day Pakistan and India, with reports of ships travelling as far as China to trade. The earliest written mention of the area of Dubai was in 1095, by Ab\u016b 'Ubayd 'Abd All\u0101h al-Bakr\u012b, in his Mojam Ma Ostojam men Asmae Al belaad wal Mawadhea, in which he describes many places of the world compiled from other accounts of them.  It was not until 1799 that the town had its first record. However, the Venetian Gasparo Balbi, a renowned pearl merchant, mentioned \u201cDibai\u201d in a list of places he noted for the exceptional quality of their pearls in the year 1590.\n\n\n== 1800\u20131966 ==\n\n\n=== 1800\u20131912 ===\nIn the early 19th century, the Al Abu Falasa dynasty (part of the House of Al-Falasi) of the Bani Yas tribe established Dubai, which remained a dependent of Abu Dhabi until 1833. On 8 January 1820, the Sheikh of Dubai and other sheikhs in the region signed the \"General Maritime Peace Treaty\" with the British government, which aimed to end plundering and piracy in the region and was the first formal denunciation of the slave trade in Emirati history. However, in 1833 the Al Maktoum dynasty (also descendants of the House of Al-Falasi) of the Bani Yas tribe left the settlement of Abu Dhabi and took over Dubai from the Abu Falasa clan without resistance, led by Maktoum bin Butti, the founder of the present day al-Maktoum dynasty. In 1841 the town was hit by a devastating smallpox outbreak which forced many to relocate east to the town of Deira, Dubai.In 1853, in an attempt to further halt the endemic piracy, the British signed another truce, agreeing to stay out of administration of the region in return for a reduction in piracy. This also had the side effect of the area becoming known as the Trucial States.\nIn 1894 a fire swept through Deira, burning down most of the homes; however, perfect geographical positioning and thriving business enabled the rebuilding of the city. The success of the area led Sheikh Maktoum to sign an exclusive business deal with the British in 1892, making Dubai a British protectorate, and in 1894 granted full tax exemption for all foreign traders. By 1903, the Sheikh had succeeded in convincing a major British steamship line to make Dubai a port of call. Merchants from Lingah looked across to the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf finally making their homes in Dubai. They continued to trade with Lingah, however, as do many of the dhows in Dubai Creek today, and they named their district Bastakiya, after the Bastak region in southern Persia. At this time, almost a quarter of the population was of non-Emirati origin.\n\n\n=== 1912\u20131944 ===\nAfter various rulers, Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum who became Ruler in 1912, was the first Ruler to rule for a substantial period of time and is regarded by many as one of the fathers of Dubai. The times of prosperity thanks to the pearl industry continued solidly through until the Great Depression of 1929. The emergence of artificial pearls had begun to hit the economy of Dubai, and coupled with the effects of the depression caused the Sheikh to explore other opportunities for expansion. In 1929, he was briefly deposed and succeeded by Sheikh Mani bin Rashid, a relative; however, three days later he was restored to the throne and ruled until his death. This resulted in the emergence of Dubai as the premier re-export business port, whereby goods are imported into a duty-free port and immediately exported to another market.Dubai has the main entrep\u00f4t in the Persian Gulf and the busiest trading port since 1900, with commerce being the main source of revenue for the emirate. The merchant class in Dubai played a key role in restructuring the economy and government decision-making in the pre-oil era of Dubai's development. Today merchants play a fundamental role in economic affairs and the political structure. In addition, again they have taken on roles as service suppliers, urban planners, culture mediators, and internationalists representing the region throughout the world.Dubai suffered economically after 1920 due to the collapse of the pearl industry, the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the loss of extensive trade networks during World War II. Until the surge of oil revenues in the late 1960s, political instability and merchant unrest existed and constituted an organized attempt to subvert British control and the ruling Al-Maktoum family.  African slavery was practiced until the 1960s.   The uprising of 1938 in Dubai was the culmination of a decade of grievances and minor rebellions against the autocratic rule of Shaykh Sa'id bin Maktum (ruled 1912-58). In the 1930s the Trucial Coast was characterized by great poverty resulting primarily from a decline in the pearl trade. Much of the initiative for reform sprang from an attempt to ameliorate economic conditions\u2014the leaders of the movement having previously been successful pearl merchants. The new government established in October 1938 lasted only a few months before Shaykh Sa'id with Bedouin support was able to overthrow it in March 1939. The collapse of the reform movement is attributable to the role played by British agents and the weakness of the political structure that was set up.\n\n\n=== 1945\u20131958 ===\nA dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi regarding their border escalated into armed conflict between the two states, with Dubai attacking a number of Abu Dhabi towns in the country's interior.  Arbitration by the British in 1949 resulted in the creation of a buffer frontier running south eastwards from the coast at Ras Hasian.  A formal compromise was not reached until 1979, eight years after the creation of the UAE.\n\n\n=== 1958\u20131966 ===\nIn 1958, upon the death of Saeed bin Maktoum Al Maktoum, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum became Ruler. Rashid al Maktoum is widely regarded as the driving force behind the expansion of Dubai, causing its massive expansion, with the aid of the discovery of oil. He embarked on a dredging of Dubai Creek in 1963, as the creek was too small for modern ships to dock there, which caused severe negative economic effects. He borrowed huge amounts of money to pull off the dredging, which was highly risky as the money necessary to complete it was far higher than Dubai\u2019s annual income. The dredging was a success, which enabled vessels of any size to dock at the port. This caused the gold re-export market to take off, and ensuring Rashid was able to begin the building of vital infrastructure in partnership with the British.\nSince the beginning, Dubai was constantly at odds with Abu Dhabi. In 1947, a border dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on their northern border erupted into war between the two states and forced the involvement of the British and the subsequent creation of a buffer zone which resulted in a temporary ceasefire. However, border disputes between the emirates continued even after the formation of the UAE and it was only in 1979 that a formal compromise was reached that ended hostilities between the two states, by allowing Abu Dhabi the control of the rest of the UAE, while leaving Dubai to rule many of its own affairs, especially when related to trade.\n\n\n== 1966\u2013present day ==\n\n\n=== Discovery of oil ===\nThe major turning point in the history and fortunes of Dubai was the discovery of oil in 1966. Coupled with the joining of the newly independent country of Qatar and Dubai to create a new currency, the Riyal, after the devaluation of the Persian Gulf rupee which had been issued by the Government of India, it enabled Dubai to rapidly expand and grow. Once the first shipment of oil was made in 1969, the future of Dubai as an autonomous state was secured, and its ability to dictate policy in later years to the UAE was cemented.\n\n\n=== Formation of the UAE ===\nBritain left the Persian Gulf in the early part of 1971, having announced their intentions in 1968, causing Dubai and Abu-Dhabi, in conjunction with five other emirates to form the United Arab Emirates. Dubai and Abu-Dhabi ensured in the negotiations that between them they could control the country effectively, enabling even greater expansion as seen today. In 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates, in introducing the UAE dirham, the uniform currency of the UAE.\nDubai and Abu Dhabi between them now hold the majority of control in the UAE, which was part of their conditions for joining.  To enable this, Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the only emirates who have veto power over matters of national importance, whereas the other emirates only have a vote on such matters.  In addition to this, Dubai is represented by eight members on the Federal National Council, of whom there are forty in total.  Dubai and Ras al Khaimah are the only two states who retain their own judicial courts, whilst the others are part of the federal justice system of the UAE.\nThe Jebel Ali Free Zone was introduced in 1979, providing companies with unrestricted import of labour and export of capital, which helped to jumpstart the influx of global companies seen today.\n\n\n=== 1990 - present day ===\n\nThe death of Sheikh Rashid al-Maktoum resulted in the accession of Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum to the throne. The Persian Gulf War of 1990, in which Dubai as part of the UAE provided military aid to the coalition, unsettled the economy; however, in the mid-1990s this stabilised and many foreign trading communities moved their businesses to Dubai. Dubai continued to foster political alignment with the western world and during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, they provided refueling bases to allied forces in the Jebel Ali Free Zone as they did during the Persian Gulf War.Global increases in oil prices allowed Dubai to focus on rapid development of key infrastructure. The success of the Jebel Ali free zone caused the development of clusters of new free zones, including Dubai Internet City, an internet technology area with ownership and tax related benefits, Dubai Media City, a tax-free zone to increase Dubai's presence in the worldwide media, and Dubai Maritime City, which will have many facilities, including waterfronts and harbours. In the past decades, Dubai has become known for its successful building projects, including the Burj Al Arab, the world's tallest freestanding hotel, The Palm Islands, a construction of three artificial islands in the shape of the date palm, on which residential and commercial property will be built and The World Islands, a massive man-made archipelago of 300 islands in the shape of the world, and Burj Khalifa, which is the world's tallest man-made structure. In 2006, upon the death of Sheikh Maktoum al-Maktoum, his brother, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum became Emir, having been de facto ruler for a decade and credited with helping to force Dubai's rapid expansion.The economic depression has hit Dubai extremely hard, due to its dependence on tourism and building which has led to many newspaper reports of construction slowing and in some cases stopping altogether.\nIn an effort to combat the recession, Dubai has announced various tax cutting measures to incentivise businesses in the region.Dubai has also been in the news for its attitudes towards adultery, which are seen as harsh in the Western world, with some cases forcing the intervention of other governments on behalf of their citizens.\n\n\n== Future ==\nDespite the international turmoil over the cost of oil, Dubai is already considered to be the Hong Kong of the Middle East. When the world's oil supply runs out and/or it's no longer needed, Dubai would survive in a new oil-free world unlike Riyadh. Commercial activity in the Dubai region would simply grow instead of wither because Dubai was a major trading center centuries before oil was known to even exist. The emirate's trade access with Iran is similar to Hong Kong's trade with the People's Republic of China due to Iran being ostracized by the majority of the Western world.\n\nDuring the 21st century, Dubai may have to implement policies that move away from globalization and toward localization to conserve their energy resources, provide local jobs to citizens of the United Arab Emirates instead of foreign citizens, and maintain their local decision-making authority. Zoning policies would be adjusted by Dubai's municipal government to promote resource conservation and eliminate sprawl.While Dubai has opened its doors to tourists by permitting non-Muslims to drink alcoholic beverages and view erotica, a lot of these services are being used by the foreign-born workers who take jobs away from legal residents of the UAE.The last remaining oil deposits in the United Arab Emirates will run out at the end of 2029. Even when there is no more oil in the UAE, their federal government will make 90% of the income that they earned in 2013 by virtue of milking the tourism industry to the fullest. As of February 2006, Dubai (along with the rest of the United Arab Emirates) only has a reserve supply of 44 billion barrels of crude petroleum. If used properly and in conjunction with alternate fuels, the reserve fuels that will keep economy activity afloat in Dubai will last until the end of the 21st century.\n\n\n== Disputes ==\nIn addition to the long running dispute between Abu-Dhabi and Dubai, Dubai was also involved in a dispute with Sharjah with regards to their legal boundaries.\nBefore the British left, there were no exact boundaries defined between the Trucial States; however, with the discovery of oil needing boundaries to be decided for concession reasons, Britain was required to define the boundaries. After Julian Walker, a British official (later the British political agent) had surveyed the area, Mr. Tripp, the British political agent, made declarations between 1956 and 1957 defining the boundaries. Although the rulers of both Dubai and Sharjah had agreed in 1954 to accept the rulings made, Dubai's ruler declined to accept the decision. Even after the formation of the UAE, neither state had agreed on the boundaries and hence, on 30 November 1976 they signed an arbitration compromise under the auspices of the Supreme Council of the Federation.  Eventually, the Supreme Council ruled that the decisions were administrative, binding decisions as opposed to arbitral awards, the Tripp boundaries were defined as the border.\n\n\n== Rulers of Dubai ==\n\nThe following is a list of rulers of Dubai, Al-Maktoum dynasty, going back at least to 1833.\n... - 9 June 1833 Sheikh `Ubayd ibn Said\n9 June 1833 - 1852 Sheikh Maktoum I bin Bati ibn Suhayl (d. 1852)\n1852 - 1859 Sheikh Said I ibn Bati (d. 1859)\n1859 - 22 November 1886 Sheikh Hushur ibn Maktoum (d. 1886)\n22 November 1886 - 7 April 1894 Sheikh Rashid I bin Maktoum (d. 1894)\n7 April 1894 - 16 February 1906 Sheikh Maktoum II bin Hushur (b. 18.. - d. 1906)\n16 February 1906 - November 1912 Sheikh Bati bin Suhayl (b. 1851 - d. 1912)\nNovember 1912 - 15 April 1929 Sheikh Saeed II bin Maktum (1st time) (b. 1878 - d. 1958)\n15 April 1929 - 18 April 1929 Sheikh Mani bin Rashid\n18 April 1929 - September 1958 Sheikh Saeed II bin Maktum (2nd time)\nSeptember 1958 - 7 October 1990 Sheikh Rashid II ibn Said Al Maktoum (b. 1912 - d. 1990)\n7 October 1990 \u2013 4 January 2006 Sheikh Maktoum III bin Rashid Al Maktoum (b. 1943 - d. 2006)\n4 January 2006\u2013Present Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (b. 1949)The current ruler of Dubai is Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.

Having attended school in the United Kingdom, he became part of the everyday running of the country.  He has two wives, Sheikha Hind bint Maktoum bin Juma Al Maktoum and Princess Haya bint Al Hussein, the daughter of the King of Jordan. He is widely known for being involved with horse-racing and his charitable donations, along with his credit for advancing Dubai's infrastructure and economy.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nTimeline of Dubai\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSugiarti, Deby (21 October 2014). \"Dubai Guide\".

On comparison I\u2019d say the same as most dry ski slopes if not higher. Takes a few minutes to ski down. They have chairlift, tow and travelator style",

          "Ski Dubai is a real icon. For a good skier it\u2019s not really a place to ski but to hang out with friends and have a good time - perfect. I recommend being your own boots and gear if you have. The skis are not great but OK. The lift is slow and the decent is fast so you dont get",
          "We got the slope premium experience. Thoroughly enjoyable experience overall. The slope is excellent (for an indoor slope, don't go here if you're expecting the the Swiss alps!) roughly 40 seconds run top to bottom at medium fast pace. Good chairlift and two surface lifts. The",
          "Awesome family day out. I having seen snow for 20yrs and was like a kid in a sweet shop. It really is real snow - not like some indoor places I have read reviews of , this is the real deal. Loads for little kids to do and a slide etc for tjem. The staff were all helpful and the",
          "1st time In my life time i have seen an Indoor ski track. Skiing is actually and outdoor sport but here it Dubai they have made it possible in Indoor",
          "I went when a friend was visiting from the States as she was adamant about skiing while in the desert. I didn\u2019t have high hopes but was delightfully surprised! The runs were nice and the snow was pretty good all things considered. Definitely dress warmly, while they give you",
          "We loved every minute of our day there ! We took the snow premium package and took part in the discovery ski lesson and penguin encounter. Everything was so well run and facilities all excellent . Dinner at north 28 was delicious too",
          "I have a home in Vail Colorado so it is hard to compare...no one goes to Dubai to ski but this is a nice departure from other types of activity but it is a lot of effort to get suited up and it really isn't very good skiing...photo ops yes..downhill skiing adventure..no. But it",
          "If you have not tried already this is mandatory when visiting Dubai. For experienced skiers it\u2019s very small and two hours is well enough but it\u2019s fun and something you have to \u201ctick off\u201d",
          "Nice runs, takes about 30sec moving at a moderate speed to ski down from the top. So theres so many times you can keep going back up before getting a bit bored. I will recommend booking to do the other activites that way you will get more of a variety and keeps you entertained.",
          "For those who can\u2019t afford a full trip to snow clad regions, you can try this ski dubai which gives a glimpse of the experience!! The venue has decent number of snow adventure activities apart from skiing!! There is also a penguin show that lasts for 10 mins or so. We visited",
          "I was excited but unfortunately, the Nepali's coach was not professional. We did ask before buying the tickets if the coach will be close to us but we were 5 beginners, that's not happened. He did not concentrate with all of us and he was not encouraging. The worst coach ever.",
          "SkiDubai is a cool inddor ski park, but it is quite small. Only two runs really, 1 4 person chairlift and 1 t-bar lift. Unfortunately both of the lifts broke down several times each while I was there. When everything was running it was good. The snow quality was good and not too",
          "This is one of the must visit places in Dubai where you'll live an experience of skiing in the middle of Arabian desert where temperature is raising to 50 deg Celsius in summer and inside Ski Dubai, it will be around /5 deg. You'll find almost all skiing activities available",
          "I thought it's a small snow ramp! But it's shockingly big inside! Hooked to it since a year \ud83d\ude0e I totally recommend it",
          "This is one of the must visit places in Dubai and not just for the kids but also for grownups this place has probably the highest indoor chairlift in the world and one of the steepest indoor downhill skating , tickets are pricey at 300 dirhams approximately but well worth it",
          "Our long time pending visit to Ski Dubai could happened during this long holidays of Eid festival. Ski Dubai is a good place...team is very good and cooperative. Gloves, jacket, trouser etc. provided by them were also in good condition and also clean....food we had to get from",

          "If you are not from a country which experience snow falling, I recommend to try visiting ski dubai once to try snow cold feeling, some activities can be done inside as well and you can enjoy the cable cars. The price is relatively higher try to search for good offers.",
          "We had alot of fun but only really need about an hour if you're not skiing. I recommend wearing warm clothes underneath the hire gear and bring your own snow gloves. Also wear two thick pairs of socks or thermal socks as the hire boots don't keep you warm. The rides were very",
          "Amazing time... hour ski lesson... went in the zorb and on the rings and the chairlift ...Definitely a place to visit when you're in Dubai",

          "We really enjoyed this trip. Both my children loved the slides, sledding, snowball fights and playing in general. I thought it would be overrated but my two 5&7 loved every second. My elderly father especially had fun and really appreciated the ice sculptures. We all had a fun",
          "Maybe we were being snobs but we felt like it wouldn't be worth the price to ski inside since we have ski some great pow pow around the world. On the other hand, if you haven't skied much or don't have mountains full of snow nearby then why not experience it here. They have",
          "Yet another great place to visit while in Dubai, something for all ages our group ranged from 8 to 45 and we all enjoyed. The slope is good for 2 hours of skiing / boarding fun. The zorbs & tobogganing is great for all the family. Half our group did the Penguin visit and they",
          "We've visited the ski Dubai first time and really enjoyed it! The meetings with penguins unforgetful experiences.",
          "Great outing to keep the kids busy. The slope is more than 200m long. There are activities appropriate for all ages. Drop them off at the slopes and go shopping. Or join them. All ages are welcome. Definitely a must do if you visit Dubai.",
          "Very cool and nice to have, especially considering it is indoors in the middle of the desert. There is one big slope looping around to the right so it isn't of course going to the Swiss Alps but amazing to go and enjoy as an activity. They have a penguin show as well.",
          "We were not interested in actually skiing, nor did we have the time, but we were at the Mall of the Emirates and took the time to walk to the other end to see this attraction. Fascinating what they have accomplished! Take the time to stop and see how the Emirate's entertain",
          "Just as much fun as skiing outside. It was well below zero and felt like the real deal. Great experience. Great value. Make sure you take gloves because they are not part of the clothing they give you.",
          "A very unique experience that's easy and fun. Visit the mall for some shopping and then hop on the slopes for a couple of hours fun (or more). You can ski or do penguins with the kids or both!",
          "If not for the pain inducing cold, this place would be super fun. The major problem with indoor ski is that there's no sun to warm you up.. you gotta keep moving to enjoy it. The penguins are fun though..",
          "We enjoyed the day to the max. Remember to wear an extra layer of warm clothing and buy the thicker gloves (leather ones) if you are a first timer at ski Dubai. The fleece gloves that are included in the ticket price are not enough at all as they get wet in first contact with",

          "I got the premium package which includes all activities, penguin encounter and even a ski lesson. *lunch or dinner inclusive* for 500Aed and with entertainer app, you get 1 for 1. It\u2019s definitely worth it. You can easily spend the whole day there. The penguin interaction was the",
          "We were the only ones there when we went so it was great and quiet. All equipment is available to hire including socks etc which was good as we were definitely not prepared for the cold weather. Great to have a chairlift in there but they were definitely overly cautious when it",
          "We went to Ski Dubai and had a lot of fun. It is amazing how they manage to maintain such a low temperature area inside a mall. All the rides were nice and safe for people of all the age groups. You can enjoy sleighing, snow, slides, chairlift ride and much more. My favourite",
          "We selected one of the many Ski Dubai experience packages for our sons 8th birthday. Obviously unable to invite the whole class we hosted 6 boys (2 our own) to a full day adventure at Ski Dubai, Mall of the Emirates. The boys did several activities - lunch, penguins, playtime",
          "When in Dubai can\u2019t miss this and should not miss Ski Dubai experience. Wen you are near to this place it\u2019s hard to believe that how human mind can create wonders. It\u2019s a wonder and when in, it looks even more amazing. Every ride , every slide is full of fun and chilling. In ski",
          "As someone who ski's a lot this was a fun way for a couple of hours. The experience is once is a lifetime. I can now say I skied when it was 100 degrees outside. The skiing for an experienced skier is easy. If you want more runs use the tow rope. The chairlift is fun but is a",
          "I am a 'seasoned' skier. I am used to and comfortable with double diamond black runs in Colorado and have skied at a number of renowned resorts elsewhere. You might think a puny indoor run like in Dubai would have no appeal to me. Yeah - that's what I thought but my wife",

          "I don't know how to ski but I love to explore and experienced different things.So I recommend to you guys that visiting ski Dubai is a very nice experienced. To try something new and be safe at the same time. Why travel far and wait for winter when the winter is here,in Dubai.",
          "I went with my best friend to ski dubai last sept 208 to celebrate our birthday together. It was my first time to have a snow experience so we really had so much fun trying out all the activities such as the Bobsled, Tubing Run, Snow Bumpers, Climbing Wall, Snow Plough",

          "Ever since I learned about Ski Dubai, it was a bucket list goal. So excited I checked it off the list! It was everything I hoped it would be and more! I had no idea there were so many fun things to do there. I bought the premium package which was the equivalent to $142 USD and",
          "After alot of thought over packages, we took the one with penguin encounter. I must say it was \"cherry on the cake.\" The employees are so well trained and friendly. Encounter with the penguins was an unforgettable and unique experience. I don't think I will ever get so close to",

          "What a wonderful experience. Lots of rides the giant ball was amazing. the staff is very courteous and humble. Always wear warm clothing if you are going to ski dubai take along warm gloves if you wanna save some money. It\u2019s a must spot to visit specially if you have teenagers",
          "Great way to have fun and escape the heat from outside. A huge freezer with tons of fun (and snow) inside!",
          "Premium package gave us access to majority of the facilities. It was the best way to cool down. The rides were so much fun and safe and we even got to say hi to some penguins who loved playing about. Loved the experience!",

          "In the middle of the dessert someone had this crazy idea of Dubai ski. It is really amazing how huge is the ski area. You can do ski,snowboard and many other activities for all ages. It\u2019s a very pleasant place to chill out during a hot day! Unique experience",
          "Okay so I kept hearing you can\u2019t take pictures with the penguins so like law abiding people, we locked our phones up in the lockers provided. Well we regretted that decision. As soon as we were done with the penguin encounter we noticed they were having a penguin lesson/show as",
          "it's worthwhile experience for anyone old, young, resident, tourist, think Ski resort is the last thing you'll expect to see in desert, but there it is. The entrance fee comes with all the winter skiing clothes and gear you need . Temperature inside Ski Dubai is 0 degree. It is",
          "A place to have memorable experience. You won\u2019t even realize you are in a country which has temperature around 40-50degrees. This adventure park has lots to offer. Five slopes of varying difficulty, even if you are beginner there are lessons you can take at additional charge.",
          "Going from a tour in the desert to snowboarding indoors. It\u2019s crazy to think it can happen in the same place! We started with a snow classic pass after entering we decided we would really enjoy ourselves more using the slopes as we have snowboarded before. You need to have some",
          "This was once in a lifetime experience for me we came all the way from Saudi Arabia and we werent disappointed at all. Penguin mr Dee (filipino instructor) and mr geene (filipino instructor) both made it extra special as they were so fun and passionate about what they do. So",

          "If you normally ski in a normal mountain resort don\u2019t bother losing your time to visit ski Dubai. The slop is done too fast (literally 20s straight from top to bottom) and not Technical. The mechanics are too slow as well. However if you are new to skiing then this is a good",
          "We hadn't skied for a long time so we each paid Dh 190 +25 (for gloves) + 25 (deposit) each for a 1 hr \"discovery experience for adults\". Less than half of this was skiing, the rest explanations of technique and equipment. I doubt we went up the baby slope more than 6 times",
          "This is our second time visiting Ski Dubai and it was great fun. The only issue we had was with the photographers. They rush taking our family pictures that when we were ready to purchase the pictures we realized that most of them were terrible ( hands covering faces etc) not",

          "We went to Ski Dubai for the novelty. We decided to do the snow pass rather than the skiing, which was probably a mistake. The skiing actually looked pretty fun, but the snow activities were definitely targeted to a 10-and-under crowd. We did really enjoy the free penguin",

          "We wanted to ski and see the penguins. We splurged and did the premier package and it was worth every penny (about $70us more than if we did skiing and penguins a la carte). This gave unlimited access to everything. My son hasn\u2019t skied in a while and decided to go in. We instead",
          "Fantastic day out. Bit pricey, but use the entertainer for deals. Meeting the penguins is a must, they\u2019re just fabulous getting to stroke and hug them. Out for n the slopes there\u2019s plenty to do, from toboggan runs, to zip lines & zorbing, so you don\u2019t have to be an expert skier.",
          "This is very family friendly. With things for the very young to those who like a bit more of a challenge.",
          "We visited with a friend that is unable to ski, but still had a blast with all the other experiences they are offering.",
          "If you have some extra time it is worth a visit here. It is really cool to be at an indoor ski slope. The staff was great too.",
          "Having bought a go city card we found ourselves queuing for a while as the staff weren\u2019t sure to begin with. We had all the snow activities away from the ski slope included and we paid extra \u00a312 for the penguin experience. The positive was that you could spend as long as you",

          "We live in Colorado and ended up here on a whim...it was oddlyour first time skiing together (not first time skiing each ever). The mountain/run is very small in comparison to what we are used to, but it is easy but gets boring quickly. But gets you out of the heat.",
          "The Mall itself is a sight to see and is huge, this is where the skiing is housed. It is truly unusual. As with most things in UAE it is not cheap. If you have the disposable dollars then have a go, it is a bit of fun. You can see enough from the outside - so just send the kids",
          "SkinDubai was awesome! We spent the better half of our morning there. I got the snow plus tickets for my fianc\u00e9 and i which included access to the snow bullet, zorb ball, tubes and snow bumpers. We were able to do all of those activities multiple times, all were very fun! I",

          "Lovely place, good experience except for the rudeness of others. Well equipped and well planned but busy to enter and the queues can be daunting.. Once inside it is quite magical ( we went in December) & the christmas decor was lovely.",

          "My son learned to ski there. Great place to practice before you hit the slopes. Best to go in the morning during the week, and avoid weekends as it gets really busy. The lifts are super slow as they are shared with the people visiting the snow park, who get a ride to the top",
          "What a great time we had. 2hrs of zipping down the indoor slopes. A great surprise as advanced skiers thought this would be boring. How wrong can you be. Fun without the hard work of trudging up the slopes. Expensive but worth it.",
          "Want to ski in the desert? Then head here. They have a little of everything at ski Dubai and you can rent your ski-wear also so it's pretty self contained. It's rather expensive for just a few beginner runs that you can be over with in less than a minute. But they do have",

          "Ski Dubai was such a great asset to our Family vacation we had soooo much fun inside this attraction it was a first time experience for my family to see live penguins to the point my husband artist BK \u201cI am Art\u201d Adams didn\u2019t want to leave the facility and if this site allowed",
          "Snow premium package was worth every penny. We were lucky enough to have the Entertainer app for a buy one get one offer and remaining we did on the residence discount as just snow classic, which still allowed us to enjoy 90% of what those on premium got. Premium had full park",

          "Come on, how often can you ski in the dessert on snow? Its a really nice ski dome, with a black piste also. You can walk inside with your swimshort and slippers, they have the rest for you that you can ski. Only you need to buy your own gloves.",
          "you have to buy cap gloves from here separately. they will give you uniform and shoes which you need to return back once you finish. the rides are good fun inside but its really very cold",
          "We had to try this during our visit to Dubai. We arrived at about 10.00 and although there were lots of people in the foyer, the slopes were really quite quiet. You have to bring your own gloves and put on an extra layer, the ski clothing they provide does not have the thermal",

          "Coming from Alaska we couldn't pass up an opportunity to downhill ski in the desert. We thought the price was very reasonable, around $57/each, which included all equipment plus ski pants, coat, and helmet. I don't think they'll be holding the World Cups there, but the runs were",

          "Average park with pretty middling service. Rides were largely mediocre. Kung Fu Panda and the Dragon Fliers were good but the rest left you wondering slightly when the ride was going to kick into gear. Wait times were fine. Luckily we got the tickets free with our hotel as I",
          "This parks is clearly trying every way to cut costs. At the entrance booth it stayed that all attractions were opened. But once inside we realised that many rides were only opened from either 12:30pm or 1pm while the park opens at 11am. Waiting time is not accurate by far. Many",
          "This is a very nice park, with plenty of attractions for every ages, including for young children. I enjoyed the visit with my 13y old daughter.",
          "Visiting the parks in Dec is best time. The weather is cool to cold which will allow everyone walk and explore the parks more. Restaurants, fast food, Cafe and food truck were very good. The parks were clean and neat. Areas of improvements in my point of view : Q-fast price",

          "We bought the entertainer and got the double park feature. We went to legoland and motiongate and I\u2019m not really sure if it was because it was so early in December but both parks were so empty. I personally think that legoland is a bit anticlimactic. There\u2019s no amazing rides or",

          "Absolutely woeful customer care. We were denied entry following purchase of TripAdvisor tickets (won\u2019t ever do that again) and needed to purchase another 3 tickets. Nobody interested in resolving the issue. Park has a few good rides for older children but generally caters more",
          "Fun rides...keeps the children thoroughly entertained. However, find ways to avoid long queues. Even the restaurants have long queues. Next time we plan to go, we will shortlist the rides that we MUST do, go early as soon as it opens and finish these rides before we do anything",

          "I went with my 1yr old daughter who was riding the stroller and I love the modern facilities because it made my visit easier. The offered entertainment and atmosphere of the theme park is, without a doubt, world class. but to me, its kind of limited. The characters is not",

          "I went here with afew friends on a week day in Dec 2019. Overall the park is more catered for families. There are some 3 or 4 rides that are for the thrill seekers but most are for the kids. The Park has different areas such as DreamWorks and Columbia Pictures and each area",
          "My family loves theme parks so when we were in Dubai we visited Motiongate. Its full of amazing rides and attractions and I would definitely want to go back again. My 3 favourite rides were the bullet train in the hunger games, the flying ride in how to train your dragon and the",

          "The park is awesome! There are enough thrilling rides for the dare devils and a few for the not so brave. This is easily my youngest daughters favorite thing to do in Dubai. The park is clean and new and the staff are all friendly. Queues are usually short which also means that",
          "We got free tickets for this theme park via emirates. It was great, for anyone who has been to Disney it was like a mini Disneyland. The Main Street you walked down was cute, the rides were fab & waiting times weren\u2019t too bad. Also some attractions are inside with air con which",
          "Visited park with 5 and a 9 years old. They said this was the best day of their life. We had Q-fast pass which was really helpful as we were able to get to rides in 5 minutes which would have taken 30-40 minutes otherwise",

          "This was a good park for all ages. We got our tickets included with our hotel stay. Parks were really quiet,but I have read reviews that says they queued up for hrs. We were there tues,wed and we also went in at night on thursday when it was the holiday there. It maybe gets",
          "We didn't enjoy Motiongate, the park was nearly empty, no characters available the whole day for meet and greet, they should really learn from Warner Bros Abu Dhabi that besides being quiet, it is always full of characters and shows around. The price was expensive for what you",

          "I did my son\u2019s 7th birthday at King Julien\u2019s Cafe in Motiongate Dubai and the result was even better than my expectations! Even though they have many processes to approve anything you want to do or bring go the party, they are fast getting the approvals and all the staff was",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the visit. I was hesitant if my three and half year kid will enjoy this or not. But there were multiple rides he could enjoy. Though he missed few due couple of cm, but still it was worth it. DreamWorks section was really good. Kungfu panda, Madagascar,",
          "Fantastic experience. Whether you travel with kids or adults it is such an amazing thrill. If you love Dreamworks and other hollywood delights, this is a must experience for you. We visited during halloween and in the night, right before closing at around 7:30 they had a walking",

          "We went on a Monday and it wasn't too crowded. although we went quite early (around midday by the time we got there). I had pre-purchased tickets and we had no issues getting them scanned at the main entrance. Bulky bags are searched by security at the entrance. The place is",
          "We were fortunate to be offered complimentary tickets to this park with Emirates (be sure to ask when booking your trip). The taxi from our hotel was 15 minutes and we were dropped off at what we thought was the entrance. I didnt consider the time and the heat at 2pm so when",
          "Absolutely amazing place, took my 4 year old, and he was just tall enough for the 105cm rides, and we went on lots. We accidentally ran into a zombie while looking for the toilets, and the zombie had the state of mind to turn and go in the other direction as my son is so little.",

          "Overall the park is good, the Dreamworks section is all indoors which is great for young kids getting out of the sun. Its been designed really well and this is apparent when you start to walk through the queuing sections for rides, room for lots of people, but its like the park",
          "It\u2019s a great day out, queues aren\u2019t huge so you\u2019ll get to experience lots of rides. Many of them are indoors so you can enjoy them even in the heat of mid day. It\u2019s a great place to pick up some little souvenirs, too.",

          "The problem with this place is that if you have visited Florida and the parks there, this was always going to be a poor imitation. It is a fair way out(about a \u00a320 taxi from the Palm) and spookily quiet when you get there(quite apt as it was Halloween!) The place is very well",
          "Was great for both children 10 years old and 5 years old as plenty for both to go on, queues were minimal apart from a couple of the rides. The only disappointment were a few rides were closed, so had to keep going back and checking if they were open. But all in all a good",

          "We visited Motiongate today (28.10.19) with our two children aged 8 & 10. Firstly with it being half term we expected a lot of people and queues but were pleasantly surprised to find quite the opposite. However we were so disappointed to find a lot of the rides & attractions",
          "It is a nice place for the families to stay for full day. The only thing i hated in this park is from the entrance to the outside rides are not shaded and you know how summer in Dubai feels like. Overall, still gona visit again and again",

          "We have been a annual pass holder for a number of years now and the kids still absolutely love going. As adults there are enough rides so that it\u2019s enjoyable. The mix between inside and outside is great for the warmer months. Definitely worth a visit or two!",

          "As with everything in Dubai, this is well made and the staff are very friendly and helpful. There isn't that much to do in reality and its all based on fun rides, some of which can be quite challenging even though they are designed for children, especially the Magadascar ride.",
          "I was worried after I booked as it looked like it was just for small children but... my 14 and 21 year olds loved it! There was literally no one else there so we didn\u2019t have to queue for any rides and there were some great rides!! I recommend getting the digital photo picture",
          "We enjoyed this theme park so much! We had a 2 year old with us and there were many rides that he could get on which was awesome! The rides were great and we had tons of fun. Park wasn't crowded when we there, which was nice. Some of the rides that are toddler-friendly include",

          "We were always reluctant to visit Dubai Parks and Resorts for some obvious reasons like we being parents of two toddlers (age factor matters a lot in such parks) and the timing of these parks. So we had passes for the park and we had to choose which park would be appropriate for",

          "We were on vacation two weeks ago and it is by far the best of all the parks we have visited. Clean facilities, impeccable bathrooms and super attentive and very friendly staff. I will recommend it for sure! The decoration is the best and the praline smoothies. We had a great",

          "I went for a day to Motiongate Dubai Park. The whole place seemed a bit abandoned, with very few visitors. Some restaurants seem to be closed down. The good points for me are: wifi access, air conditioned areas and some wild nice rides like Madagascar. There were hardly any",
          "A large theme park with lots indoor attraction so therefore air conditioned. some excellent rides, roller coasters, food was good and all the staff were excellent. The rides are all themed on films and were excellent. There are other parks here and a multi park ticket is best",
          "Great park especially Dreamworks. We visited here with our daughter who was 1 years old, she did enjoy herself but next time we will visit when she is older as she wasn't aware of many character etc. Lovely place to visit.",
          "So there are 4 Parks but we only did three Legoland, Legoland Water Park and Motiongate it was fun I suppose you could rush and do it all in one day but my suggestion would be to plan for atleast 2 days because Legoland itself is about is not big but if you include the water",
          "Annual pass guest here as Motiongate is our favorite theme park. As always, even in hot weather we enjoyed our time at the park. However, it is our first time to buy some popcorn in one of the store on the walkside of park. It was a total dissapointment! Too bad, our children",

          "My husband and I visited Motiongate, probably the best park on offer. Plenty of fast rides for the thrill seekers. And enough for the not so brave to do. Some nice rides for smaller children. You can meet and greet your favourite characters. All in all a good afternoon out, for",

          "The park is very good. I came with my daughter around 4pm. Most of the attractions are inside. We came on weekday, so there were less queue, which is good. Unfortunately, we couldn't try all the attractions. At one moment felt myself like a child \ud83d\ude05. I recommend it!",

It's worth to visit and if you want to visit the whole motiongate be sure to come early \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09",
          "Arguably, its the best destination within DP&R. Why I am saying this, because it's for all ages, variety and quality of the games, very funny and more. The only issue is the distance to the gate, you need shuttle to reach there, and you didn't catch the free one then you need to",

          "Motiongate is an amazing destination for families and friends, with a variety of rides and activities to do. It is a lot similar to Disneyland in the style of its rides and attractions. In my opinion it is the best theme park in Dubai, We had a lot of fun that day!",

          "If you're thinking which park you should spend most of your time - this is where it should be. From babies - Smurf's Village, Toddlers - Shrek Journey, Kung-Fu Panda, Teens and Adults - Madagascar, Lion's Gate, Green Hornets - everyone will enjoy this park. This park is a",
          "We have enjoyed a lot at Motiongate. We have visited for 6 hours but still we have missed to see a lot. We enjoyed the different theme parks and adventures. In weekend expect long queue for some of the attractions.",
          "We got our tickets free with our Emirates trip. We decided to give it a go. Would I regret it? Not a chance! This place was absolutely amazing. We went slightly later at night to save ourselves the queues, because we\u2019ve been to Disney World in Florida 3 times and believe me,",
          "Went to motion gate at 5 pm and left at 10:30. We were a family of adults and younglings from 2 yr to 8 yr olds. The kids who wete 100cm above had a blast while the 2 yr old had no ride apart from the merry go round. Motion gate opens in the morning and stays open till 11 pm.",
          "I intended to visit it for my kids but I enjoyed it myself, a friend told us to book the annual ticket to use it more than twice... We went 4 days in a row.",
          "We visited the park for two days one after the other. The place is amazing. My son loves the rides and there were no queues so we went on them over and over again. The bullet train and Madagascar ride and river rapids were our favourites. If you can ignore the constant people",
          "We got free tickets through our Emirates holiday package so thought we would use them to get out of the sun for the afternoon. Quite a good little theme park, reminded me slightly of Disney world Hollywood studios on a much smaller scale. We still managed to spend a good 5",
          "My favourite thing about this park and most others in Dubai is that during October the queues tend to be non existent so you get to enjoy lots of fun in a short period of time. A mix of indoor and outdoor attractions, unlike Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi (which is fab too!). Would",
          "Had the best day out with my husband and 3 kids (ages 6 & 9). We went just before school holidays in Dubai mid week and practically had the park to ourselves! We didn\u2019t have to wait for a single ride, the park was spotless, staff were helpful and food was surprisingly affordable",
          "Just back from a good day at Motiongate. Not very busy which always helps. Visited with my wife, 9yo and 2yo. Bit of a trek from taxi drop off to entrance but nice walk. All the area's were really well done and no expense spared in the set up. As my daughter says \"what do u",
          "We went here purely as we had free tickets, it was bizarre we wandered in an opening time 2pm and found we had virtually the entire place to ourselves we headed straight to Hunger Games to get the outside part done first and went straight into the rollercoaster we were the only",
          "Just visited motions gate Dubai with two kids aged 8 and ten. We all had a ball. The attention to detail in this park is unreal and the huge Dreamworks area is inside airconditioned. The rides that were the best for us were madagascar coaster which is really fast the dreamworks",
          "Excellent park, service, interior and exterior, every little detail was very thought of , one of the best park in Dubai, if not the best. Very well done to the management, excellent and keep it up. Show less",
          "A great place for young kids. They will love the encounters with their favourite cartoon characters. Also the games and rides are very suitable for younger children while there are still some other rides the need some courage! I very much enjoyed a great Hotel Transylvania car",
          "For some reason we had low expectations of the Park but the kids had an amazing time specially because the weather was quite pleasant both times we went. It's not the most lively place maybe it felt that way because we went on weekdays but not having to wait to get on the rides",
          "Super enjoy... Really... ONE DAY is Not enough to take all the rides.. We have missed a lot of games because we came late.. Till next time.. And more promo to comes.. THANK YOU SO MUCH MOTIONGATE",
          "Great park, we spent most the time in the Dreamworks area as it was indoors. It was so quiet, no que\u2019s at all!! We wondered if we had come in the wrong day. The dragon glider ride was amazing! The only downfall is, the taxi rank is so far away, we were dripping in sweat by the",
          "Its my 3rd time visiting this wonderful park but had a chance to visit again on Summer season on Promotional entry. Its Friday and theres a long queue 40-meters from turnstile gate for bag check. No shaded patio provided for waiting guest and when we reached the turnstile,",
          "Took about 1.5 hours to get to park. Took metro from Financial centre station to UAE Exchange station and a short taxi ride (33-40 Dhm). Mostly indoor rides so it is ok to go in summer after 3-4pm. There are lots eateries too.",
          "Lego addicts will kill me, but this park became my favorite among Dubai Parks and Resorts. The others were not any worse though. So many things to do and see, such a nice atmosphere. The feeling that you are in a fairy-tale does not leave you even after exiting the park. For",
          "We have visited the park in April with my family and friends.We have enjoyed a lot roller coasters were amazing. 3D 4D shows wear best.I recommend all of u who goes to riverland Dubai must visit the park and the Riverland itself is also beautiful.Hats off to the people who made",
          "Wonderful experience with my 5, 6, 13 and 15 year old children. Something for everyone. Rides for all ages.",
          "We had a fantastic time here. There were plenty of rides to keep you entertained whether you are visiting with young children or thrill seekers. The Step Up show is worth a visit and definitely head over to DreamWorks, it is truly amazing. All staff are helpful and engaged",
          "We usually visit dubai parks every single months and really all of us can\u2019t feel that we get bored coz every visit is different than the other one:) highly recommend",
          "It was so quiet, straight on rides over and over again. Rides are really good a mix for everyone. It was on a par with USA parks",
          "We paid for the annual passes to give us unlimited access to both Motiongate and Legoland as we enjoyed them both so much on our last visit! This is my favourite theme park with loads to do, some great rides such as 'Dragon Gliders' 'Capitol Bullet Train' and 'Mad Pursuit'. We",
          "If only theme parks could be like this in the UK. Virtually no wait times, zero queues, air-con everywhere, free lockers and being Ramadan means respecting no snacks \u2018til after dusk. Another lovely day here at Motiongate Dubai Parks on our second visit.",
          "My daughter and family thoroughly enjoyed the rides here. The roller coasters, especially bullet train and mad pursuit was excellent. Kids have some excellent rides too. Would definitely want to visit the park again.",
          "One of my favorite theme park so far.! Location it\u2019s accessible easily by a own vehicle or els a taxi also they have a shuttle service from Batuta mall I guess.! If you\u2019re a traveler who travels by public transportation like me I suggest to use the Dubai metro till last metro",
          "My wife and my self went to this awesome place not expecting too much, but we were in for a huge surprise. This placed had everything and I still can\u2019t believe all the fun we had. Ticket price it little bit expensive and you have very limited options with regard to eating. But",
          "We had a great time At Motiongate Our grandchildren enjoyed the rides although some they were not tall enough for. It was quiet so no long queues for us to wait in. Also some very good rides for adults to go on too. We could see the rollercoaster from our balcony and at night",
          "This is a great theme park for fans of movies, ranging from the family favourites of Dreamworks Animation and Shrek to Blockbusters of Hunger Games and Ghostbusters to the pure terror of Zombieland! The park was never too busy and the staff are some of the friebdlist I have",
          "its an amazing theme park that enhances and attracts movie lovers as the rides are based on different characters. it also offers restaurants and snacks. very fun and suitable for family and friends however not suitable for kids under 10 years old",
          "Motiongate is a wonderful theme park which caters to all ages. It is a fun way to spend the day with the family. We went on a Friday, and the longest we had to wait was 20 minutes for a ride. Dreamworks, Columbia and Lionsgate are the major studios being represented and they",
          "Motiongate is an wonderful theme park. I found it to be a multifaceted park, with something present there for all age groups. Madagascar Mad Pursuit roller-coaster was a truly astonishing experience and is a must for adrenaline junkies.",
          "Our family went to motiongate and had a amazing time . The rides where amazing and didn\u2019t have to wait longer than 30 minutes for a ride due to how quiet the park was . It was great for all ages . The food was amazing but I would eat outside the park because of all the",
          "I booked Mg and bollywood parks same day.But due to lot of yearly pass holders my line at every ride went after 30 min.The Main gate opens at 12 Pm,ends at 10 Pm. So overall you have 8 hours+2 hrs to have lunch and dinner. So make a plan and enjoy the trip!!",
          "We did Legoland and MG in one day. For older kids,MG is better. On a sat after 5pm, the queue for the \"fun\" rides were all 30min waits. After a full day, we just couldnt do it. Amazing to see. Kids loves what they saw and could do. I would go back again. Smurfs village was so",
          "We enjoyed ourselves at this theme park especially in the afternoon when it was really hot outside. Nice play area for the kids. Wish there was more for younger kids to do especially in dreamworks area as we are big fans",
          "We have chosen to go to Motion-gate as we have visited Lego Land previously. This was a great choice as both my 4 year old daughter as 10 year old son could enjoy the experience. The smurf village is the best place for kids. Recommend to start with Indoor park during the noon",
          "We stayed over at the Lapita with access to all parks including Motiongate - only thing we enjoyed at MG was the 4D Kung Fu Panda ride which was a short 3D movie with some water splashed as you embarked the journey with Panda \ud83d\udc3c. We loved it so much we rode twice as there was no",
          "This is part of the dubai parks, one of 5. Madagascar ride is the one to do, little wait time on all the rides. Loads to do and fun characters for the kids",
          "We came to motiongate for the day. It was empty! Straight on every ride lots of times! Ok it doesn\u2019t have the scariest rides, but the sets and Main Street rival Disney and the staff as super friendly. The roller coasters are similar scare factor to Disney. Hot but not too",
          "Motiongate Was fantastic, suitable for all ages as there is plenty of kids rides and bigger ones for teens and adults, it really is so much fun and we went back a few times as we enjoyed it so much",
          "Other than that a somewhat hefty entrance fee, everything else is perfect. The place is huge which is better to come early to find time for it. There are many choices of food and cafes to enjoy before entering the theme park.",
          "Visited on a Sunday in April and it was deserted, which meant zero queues for the rides. Good selection of rides, with Madagascar, green hornet and the hunger games the best thrill rides. Spent 5 hours there and did everything. Good day out if a little over priced (look out for",
          "Motiongate Dubai is perfect for families with small children. Decent wait time. We are definitely going back when our son gets a little bigger for him to try all the other rides.",
          "We had a great time like always. Our experience was great. The kids enjoyed and shopped till they dropped. The weather was great too. It was nice that it wasn't that busy although it was a Friday. The staff were extra helpful and friendly. Can't wait to come back. One",
          "Much smaller in reality than expected. Some areas very few rides to enjoy. Going early and during a weekday advised as to skip ques and be able to enjoy rides more than once. Favourites both adults and kids: Train your Dragon and Kung Fu Panda. Zombie land not for the faint",
          "Getting to the park just before it opened really helped as we were able to go on the popular rides without waiting in a queue. The Mad Pursuit roller coaster ride was our favourite, followed by the water ride Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs. Thrill seekers will enjoy the",
          "We went to Motiongate on the 7th of April. This was my second time. However, last time we stayed in Lapita Hotel and visited Motiongate & Lego parks whereas this time we decided to visit this park alone (being the best option for the younger kids). I took my 3 kids and this time",
          "Thanks to all the staff who assisted us today for VIP tour especially Anna, Mai and George! They are very accommodating and helpful! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "My kids are helping me right this review! They gave it five stars and called it awesome! Each line has a queue time before you get in it. The lines were pretty quick. One was 45 minutes which we didn\u2019t attempt to line up for because of this. There were lots of characters walking",
          "Amazing facilities for kids and families. Great environment, plenty of shops and different ages activities.",
          "Visited the park on Friday and it was way below expectations. First bad experience started at the gate. They offered us a package of AED 280 ($75) per person including food. When we got inside there were limited food options and its only one option plus soft drink. Dont buy",
          "Wish we spent more time here, we were there for 5 hours and we did not see all of it. The theming in the park is great, there are lots of photo opportunities with characters etc. the rides are a lot more thrilling, and there are a lot more rides little ones (3 year old) can go",
          "Enjoyed a magical kingdom where you can play with #Ghostbusters #zombieland ,explore exotic #smurfvillage, #underworld , meet fairy-tale #shrek, funny #kungfupanda , #madagaskar and rocket through the stars!",
          "If in Dubai, this theme park is a must visit. From 4d adventures to roller coaster rides this theme park is a heaven for adventure lovers. Columbia pictures is a must visit at Motion gate.",
          "We were family 3 kids and really enjoyed all the rides at Motiongate Park. The best time to visit the park within week days not the weekend to avoid crowed time waiting in rides queue.",
          "Well worth a visit great for all ages. Well laid out plenty of rides, shops and eating places. Obviously not on the same scale as Disney but well worth. A visit.",
          "I had heard about Dubai Parks and Resorts and Motiongate from friends and radio ads, but only got around to visiting it now. I was absolutely blown away by how beautiful and well made it is. They really need to share more content online to promote themselves other than just by",
          "There\u2019s always a reason to celebrate and last 08 March 2019, Dubai Parks and Resorts have given limited passes to their four theme parks. And as fanatic of movies, my friends and I chose MotionGate as our park for this special day. It was indeed a good and memorable one as most",
          "Great theme park. There's something for everyone. make sure you have enough time to spend without a rush. Food is ridiculously expensive but everything else is enjoyable.",
          "Lots to do for wide ranges. Went when no queues. Age4-8catered for well. Loved the Hollywood dance to finish the day so well done. Most rollercoaster open and great fun. Don't forget your sun cream. Got discount to go but enjoyed immensely. We all laughed and laughed.",
          "I visited Motiongate - Dubai with my friends, we all enjoyed a lot. All the games are great attractions. Wonderful theme park !!",
          "i visited motiongate along with my wife and 6 year old daughter. and we were so happy that we visited as its a day full of fun. few highlights travel its about 1 hour from dubai depending upon where you stay. its outside dubai city on the way towards abu dhabi and is pretty",
          "This park has a lot to offer, but very little for children under 6. The theme park is worth the tour if one has childrrn over 7 years to be able to enjoy the rides and get value for money. Unfortunately food is not allowed at the gates. Food is damn expensive inside the park.",
          "The park was ok and can see how older children would enjoy it. However it is over priced for what it is. I would much rather recommend you do global village instead and is much cheaper and much better. Also a lot of the drink/snack stands were not open or ready to serve at 1pm",
          "We are from the UK. We have visited Disneyland Paris, Disney Florida, Busch Gardens and Universal Studios Florida. We were staying in Dubai for the week and we were talked into going to here by our teenager. Our kids are 15 and 12. We went with low expectations and we were",
          "Best part is that we managed to go on so many rides whether once or twice without waiting so long for a queue. The children had fun and so did I, especially on the Dragon Ride in Dream Works. I would visit motion gate again in the future for other theme parks, and hope this",
          "We came there after Legoland as we bought tickets 1 day 2 parks. We spent there 2,5 h. Few attractions we have missed as kids were too small (5y and 8y) or they had tried similar in Legoland. Most of all we liked 4D movie with Panda.",
          "This theme park is about 20- 30 minutes from main area Dubai . 10 minute walk from the taxi drop off and lots of coffee shops on the way if needed. Entry was about \u00a350 for the day. Park is split into zones with varying rides for all. It\u2019s a good day out and I just have 2",
          "Arriving back from an overnight desert tour the night before we were still checking into our hotel at 10.30am we then quickly grabbed a few things and we were off to Motiongate in a cab from a City Walk area in central Dubai. The cab cost us 114AED which we thought was fair",
          "After reading the reviews I was a little sceptical about the queues, got here and you could tell by the car park it was empty. We waited no longer than 30 mins and that was for the 4D rides which stayed 10 mins wait time. The rollercoasters were only a 5 min wait, and it was",
          "This is the Hollywood park part of Dubai Parks and Resorts. Visiting this park will probably take most of your day so if you have 2 park pass then its better to spend atleast 75% of the time here.. the good thing about the park is that it has rides for all ages.. so if you have",
          "Great rides for toddlers - Shrek, Madagascar etc and older kids and adults. Visited Friday lunchtime and not too busy and had a great day out. Staff team were very helpful .... just watch out gift shops at the end of every ride are hard for small kids to resist ;)",
          "I visited Dubai Parks with my family and all enjoyed it .. many games and attractions even we didn't have time to visit legoland, planning to visit it later .",
          "What a wonderful day! In our party there were 3 over 30 year olds and a 7 year old and we all enjoyed it here. It was spotless, the staff were wonderful and no queues! We went in Feb on a weekend but it was very quiet and we literally stayed here until the park closed. It was a",
          "We enjoyed our day here at Motiongate . be aware there is a lot of outside walking from the enterance to the park and that could very uncomfortable in the summer time . The park only really has a couple of good coasters one being the Mack rides bullet train and the other being",
          "I went with my 2 daughters and granddaughters. About 40 min from dubai center it was easy to reach with free parking on site. Ee took the valentine day package and the added fast pass made the rides extremely easy. You can use the fastpass time after time and there is no delay.",
          "Wow! Imagine a works class theme park with hardly any crowds. While I am amazed to see such small crowds flock to this place, I am glad as it means I can enjoy all these great rides with my family without a long waiting line. Consider a 5 min wait for these rides versus 45 mins",
          "This Park is part of a whole Area with mort other parks. Legoland is there, and inside Motiongate, there are Bollywood, Hollywood, Deramworks and one other. Inside Dreamworks, there are again different themes, one of which is Madagascar. Inside Madagascar, there is Mad Pursuit.",
          "We took a taxi to Motiongate after buying tickets online. Note the park does not open til noon. We managed to walk on to all the rides apart from one where there was a 10 minute queue. Fun day at a reasonable cost. Then took a walk (5-10 minutes) over to the outlet village.",
          "We had our tickets prebooked online and had no issues in the entry. There were no queues for any of the rides, and we enjoyed our favourite rides multiple times. Some of the sections like Madagascar were not open to visit which was disappointing. Overall there were some great",
          "We just love this theme park. There was so much to do for younger kids or people who just don't like rollercoasters. We have enjoyed this park much more than IMG Worlds.",
          "The last time I was in Dubai we went to IMG. This time we decided to try motion gate , and it was really awesome both for Adults and kids. I highly recommend it .",
          "This gave us unforgettable experience especially the Zombieland Blast Off/Madagascar Mad Pursuit/The Green Hornet. I know that there are numerous rides to try but I recommend not to miss those 3.",
          "We didn't really have a good experience here sadly. Queues for everything. Over an hour's queue just to get an entrance ticket - we should have pre-purchased online! The ride queues are phenomenal - almost two hours for some. Their predicted wait times are absolutely false. We",
          "Visited at end of December - very few queues and lots to do for my 6 year old. She loved it! Good rides and most of it inside so not too hot. 'Kung fu panda' and 'cloudy with meatballs' our favourite rides. Worth a visit.",
          "We were in Dubai for two weeks and I wish we knew about Motiongate sooner! We opted for a season\u2019s pass for the four days we went it was a great option. Everything is so clean, so much attention was given to detail with each themed section of the park. My three and a half year",
          "Great park. Contains a couple of great games, especially the bullet train. For children less than 100 cm tall will not be able to play most of the games.",
          "At first we thought this was meant to be for smaller children, however there are some great rides for older kids. The Hunger Games ride and the Madagascar Circus ones were our favorites. They also have a great how to train a dragon ride which we really enjoyed. Tip: There is a",
          "We went with 2 couples, a 3 year old and a 4 year old and everyone had fun. You need to queue for some rides and some other rides are deserted. Try and convert your ticket to an annual pass after your ticket. It only costs a small fee!",
          "This one is really great for families, if you have a long layover, do try this. We love Shrek, Madagascar, Hiw to train your Dragon etc, and just met them all :) It\u2019s got rides for every age group and you will definitely enjoy if you love these flicks.",
          "Unlike studio owned parks like Disney or Universal studios, Motiongate park is independent and so it has the advantage of combining attractions from multiple studios into one park. The park has several zones each dedicated to a studio. To beat the searing Dubai heat, some of the",
          "First time we have visited the park 2 years ago when it was just opened for just a couple of weeks. They opened it way too early, many rides were still under construction, and the park itself looked unfinished. Now it is all finished, it has nice look to it and it has few rides",
          "This place is awesome. It's a whole day of fun guaranteed for both kids and grownups. There are all kinds of rides, from plain to adrenalin rides. The craziest are madagascar and bullet train. It's a must try when you are there. To avoid crowd the best time to go it's on a",
          "I visited Motiongate last month after the excellent reviews. We arrived there at around 1pm, and because we booked online, we did not have to wait at the ticket section. The theme park itself is extremely impressive. At first i thought $65 dollars per person was expensive, but",
          "place is nice,well planned and good fun for family.especially for the kids. definitely go with my kids.awesome.walking distance to Bollywood park,legoland and many more activities",
          "This theme park is great fun and we all loved it. We arrived for opening at 11am with our 8 and 10 year old on a Friday. We didn\u2019t queue at all for the rides until about 3 in the afternoon which was brilliant. If you do find a queue then the waiting is indoors and air",
          "It was amazing time there with the kids ... everyone enjoyed it ... It is like US park standard and even better and cleaner... The prices if the ticket is convenient to be honest but i don\u2019t liked the parking cost 100/150 AED The rides are good and nice .. just need to do",
          "A nice and lovely amusement park filled with rides for kids, teens and adults. lovely Rollercoasters and simulation amazing pictures can be taken. Tourist must visit prices range 140 upto 249 dhs",

          "The rides are great and the park is well organized. Compared to my previous visit from 2017, now all attractions were opened. There are enough attractions to keep you busy all day with a 9 years old child. Even in December there was no more then 15-20 minutes waiting time for",
          "Motion gate itself wasn\u2019t a bIg theme park, you may be able to cover an additional park if you plan your day early. We managed to cover both motiongate and also Legoland. Having said that, provided you don\u2019t go for every single rides but it was good enough for my family of 4",
          "A wonderful attraction with alot of activities and shops , fun place for both adult & children . As for DreamWorks hall , It was a place that would make you wish to be child again and to relive every film you have seen . Try to go when the weather is beautiful because alot of",
          "This has got to be the easiest and most comfortable theme park I have been to. Free wifi and the dreamworks section is airconditioned. Best to go winter time so you will enjoy fair temperature. For thrill riders, ride the Madagascar ride and the bullet train in the Lionsgate",
          "We stayed at the Lapita so this we got all the tickets for our stay. Motiongate is amazing, what a job they have done with it, you would never guess you were in Dubai. Rollercoasters - Hunger Games, Madagascar, Zombie Land, Green Hornet and the Water coaster are amazing.",
          "we visited on morning saturday in december with pleasant whether and inside environment was electrified and thrilled. There are more than 25 rides including bullet train, z ball , many shows for children, and other games in different camps names like dinosaur, dream worlds",
          "15 km outside Dubai, direction Abu Dabi, you will find 4 attraction parks around 3 villages. The entry fee is per park but each park offers more than sufficiently to spend a full day (11am - evening) with the family. Depending on the age you select the park. For 8-14 years",
          "We went late morning with our 14yo and 12 yo. The park was nearly empty before noon. We did purchase a fast pass upgrade, and even though the lines were minimal, we felt it was totally worth the additional price. We often went straight to the front of the line and our children",
          "Really enjoyed this resort and glad we visited. Lots to do and plenty of shade to sit and rest. Plenty of rides and shops. Great day out",

          "Visited with family and found it HOT! park catered well for heat in terms of shade and volume of indoor rides but I was disappointed that only soft drinks were offered in refillable cups - water really should be offered as an option. Probably not a park for extreme theme park",

          "I think people are a little harsh about this park it obviously doesn\u2019t compare to well established American parks like universal but it does have excellent themed rides that are similar. We went during the week and it was absolutely deserted meaning we had to queue for a maximum",

          "Supercool park based on Hollywood movies/ themes, with lot of indoor rides and events. Though not very well connected to the main city, there are shuttle buses from various parts of Dubai, which can be availed if planned properly. Restaurants are also very good inside the park",
          "First off, I found it very weird that the park was empty. Literally no one around and we were walking straight onto rides. This comes with both positives (that being walk on) and negatives, with the atmosphere lacking, most of the stalls and eateries closed too because of this",
          "It's safe to say that the park is definitely underrated for what it is, however I would say that the price for a ticket is very high compared to some actual theme parks. The price for one ticket is for one small section of the park whereas if the price was for access to all",

          "Best place to spend time with family. Only go if you love awesome rides and characters such as shrek, kung fu panda, hunger games, madagascar. Check height of your kin as only 85 cm is allowed to seat in heavy rides. Other rides are also there for little one.",
          "Its bigger than you think. Best to go at night since most people leave then and lines are non existent. Good 5-6 hours to spend with family and friends. It helps if you have some sort of discount going into it.",

          "A great place for the family but you should go on winter cuz Dubai's summer weather does not suit out door activities",
          "Should not go whenever big offers are going on. It is just waste of time. Will have to wait atleast 1hr per ride, else opt qpass which is 150dhs per person.\nCannot depend on rta bus since bus will be full most of the time if there are offers.",

          "Average park! Approximately 50%of the rides were closed and is 2019! Massively understaffed and whoever works at the ride is not properly trained. It seems to be a lack in communication as the rides attendees are unaware of why some rides are working but cannot be used. The indoors DreamWorks park was the best. Will not visit again!",

          "Nice park but if you want Qfast lane, you almost need to double price of your ticket and Qfast is the only option to avoid waiting 30 to 45 min per  play. At $120 per child who can afford that ? Quite a ripoff",

          "Love it! Second visit and the best part of Dubai park to visit during summer. Most rides are indoors and the kids didn't wanna leave. We went to Legoland land first and they all wished we had come here first  so we had more time to explore. Even my 3yr old loved it but my 6 yr old was scared. So it's dicey with kids.",

        "wiki": "Dubai ( doo-BY; Arabic: \u062f\u0628\u064a\u200e, romanized: Dubayy [d\u028a\u02c8bajj], Gulf Arabic pronunciation: [d\u0259\u02c8baj]) is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai.Located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf, Dubai aims to be the business hub of Western Asia. It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo. Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a major mercantile hub. Today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue comes from oil. A centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. According to government data, the population of Dubai is estimated at around 3.38 million as of January 2020.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nMany theories have been proposed as to origin of the word \"Dubai\". One theory suggests the word was used to be the souq, which was similar to the souq in Ba.  An Arabic proverb says \"Daba Dubai\" (Arabic: \u062f\u0628\u0627 \u062f\u0628\u064a\u200e), meaning \"They came with a lot of money.\" According to Fedel Handhal, a scholar on the UAE's history and culture, the word Dubai may have come from the word daba (Arabic: \u062f\u0628\u0627\u200e) (a past tense derivative of yadub (Arabic: \u064a\u062f\u0628\u200e), which means \"to creep\"), referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland. The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word, but to its alternative meaning of \"baby locust\" (Arabic: \u062c\u0631\u0627\u062f\u200e) due to the abundant nature of locusts in the area before settlement.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of human settlement in the area now defined by the United Arab Emirates is rich and complex, and points to extensive trading links between the civilisations of the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia, but also as far afield as the Levant. Archaeological finds in the emirate of Dubai, particularly at Al-Ashoosh, Al Sufouh and the notably rich trove from Saruq Al Hadid show settlement through the Ubaid and Hafit periods, the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods and the three Iron Ages in the UAE. The area was known to the Sumerians as Magan, and was a source for metallic goods, notably copper and bronze.The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland, becoming part of the city's present coastline. Pre-Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th centuries. Prior to the introduction of Islam to the area, the people in this region worshiped Bajir (or Bajar). After the spread of Islam in the region, the Umayyad Caliph of the eastern Islamic world invaded south-east Arabia and drove out the Sassanians. Excavations by the Dubai Museum in the region of Al-Jumayra (Jumeirah) found several artefacts from the Umayyad period.An early mention of Dubai is in 1095 in the Book of Geography by the Andalusian-Arab geographer Abu Abdullah al-Bakri. The Venetian pearl merchant Gasparo Balbi visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai (Dibei) for its pearling industry.\n\n\n=== Establishment of modern Dubai ===\nDubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century and was, by 1822, a town of some 700\u2013800 members of the Bani Yas tribe and subject to the rule of Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi.In 1833, following tribal feuding, members of the Al Bu Falasah tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves in Dubai. The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by Obeid bin Saeed and Maktoum bin Butti, who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836, leaving Maktum to establish the Maktoum dynasty.Dubai signed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 along with other Trucial States, following the British punitive expedition against Ras Al Khaimah of 1819, which also led to the bombardment of the coastal communities of the Persian Gulf. This led to the 1853 Perpetual Maritime Truce. Dubai also \u2013 like its neighbours on the Trucial Coast \u2013 entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the United Kingdom took responsibility for the emirate's security in 1892.\n\nIn 1841, a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality, forcing residents to relocate east to Deira. In 1896, fire broke out in Dubai, a disastrous occurrence in a town where many family homes were still constructed from barasti \u2013 palm fronds. The conflagration consumed half the houses of Bur Dubai, while the district of Deira was said to have been totally destroyed. The following year, more fires broke out. A female slave was caught in the act of starting one such blaze and was subsequently put to death.\n\nIn 1901, Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum established Dubai as a free port with no taxation on imports or exports and also gave merchants parcels of land and guarantees of protection and tolerance. These policies saw a movement of merchants not only directly from Lingeh, but also those who had settled in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah (which had historical links with Lingeh through the Al Qawasim tribe) to Dubai. An indicator of the growing importance of the port of Dubai can be gained from the movements of the steamer of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, which from 1899 to 1901 paid five visits annually to Dubai. In 1902 the company's vessels made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on, the steamers called fortnightly \u2013 in 1906, trading seventy thousand tonnes of cargo. The frequency of these vessels only helped to accelerate Dubai's role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference. Lorimer notes the transfer from Lingeh 'bids fair to become complete and permanent', and also that the town had by 1906 supplanted Lingeh as the chief entrep\u00f4t of the Trucial States.The 'great storm' of 1908 struck the pearling boats of Dubai and the coastal emirates towards the end of the pearling season that year, resulting in the loss of a dozen boats and over 100 men. The disaster was a major setback for Dubai, with many families losing their breadwinner and merchants facing financial ruin. These losses came at a time when the tribes of the interior were also experiencing poverty. In a letter to the Sultan of Muscat in 1911, Butti laments, 'Misery and poverty are raging among them, with the result that they are struggling, looting and killing among themselves.'\n\n\n=== Pre-oil Dubai ===\nDubai's geographical proximity to Iran made it an important trade location. The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen, chiefly those from Iran, many of whom eventually settled in the town. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was an important port. At that time, Dubai consisted of the town of Dubai and the nearby village of Jumeirah, a collection of some 45 areesh (palm leaf) huts. Dubai was known for its pearl exports until the 1930s; the pearl trade was damaged irreparably by the 1929 Great Depression and the innovation of cultured pearls. With the collapse of the pearling industry, Dubai fell into a deep depression and many residents lived in poverty or migrated to other parts of the Persian Gulf.In the early days since its inception, Dubai was constantly at odds with Abu Dhabi. In 1947, a border dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on the northern sector of their mutual border escalated into war. Arbitration by the British resulted in a cessation of hostilities.\n\nDespite a lack of oil, Dubai's ruler from 1958, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, used revenue from trading activities to build infrastructure. Private companies were established to build and operate infrastructure, including electricity, telephone services and both the ports and airport operators. An airport of sorts (a runway built on salt flats) was established in Dubai in the 1950s and, in 1959, the emirate's first hotel, the Airlines Hotel, was constructed. This was followed by the Ambassador and Carlton Hotels in 1968.Sheikh Rashid commissioned John Harris from Halcrow, a British architecture firm, to create the city's first master plan in 1959. Harris imagined a Dubai that would rise from the historic center on Dubai Creek, with an extensive road system, organised zones, and a town center, all of which could feasibly be built with the limited financial resources at the time.1959 saw the establishment of Dubai's first telephone company, 51% owned by IAL (International Aeradio Ltd) and 49% by Sheikh Rashid and local businessmen and in 1961 both the electricity company and telephone company had rolled out operational networks. The water company (Sheikh Rashid was Chairman and majority shareholder) constructed a pipeline from wells at Awir and a series of storage tanks and, by 1968, Dubai had a reliable supply of piped water.On 7 April 1961, the Dubai-based MV Dara, a five thousand ton British flagged vessel that plied the route between Basra (Iraq), Kuwait and Bombay (India), was caught in unusually high winds off Dubai. Early the next morning in heavy seas off Umm al-Quwain, an explosion tore out the second class cabins and started fires. The captain gave the order to abandon ship but two lifeboats capsized and a second explosion occurred. A flotilla of small boats from Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman and Umm al-Quwain picked up survivors, but 238 of the 819 persons on board were lost in the disaster.Construction of Dubai's first airport was started on the Northern edge of the town in 1959 and the terminal building opened for business in September 1960. The airport was initially serviced by Gulf Aviation (flying Dakotas, Herons and Viscounts) but Iran Air commenced services to Shiraz in 1961.In 1962 the British Political Agent noted that \"Many new houses and blocks of offices and flats are being built... the Ruler is determined, against advice [from the British] to press on with the construction of a jet airport... More and more European and Arab firms are opening up and the future looks bright.\"In 1962, with expenditure on infrastructure projects already approaching levels some thought imprudent, Sheikh Rashid approached his brother in law, the Ruler of Qatar, for a loan to build the first bridge crossing Dubai's creek. This crossing was finished in May 1963 and was paid for by a toll levied on the crossing from the Dubai side of the creek to the Deira side.BOAC was originally reluctant to start regular flights between Bombay and Dubai, fearing a lack of demand for seats. However, by the time the asphalt runway of Dubai Airport was constructed in 1965, opening Dubai to both regional and long haul traffic, a number of foreign airlines were competing for landing rights. In 1970 a new airport terminal building was constructed which included Dubai's first duty-free shops.Throughout the 1960s Dubai was the centre of a lively gold trade, with 1968 imports of gold at some \u00a356 million. This gold was, in the vast majority, re-exported - mainly to customers who took delivery in international waters off India. The import of gold to India had been banned and so the trade was characterised as smuggling, although Dubai's merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.In 1966, more gold was shipped from London to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (Only France and Switzerland took more), at 4 million ounces. Dubai also took delivery of over $15 million-worth of watches and over 5 million ounces of silver. The 1967 price of gold was $35 an ounce but its market price in India was $68 an ounce \u2013 a healthy markup. Estimates at the time put the volume of gold imports from Dubai to India at something like 75% of the total market.\n\n\n=== Oil era ===\n\nAfter years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring Abu Dhabi, oil was eventually discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966, albeit in far smaller quantities. The first field was named 'Fateh' or 'good fortune'. This led to an acceleration of Sheikh Rashid's infrastructure development plans and a construction boom that brought a massive influx of foreign workers, mainly Asians and Middle easterners. Between 1968 and 1975 the city's population grew by over 300%.As part of the infrastructure for pumping and transporting oil from the Fateh field, located offshore of the Jebel Ali area of Dubai, two 500,000 gallon storage tanks were built, known locally as 'Kazzans', by welding them together on the beach and then digging them out and floating them to drop onto the seabed at the Fateh field. These were constructed by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company, which gave the beach its local name (Chicago Beach), which was transferred to the Chicago Beach Hotel, which was demolished and replaced by the Jumeirah Beach Hotel in the late 1990s. The Kazzans were an innovative oil storage solution which meant super-tankers could moor offshore even in bad weather and avoided the need to pipe oil onshore from Fateh, which is some 60 miles out to sea.Dubai had already embarked on a period of infrastructural development and expansion. Oil revenue, flowing from 1969 onwards supported a period of growth with Sheikh Rashid embarking on a policy of building infrastructure and a diversified trading economy before the emirate's limited reserves were depleted. Oil accounted for 24% of GDP in 1990, but had reduced to 7% of GDP by 2004.Critically, one of the first major projects Sheikh Rashid embarked upon when oil revenue started to flow was the construction of Port Rashid, a deep water free port constructed by British company Halcrow. Originally intended to be a four-berth port, it was extended to sixteen berths as construction was ongoing. The project was an outstanding success, with shipping queuing to access the new facilities. The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972, although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built. Port Rashid was to be further expanded in 1975 to add a further 35 berths before the larger port of Jebel Ali was constructed.Port Rashid was the first of a swath of projects designed to create a modern trading infrastructure, including roads, bridges, schools and hospitals.\n\n\n=== Reaching the UAE's Act of Union ===\n\nDubai and the other 'Trucial States' had long been a British protectorate where the British government took care of foreign policy and defence, as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Gulf, the result of a treaty signed in 1892, the 'Exclusive Agreement'. This was to change with PM Harold Wilson's announcement, on 16 January 1968, that all British troops were to be withdrawn from 'East of Aden'. The decision was to pitch the coastal emirates, together with Qatar and Bahrain, into fevered negotiations to fill the political vacuum that the British withdrawal would leave behind.The principle of union was first agreed between the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and Sheikh Rashid of Dubai on 18 February 1968 meeting in an encampment at Argoub Al Sedirah, near Al Semeih, a desert stop between the two emirates. The two agreed to work towards bringing the other emirates, including Qatar and Bahrain, into the union. Over the next two years, negotiations and meetings of the rulers followed -often stormy- as a form of union was thrashed out. The nine-state union was never to recover from the October 1969 meeting where heavy-handed British intervention resulted in a walk-out by Qatar and Ras Al Khaimah. Bahrain and Qatar dropped out of talks, leaving six of the seven 'trucial' emirates to agree on union on 18 July 1971.On 2 December 1971, Dubai, together with Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Quwain and Fujairah joined in the Act of Union to form the United Arab Emirates. The seventh emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the UAE on 10 February 1972, following Iran's annexation of the RAK-claimed Tunbs islands.In 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency: the UAE dirham. In that same year, the prior monetary union with Qatar was dissolved and the UAE Dirham was introduced throughout the Emirates.\n\n\n=== Modern Dubai ===\n\nDuring the 1970s, Dubai continued to grow from revenues generated from oil and trade, even as the city saw an influx of immigrants fleeing the Lebanese civil war. Border disputes between the emirates continued even after the formation of the UAE; it was only in 1979 that a formal compromise was reached that ended disagreements. The Jebel Ali port, a deep-water port that allowed larger ships to dock, was established in 1979. The port was not initially a success, so Sheikh Mohammed established the JAFZA (Jebel Ali Free Zone) around the port in 1985 to provide foreign companies unrestricted import of labour and export capital. Dubai airport and the aviation industry also continued to grow.\nThe Gulf War of 1990 had a negative financial effect on the city, as depositors withdrew their money and traders withdrew their trade, but subsequently, the city recovered in a changing political climate and thrived. Later in the 1990s, many foreign trading communities\u2014first from Kuwait, during the Gulf War, and later from Bahrain, during the Shia unrest\u2014moved their businesses to Dubai. Dubai provided refuelling bases to allied forces at the Jebel Ali Free Zone during the Gulf War, and again during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Large increases in oil prices after the Gulf War encouraged Dubai to continue to focus on free trade and tourism.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nDubai is situated on the Persian Gulf coast of the United Arab Emirates and is roughly at sea level (16 m or 52 ft above). The emirate of Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi in the south, Sharjah in the northeast, and the Sultanate of Oman in the southeast. Hatta, a minor exclave of the emirate, is surrounded on three sides by Oman and by the emirates of Ajman (in the west) and Ras Al Khaimah (in the north). The Persian Gulf borders the western coast of the emirate. Dubai is positioned at 25.2697\u00b0N 55.3095\u00b0E\ufeff / 25.2697; 55.3095 and covers an area of 1,588 sq mi (4,110 km2), which represents a significant expansion beyond its initial 1,500 sq mi (3,900 km2) designation due to land reclamation from the sea.Dubai lies directly within the Arabian Desert. However, the topography of Dubai is significantly different from that of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai's landscape is highlighted by sandy desert patterns, while gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country. The sand consists mostly of crushed shell and coral and is fine, clean and white. East of the city, the salt-crusted coastal plains, known as sabkha, give way to a north\u2013south running line of dunes. Farther east, the dunes grow larger and are tinged red with iron oxide.The flat sandy desert gives way to the Western Hajar Mountains, which run alongside Dubai's border with Oman at Hatta. The Western Hajar chain has an arid, jagged and shattered landscape, whose mountains rise to about 1,300 metres (4,265 feet) in some places. Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases; however, Dubai does have a natural inlet, Dubai Creek, which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through. Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes, which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains. A vast sea of sand dunes covers much of southern Dubai and eventually leads into the desert known as The Empty Quarter. Seismically, Dubai is in a very stable zone\u2014the nearest seismic fault line, the Zagros Fault, is 200 kilometres (124 miles) from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai. Experts also predict that the possibility of a tsunami in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami.\n\nThe sandy desert surrounding the city supports wild grasses and occasional date palms. Desert hyacinths grow in the sabkha plains east of the city, while acacia and ghaf trees grow in the flat plains within the proximity of the Western Al Hajar mountains. Several indigenous trees such as the date palm and neem as well as imported trees such as the eucalypts grow in Dubai's natural parks. The houbara bustard, striped hyena, caracal, desert fox, falcon and Arabian oryx are common in Dubai's desert. Dubai is on the migration path between Europe, Asia and Africa, and more than 320 migratory bird species pass through the emirate in spring and autumn. The waters of Dubai are home to more than 300 species of fish, including the hammour. The typical marine life off the Dubai coast includes tropical fish, jellyfish, coral, dugong, dolphins, whales and sharks. Various types of turtles can also be found in the area including the hawksbill turtle and green turtle, which are listed as endangered species.Dubai Creek runs northeast\u2013southwest through the city. The eastern section of the city forms the locality of Deira and is flanked by the emirate of Sharjah in the east and the town of Al Aweer in the south. The Dubai International Airport is located south of Deira, while the Palm Deira is located north of Deira in the Persian Gulf. Much of Dubai's real-estate boom is concentrated to the west of Dubai Creek, on the Jumeirah coastal belt. Port Rashid, Jebel Ali, Burj Al Arab, the Palm Jumeirah and theme-based free-zone clusters such as Business Bay are all located in this section. Dubai is notable for sculpted artificial island complexes including the Palm Islands and The World archipelago.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nDubai has a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh). Summers in Dubai are extremely hot, windy, and humid, with an average high around 41 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) and overnight lows around 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in the hottest month, August. Most days are sunny throughout the year. Winters are comparatively cool with an average high of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) and overnight lows of 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January, the coolest month. Precipitation, however, has been increasing in the last few decades, with accumulated rain reaching 110.7 mm (4.36 in) per year. Dubai summers are also known for the very high humidity level, which can make it very uncomfortable for many with exceptionally high dew points in summer. Heat index values can reach over 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F) at the height of summer. The highest recorded temperature in Dubai is 49.0 \u00b0C (120.2 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nDubai has been ruled by the Al Maktoum family since 1833; the emirate is a constitutional monarchy. Dubai citizens participate in the electoral college to vote representatives to the Federal National Council of the UAE. The ruler, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is also the Vice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and member of the Supreme Council of the Union (SCU). Dubai appoints 8 members in two-term periods to the Federal National Council (FNC) of the UAE, the supreme federal legislative body.The Dubai Municipality (DM) was established by the then-ruler of Dubai, Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, in 1954 for purposes of city planning, citizen services and upkeep of local facilities. DM is chaired by Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum, deputy ruler of Dubai, and comprises several departments such as the Roads Department, Planning and Survey Department, Environment and Public Health Department and Financial Affairs Department. In 2001, Dubai Municipality embarked on an e-Government project with the intention of providing 40 of its city services through its web portal, [dubai.ae]. Thirteen such services were launched by October 2001, while several other services were expected to be operational in the future. Dubai Municipality is also in charge of the city's sanitation and sewage infrastructure.The UAE has a Minister of Happiness, appointed by Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The UAE has also appointed a Minister of Tolerance to promote tolerance as a fundamental value of the UAE, a country filled with a diverse range of faiths and ethnicities, and also a Minister for Youth Affairs.\n\n\n=== Law enforcement ===\nThe Dubai Police Force, founded in 1956 in the locality of Naif, has law enforcement jurisdiction over the emirate. The force is under direct command of Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum.\n\nDubai and Ras al Khaimah are the only emirates that do not conform to the federal judicial system of the United Arab Emirates. The emirate's judicial courts comprise the Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Cassation. The Court of First Instance consists of the Civil Court, which hears all civil claims; the Criminal Court, which hears claims originating from police complaints; and Sharia Court, which is responsible for matters between Muslims. Non-Muslims do not appear before the Sharia Court. The Court of Cassation is the supreme court of the emirate and hears disputes on matters of law only.\n\n\n=== Alcohol laws ===\nAlcohol sale and consumption, though legal, is tightly regulated. Adult non-Muslims are allowed to consume alcohol in licensed venues, typically within hotels, or at home with the possession of an alcohol licence. Places other than hotels, clubs, and specially designated areas are typically not permitted to sell alcohol. As in other parts of the world, drinking and driving is illegal, with 21 being the legal drinking age in the Emirate of Dubai.\n\n\n== Human rights ==\n\nCompanies in Dubai have in the past been criticised for human rights violations against labourers. Some of the 250,000 foreign labourers in the city have been alleged to live in conditions described by Human Rights Watch as \"less than humane\". The mistreatment of foreign workers was a subject of the difficult-to-make documentary, Slaves in Dubai (2009). The Dubai government has denied labour injustices and stated that the watchdog's (Human Rights Watch) accusations were 'misguided'. The filmmaker explained in interviews how it was necessary to go undercover to avoid discovery by the authorities, who impose high fines on reporters attempting to document human rights abuses, including the conditions of construction workers. Towards the end of March 2006, the government had announced steps to allow construction unions. UAE labour minister Ali al-Kaabi said: \"Labourers will be allowed to form unions.\"Homosexual acts are illegal under UAE law. Freedom of speech in Dubai is limited, with both residents and citizens facing severe sanctions from the government for speaking out against the royal family or local laws and culture. Most of the low paid labourers are victims of human trafficking or forced labour while some women are even trafficked into the growing sex trade in Dubai, a centre of human trafficking and prostitution.Defamation on social media is a punishable offence in Dubai with fines up to half a million dirhams and jail term for up to 2 years. In January 2020, three Sri Lankan expats were fined AED 500,000 each for posting defamatory Facebook posts.\n\n\n== Crime ==\nDubai has one of the world's lowest crime rates, and in 2019 was ranked the seventh-safest city in the world. The Security Industry Regulatory Agency classified the crimes into six categories. These crimes include theft, forced robbery, domestic burglary, fraud, sexual assault and abuse, and criminal damages.As per Gulf News, Dubai Police stated that the crime in Dubai is reduced by fifteen percent during 2017. However, the cases of drugs operation increased by eight percent. Major-General Abdullah Khalifa Al Merri, Commander-in-Chief of Dubai Police, hailed the force which solved 86 percent of criminal cases.The statistics also indicated that murder crimes dropped from 0.5 in 2016 to 0.3 in 2017 for every 100,000 population, while violent and aggressive crimes in the past 5 years went from 2.2 crimes per 100,000 and dropped to 1.2 by the end of 2017, pointed out Al Mansouri. General crimes have decreased since 2013, registering around 0.2 by the end of 2017. Robberies went from 3.8 in 2013 to 2.1 by the end of last year, while kidnapping cases also dropped from 0.2 in 2013 to 0.1 in 2017.\nVehicle thefts in 2013 were 3.8 per 100,000 population and fell to 1.7 in 2017. All the stolen vehicles were also recovered after being smuggled to neighbouring countries, in cooperation with the competent authorities there. According to the US Bureau of Diplomatic Security, petty theft, pickpocketing, scams, and sexual harassment still occur although they are usually not violent and weapons are not involved.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Ethnicity and languages ===\n\nAs of September 2019, the population is 3,331,420 \u2013 an annual increase of 177,020 people which represents a growth rate of 5.64%. The region covers 1,287.5 square kilometres (497.1 sq mi). The population density is 408.18/km2 \u2013 more than eight times that of the entire country. Dubai is the second most expensive city in the region and 20th most expensive city in the world.As of 2013, only about 15% of the population of the emirate was made up of UAE nationals, with the rest comprising expatriates, many of whom either have been in the country for generations or were born in the UAE. Approximately 85% of the expatriate population (and 71% of the emirate's total population) was Asian, chiefly Indian (51%) and Pakistani (16%); other significant Asian groups include Bangladeshis (9%) and Filipinos (3%). There is a sizeable community of Somalis numbering around 30,000, as well as other communities of various nationalities. A quarter of the population (local and foreign) reportedly traces their origins to Iran. In addition, 16% of the population (or 288,000 persons) living in collective labour accommodation were not identified by ethnicity or nationality, but were thought to be primarily Asian. There are over 100,000 British expatriates in Dubai, by far the largest group of Western expatriates in the city. The median age in the emirate was about 27 years. In 2014, there were estimated to be 15.54 births and 1.99 deaths per 1,000 people. There are other Arab nationals, including GCC nationals.Arabic is the national and official language of the United Arab Emirates. The Gulf dialect of Arabic is spoken natively by the Emirati people. English is used as a second language. Other major languages spoken in Dubai due to immigration are Malayalam, Hindi-Urdu (or Hindustani), Gujarati, Persian, Sindhi, Tamil, Punjabi, Pashto, Bengali, Balochi, Tulu, Kannada, Sinhala, Marathi, Telugu, Tagalog and Chinese, in addition to many other languages.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nArticle 7 of the UAE's Provisional Constitution declares Islam the official state religion of the UAE. The government subsidises almost 95% of mosques and employs all Imams; approximately 5% of mosques are entirely private, and several large mosques have large private endowments. All mosques in Dubai are managed by the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department also known as \"Awqaf\" under the Government of Dubai and all Imams are appointed by the Government. The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates provides for freedom of religion. Any person held preaching religious hatred or promoting religious extremism is usually jailed and deported.Dubai has large Christian, Hindu, Sikh, Bah\u00e1'\u00ed, Buddhist and other religious communities residing in the city.Non-Muslim groups can own their own houses of worship, where they can practice their religion freely, by requesting a land grant and permission to build a compound. Groups that do not have their own buildings are allowed to use the facilities of other religious organisations or worship in private homes. Non-Muslim religious groups are also permitted to advertise group functions openly and distribute various religious literature. Catholics are served pastorally by the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia. British preacher Reverend Andrew Thompson claimed that the United Arab Emirates is one of the most tolerant places in the world towards Christians and that it is easier to be a Christian in the UAE than in the UK.\nOn 5 April 2020, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced the building of one of their Temples in Dubai. As part of the announcement, church President Russell M. Nelson said that \u201cThe plan for a temple in Dubai comes in response to their gracious invitation, which we gratefully acknowledge.\u201d\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nOne of the world's fastest growing economies, Dubai's gross domestic product is projected at US$107.1 billion, with a growth rate of 6.1% in 2014. Although a number of core elements of Dubai's trading infrastructure were built on the back of the oil industry, revenues from oil and natural gas account for less than 5% of the emirate's revenues. It is estimated that Dubai produces 50,000 to 70,000 barrels (7,900 to 11,100 m3) of oil a day and substantial quantities of gas from offshore fields. The emirate's share in the UAE's total gas revenues is about 2%. Dubai's oil reserves have diminished significantly and are expected to be exhausted in 20 years. Real estate and construction (22.6%), trade (16%), entrep\u00f4t (15%) and financial services (11%) are the largest contributors to Dubai's economy.Dubai's non-oil foreign trade stood at $362 billion in 2014. Of the overall trade volumes, imports had the biggest share with a value of $230 billion while exports and re-exports to the emirate stood at $31 billion and $101 billion respectively.By 2014, China had emerged as Dubai's largest international trading partner, with a total of $47.7 billion in trade flows, up 29% from 2013. India was second among Dubai's key trading partners with a trade of $29.7 billion, followed by the United States at $22.62 billion. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was Dubai's fourth trading partner globally and first in the GCC and Arab world with a total trade value of $14.2 billion. Trade with Germany in 2014 totalled $12.3, Switzerland and Japan both at $11.72 billion and UK trade totalled $10.9 billion.\n\nHistorically, Dubai and its twin across Dubai Creek, Deira (independent of Dubai City at that time), were important ports of call for Western manufacturers. Most of the new city's banking and financial centres were headquartered in the port area. Dubai maintained its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s. Dubai has a free trade in gold and, until the 1990s, was the hub of a \"brisk smuggling trade\" of gold ingots to India, where gold import was restricted. Dubai's Jebel Ali port, constructed in the 1970s, has the largest man-made harbour in the world and was ranked seventh globally for the volume of container traffic it supports. Dubai is also a hub for service industries such as information technology and finance, with industry-specific free zones throughout the city. Dubai Internet City, combined with Dubai Media City as part of TECOM (Dubai Technology, Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority), is one such enclave, whose members include IT firms such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Google, EMC Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Dell and IBM, and media organisations such as MBC, CNN, BBC, Reuters, Sky News and AP.\n\nThe government's decision to diversify from a trade-based, oil-reliant economy to one that is service- and tourism-oriented made property more valuable, resulting in the property appreciation from 2004 to 2006. A longer-term assessment of Dubai's property market, however, showed depreciation; some properties lost as much as 64% of their value from 2001 to November 2008. The large-scale real estate development projects have led to the construction of some of the tallest skyscrapers and largest projects in the world such as the Emirates Towers, the Burj Khalifa, the Palm Islands and the most expensive hotel, the Burj Al Arab. Dubai's property market experienced a major downturn in 2008 and 2009 as a result of the slowing economic climate. By early 2009, the situation had worsened with the Great Recession taking a heavy toll on property values, construction and employment. This has had a major impact on property investors in the region, some of whom were unable to release funds from investments made in property developments. As of February 2009, Dubai's foreign debt was estimated at approximately $80 billion, although this is a tiny fraction of the sovereign debt worldwide.\n\nThe Dubai Financial Market (DFM) was established in March 2000 as a secondary market for trading securities and bonds, both local and foreign. As of the fourth quarter 2006, its trading volume stood at about 400 billion shares, worth $95 billion in total. The DFM had a market capitalisation of about $87 billion. The other Dubai-based stock exchange is NASDAQ Dubai, which is the international stock exchange in the Middle East. It enables a range of companies, including UAE and regional small and medium-sized enterprises, to trade on an exchange with an international brand name, with access by both regional and international investors.DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Centre) was established in 2002. It's world's fastest-growing free zone and been nominated as \"Global Free Zone of the Year 2016\" by The Financial Times fDi Magazine.\nDubai is also known as the City of Gold because a major part of the economy is based on gold trades, with Dubai's total gold trading volumes in H1 2011 reaching 580 tonnes, with an average price of US$1,455 per troy ounce.A City Mayors survey ranked Dubai 44th among the world's best financial cities in 2007, while another report by City Mayors indicated that Dubai was the world's 27th richest city in 2012, in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). Dubai is also an international financial centre (IFC) and has been ranked 37th within the top 50 global financial cities as surveyed by the MasterCard Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index (2007), and 1st within the Middle East. Since it opened in September 2004, the Dubai IFC has attracted, as a regional hub, leading international firms and set-up the NASDAQ Dubai which lists equity, derivatives, structured products, Islamic bonds (sukuk) and other bonds. The Dubai IFC model is an independent risk-based regulator with a legislative system consistent with English common law.In 2012, the Global City Competitiveness Index by the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Dubai at No. 40 with a total score of 55.9. According to its 2013 research report on the future competitiveness of cities, in 2025, Dubai will have moved up to 23rd place overall in the Index. Indians, followed by Britons and Pakistanis are the top foreign investors in Dubai realty.Dubai has launched several major projects to support its economy and develop different sectors. These include Dubai Fashion 2020, and Dubai Design District, expected to become a home to leading local and international designers. The AED 4 billion first phase of the project will be complete by January 2015.In September 2019, Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum ordered to establish the Higher Committee for Real Estate Planning to study and evaluate future real estate construction projects, in ordered to achieve a balance between supply and demand, which is seen as a move to curb the pace of construction projects following property prices fall.Since the economy of Dubai relies majorly on real estate, transportation and tourism, it was highly exposed to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In April 2020, the American business and financial services company, Moody's Corporation reported that the coronavirus outbreak is likely to pose acute \u201cnegative growth and fiscal implications\u201d in Dubai. It was reported that in order to bolster its finances and overcome the impact of coronavirus on its economy, Dubai was in talks to raise billions of dollars of debt privately, where it was seeking loans of 1 billion dirhams ($272 million) to 2 billion dirhams from each lender. On 6 May, Dubai\u2019s businessman from the hospitality sector, Khalaf Al Habtoor stated that the coronavirus pandemic left the economy and his companies \u201cbleeding\u201d. The owner of seven hotels in the country, including the Waldorf Astoria on the man-made island Palm Jumeirah, Habtoor stated that Dubai\u2019s economy cannot afford to wait for the vaccine, before resuming the major activities.\n\n\n=== Tourism and retail ===\n\nTourism is an important part of the Dubai government's strategy to maintain the flow of foreign cash into the emirate. Dubai's lure for tourists is based mainly on shopping, but also on its possession of other ancient and modern attractions. As of 2018, Dubai is the fourth most-visited city in the world based on the number of international visitors and the fastest growing, increasing by a 10.7% rate. The city hosted 14.9 million overnight visitors in 2016, and is expected to reach 20 million tourists by 2020.\n\nDubai has been called the \"shopping capital of the Middle East\". Dubai alone has more than 70 shopping centres, including the world's largest shopping centre, Dubai Mall. Dubai is also known for the historical souk districts located on either side of its creek. Traditionally, dhows from East Asia, China, Sri Lanka, and India would discharge their cargo and the goods would be bargained over in the souks adjacent to the docks. Dubai Creek played a vital role in sustaining the life of the community in the city and was the resource which originally drove the economic boom in Dubai. As of September 2013, Dubai creek has been proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Many boutiques and jewellery stores are also found in the city. Dubai is also referred to as \"the City of Gold\" as the Gold Souk in Deira houses nearly 250 gold retail shops.\n\nDubai Creek Park in Dubai Creek also plays a vital role in Dubai tourism as it showcase some of the most famous tourist attractions in Dubai such as Dolphinarium, Cable Car, Camel Ride, Horse Carriage and Exotic Birds Shows.Dubai has a wide range of parks like Safa park, Mushrif park, Hamriya park, etc. Each park is uniquely distinct from the other. Mushrif park showcases different houses around the world. A visitor can check out the architectural features of the outside as well as the inside of each house.\nSome of the most popular beaches in Dubai are Umm Suqeim Beach, Al Mamzar Beach Park, JBR Open Beach, Kite Beach, Black Palace Beach and Royal Island Beach Club.\nMastercard's Global Destination Cities Index 2019 found that tourists spend more in Dubai than in any other country. In 2018, the country topped the list for the fourth year in a row with a total spend of $30.82 billion. The average spend per day was found to be $553.In October 2019, Dubai loosened its liquor laws for the first time in history, under which it allowed tourists to purchase alcohol from state-controlled stores. Previously, alcohol was only accessible for the locals with special licences. The crucial policy shift came as the United Arab Emirates witnessed severe economic crisis that led to a drop in alcohol sales by volume in a decade.\n\n\n=== Expo 2020 ===\n\nOn 2 November 2011, four cities had their bids for Expo 2020 already lodged, with Dubai making a last-minute entry. The delegation from the Bureau International des Expositions, which visited Dubai in February 2013 to examine the Emirate's readiness for the largest exposition, was impressed by the infrastructure and the level of national support. In May 2013, Dubai Expo 2020 Master Plan was revealed. Dubai then won the right to host Expo 2020 on 27 November 2013. The event will bring huge economic benefits by generating activities worth billions of dirhams and may create over 270,000 jobs.The main site of Dubai Expo 2020 will be a 438-hectare area (1,083 acres), part of the new Dubai Trade Centre Jebel Ali urban development, located midway between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Moreover, the Expo 2020 also created various social enlistment projects and monetary boons to the city targeting the year 2020, such as initiating the world's largest solar power project.The Dubai Expo 2020 is to take place from 20 October 2020 till 10 April 2021 for 173 days where there are to be 192 country pavilions featuring narratives from every part of the globe, have different thematic districts that would promote learning the wildlife in the forest exhibit to many other experiences.Due to the impact of COVID-19 the organisers of EXPO are seeking to postpone the EXPO by one year to begin in 2021.Dubai is trying to build an inclusive, barrier-free and a disabled-friendly city by the time it hosts Expo 2020. The city has already brought in changes by introducing wheelchair friendly taxis, pavements with slopes and tactile indicators on floor for the visually-impaired at all the metro stations.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nDubai has a rich collection of buildings and structures of various architectural styles. Many modern interpretations of Islamic architecture can be found here, due to a boom in construction and architectural innovation in the Arab World in general, and in Dubai in particular, supported not only by top Arab or international architectural and engineering design firms such as Al Hashemi and Aedas, but also by top firms of New York and Chicago. As a result of this boom, modern Islamic \u2013 and world \u2013 architecture has literally been taken to new levels in skyscraper building design and technology. Dubai now has more completed or topped-out skyscrapers higher than 2\u20443 km (2,200 ft), 1\u20443 km (1,100 ft), or 1\u20444 km (820 ft) than any other city. A culmination point was reached in 2010 with the completion of the Burj Khalifa (Khalifa Tower), now by far the world's tallest building at 829.8 m (2,722 ft). The Burj Khalifa's design is derived from the patterning systems embodied in Islamic architecture, with the triple-lobed footprint of the building based on an abstracted version of the desert flower hymenocallis which is native to the Dubai region.The completion of the Khalifa Tower, following the construction boom that began in the 1980s, accelerated in the 1990s, and took on a rapid pace of construction during the decade of the 2000s, leaves Dubai with the world's tallest skyline as of 4 January 2010. At the top, Burj Khalifa, the world's second highest observatory deck after the Shanghai Tower with an outdoor terrace is one of Dubai's most popular tourist attractions, with over 1.87 million visitors in 2013.\n\n\n==== Burj Al Arab ====\n\nThe Burj Al Arab (Arabic: \u0628\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628, Tower of the Arabs), a luxury hotel, is frequently described as \"the world's only 7-star\", though its management has said it has never made that claim. A Jumeirah Group spokesperson is quoted as saying: \"There's not a lot we can do to stop it. We're not encouraging the use of the term. We've never used it in our advertising.\" The hotel opened in December 1999.\n\n\n==== Burj Khalifa ====\n\nBurj Khalifa, known as the Burj Dubai before its inauguration, is a 828 metres (2,717 ft) high skyscraper in Dubai, and the tallest building in the world. The tower was inspired by the structure of the desert flower Hymenocallis. It was constructed by more than 30 contracting companies around the world with workers of a hundred nationalities. It is an architectural icon. The building opened on 4 January 2010.\n\n\n=== Palm Jumeirah ===\n\nThe Palm Jumeirah is an artificial archipelago, created using land reclamation by Nakheel, a company owned by the Dubai government, and designed and developed by Helman Hurley Charvat Peacock/Architects, Inc. It is one of three planned islands called the Palm Islands which extend into the Persian Gulf. The Palm Jumeirah is the smallest and the original of three Palm Islands, and it is located on the Jumeirah coastal area of Dubai. It was built between 2001 and 2006.\n\n\n=== Dubai Miracle Garden ===\n\nOn 14 February 2013, the Dubai Miracle Garden, a 72,000-metre (236,000-foot) flower garden, opened in Dubailand. It is the world's largest flower garden. The garden displays more than 50 million flowers with more than 70 species of flowering plants. The garden uses retreated waste water from city's municipality and utilises drip irrigation method for watering the plants. During the summer seasons from late May to September when the climate can get extremely hot with an average high of about 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F), the garden stays closed.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nTransport in Dubai is controlled by the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), an agency of the government of Dubai, formed by royal decree in 2005. The public transport network has in the past faced congestion and reliability issues which a large investment programme has addressed, including over AED 70 billion of improvements planned for completion by 2020, when the population of the city is projected to exceed 3.5 million. In 2009, according to Dubai Municipality statistics, there were an estimated 1,021,880 cars in Dubai. In January 2010, the number of Dubai residents who use public transport stood at 6%.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nFive main routes \u2013 E 11 (Sheikh Zayed Road), E 311 (Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road), E 44 (Dubai-Hatta Highway), E 77 (Dubai-Al Habab Road) and E 66 (Oud Metha Road, Dubai-Al Ain Road, or Tahnoun Bin Mohammad Al Nahyan Road) \u2013 run through Dubai, connecting the city to other towns and emirates. Additionally, several important intra-city routes, such as D 89 (Al Maktoum Road/Airport Road), D 85 (Baniyas Road), D 75 (Sheikh Rashid Road), D 73 (Al Dhiyafa Road now named as 2 December street), D 94 (Jumeirah Road) and D 92 (Al Khaleej/Al Wasl Road) connect the various localities in the city. The eastern and western sections of the city are connected by Al Maktoum Bridge, Al Garhoud Bridge, Al Shindagha Tunnel, Business Bay Crossing and Floating Bridge.The Public Bus Transport system in Dubai is run by the RTA. The bus system services 140 routes and transported over 109 million people in 2008. By the end of 2010, there will be 2,100 buses in service across the city. In 2006, the Transport authority announced the construction of 500 air-conditioned (A/C ) Passenger Bus Shelters, and planned for 1,000 more across the emirates in a move to encourage the use of public buses.All taxi services are licensed by the RTA. Dubai licensed taxis are easily identifiable by their cream bodywork colour and varied roof colours identifying the operator. Dubai Taxi Corporation, a division of the RTA, is the largest operator and has taxis with red roofs. There are five private operators: Metro Taxis (orange roofs); Network Taxis (yellow roofs); Cars Taxis (blue roofs); Arabia Taxis (green roofs); and City Taxis (purple roof). In addition, there is a Ladies and Families taxi service (pink roofs) with female drivers, which caters exclusively for women and children. There are more than 3000 taxis operating within the emirate making an average of 192,000 trips every day, carrying about 385,000 persons. In 2009 taxi trips exceeded 70 million trips serving around 140.45 million passengers.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nDubai International Airport (IATA: DXB), the hub for Emirates, serves the city of Dubai and other emirates in the country. The airport is the third-busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic and the world's busiest airport by international passenger traffic. In addition to being an important passenger traffic hub, the airport is the sixth-busiest cargo airport in world, handling 2.37 million tons of cargo in 2014. Emirates is the national airline of Dubai. As of 2018, it operated internationally serving over 150 destinations in over 70 countries across six continents.The development of Al Maktoum International Airport (IATA: DWC) was announced in 2004. The first phase of the airport, featuring one A380 capable runway, 64 remote stands, one cargo terminal with annual capacity for 250,000 tonnes of cargo and a passenger terminal building designed to accommodate five million passengers per year, has been opened. When completed, Dubai World Central-Al Maktoum International will be the largest airport in the world with five runways, four terminal buildings and capacity for 160 million passengers and 12 million tons of cargo.\n\n\n=== Metro rail ===\nDubai Metro consists of two lines (Red line and Green line) which run through the financial and residential areas of the city. It was opened on September 2009. UK-based international service company Serco is responsible for operating the metro.\nThe Red Line, which has 29 stations (4 underground, 24 elevated and 1 at ground level) running from Rashidiya Station to UAE Xchange Station in Jebel Ali, is the major backbone line. The Green Line, running from the Etisalat Station to the Creek Station, has 20 stations (8 underground, 12 elevated). An extension to the Red Line connecting the EXPO 2020 site is due to open in April 2020. A Blue and a Purple Line have also been planned. The Dubai Metro is the first urban train network in the Arabian Peninsula. The trains are fully automated and driverless.\n\n\n=== Palm Jumeirah Monorail ===\n\nA monorail line connecting the Palm Jumeirah to the mainland opened on 30 April 2009. It is the first monorail in the Middle East. An extension to connect to the Red Line of the Dubai Metro is planned.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nA tramway located in Al Sufouh, will run for 14.5 km (9.0 mi) along Al Sufouh Road from Dubai Marina to the Burj Al Arab and the Mall of the Emirates with two interchanges with Dubai Metro's Red Line. The first section, a 10.6 km (6.6 mi) long tram line which serves 11 stations, was opened in 2014.\n\n\n=== High speed rail ===\nDubai has announced it will complete a link of the UAE high-speed rail system which will eventually hook up with the whole GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council, also known as Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf) and then possibly Europe. The High Speed Rail will serve passengers and cargo.\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\nThere are two major commercial ports in Dubai, Port Rashid and Port Jebel Ali. Port Jebel Ali is the world's largest man-made harbour, the biggest port in the Middle East, and the 7th-busiest port in the world. One of the more traditional methods of getting across Bur Dubai to Deira is by abras, small boats that ferry passengers across the Dubai Creek, between abra stations in Bastakiya and Baniyas Road. The Marine Transport Agency has also implemented the Dubai Water Bus System. Water bus is a fully air conditioned boat service across selected destinations across the creek. One can also avail oneself of the tourist water bus facility in Dubai. Latest addition to the water transport system is the Water Taxi.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe UAE culture mainly revolves around traditional Arab culture. The influence of Arab and Islamic culture on its architecture, music, attire, cuisine, and lifestyle is very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques which are scattered around the country. Since 2006, the weekend has been Friday and Saturday, as a compromise between Friday's holiness to Muslims and the Western weekend of Saturday and Sunday. Prior to 2006, the weekend was Thursday-Friday.\nBecause of the touristic approach of many Dubaites in the entrepreneurial sector and the high standard of living, Dubai's culture has gradually evolved towards one of luxury, opulence, and lavishness with a high regard for leisure-related extravagance. Annual entertainment events such as the Dubai Shopping Festival (DSF) and Dubai Summer Surprises (DSS) attract over 4 million visitors from across the region and generate revenues in excess of $2.7 billion.\n\nDubai is known for its nightlife. Clubs and bars are found mostly in hotels because of liquor laws. The New York Times described Dubai as \"the kind of city where you might run into Michael Jordan at the Buddha Bar or stumble across Naomi Campbell celebrating her birthday with a multiday bash\".The city's cultural imprint as a small, ethnically homogeneous pearling community was changed with the arrival of other ethnic groups and nationals\u2014first by the Iranians in the early 1900s, and later by Indians and Pakistanis in the 1960s. In 2005, 84% of the population of metropolitan Dubai was foreign-born, about half of them from India.Major holidays in Dubai include Eid al Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, and National Day (2 December), which marks the formation of the United Arab Emirates.The International Festivals and Events Association (IFEA), the world's leading events trade association, has crowned Dubai as IFEA World Festival and Event City, 2012 in the cities category with a population of more than one million. Large shopping malls in the city, such as Deira City Centre, Mirdiff City Centre, BurJuman, Mall of the Emirates, Dubai Mall (the world's largest) and Ibn Battuta Mall as well as traditional Dubai Gold Souk and other souks attract shoppers from the region.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nArabic cuisine is very popular and is available everywhere in the city, from the small shawarma diners in Deira and Al Karama to the restaurants in Dubai's hotels. Fast food, South Asian, and Chinese cuisines are also very popular and are widely available. The sale and consumption of pork is regulated and is sold only to non-Muslims, in designated areas of supermarkets and airports. Similarly, the sale of alcoholic beverages is regulated. A liquor permit is required to purchase alcohol; however, alcohol is available in bars and restaurants within hotels. Shisha and qahwa boutiques are also popular in Dubai. Biryani is also a popular cuisine across Dubai with being the most popular among Indians and Pakistanis present in Dubai.The inaugural Dubai Food Festival was held between 21 February to 15 March 2014. According to Vision magazine, the event was aimed at enhancing and celebrating Dubai's position as the gastronomic capital of the region. The festival was designed to showcase the variety of flavours and cuisines on offer in Dubai featuring the cuisines of over 200 nationalities at the festival. The next food festival was held between 23 February 2017 to 11 March 2017.\n\n\n=== Entertainment ===\nDubai Opera opened its door on 31 August 2016 in Downtown Dubai with a performance by Pl\u00e1cido Domingo. The venue is a 2000-seat, multifunctional performing arts centre able to host not only theatrical shows, concerts and operas but also weddings, gala dinners, banquets and conferences.  \nArabic movies are popular in Dubai and the UAE. Since 2004, the city has hosted the annual Dubai International Film Festival which serves as a showcase for Arab and Middle Eastern film making talent. The Dubai Desert Rock Festival was also another major festival consisting of heavy metal and rock artists but is no longer held in Dubai.\nOne of the lesser known sides of Dubai is the importance of its young contemporary art gallery scene. Since 2008, the leading contemporary art galleries such as Carbon 12 Dubai, Green Art, gallery Isabelle van den Eynde, and The Third Line have brought the city onto the international art map. Art Dubai, the growing and reputable art fair of the region is as well a major contributor of the contemporary art scene's development.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nMany international news agencies such as Reuters, APTN, Bloomberg L.P. and Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC) operate in Dubai Media City and Dubai Internet City. Additionally, several local network television channels such as Dubai One (formerly Channel 33), and Dubai TV (EDTV) provide programming in English and Arabic respectively. Dubai is also the headquarters for several print media outlets. Dar Al Khaleej, Al Bayan and Al Ittihad are the city's largest circulating Arabic language newspapers, while Gulf News, Khaleej Times, Khaleej Mag and 7days are the largest circulating English newspapers.Etisalat, the government-owned telecommunications provider, held a virtual monopoly over telecommunication services in Dubai prior to the establishment of other, smaller telecommunications companies such as Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC\u2014better known as Du) in 2006. Internet was introduced into the UAE (and therefore Dubai) in 1995. The network has an Internet bandwidth of 7.5 Gbit/s with capacity of 49 STM1 links. Dubai houses two of four Domain Name System (DNS) data centres in the country (DXBNIC1, DXBNIC2). Censorship is common in Dubai and used by the government to control content that it believes violates the cultural and political sensitivities of Emirates. Homosexuality, drugs, and the theory of evolution are generally considered taboo.Internet content is regulated in Dubai. Etisalat uses a proxy server to filter Internet content that the government deems to be inconsistent with the values of the country, such as sites that provide information on how to bypass the proxy; sites pertaining to dating, gay and lesbian networks, and pornography; and sites originating from Israel. Emirates Media and Internet (a division of Etisalat) notes that as of 2002, 76% of Internet users are male. About 60% of Internet users were Asian, while 25% of users were Arab. Dubai enacted an Electronic Transactions and Commerce Law in 2002 which deals with digital signatures and electronic registers. It prohibits Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from disclosing information gathered in providing services. The penal code contains official provisions that prohibit digital access to pornography; however, it does not address cyber crime or data protection.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nFootball and cricket are the most popular sports in Dubai. Three teams (Al Wasl FC, Shabab Al-Ahli Dubai FC and Al Nasr SC) represent Dubai in UAE Pro-League. Al-Wasl have the second-most number of championships in the UAE League, after Al Ain. Dubai also hosts both the annual Dubai Tennis Championships and The Legends Rock Dubai tennis tournaments, as well as the Dubai Desert Classic golf tournament and the DP World Tour Championship, all of which attract sports stars from around the world. The Dubai World Cup, a thoroughbred horse race, is held annually at the Meydan Racecourse. Dubai also hosts the traditional rugby union tournament Dubai Sevens, part of the Sevens World Series Event pictures of Rugby 7 Dubai 2015. In 2009, Dubai hosted the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens. Auto racing is also a big sport in Dubai, the Dubai Autodrome is home to many auto racing events throughout the year. It also features a state-of-the-art indoor and outdoor Kartdrome, popular among racing enthusiasts and recreational riders.\n\n\n=== Dress code ===\nThe Emirati attire is typical of several countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Women usually wear the \"abaya\", a long black robe with a hijab (the head-scarf which covers the neck and part of the head-all of the hair and ears). Some women may add a niqab which cover the mouth and nose and only leaves the eyes exposed. Men wear the \"kandurah\" also referred to as \"dishdasha\" or even \"thawb\" (long white robe) and the headscarf (ghotrah). The UAE traditional ghotrah is white and is held in place by an accessory called \"egal\", which resembles a black cord. The younger Emiratis prefer to wear red and white ghotras and tie it round their head like a turban.The above dress code is never compulsory and many people wear western or other eastern clothing without any problems; but prohibitions on wearing \"indecent clothing\" or revealing too much skin are aspects of the UAE to which Dubai's visitors are expected to conform, and are encoded in Dubai's criminal law. The UAE has enforced decency regulations in most public places, aside from waterparks, beaches, clubs, and bars.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe school system in Dubai follows that of the United Arab Emirates. As of 2009, there are 79 public schools run by the Ministry of Education that serve Emiratis and expatriate Arab people as well as 145 private schools. The medium of instruction in public schools is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language, while most of the private schools use English as their medium of instruction. Most private schools cater to one or more expatriate communities.More than 15 schools offer an international education using the one or more of the four International Baccalaureate Programmes for students aged 3\u201319. Several schools have introduced the new IB Career-related Programme that can be combined with a vocational qualification such as a BTEC. The Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) signed an agreement with the IB in efforts to widen the options offered for parents and to meet the different needs of students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Additionally a number of schools offer either a CBSE or an Indian Certificate of Secondary Education Indian syllabus. The Indian High School, DPS, DMHS are some examples. Similarly, there are also several reputable Pakistani schools offering FBISE curriculum for expatriate children in Dubai.A number of schools also offer British primary education up to the age of eleven. British style eleven-to-eighteen secondary schools offering General Certificate of Secondary Education and A-Levels include Dubai Gem Private School, Dubai British School, English Language School Pvt. Some schools, such as The American School of Dubai, also offer the curriculum of the United States.The most well-known universities in Dubai are American University in Dubai, Hult International Business School, Al Ghurair University, The American College of Dubai, University of Wollongong in Dubai, British University in Dubai offering courses in Business Administration, Engineering, Architecture and Interior Design. American University in Dubai is one of the six UAE universities featured in QS World University Rankings 2014/2015. In 2013 Synergy University Dubai Campus opened its campus in Jumeirah Lakes Towers being a first University in Dubai to be located outside of Educational Zones (Knowledge Village or Academic City).\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nHealthcare in Dubai can be divided into two different sectors: public and private. Each Emirate is able to dictate healthcare standards according to their internal laws, although the standards and regulations rarely have extreme differences. Public hospitals in Dubai were first built in the late 1950s and continued to grow with public health initiatives. There are now 28 hospitals in Dubai, 6 public and 22 private, with 3 more major hospitals scheduled to be built by 2025.By the end of 2012, there were also a total of 1,348 medical clinics, 97% of which are operated privately. In 2015, Dubai phased in mandatory health insurance for all inhabitants, thereby leading to increased demand for medical services.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nDubai is twinned with the following cities:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nArchaeology of the United Arab Emirates\nAl Sufouh Archaeological Site\nDubai Desert Conservation Reserve\nList of buildings in Dubai\nList of people from Dubai\nSustainability in Dubai\nOutline of Dubai\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSyed Ali.

          "I think Dubai Opera should rethink this Iftar event as it tarnishes their reputation. There was nothing luxe nor memorable about the event especially the food and service. In fact, it makes me rethink about even dining in Sean Connolly. Overpriced. Overhyped. Underdelivered.",

          "an excellent place for shows. good experience and good staff. people were allowed to walk in even after the show started,",

          "This was definately not Opera worthy performance. It was poorly choreographed or infact not choreographed all toghether. The entire performance was in bits and pieces. Technical glitches in soundtrack. At times it felt like a chaos with no sense. I have been to shows like Cirque",

          "Aida was wonderful. The sets were breathtakingly colourful, and the music, singing, and performance was amazing. I was very surprised to learn that parking was paid. Free parking should be extended as a courtesy to the opera visitors.",
          "The performance was excellent. The decoration and audiovisual settings were excellent. we are missing the Salmon sandwiches in the last few shows.",
          "Absolutely fabulous venue and they even serve alcohol on each of the three lobby floors. And to top it all up, add the ul opera was in Italian, it had subtle subtitles in English and Arabic above the stage.!!! Can't recommend enough !!!",
          "Besides the amazing show we attended, the whole customer experience should be improved. First of all providing a well managed parking facility, although you end up paying 40 AED for the parking, we had to wait for quite sometime in front of elevators after the show, they blocked",
          "Visiting the breathtaking Dubai Opera is always a fabulous experience. We always go early to enjoy the ambience of the building, the dhow and nets motif, the gorgeous chandelier and the elegant d\u00e9cor. If the timing is right, you also get a great view of the fountains as an added",

          "It is a shame to be disturbed by late comers while the artist is performing. Specially that you are mentioning yourself that you have a closed door policy (Article 6 of T&C's). And you don't respect your own T&C's ?! Ridiculous to make people enter between 2 songs, with the",

          "Amazing experience! Friendly and helpful staff under a beautifully constructed building. Venue is elegant and cosy",
          "Went to see Evita and booked the tickets ages ago, got good seats in front row of upper balcony. Was really looking forward to it. Sadly the sound was off, the only good bit was when Don\u2019t cry for me\u2019 came on and think that is because the platform was moved to front of stage",

          "Went to see Evita, third row from the front was superb. The boxes were very off centre and I wouldn't recommend. Stunning venue, helpful staff and clientele seemed very well mannered and didn't have phones out, talking etc which was great. Very professional production, great",

          "Dubai operas Evita. What an excellent performance. However. At the opera house itself, why do we get sandwiches in cardboard boxes. It\u2019s supposed to be special. Plates is the way to go. The sound was good but stifled in parts and the orchestra drowned out the voice of Che.",

        "wiki": "A water park or waterpark is an amusement park that features water play areas such as swimming pools, water slides, splash pads, water playgrounds, and lazy rivers, as well as areas for bathing, swimming, and other barefoot environments. Modern water parks may also be equipped with some type of artificial surfing or bodyboarding environment, such as a wave pool or flowrider.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWater parks have grown in popularity since their introduction in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The United States has the largest and most concentrated water park market, with over 1,000 water parks and dozens of new parks opening each year. Major organizations are the IAAPA (International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions) and WWA (World Waterpark Association), which is the industry trade association.Water parks which emerge from spas tend to more closely resemble mountain resorts, as they become year-round destinations. For example, Splash Universe Water Park Resort is themed to match the community in which it is located. The theme is intended to enhance the community's destination appeal. Therefore, the amusement and leisure-time industry is becoming more concentrated, as winter sports are becoming common themes in summertime water recreation.\nA process of concentration can be observed in the hybrid versions of theme-, amusement-, and water parks. Some water parks are more spa-oriented. For example, SchwabenQuellen has no water slides; it has instead many saunas, steam rooms, \"adventure showers\", and relaxation-oriented water play areas.In the 2000s, an effort was made to reduce long waiting lines by introducing conveyor belts to lift passengers or use water jets.An unusual feature at a water park is ice skating. Deep River Water Park in northwestern Indiana features ice skating, made possible by cooling pipes installed under their massive plaza.\n\n\n== Indoor water parks ==\n\nSome of the first indoor water parks are Tikibad at Duinrell (The Netherlands, 1984), Nautiland located at Haguenau (France, 1984), the Aqua Mundo at Center Parc De Eemhof located at Zeewolde (The Netherlands, 1980) and Alpamare (Pf\u00e4ffikon) (Switerland, 1977).In 1986 World Waterpark was open in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada at the West Edmonton Mall. It is in 2016 the largest indoor water park in North America.Tropical Islands Resort (Germany), with an area of 66,000 m2 (710,418 sq ft), is in 2016 the largest indoor water park in the world.With five indoor water parks, Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin is supposed to be recognized as the \"Water Park Capital of the World\". It showcases several of America's largest indoor and outdoor water parks, such as Noah's Ark Water Park. Indoor water parks in Wisconsin Dells debuted in 1994 after the Polynesian Resort Hotel built the first one in the U.S.\nSuccess in extending the tourist season and turning water park resorts into vacation destinations has resulted in tremendous industry growth. Usually, resort hotels featuring massive indoor water parks have been reserved for overnight guests. Companies like Great Wolf Resorts/Great Wolf Lodge and Kalahari Resorts have branched out from their origin in Wisconsin Dells to open new locations around the country. Mt. Olympus Theme and Water Park (formerly Family Land) is another huge water park in the Dells.\nThe largest indoor water park in the UK is Sandcastle Water Park in Blackpool, England, which opened in 1986.There are many water parks in southern Europe where the climate suits a long season. For example, in Portugal's Algarve, there are three main parks: Aqualand, Aquashow, and Slide n' Splash.\nThe growth of indoor water parks have encouraged leisure centres across the world to begin implementing features of waterparks into their facilities, including slides and lazy rivers.\n\n\n== Water play areas ==\nWater play areas are similar to water parks and include urban beaches, splash pads, and smaller collections of water slides in many hotels and public swimming pools.\nFor example, the Chelsea Hotel in Toronto features a four-story water slide called the Corkscrew.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndoor water park\nList of water parks\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nO'Niell, Karen (December 1996). \"The International Politics of National Parks\". 24. \nYoung, Terrance (October 1995). \"Modern Urban Parks\". 85: 535\u2013551.

          "A fun place to be with kids and relax. You should start your day early in the morning to get maximum out of it. Its better to have your swimming costume with you to avoid the cost of buying new ones there (expensive). You should have your softies with you as well which will help",
          "This is huge and amazing water park ever visited, I don't think better than this in my life, spent a whole day with my family and each and everyone enjoyed a lot, done almost all the rides but still thinking there is something left. Just can get much options to eat as spent the",
          "Spend the whole day and still there will be a lot left to do! Aquaventure features something for everyone, you don't need to be an adventure junkie to be here (those looking to slow down can take the lazy river ride, a very slow float which has rapid in between). Dare to go for",
          "Although it is wide & there is a large green area but we did not find many exciting games as the long slides were closed",

          "The VIP bracelet is a must !! We went in about 6 rides and waiting times where between 45 min to 1.5 hours .we could never do it..so is worth it. We had lunch as well, towels are provided ,showers inside with body wash as well,and also lockers are available.",
          "Two adults felt like a bunch of kids, laughing and giggling on the slides. We experienced the silver lining of C19, literally NO cues. The slides were fabulous, customer service and employees were kind, the park was clean and the food for theme park standards was really great. A",

          "Fab location - but unfortuntely all the rides were cancelled for about an hour as someone had got sick in one - so they all closed down.",
          "The park is nice located with direct access trough the Atlantis Hotel on The Palm. Attractions are funny but to stay in the line and wait for more than half hour is not that nice because people are looking undercooled. So it's recommended to buy a Expresstickets, that cost",

          "Had been to Siam Park in Tenerife so am comparing to that experience - this is a fun day out but if I\u2019m being picky not quite as good as Siam - this is more expensive in every way - but still worth a day out in glorious weather - great fun",
          "The waterpark itself was fun, but you pay a lot of money to get in, and we had to wait 45 minutes for our first ride. You can pay more to skip the line, but this just makes people feel a little resentful as you're already paying a lot to get into the water park. There are also",
          "Love the new toddlers splash area!!! Parents can enjoy while watching their little ones have fun in the water and in a very safe environment",

          "As guests at the Atlantis we had free access to the water park and loved it. There were different levels of slides for young children and adults and also for the very brave there was \u201c a leap of faith\u201d. The lazy river was also very good taking at least 40mins to go all the way",

          "We love this waterpark, especially the rapids. You sit on a rubber ring and the water takes you around the park. You dont need to move off the ring, a conveyor belt takes you up and down the rapids. Life guards every 50 metres or so, therefore plenty of people to help if you",
          "To be at the Atlantis is itself amazing. Aquaventure Water Park is a part of the Atlantis Hotel which is open for the public for a day out. All the water rides are too good both for the kids and adults. The lost chamber at the Atlantis is worth a visit. It's an Aquarium with",
          "The aquarium is very nice and the waterpark relaxed. Really enjoyed the Rapids on floats. Loads of shade. Great lockers/changing rooms.",
          "It is an amazing water park with lots of activities for the kids and grown-ups. But the long waiting time for each and every ride make you very frustrated. If you want to enjoy all the rides, then you must have fast track passes to avoid the queues or reach the park very early.",
          "Very nice structure with about 10 slides and one area for children. Food is available inside but prices are insane.",
          "We went on the day prior to leaving, midweek on a Wednesday in February. We booked direct on the Atlantis website same morning and used the QR code to \u2018check in\u2019 on arrival. We arrived early 9.30am the signage and information was quite lacking. Managed to get a front row",
          "We visited on 20th Feb. We got there about 1030, and had no problem getting a sun bed. However by 1300 nearly all the beds had gone. We managed to do nearly every main ride within 1 hour and almost non existent queues! Simiarly later in the day the rides were up to an hour wait",
          "We have been coming here for years now and it still is great fun! The grounds are impeccable, the rides are great, staff is nice, the food very good. Is there nothing bad to say ? Yes, of course, the lack of sunbeds, the fact that nobody is on them all day, the fact that they",
          " We stayed at the Atlantis so the waterpark is part of our stay. We also had the go city dubai pass which we used to got tickets as well and gave to someone as this place is extremely expensive for only a day and a few waterside. Since wisconsin dells is close to our home the",
          "So much queuing per ride 30/45 mins, so it don't take long and after a couple of rides you have burned 2hrs. We got fed up and ditched the rides in the end. Leap of faith is good fun and the group rafting are by far the best. Little kids that ain't going on the do love it",
          "Highly overrated and overpriced Few good rides and not much for kids under 3 years old. Even for a 4 year old not much I think there\u2019s better water parks out there 50 AED for a small locker?!!! That\u2019s extortionate and unfair.",
          "Like everything in Dubai it\u2019s not cheap but it\u2019s a great park anyway Lazy river ride was great. The rapids were quite good too. We saw lots for the younger kids too, splash zone all looked good Beach area and lots of sun beds, free towels, but you have to pay extra for lockers.",
          "We were disappointed about the waterpark. Very long queues even in low season as we visited the park in february. The park needs to be renovated in certain parts. Price,quality does not mix anymore and the aquaxpress lines is an effrontery to all the people who purchase the",

          "Very expensive the entry fee but worth visit once if you are great fun of water park. Of course you can not compete it with other worldwide parks.",
          "We early booked our ticket that included a 1 day entry to the waterpark, the Lost Chambers aquarium and also a meal deal at around 340 AED. Went it right at the opening time and there were very few people. Truth to be said it was a slightly windy day, but would have expected",

          "Out of the bigger waterparks, this is definitely the best one to visit (opinion of resident for 6 years), with YAS (Abu Dhabi) in 2nd place. The size and amount of attractions is brilliant for all ages/levels of fear. The best rides - in my opinion - are the test tube where the",

          "A fantastic day out. So many things to do and so much fun. We were lucky enough to have tickets included with our stay at Atlantis, went three times in a week. Super fun, top class services! As with everything aimed at tourists in Dubai, you pay a premium for food and drink but",
          "We went to the Waterpark with children from 2 to 8 years. There was something to do for everyone, very nice for one day, the older the children are the more fun they have. The price for food was acceptable and the (fast) food was better than expected.",

          "great park and layout, its kinda altogether but still plenty of space and water for everyone. You end up in the lazy river multiple times but it adds to the fun as there are lots of spin offs within the lazy river. Highly recommend this park, its very good. Loads of fun.",
          "The place is amazing but the rooms aren't fancy enough. I love the Lost Chambers for the variety of underwater species they habituate and the waterpark is not bad and the monorail is something new if you haven't been to many international destinations but all the glitz and",

          "If you have visited some other Aquaparks in Europe - you will be disappointed. There are some key points that make this park fall below average: - prices: entry is expensive. You are searched for food & water because you have to spend money inside the park. That would be OK -",
          "Went to atlantis holiday park keeping in mind I'd been toany across the world including america. It wasn't as great as the American ones but it was fun. Much smaller than I thought it would be and not much selection of food to eat. My sister did a dive here and the",

          "We had a great day at the waterpark. Plenty of rides and soon to have more. The queues were less than 10 minutes long and the staff were really friendly. Lots of sun loungers and plenty of huts to hire towels from. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Bought a 2-day pass and actually ended up spending 2 wonderful days at it. The kids had a ball of a time. A tip-if you reach the queue early then the entire park can be covered in 1 day itself without an express pass.",
          "Loved it, especially the ride. \"The STorm\", we had a great time. The only thing I did not like was the fact that there was only one place from where you could take the swimbelt. Make more rooms with those!",
          "Worth a litlle bit extra to have 2 full days. Enjoyed the water park and the beach but avoid the chicken in Barracudas. Looked like it had been reheated several times and the chips were cold",
          "Plenty of activities for everyone, especially for adrenaline junkies. Best time is in January, when most of tourists and all locals consider the weather too cold for swimming. In peak time waiting for an attraction can be form half an hour to even more. When we came it was",

          "This my third time in this park, but this year it's has many changes one and the most unpleasant was the aqua adventure park has a fast pass so if you don't pay for it you have to walk around all the park for to take a ride in one of the game. Very disappointed you have to pay",
          "We visited this place while staying at Atlantis the palm although you can still visit for a charge if staying elsewhere there were lots of different things in the park you could slide down an enormous drop into a clear tunnel with numerous sharks etc swimming around you,there",
          "Although the water park is fabulous once you are actually in it the experience we had queuing to to get in was horrendous even with prepaid tickets. It got very aggressive with people pushing even small children (ours and other peoples) out of the way . Unhelpful staff . No",
          "Went with family and will advice to book express pass if you can. This allowed us to do all but three rides within the time limit of 5pm. The dolphin \ud83d\udc2c experience was amazing and loved watching my toddler hug the dolphin. Alice was her name. The leap of faith and dead drop",
          "Great place to have a complete enjoyment reach in early hours so as you have full fun bash. Park needs extra signage to guide the tourists so as they can have full fun,park should provide assistance booth in several locations, best rides I have been to several water parks but",

          "Kids rated the Lazy River very highly in comparison to Volcano Bay, FL and Etnaland, Sicily. The length of this is enormous and contained essentially two circuits. We spend a good part of half a day exploring that. Limited crowding as it was just after Christmas. The remarkable",
          "This park is amazing and worth every Dirham! The thing that I like about the most is that there are many things the little kids can enjoy! There are 2 big areas for them where they can enjoy and they are very safe specially one of them is only few CM of water where even toddler",
          "If you are a person who love water rides Atlantis aquarium is the best place be the view of the place it's so woow for taking pictures & also the hotel",
          "Park opens at 9.45 AM. Try to go early; else it gets crowded and there will be queues for each ride. Carry waterproofed gopro (attached to wristband of chestguard \u2013 selfie sticks not allowed) or waterproof pouch for your smartphone. Carry enough water bottles. I think there is",
          "I have attached some photographs with the information the website fails to provide. Also note the online purchase price is 330AED without an online transaction fee as of late 2019 and the gate price is 400AED. This park is very well themed and the rides were of excellent quality",
          "Enjoyed the time at Atlantis. Specially the rides were very interesting. Got to try the LEAP OF FAITH 40 ft drop! But food was very expensive and not worth the price.",
          "Honestly from the minute you walk in it\u2019s in your face with no shame from staff whom I will mention are not locals very rude and not shy to say welcome to Dubai with a shifty smirk on their faces when they charge you 90 UAE dirham for towel hire or 170 UAE for a locker and then",
          "It was loads of fun. Brings out the inner child in you. Lost chambers is good too but can do with more space",
          "This is an excellent place for family with kids, activities for all day long, drinks everywhere and food on site",
          "Great warerpark we had a great time, shark attack is the very best, also playing with dolphines. Stuff pleasant worth too see",
          "Must visit place if u r traveling to dubai.... amazing slides.... very good service.... and the lost chambers is out of the world....",
          "For any thrill seeker this it so much fun it is so exhilarating. The ride that anaconda is extremely intense getting the heart racing. The lazy river is a great way to transport yourself around the park. I suggest like we didGetting a private cabana where you can go to without",
          "Last visited this place almost 10 years ago and it still well maintained. Some of the slides show some wear but are still functional and fun. Luckily the day we went did not have too many people but some rides did start to have a queue as the day progressed. The best is to",
          "Great facility, to enjoy and have fun throughout the day. Variety of different entertainment available, for different ages. All staff very kind and serviceable.",
          "Amazing recomend it to anyone looking for a good time spent the best time of my life there and hope to be back soon",
          "Our day visit to the water park was ok but overpriced for what was offered. The rides are like any other waterpark we have been to, nothing extraordinary. Towels are not inclusive or lockers. For the steep entry price, these should really be included. Food outlets are ordinary",
          "We visited on a Tuesday at opening time and the queues were rather small throughout the day. All the rides were thrilling particularly the leap of faith, zoomerango, falls and torrent river. The shark attack tube ride was underwhelming.",
          "We had daily access to the park throughout our stay at the adjoining resort, Atlantis, The Palm. We mostly visited upon opening at 9:45am, via the guest entrance. This is a great way to beat any lines and experience the rides without the crowds - it starts to get busy around",
          "Been to Greatwolf in Dallas Texas so I was not so over wowed on the rides at Aquaventure but Poseidon Leap of Faith is not for the Faint or Have heart issues. Altantis as a whole was awesome. Some activities will make me visit again when the children are like 7years and above",
          "very nice reminds of Vegas but expensive and very busy specially holidays and weekends aquarium very nice",
          "Loved it! Water parks are a top favorite for our family and this is an exceptional one. I\u2019m so happy my husband and I took our 4 teenagers here to celebrate my son\u2019s birthday. Everyone had an excellent day and enjoyed all the rides. The lazy river was the best we\u2019ve ever been",
          "A really good day ! There is no end to the amount of fun to be had trying all the different 'rides'. Neither of us was brave enough to take the vertical chute but there is exhilaration and excitement to be found everywhere and should you need it, there are sun-loungers at",
          "Visited the waterpark on the 30th December. was extremely busy and all rides except the lazy river were over 2 hours long. Even if you paid extra for the rapid pass, queues were an hour long. Not happy after paying over \u00a3300 for admission to not be able to do anything!",
          "It is another fun and bit of adventure place to go in Dubai I prefer u get Express tickets if visiting with family as will save time and u can enjoy more. With friends it's nice place lots of crowd and also check on website what kind of clothes they allow otherwise u will miss",
          "Whole experience was monotonous. Saving grace was only 2 enclosure One with snake fish and other one atrium enclosure All the best for your visit",
          "We had a great time in Aquaventure. We visited the waterpark end of December when it was around 23 degrees Celsius. The weather was good enough. The park was not that crowded. Most slides did not have long queues (approx 5-10 mins) and some family slides and the tunnel had",
          "We stood for 3 hours trying to buy tickets. Unfriendly staff. By time we were half way in front it was already 1PM. Very disappointed kids left day without seeing the chambers or water park.",
          "It was a good place to have fun with water rides. Place was clean. December and January are the best time to visit. Safe.",
          "Our third time at the waterpark and everything was the same which although good to see that the quality was still there we didn't experience anything new.",
          "This is a great park, I was expecting maybe more attraction for this price. The kids really enjoy it.",
          "We were at Atlantis Aquaventure for 6 hours and only able to go on 4 slides (each no longer than 1 minute long). The entire time was spent in queues waiting to get on these slides. With so much time hanging about we realised it cost us AED80 per ride .... EXPENSIVE. The park",
          "Atlantis Aquaventure water park is very good water park, it is best water park.all rides are very good and thrilling .",
          "Very thrilling day out. Spent the whole day screaming going up and down the water slides. There's a good variety of adrenaline inducing drops and speed in the slides. Go early so that it is not too crowded. Bring your own towel as the rental for towels are pretty expensive.",
          "We spent 3 nights half board. I loved the aqua adventure. However, the buses that pick you at the end of the day was not enough. Safraan resturant was amazing with wide variaty of food. The aquarium is nice and the service is really good.",
          "I was well disappointed. The waterpark was ok. The water was cold. The dolphin photo fun, Firstly for the money they charge, you get 2 minutes with the dolphin and one complimentary photo. The photos that are taken are not what i expected. In most of them you are not even",
          "The slides are excited. Choose the tall ones, excited! Really scary, like a vertical fall from height! The admission tickets are very expensive, with over crowded scene like this, the queues are no joke. We had no choice but to pay for express to skip the queues. Total over",
          "So we weren\u2019t able to make it to the water park but did head to the Lost Chambers aquarium - it was just not big enough. The design and theme is nice, and there is one tank that is simply vast and impressive, but that\u2019s it. The other exhibits are all fine, but there\u2019s just not",
          "The queues we're horrific to get the tickets, the rides just didn't seem that many and it's so spread out. And typically expensive..",
          "Although it only has been 6-7 years since its opening, we strongly feel that - contrary to expansions to the Atlantis Aquaventure Waterpark coming up -, it is past its golden days. We read many reviews of the times when it freshly opened and well, those times are gone. But",
          "Third visit here and we all fun as usual but the waterpark needs more rides to keep up with the competition.",
          "We got a 2 day pass at this water park and i must say it is awesome. The rides of different age of people along with family rides to be done together and the relaxing time on the beach along with their restaurants, superb and worth it what you pay for.",
          "The child liked it, but there are better parks. Long lines for interesting attractions. We rested on the beach. And that was not bad. But the beach was not impressive. In general, this is a business in its purest form. A way to take money from parents.",
          "We have been in the water park many times it is a great family day out. We generally always book a cabana this time was very disappointing the cabana was in a very busy area with people hanging there stuff all over it and pushing beds up against it. Also the menu has now",
          "Me and my wife went to the water park and we informed them that we are Deaf. They was so good with the Disability awareness to able to provide us a great service for our quality time at the water park. The staffs was showing us whenever we asked them where the place is etc. I",
          "If you are an Atlantic hotel guest you arrive earlier than everyone else resulting in no queues which is a bonus. When we went there were not queues. I am assuming it is busier other times of the year. Plenty of choice re slides and deck chairs. Nice day out fot family or",
          "\u00a3500 for a day. Nice enough day but really not worth the money. All the extras bump the price up and you can't take in any drinks or food as bags are searched. It was a quiet morning so we didn't queue much. But we were told to go up to dolphins and sealions after 530 when park",
          "Using a variety of transport systems to get to the Atlantis was fun. The visit itself is not very long but the big aquarium is really impressive and all was vey clean. Not too crowded allowing to spend time watching the nice variety of fishes.",
          "Visited the aqua park today and thought it was quite pricy for what it offers. Paid my credit bill with \u00a3 only to realise that it was \u00a330 more than the daily exchange rate. Rather settle in AED \ud83d\ude2d Apparently park is quieter at this time of year, would hate to see during its",
          "Like almost everything at the Atlantis area this was very overpriced. The exhibitions were nice but nothing spectacular. If I had my time again I would do the cheapest option and just view the huge Aquarium not the whole tour.",
          "Get there early! Is my TOP TIP. Get ready to spend and have fun... we had a great day out here, but we also spent loads. Lockers are extra, a bigger locker is 85 Dirhams. The smallest photo is 130 Dirhams. Entry ticket is 300 dirhams and a aquaexpress ticket on top of your entry",
          "We enjoyed rides in the park, Lost chambers was also good. Please plan to buy your tickets online , if you buy tickets at the park they are expensive. Bring your towels they charge money to rent towels, I think towels should be free. Any thing you want to buy around the park is",
          "Keep away from here. Although you have an online eticket, you have to wait for 1 hour at the entrance just to get a wristband which is just to distinguish poor standart visitors from rich fast track visitors. Also it is just to get your photos taken during your visit. Entire",
          "You pay a lot it\u2019s ok but not really worth the amount of money you pay. Go to a local water park or Latina or wadi it\u2019s just as good and slot cheaper",
          "The end of March we took a trip to New Orleans. Stayed at the Wyndham downtown and enjoyed a fun night of debauchery at one of their post Mardi Gras festivals. The next day we were to board the Carnival Dream for a week\u2019s excursion to the Bahamas. We left New Orleans in the late",
          "If your not staying in the hotel then don\u2019t forget your wallet \u00a3600 for 4 adults and 2 children aged 3 & 4 just to enter the very busy water park. Very good but also very busy and expensive.",
          "Despite pre booked tickets, it took us an hour in the queue to get our bands for entry. The food inside is very expensive. The slides, that last less than 10 seconds have a wait time of more than 90 minutes. The only good thing, the wave river.",
          "Well planned, and always in touch excellent service will try again no doubt, overall would do again!",
          "We rebooked tickets as they where cheaper and where suppose to get us in fast. We had to wait for 1.5hours to get our tickets, absolute chaos people pushing in and security overwhelmed. Everything cost extra locker 50AED, deckchair etc so prepare enough spare cash. The park is",
          "We visited on 27 December and queued for an hour to get in. We didn't want to pay 400DH for the express ticket each (yes that's about \u00a380 each and that's on top of the nearly \u00a360 to get in to the park - this means over \u00a3560 for a family of 4 if you want an express ticket) and so",
          "We loved the family time we spent together in the waterpark, river raft tube rides. My kids enjoyed the Leap of faith, Anaconda, shark attach, Zoomorango and the little one the kids side. The Atlantis Aquarium with the amazing water creatures.",
          "Its very good but very very expensive. Do all the rides only if you have lots of money to spare. Kids would emjoy more.",
          "My husband, 12yr old, 9 yr old and myself bought a day pass to Atlantis. We took the hit of paying for an Xpress pass too, so glad we did. All the kids wanted was to do ride after ride with bouts of the lazy river, and having been to Motiongate the night before we didn\u2019t want",
          "If you happen to visit Dubai mall aquarium you may skip this .You save time.This will be duplication besides extra payment.",
          "We had some great days out at this water park.Entrance was included in our hotel package and there is plenty to do here for all ages. Can be busy at weekends. Fast pass available for an extra charge. Very safe and a great choice of rides.",
          "Has a few water rides..just like all other water parks all over the world. Acceptable waiting times to get into each ride.. Must pay for towel and locker.. so I suggest u take your own towel, and a small bag with no valuables. No changing rooms.. so we changed in the",
          "We did the sea lion discovery activity. We were so excited about touching and kissing the sea lion. I can really recommend to book this activity. After that we enjoyed the stay at the waterpark the rest of the day and did a lot of the water slides. The only thing that\u2019s bad: the",
          "The whole scenery of the Atlantis resort is a dream. The lost chamber Is a whole breathtaking seaworld aquarium. My daughter had fun on the river ride. I didn\u2019t get to swim the rides with her. Was a cool cool day. Lots of shops for shoppers too",
          "I was visiting there on my birthday. It was really nice place to chill. And it's my 2nd time as well. All good I like it.",
          "Must visit. Did not want to leave the place. Successfully did Leap of Faith and many family rides that were fun and thrilling.",
          "A whole day to spend at the water park enjoyed a lot with different rides. I loved the water slides very much though pretty tough to ride on",
          "My teenage boys and I had a two day pass. Great fun. Amazing rides. The first day wasn\u2019t busy so getting on the rides was quite quick. The second day was a very hot sunny day which attracted more visitors which meant long queues for the rides, so we decided to buy the aqua",
          "Visited this place during of the eid holiday. The rides are good but due to holiday the place is so crowded and queue is quite long. I suggest to visit the place during week days to enjoy all the rides in less crowd.",

          "Full place super crowded owing to new year rush. We went with our own towels & after the water world experience, had a shower area(just 1 near to entrance ). Got the express tickets DH400(approx)& managed all the rides within 3 hours else 1 ride experience would have taken",
          "The Aquaventure has lots of attractions both for smaller children and for grown-ups. There is a river that covers all the park with a myriad of connections and waves to make your ride more thriling. The slides are also thriling (the Poseidon's Revenge is for 55+ kg individuals",

          "Well what to say, the water park goes with Dubai like strawberries and cream. Perfect way to cool down, and is great all year round. We are regulars, have been to pretty much all the water parks in the UAE, and would say this is probably the best (notwithstanding some of the",
          "The pyramid water slide was heaps fun, what an experience. We had free access to the water park with our accomodation package. I wouldn't pay extra to do it unless you have children. Lots of rides for children and chill out areas. You have to pay for a locker, which I thought",
          "I have visited Aquaventure a few times before during my many visits to Atlantis The Palm Dubai. The last time I went there was during this month just before christmas in addition to Dolphin Bay. Aquaventure is such a blast along with its unique rides and thrilling slides. It's",
          "When we visited Dubai visiting Atlantis was a must. We were a bit disappointed by it, i had read so many reviews about the water parks being some of the best in the world and they just weren't. The water park isn't very big. We spent a day there and a few hours of that the water",
          "The whole experience was fun with a range of water slides suitable for all age groups, even the scaredy-cat kids are catered for. All food is expensive, you just have to expect that. The dolphin experience was awesome but the price tag is eye watering. The pictures are",

          "Don't believe the hype and adverts, it is tired and grubby with high prices. Overall the Wild Wadi is just as good.",
          "It\u2019s worth allowing a full day to spend here. We took public transport from our hotel in Deira which took 90 mins so it was almost noon when we arrived. It was BUSY, though we knew it was the first day of the weekend and expected crowds. We therefore didn\u2019t feel we got to do/see",

          "The attractions in the park are actually quite nice, nothing exceptionally superb comparing to many European parks though. Just a regular aquapark. The private beach is a nice bonus, but it is not that great. Not long, too many sunbeds, not ghat pictoresque as advertised.",
          "Very nice water park. Have been there few times and still not getting bored of it. Very nice venue and amazing activities. Downside price for food and especially for water are super high and you can't bring your own water. This is quite shameful especially in a country where",

          "Came here with 2 adults and 2 kids and for the AED 450 that we paid was vastly overpriced - the entire experience lasted less that 30 mins. If you are in the area you are far better off going to the Dubai Mall aquarium. Very disappointed.",
          "Access to the water park was included with our hotel stay. So we took advantage. Plenty to do within the park. Rides were all fun. Staff tried their best to clean up after the guests would would leave food, towels and garbage laying around. Without this being included in the",
          "Unless you pay for the fastrack add-on ( very expensive ) expect to queue ! Lazy river is good with several routes/features.",
          "Luckily the slides are grouped together, because it's impossible to find you way around. However the slides themselves are top notch. And somehow the walk up isn't as high as other water parks. We prepaid for a fast-pass, which was barely worth it. But they messed up and gave us",
          "Decent place to view underwater sea life and see loads of varieties of sharks, stingrays and box jellyfish. I purchased a 2 day hop on/hop off ticket and this, among other things was one of the free entries. Definitely worth a look although don\u2019t plan to spend more than 1 hour",
          "Expensive but great fun had by all. Luckily they had a deal on and we got 2days for barely more than the price of a 1 day ticket. They don't allow food and drink in and they do check your bags but the prices particularly for water which you need with the heat and sun was",
          "Went as a group of 6 adults. The park and ride is very handy and I'd recommend getting your tickets their to beat the queues at the actual park. The rides were great fun and we didn't have to queue for long at all. We screamed a lot on the rides, so don't forget to buy some",
          "I\u2019m not normally a big fan of waterslides but I had so much fun! The surroundings are beautiful, everything was so clean, the staff nice and the smides made us smile. Maybe we we had a lucky day beacause the queues weren\u2019t at all so bad as we expected. For the rather expensive",
          "I took my 2 daughters and 2 of their friends to the park for their birthday. We had a blast. Then one of the friends lost her earring in the kiddie water bucket zone area and was in tears because it was a gift from her nana. I reported it to a staff member who alerted his",
          "Great water park, many people there but did not feel too crowded. We visited the park 2 days, could definitely spend more time there. Opening hours should be extended",
          "The aqua adventure park is only for little kids or men that haven\u2019t grown up. There was nothing in between. The one thing that was fairly good was the surfing in place on a boogie board, but three goes and my husband was told he had to then leave. Even though there was no one",
          "We enjoyed the different types of Rides. The views are beautiful and relaxing. The Best Customer Service.. So much fun. #AquAdventure #ThePalm #Atlantis",
          "The kids (aged 2, 5 and 8) loved the Splashers areas. Us adults also enjoyed the bigger slides. Was a shame to see that there are captive dolphins at this park. But on the whole a great day out.",
          "Very hot day when I went here. First off, any cottons tops are not allowed on the rides with a small rubber ring, polyester only (they will check). The other group rides that open later are fine with cotton. Really excellent rides, and very helpful staff. Queues were manageable.",
          "The standards of the water park match the standards of the hotel great facilities and friendly staff. Only downfall again is price of items otherwise great fun.",
          "The Atlantis area is itself in superb area. Blue water and white sand. The rides are nice and good. One time visit.",
          "Fantastic lay out and activities! During the weekend is super busy so avoid if you are sensitive on over crowed atmosphere. The food offer is very average even if now they just open a new restaurant where you can have a better food and beverage. Still the best Aquapark by far so",
          "I was very disappointed with Aquaventure water park. 1) even in the USA I have never seen so much capitalism in one place. Entrance fees are very expensive! Almost 100 euros per person and 80 for a 4 year old kid! For this price don\u2019t expect a locker you have to pay additional",
          "We booked to visit the Burj Khalifa through Baratotravels.com through Tripadvisor. We arrived and early and queued for over two hours to collect the tickets. To be told that the confirmation we had from this company was invalid. I tried constantly to get intouch and they",
          "I and my sister visited the Aquaventure in Nov 2019 and we really enjoyed the rides. I would like to thank all the life guards and special thanks go to Gafour and Aruna from Barracuda Restaurant. They were very friendly and helped us with choosing the items and gave advices",
          "Amazing for families with kids an experience they will never forget, but the restaurant is expensive and not too good so we went to a near by mall called the point for lunch and dinner the mall is amazing and has a good choices",
          "It was ok. The cabana was very impressive. I was only able to participate in one ride because the others is either for kids or too daring for me.",
          "A nice place to have fun with kids. Rides are of all levels. Maintenance of very high standards. Crowd is all well behaved. Some Indian crowd is noisy . Eateries particularly paratha house is awesome.",
          "It was our second visit (4 years apart) and although my kids are now 14 & 12, they Loved it just as much. The rides are well maintained, clean & good fun. The park can get busy after lunch, mornings are more quiet & queues are minimal. I\u2019m not sure there are enough thrilling",
          "Seems a bit expensive initially when you buy tickets but this included access to the aquarium at the Atlantis Hotel as well. The waterpark is absolutely massive and has so many slides, rides and attractions for all ages and swimming abilities. Very novel to have rides through",
          "We didn't buy the express pass. I would recommend going to the tower fartest first for the slides. We waited 45 minutes for the Leap of Faith and 1 hour for another slide at that tower entrance. Five slides depart from the first tower you come to when you enter the park. The",
          "The Aquapark is enormous! The rides are thrilling and jaw dropping. A day is not enough to be able to enjoy all the amenities of the park. Our pass also included a visit to the the Lost chambers aquarium which was amazing! Downside here is that it can be a little expensive. But",
          "Cool relaxing days in Private cabana and nice slides. Staff very friendly. Goid for kids and adults.",
          "hello Atlantis is a very fun place in Dubai I personally like going there with my friends it's huge and has lots of rides many places to eat and good food I recommend you go early in the morning so you can enjoy the day before it gets too crowded so you can enjoy your day",
          "We visited during the European autumn holidays so the park was very busy. Luckily we purchased 2 day passes as it was 400AED for 1 days and 430AED for 2 days. We reached the park in the afternoon on the first day but only got to go on 3 rides as the queues were extremely long.",
          "Great place to relax and let the children run wild Staff accommodating Safety is of paramount in the van city life guards at every station .. food slightly ivermectin priced But lovely environment to spend the whole day. Child teen very friendly and accessible for wheel",
          "We purchased a day pass including lost chambers marine. Arrived about 10am, probably a bit late as there was quite a long wait(40 minutes) to process our tickets. Lockers available at an extra cost and you can purchase lots of other extras at the entrance. It is a massive park",
          "Good waterpark Lots of people but still we can do all attractions Free for Atlantis hotel guests as I was Nice for children but also for adults",
          "We went to collect prepaid tickets at 10am and there was already a long queue on a weekday. Once inside, the water park was very clean and all the staff we talked to were very friendly and helpful. The downside was the very expensive but low quality food.",
          "This is the best waterpark in Dubai! And seems like it's the biggest too. There was lots to do. They have awesome slides and rivers that go on forever. My kids had so much fun they didn't want to leave! I suggest one goes early though, (at opening time), as the lines get really",
          "This is a great way to spend a few days of fun when in Dubai we elected to have a spot on one of the private areas and this comes with attentive waiter service, fantastic just remember this is a big park on par with any of the Florida Water parks in fact in some ways better. We",
          "I defintely recommend any body to visit this!! it is really an exceptional experience for all sea world lovers!",
          "It was good fun. Best to make a day activity out of this and enjoy a good 5-6 hours. We did tiring activities mixed with relaxing lazy rivers one. All in all we had a good time and will go there again. But if you have a very small child there isnt much to do. In that case best",
          "You can see the aquarium and have a good meal in the self service Caleidoscop. Take the monorail to arrive (good wiews).",
          "Good water park, but the 90 minute queue for wrist bands (we had pre booked tickets), then a 20 minute queue for a locker pass spoilt the day for us somewhat. It cost us \u00a3200 for us for the day but \u00a350 of that was wasted in a queue Having said that once in we enjoyed the park,",
          "This is an amazing place with awesome waterpark and things to do for children of all ages. worth the money .",
          "Really enjoy our stay in Atlantis hotel with all my family for a special occasion, my two September birthdays kids had special treat as free entrance for waterpark and we had amazing dinner in restaurant, was treated like royalty \ud83d\ude01",
          "Good experience, but might be excellent if not a long wait )) It worth to visit great facilities! I would recommend going earlier to have more chances to visit each attraction as waiting time for some of them might take until 40 minutes especially during the tourist season.",
          "The Place is awesome and having good water Rides. The cleanliness is great. There are long waiting ques which the kids dont like. The price looks slightly high. overall is a place one can enjoy a full day.",
          "We went with our kids aged 7 and 4 and for them as well as for us adults it was a wonderful and joyous trip, which we wish to partake again. One day is not enough and i feel 2 days should be sufficient to enjoy the park.",
          "Great waterpark with fantastic rides. Went in the off season when it was quieter which made it easier to try everything",
          "We loved it here but the prices are sky high. We were lucky to book it with a large discount as they were running a promotion on their website. Would highly recommend if the prices are cheaper. Otherwise our second best ever water park is Wild Wadi.",
          "Worth going once, however in no rush to return. The facility is impressive, the rides are excellent when you eventually get on them and the park is well spread to cater for all needs. However, it opens from 10 until 5.30 and due to extremely long queues this time is nowhere near",
          "Came here for a day whilst on holiday to dubai. The experience was great. I wasnt expecting much as I've been to similar places I the usa and Europe and always had bad experiences. However I was wrong. The queues for the slides were short and fast moving, so no standing for",
          "The long wait in the queues were well worth the water rides. Especially Poseidon's revenge, you can feel the adrenaline pumping!",
          "Our son recommended us going here. I was a little dubious as to how much I would be able to do due to medical issues. However I have to say I was amazed how much there was to offer. I have never been a fan of fast rides but have to say I pushed myself to go on some and was not",
          "Water park with amazing rides for all small kids to adults all will enjoy. But all costumes and water shoes and socks very expensive. Carry ur own or will have to pay large amt. Too much queues for tkts avoid Diwali vacations and holidays. Aquarium is must match",
          "We got there but didn't have no idea which way to go. After a few mins of waling around we finally got to what was a massive queue to the waterpark gates. We must have waited 20mins. and got the entrance of the admissions. Even though we had pre paid tickets it made no",
          "After reading details on the website I booked 3 adult tickets, 2 for my husband and I and 1 for my Son. The website stated that if children are over 120 cm they are then allowed on all rides and classed as an adult. In the UK we have merlin passes and have been to all the theme",
          "We booked this via viator, so did save \u00a310 but it was still expensive water park. We arrived at 10.15 we then had to queue another 45 mins for are wristbands. Once in you then had to find a sunbed, luckily we found the beach and there was plenty of beds with umbrellas. We",
          "Either go with express pass or low rush days otherwise you will be spending your whole time standing in the queue. In the full day I was able to go into 2 rides only, rest waiting waiting waiting in the queue..",
          "Be prepared for masses as this is one of the top attractions in Dubai. Even with pre-booked tickets we had to queue for an hour to collect wristbands and get a locker. The top slides had a queue time over an hour, we queued about 45 mins for the family ride Aquaconda and",
          "We visited the park twice during our stay and it was really amazing. Some of the best water rides I've seen, and the lazy river really is stunning (hold on during the rapids if you don't want to tip over like I did). The only downside was it seems pretty poorly organised. We",
          "This was great, the facilities are clean and well organised although i had a problem with a locker. This was quickly sorted. The rides were great fun and enjoyed most days as we were staying in the hotel. The lazy river links to a number of the rides so worth reviewing the",
          "Went there by taxi, 2 persons, we paid 29 AED and return 31. Way better than waiting for the monorail, and not beeing crowded. Arrived at the park at 9 45 and by 15:00 we had done all the rides. The rapids are not that rapid, but funn. The tower near the Delphin place has the",
          "We (2 adults, 2 kids 6/7y) arrived by car on a working day. Bought ticket online via a ticket broker (saved 70,- EUR for 4x combined ticket: aquapark & aquarium) and transferred it to entry badges at the bus shuttle stop (just ahead of Atlantis hotel). Shuttle drove us to mono",
          "One feels in the water totally different in several ways. Imagine: 500 m of private beach. As an animal lover I was able to approach dolphins, sea lions, sharks and stingrays. I advise you to do it at your pace without haste.",
          "It was a waste of time we had stayed at the Atlantis hotel 4 years ago and the waterpark was never this busy and never had to queue, we went to the waterpark on the 30th of October we had already pre booked our tickets at our hotel and paid \u00a3105 for two of us we were told just",
          "We were staying at the amazing Sofitel the Palm so decided to visit the famous Atlantis water park. My daughters aged 13 and 15 had both googled it !. We prebooked online with the park before and had a couple of questions that they answered immediately \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffbI was worried about",
          "After reading many reviews that warned about long lines, we begrudgingly bought the Aquaexpress pass. You can buy online, at the park or in the park. It cost more than what we paid in admission per ticket! However, it was \u201cworth\u201d it in terms of allowing us to enjoy our day and",
          "We pre bought the tickets from the hotel with the hope of avoiding the queues.... no such luck. When we saw the queues we asked if we could go to the queue for the pre booked but we were in it. Everyone was hot and bothered and fed up.... we got to the front of the queue after",
          "Very disappointed for what we paid for entry, queue to enter the park was huge and took forever, everything is an extra cost for guaranteed sun beds or lockers etc. We struggled to find anywhere to sit. Lack of rubber rings for the attraction due to how busy it was (we were",
          "This was the best place which has the best activities, there were very many it was my choice to go in to a river which brought me to onother place which is different from where I started. I didnt spent more time there because we were about going to a dhow cruise dinner in",
          "This water park would be great if it wasn\u2019t for the queues. They only let you on the rides if there aren\u2019t any people with fast track queuing. Most rides had an hour queue at least. If you want to lay for fast track go as the rides are great, but if not, I really wouldn\u2019t bother",
          "The place was clean and well staffed . U will feel safe . Must visit if u have kids or kids Inside you .",
          "We first visited here as a couple not long after it first opened and had good memories, we waned to take our 7 year old Son to share the park with him. We Pre-booked tickets but still had to queue 50 mins to get in. Everything is as extra cost, lockers are \u00a35. You can pay extra",
          "This place was very crowded and the queues for the rides were insane and having to wait at least one hour for the rides apart from the family rides (15-20 minutes) was awful. For one of the rides we had to wait an incredible 1 hour and 45 minutes !! We arrived at Atlantis at",
          "Having visited Aquaventure previously I was disappointed to see how much the customer service has slipped, considering the tickets are not cheap... On arrival in the morning even though there are multiple counters only 3 were open so long queues had formed by the 10am opening",
          "We preferred this over Wild Wadi. The lazy river goes on for ever. Plenty of sun loungers available if you get there early. Take your own beach towel if you can as there is a charge but you do need to get a locker which again is a charge. All the food outlets take cards.",
          "Arrived at 10.30am left at 6pm. In that time we spent over 1 hour queing to get in, Half hour finding sun beds. One hour queing for thr first ride only for it to breakdown. Over hour hour queing for food. Two further hours queing for 2 more rides. In summary over \u00a3550 spent in a",
          "Spent my 60th birthday at the waterpark. Had a great time, queues for rides no problem. Did leap of faith ride and a few others. Very clean and well supervised. Great beach area of which I spent a great deal of my time there",
          "One of the gigantic water parks in the world. We paid for a full day ticket which entitled us to visit theAquaconda, Poseidon's revenge, Zoomerango, Siltherine, The leap of faith. All the above are based at the waterpark, the adventure is adrenaline pumping and the ques are",
          "Took the family (2 adults and 2 kids 8 and 9) to the park yesterday and had a fabulous day. Order tickets online before, got there at just after 9. Small queue to get tickets and decided to pay for the fast passes due to previous reviews on here about this week. Yes they are",
          "I cannot say this has been the best day out in Dubai. The Aquapark is very nice, but unless you purchase fast track, you queue forever. We went on a weekday expecting moderate numbers. How wrong I was. It maybe because it was school holidays, but I do not know. I Would",
          "We visited the water park as my other half loves them, however, it was me that ended up being pleasantly surprised. The lazy river and river rapids were a lot of fun and so different to anything I\u2019ve experienced before. The variety of rides was brilliant, and whilst the",
          "Rides were fun. Some long lines but worth every penny spent. I got to experience the leap of faith slide.",
          "Very little to do or see! For the price we paid we spent 20 minutes there! Would not recommend you spend the money on this",
          "I would like to recommendation for Entrance. Customers who bought pre admission tickets should able to get hand bands by self service Machine similar as when printing a boarding pass at the airport. This will solve the long delay lines for entering the park.",
          "We have been visiting many parks in Europe and US. Atlantis was quite let down. Basically you have to pay 200 eur per person to avoid queus otherwise you will be waiting 60-70min to get in ride. There was plenty of staff and park was clean. I would have spend the money to",
          "Nice water park, with minimal waiting time for the attractions. In the overall, the attractions are well maintained, the staff is nice, and service is very good. The number of lifeguards I would say is excellent, as all the rides were having more than enough eyes to control the",
          "We visited here regularly because we was staying at the Atlantis and our kids (11 and 7) loved it. There was rides for us to do us a family and separatly, there was life guards everywhere too.",
          "Never been so disappointed! The queues were horrendous and only managed to go on 4 rides despite arriving at 11am!! And thank goodness we had a big breakfast before arriving because we did not even stop for lunch or go buy a drink! Yes, extreme but you would do so if you\u2019re",
          "Despite buying tickets online, we still needed to queue for over an hour to get our entry tickets into the park - not overly sure what the point in buying online is except saving a little. Waiting for an hour is hardly the ideal start to the day. What I don\u2019t understand is how",
          "This was the second time we visited Aquaventure and once again we had loads of fun. There is a dedicated young children's play area which our daughter loved. As hotel guests we were able to use the fast track into the park which meant no queing :-) If you are not a guest, be",
          "Great rides, pleasant staff, but gets very crowded understandably because it's a popular destination. Go in weekdays",
          "We went to the Atlantis for the weekend and had an opportunity to visit teh water park. Create memories, take those selfies as you slide and have lasting memories. The quality of the photos is amazing!!! Wish to visit again",
          "We had a great day at the park, we first did the Scuba diving encounter at Dolphin Bay then moved onto the park for the rest of the day. We braved the Leap of Faith and Poseidon\u2019s revenge (twice) and a few of the smaller rides. The longest we queued for was 40 minutes which was",
          "Located right by the Atlantis hotel. The park has rides for everyone. We enjoyed trips down the lazy river and rapids. The concrete does get quite warm, so bring your water shoes. The lines for the popular rides will get quite long. One area to improve upon is listing weight",
          "very beautiful place with good and fantastic riders .nice clean beach .aware that 2 separate part with many riders so be careful to visit both part.",
          "We went there in May 2019 and it was very busy which meant big queues for the attractions, the food, the chairs and the buoys as well. Will try again to see if it was a once off or it is always like this",
          "We went to the park on the 24th of October 2019 and had looked forward to it after a little research and looking up previous reviews which said it was the best Park in Dubai. We decided to buy our tickets at the ticket office, the queues were long as you would expect but made",
          "Expensive if you pay on the door but lots of deals around. The lazy river is the best I\u2019ve been on, with waves, rapids etc not very lazy! Water slides are good fun, as good as parks in Cyprus. The lockers are 55 AED and very small, so leave valuables at home! We went on a",
          "hi guys me again there are a few water parks I've visited this place is the best a day will be short it was the most amazing time we had it really is a must visit enjoy.",
          "We travelled during half term in October, the Fast track is called Aquaexpress and costs around 395Aed each. We found it to be worth it otherwise youd be paying to queue for most of the day. We overheard one family saying that they had only been in about 4 rides all day... we",
          "I\u2019ve visited Atlantis several times, and the first time in the water park , it\u2019s amazing lots to do and see, I didn\u2019t go on the tallest one but I loved the lazy river. Excellent water park",
          "Unless you are prepared to pay extra for fast passes I would recommend that you save your money and spend it on one of the other experiences in Dubai, as you will just spend your whole day queuing whilst the fast pass holders walk by with a smile! We arrived at 10.10am and",
          "Over priced and extremely long wait to get onto rides unless you buy fast passes at a extremely high price.",
          "Fantastic day at water park for all. Do start early and do the most popular slides first as the lines get long later in",
          "Our teenage son loves a water park and we have visited several around the world including Portugal and Florida ... this is one of the best!",
          "Its a good day out but not as good as the reviews make out. If you've been to Blizzard Beach or Typhoon Lagoon, they're an 8.5/10 where as Atlantis is 7/10 There are two main focal points 1. Tower of Neptune - 3/6 rides are the same just on different floor levels. Shark Attack",
          "Be prepared for blatant discrimination by staff members based on the colour of your skin and ethnicity (Indian), otherwise fun and enjoyable day out with the family",
          "This place is great to visit as a family, something for everyone from the lazy river to relax to the thrill seeking slides for those who dare. Food and drinks are expensive here as you can imagine, my tip would be to eat at Baracuda as they have an excellent choice ranging",
          "The water park was the most enjoyable activity we did during our trip. The euphoria of every ride was palpable. My girls thought i wouldn't participate because of my age but i couldn't let them enjoy it all alone so i went on all the rides bar 2. I must say we thoroughly enjoyed",
          "I had an offer for Atlantis waterpark, in the offer poster there was blackout days but they weren\u2019t clear, so I contacted their call center with my friends and put it on speaker maybe 2 weeks before I went there : I asked if the blackout days are between 18-oct and 2-nov or",
          "This is our third year in a row enjoying Aquaventure. Two of our children are just a fraction below the strict 1.2m height requirement for most of the slides which does take away from our fun slightly, even though I think Shark Attack is much more tame than Zomerango (which they",
          "It was actually pretty good! I had lower expectations. Rides were fun! I went in the hot season and on a Thursday, so i believe it was not that busy at that time of the year. That means the waiting for the rides was not a lot. The more extreme rides were very cool and since lot",
          "I have been here many times and I would say that this waterpark has completely everything you need if you\u2019re looking for a waterpark! I have been to some other ones in Dubai like Wadi and Laguna Park and I would say that to be honest all the waterparks in Dubai are brilliant.",
          "Waterpark was great, lots to do for all the family. Our favourite was Zoomrango! Unfortunately my 6 year old daughter didn\u2019t enjoy it so didn\u2019t manage to do the whole park. Would like to go back though.",
          "A day in this water park is amazing. So much activities you can do with some really challenging ones like the leap of faith and revenge of Poseidon. We spend the whole day there and even it was not very crowded we did buy an express ticket. It really is worth its money, we had",
          "The Atlantis Aquaventure Waterpark affords several exciting water rides for both children and adults. Good food stalls are on site, though quite pricey. A fun day out for the whole family!",
          "On the plus side, the park has a lot of great rides for all ages, the wait times are not too long (in October at least) and it is well staffed and feels safe with all the lifeguards around. On the down side, pricing and discounts are not transparent. It wasn\u2019t clear that",
          "Dont miss going to the park with friends or family..many kinds of adventure available round year not to be missed specially in summer time.",
          "Went for the day. Dolphin experience worth every penny, interesting, staff excellent and very knowledgeable. Spent the day at the park, had lunch and went on rides. Overall a great experience.",
          "Myself, husband and our 3 year old son took part in a dolphin encounter which included our entry to the park. The dolphin encounter was lovely, and the dolphins seemed to be very well loved and cared for and had a real bond with their trainers. The only thing that let this down",
          "I had researched prices on the website and found a residents offer for 199dhs each. We arrived at the hotel and could not figure out where to park. It was badly sign posted. We asked a security guard who told us which direction to go. He told us valet parking would be 150dhs or",
          "Staying at Atlantis hotel we were going every day. My kids of 12 and 10 years old had great time. Lots of activities and expensive bars/restaurants.",
          "Large, fully-equipped water park. The weather does not feel that hot there, so it's a good place to spend most hot hours of the day. But also consider that it's least crowded in the early morning. Quite long and Interesting lazy river. Their own beach (with almost no one there).",
          "Family visit with ages from 1-57. There literally is something for everyone here. The life guards were brilliant in the tiddlers section, playing with all 3 of our grandchildren ages 1-6. Couldn\u2019t recommend enough for a great family day out.",
          "Nice water park with superb rides.we enjoyed the shark ride and storm. we have water fountain for kids to enjoy.Excellent!!!!",
          "Had lots of fun at this water park. Good day out. Best to take your own towels unless you want to get charged. And best to book online to make life a little easier. Really good water slides and an enjoyable day.",
          "Good location for adventure - highly recommended to buy an Aqua express ticket to skip the line. Overall for that what was offered really expensive but it's Dubai. If you have the money you have one or two days full of adventure - combined with Lost Chambers and dolphin shows -",

          "We had a fantastic day!! All the slides were great- with little to no queues which was a bonus! Would highly recommend!",
          "One of the best I ve been So much to do and see. Lazy river is a highlight. Facilities excellent Service good",
          "We spent the whole day from opening to sunset in the park. The place is spacious and well kept. Rides are good fun, and everyone will find something that suites his need for adrenaline and level of courage. Changing rooms should have more showers. Food ok and fair priced.",
          "Me and my family where at the water park on Saturday 5th October 2019 when I was walking on the stairs going from one part of the lazy river to another part of the lazy river, making my way on the stairs there was a rock that should not of been there and could only see it once",
          "The rides are amazing, lines can be long- but generally go quite quick- definitely for all lovers of water parks and adrenaline rush- Poseidons tower has to be done- also note that some rides have a weight limit- as in if you are below the weight required you aren\u2019t allowed and",
          "Amazing waterpark which is huge but gets really busy. You could get a fast track ticket to beat the queues but it all adds up quickly. The rides are amazing but be prepared to walk up a whole load of stairs everytime. Hardest rides were leap of faith and Poseidons revenge",
          "Loads of rides and not too far to get between them. We got Premium beds to use as a base and leave our stuff which was handy, it also meant that we had someone take food and drink orders and deliver to our bed! It is expensive but you can sometimes get discounts from the hotel",
          "Very nice acquapark Plenty of activities Too many people Tickets machines at the entrance often don't work properly Even if you have the reservation you have to stay in line for 1 hour before to get in. So useless to book in advance, no discount at all",
          "We purchased the Fastpass for both days of our two-day experience. Over two days, with the extra for the fastpass, we spent an inordinate amount of money (approx US$ 1,500) but it was a great experience and we weren\u2019t expecting Dubai to be cheap... We also did the snorkel",
          "This is another reasons why u need to visit Dubai. the Atlantis is shining , shimmering, splendid thing. You cannot imagine how they create this structure with so much wonderful imagination. Really u cannot explain the joy of excitement.",
          "Great day out at the water park with access to the private beach. Swimming in the sea was glorious and it was so warm it was like taking a bath. Rides were great and we had such fun on rides such as Storm and Leap of Faith. Food prices expensive and so would advise you take",
          "A brilliant water park with everything you can want in water park from lazy rivers (if you can call them lazy with rapids and torrents!) that go on for great lengths, surfing, flumes through shark/ rays infested waters, fast flumes, wave pools and loads of rubber tube rides.",
          "This is a really wonderful water park, the only problem is that you have to watch what time of year you visit as the temperature in Dubai is too hot to stay out in the summer months so you won't get your moneys worth if you book then as its 40+++. degrees. In the cooler months",
          "A lot of different attraction for all level of fear haha! I recommend but don't put more than 75euros in your ticket",
          "From the moment we arrived here I had the feeling of being ripped off. Dubai is an expensive place to visit but this visit ended up costing double what we paid to visit the other main attractions (Marina, Dubai Ski). We were even charged 40 Dhs each for a beach towel to cover",
          "The queues can be really long and I figured I\u2019d be here for an hour or two but ended up staying a whole day and doing every ride! I\u2019ll still have palpitations about Poseidon\u2019s revenge..... the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever done! But then you can totally chill on an inflatable around",
          "Must visit place. We had a fantastic evening and pool rides. Highly recommend place to visit for all groups of Age. Thank you Atlantis",
          "visited the water park with two teenagers an I t costed us over 330 euro just to get inn to the park. When we arrived we had to stand in line for 20 minutes to get the wristband that we had to use to get inn to the facilities, even if the tickets where prepaid online in",
          "Spent the entire day at Atlantis from a morning of the slides to an incredible dolphin experience with the royal swim package the back to the slides and lazy river. The day was full of fun and queues were not to big. Was one of the most enjoyable days out I can remember! We",
          "This is a real nice park to spend the day. We thought the park is a bigger based on the folders but nice enough for 1 day. the rides are fun and there is ahold combination to relax and having fun. if your birthday is in the week you want to go then register and you get free",
          "Loads of fun to be had here. Try as many rides and slides as you can I'd say. Didn't do so many pics as I could as was too busy having fun times.",
          "One of the best family days out of our holiday. All the staff are excellent. We attended on a Sunday and the line ups were very short. Plenty of shade and cold water. This place is a MUST DO when in Dubai",
          "We visited this place on a saturday thinking that it would be packed and would have to que for hours for the slides but how wrong we was. The longest it took us was about 20 mins so we managed to do tgem all twice. Like some other reviewers have said the floor does get got so i",
          "In the heat of Dubai spending the day in the water is a good idea! There were lots of rides suitable for all ages and fear levels and we really enjoyed our day there. There are also some lovely views back across to Dubai if you head down to the beach area. Only downsides were",
          "Had a free day to spent, so we decided to visit Atlantis waterpark.What fun day that was with the kids. From small to big kids, the enjoyment was present the whole day. Breath taking slides,passing underwater in a tube where sharks swin around. No bigger thrill...Sure wil be",
          "One of the best water parks with amazing slides, adventures. A whole day is needed to explore the park completely so it is advised to be early to enjoy it to max. All the slides are amazing & full of thrill. Very well managed & organised with safety being the top priority.",
          "We spent the whole day at the waterpark and didn\u2019t get a chance to do everything! There is something for all ages and the slides are great, both tubing and body slides. The food on site is slightly expensive but to be expected at any waterpark/theme park. Saying that the food",
          "Great facilities for any age. There is enough space to accommodate the visitors without hassle. Let's not forget the beach area for a bit rest from the activities on offer. It is a must visit.",
          "This place is very good for all ages but all product and food sold are way overpriced. I have been coming hear once a year and this place does need attention in a few places, the smaller kids area is starting to show signs of wear which will cause trip hazards. Maybe this place",
          "Many things to do, most of them quite good. For sure you will not be dissapointed. The ride to the Atlantis is also enjoyable.",
          "We had a good family day out here during our holiday in Dubai. This is our second visit as we also visited this time last year. The park was not to busy and did not have to wait to long for any of the rides. Staff are always helpful and friendly.",
          "OMG what a fun place to spend an afternoon with your friends. I didn't wanna leave, It is not cheap but it is worth it!",
          "This place left us underwhelmed from the badly managed and slow check in on the prepaid tickets to the smelly toilets that you don\u2019t expect to get in Dubai The place felt grubby in general and in need of an overhaul - also based on the number and length of rides I\u2019d say it\u2019s",
          "During weekends management knows lot of people will come but still for time adjustment they will make stuck at entry ticketing queues with or without online booking also .",

          "What fun it is to experience this delightful water park with family and friends. There is so much to see and do there. It is really magnificent and well worth the visit.",
          "This is must do when you come to DXB. While I am not much of a water park person I had enjoyed this one the most. The reason behind this that you could always lay back and chill by the beach at any time and all is provided for you at no extra cost. As a mum if teens and each",
          "sadly the hype that is placed upon Atlantis and what you receive is very very disappointing! Firstly in order to sit in a few of the places you need to pay a premium fee, even tho we stayed in the regal suite, we were still asked to pay. There is not exactly a variety of \"wow\"",
          "While I enjoyed my time at the Atlantis Aquaventure Waterpark, it\u2019s important to book your tickets online before you arrive as the price on the day is more expensive. As the pavement is hot, buy yourself some aqua shoes before you arrive as they are expensive to buy on site.",
          "If you like water parks then this is a must, great slides and a lazy river to die for, worth every penny.",
          "a gorgeous hotel u will see with the around the palm cruising its very romantic hotel with a heartshape in the middle",
          "Really good day out. Not long to wait for rides. Nice clean changing rooms and facilities. Only downside is the drinks and food were really expensive.",
          "We stayed at the Atlantis for three nights with our 9 year old son. It was a very expensive and over priced stay. We ordered room service and paid $50 Australian dollars for a slice of French toast and porriage, what a joke. The room itself is spacious but a little outdated,",
          "Very nice place for your family they can enjoy it the rides are amazing every thing is nice and beautiful",
          "Thats very expensive place to be Very hot place and many people, too many people Staff are unable to cater for the required level of service",
          "Fun day with plenty of rides, some with longer cues than others as expected. Could get rather expensive if taking the entire family, but a good way to spend the day.",
          "First I recommend you to consider the time you travel because it could be too warm! but I had a good time of trip so it was not that warm so I was enough fine by the weather ! So just I was not that lucky about this place because in 2017 several of the fun things there were",
          "Me and my husband went here with no kids we had a ball, the longest we waited to get on a slide was no longer than 20minutes it was boss. Because it was my birthday I went online and printed the birthday voucher out I got into the water park for FREE, so if it\u2019s ur birthdays",

          "Atlantis Hotel is huge and you need a buggy ride to take you to a wristband booth for entry! Then the buggy will take you to the entrance! You also need to pay for a locket, a small one is plenty! You also need to pay for towel if needed! We all want to take pictures so bring",
          "Although it was a very hot day, I really enjoyed the water park fun. It is a world class resort and the thrill rides are fun! I recommend to bring water shoes to go from one ride to another as flip flops are usually left in a storage drawer at the bottom of a ride and concrete",
          "we were there around 10 am, just checked our pre-purchased tickets through my mobile phone, gave us a bracelet which was our key to enter, to use lockers and even see the photos. we had a small locker for 45 AED which i could put a large 40 lit backpack in it and my husband's",

          "We stayed at Atlantis for 5 nights and the first thing we had planned to do when we got there was Dolphin Bay and Aquaventure park..It's a good idea to get a big locker for storing all your stuff. Then the fun really starts! We tried all the different sections and the best part",
          "We visited the Atlantis water park on our honeymoon. We were underwhelmed with the experience. We firstly did the dolphin experience which we would highly recommend and alone would rate as 5 stars. The rest of the park was extremely crowded and the ques for the rides were long",
          "Noway, last time I visit. You need to stand hours in line to engage into a drop. Too crowded it's like doing pilgrimage! no good places to settle down, you have to keep running, no feeling of safety here in the middle of the rush, they have to maintain a maximum number of",
          "We had prepaid tickets and they did let us wait for more than 45min just to get the wristband to get access. There were countles people waiting and they had only two counter open! To me a real offend and cheat! This is poor management at its best. Will never go back there.",
          "Disappointment for visiting, except maybe for kids or someone who never seen similar Aquarium. A long ride from the city (airport), takes 3 transfers, metro, tram and monorail ($$$) to get there, almost 2 hours. Hotel itself is not amazing or glamours compare to many other",
          "Visited twice during our 5 day stay at the Atlantis hotel and lucky for us entry was free as residents. As 2 adults in their 40s we had the best time. Place is huge, spotless and loads of life guards everywhere. Highlights for us were Zoomerango, Storm and Aquaconda. Also",

          "we really enjoyed at aqauanture waterpark, very pleasant environment and had many slides for any age of person",
          "Had a fantastic day here, entering the park with a pre purchased ticket was easy enough. Bought locker which was easy to use and also got wristband where I could put money on so didn\u2019t have to carry cash or card around which made the day easier! Lazy river was absolutely",

          "Everything was better than expected. The rides we're fun and a bit scary. Maybe I got lucky, but the queues we're pretty small. Don't forget to ask for a tower when you leave your hotel, renting is expensive.",
          "Hands down the best aqua park in Dubai, maybe the whole Middle East! It is huge- hence keep your day free if you\u2019re visiting; plenty of slides- and a beach to relax at. It is a bit pricey, even for residents, but definitely worth a visit at least once! A great day out.",

I recommend any other park",

          "Loved it a lot. There are so many slides to choose from, we went there 5 times already but still haven't managed to ride all the slides yet. The annual pass for this waterpark is quite a good choice for Dubai residents, since you have unlimited entries for a year and it only costs about DH990 for an adult and DH450 for kids.",
          "Great water park and it's about to get bigger and better given the expansion plans. I do hope though that their water be more temperature controlled so everyone can enjoy it all year round!",

          "Great place absolute bargain season pass. Foods expensive but capturing the tourist market I guess. Some better choices of food would be great. We live in a massively diverse culture. Yet all we can get it's Burgers and a pretty meh salad bowl.",

          "The park itself is great and filled with lots of funbut they need to train their staff inside to be more hospitable. They are just making stupid faces if you ask any questions or directions. It looks like they are not getting paid enough and that's why completely demotivated and having low moral.",
          "We loved it lot & enjoyed whole day. Especially for kids have separate area to spend more time with them. Family rides can't take all kids have some height restrictions. Apart from that all fine.",

          "Here will enjoy almost ALL the pleasures you can think of while in the cleanest waters if this place. You can even walk while in the waterpark, to the beach and enjoy the sea if Dubai. There are free transportation to move you around that \u2026",

          "Worst experience ever, too many people, 2 hour waits for rides, pool water smells like urine, and staff is so busy to attend to anyone.\n\nNot sure what happened with Atlantis, but the quality level DEFINITELY dropped since they opened, and is NOTHING like its Bahamian counterpart",
          "I enjoyed the place like i ve never been to a water park,the best  ever.",

          "Best water park I have ever visited. They have everything, and aquarium too.\n\nFeeding and hugging dolphins we didn\u2019t do, if you have small kid, you have to accompany, this makes almost 1000$ for two. \n\nBest to bring along some snacks, prices are a bit high.",
          "Wonderful, chill and a very fun experience! Definitely a must try!",
          "Amazing water park. Access was included in the hotel stay, I would recommend trying all the slides at least once.

They have a package for everyone. I will always go back",

          "Fantastic resort and facilities highly recommend this during Dubai winter season when the weather is bearable. Queuing times I found were short as they were very efficient in keeping the flow of people moving freely. Staff are very friendly and attentive.

          "I have visited 3 times now all of the slides are fantastic and thrilling. One area of improvement could be the changing rooms which i feel are a bit small and also the shower wasn't working in one of the bathrooms. Otherwise the experience was fantastic . Must visit for anyone going to dubai.",

          "Water park is good but adhere to the swimming costume or nylon clothes only, better to buy before as the prices inside the park are higher",
          "Really good to cool down here - especially during summer as there are several water slides and the park is currently under renovation to add in more slides. They have the best lazy rivers and rapids. Do be careful though when the temperature gets too high, the water part gets very hot as everything is concrete.",

          "Not worth the entry ticktets very high rates. Food inside is costly. Rides mostly are common only leap faith is worth experiencing. Now a days beach access also they have closed because of some construction. Please mind before booking tickets.",

          "Amazing time with the kids. Better to utilize the whole day. The tower of Neptune was the best. Look around for good offers. Once you go in, you forget about the heat. You get free showers and changing rooms, but have to pay for every thing else like lockers, food, drinks ( very expensive). But overall a great experience",
          "Didn't stay at the hotel but went to this waterpark and had so much fun with my family for a day. The park was very clean but location is quite far from the city. Would recommend this when travelling to Dubai.",

          "Amazing Crowd, ambience. The way its structured, you will never get bored of it. Not too crowdy also, therefore no big lines. Extremely safe. Good restraunts inside. Little expensive, but a must visit if you have come for 1st time in Dubai.",
          "Great Waterpark with lots of exciting rides. Entrance fee is a bit steep but we'lll worth it. Food was OK but nothing special. Lockers are extra cost. Make sure you get your food vouchers if you have prepaid for meals because the automatic ticket machine doesn't generate them so you have to go to a manned till.",
          "More money for less fun. The count of attractions is undersized. If you dont have priority pass you are waiting in queues for a tenth of minutes. And today is not a weekend... It must be a hell. If you have eticket, you have to printed it. \u2026",
          "This Aquapark is big and there is so much to do!

          "Amazing! I was very impressed with the kiddies play area. Probably one of the best. My 3 year old was able to go on many slides and my 11 month old was able to walk around on his own in the pool which he loved, due to the shallow water and soft padded base.  Fun was had by all.",

        "wiki": "Legoland (trademark in uppercase as LEGOLAND) is a chain of family theme parks, which has its main focus on the construction toy system Lego. They are not fully owned by The Lego Group itself; rather they are owned and operated by the British theme park company Merlin Entertainments.\nThe Legoland Billund Resort opened in Billund, Denmark in 1968, followed by the Legoland Windsor Resort in Windsor, England in 1996. Further parks opened in Germany, Japan, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates (Dubai), and the United States (California and Florida). Parks in New York, South Korea, Shanghai, Sichuan and a Legoland Water Park at Gardaland are currently under construction.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nThe parks are marketed to families with younger children (11 and under), and although the attractions include a number of roller coasters, the roller coasters are not as numerous or as extreme as those in other parks, and there is a greater emphasis on rides suitable for younger children.\nLegoland parks are split into various areas, which are consistent among the chain's parks. For example, all six of the parks include a Lego miniland, a model village which includes models of landmarks and scenes from around the world, made from millions of genuine Lego bricks.\n\n\n=== Educational elements ===\n\nAn important aspect of Legoland is education and learning.\nExamples include:\n\nWater flow channels in which participants can construct dams from Lego blocks to understand laminar and turbulent fluid flows\nInteractive musical instruments, such as musical fountains, and the Aquatune hydraulophone, which is an underwater pipe organ in the shape of a giant  Lego block\nA Lego Mindstorms centre for fun-based learning\nDuplo Gardens (for smaller children)\nDriving area (including attractions such as Driving school, Boating school, Ballooning school, Flying school, and Fire Academy)\nMy Town\nWild Woods\nKnights' KingdomThe parks' rides are all Lego themed; many are made to appear as if they are built out of Lego bricks. They tend to be based on one particular line of Lego: for example, a popular ride at all six parks is the Dragon Coaster, which is loosely based on the Knights' Kingdom Lego sets. Another popular ride is the Driving school, in which children can drive small electric cars made to look like Lego cars around a small road network, after which they gain a mock driving licence.\nDespite the commonality of the above-mentioned attractions, the exact set of rides varies between parks, although as with the Disney parks there is some overlap.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nEurope\n\nNorth America\n\nAsia\n\n\n== Future parks ==\nNorth America\n\nAsia\n\n\n== Former parks ==\nThere was an earlier Legoland Park in Germany, from 1973 to 1976.  It was located in the city of Sierksdorf in northern Germany. In 1976, the park was sold; the former Legoland Sierksdorf is now Hansa-Park.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLegoland Discovery Centre\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website Legoland, Real Estate Investment Firm in Da Nang, Vietnam",

          "The displays throughout the park were very good. The rides were ok. Main criticism is the state of some of the displays - particularly inside with all the Dubai and middle eastern displays - looked like they hadn\u2019t been dusted in a year. They are amazing builds, but just not",
          "Probably the best time we visited Legoland. We had bit of a hick up as I had booked cheaper tickets on klook and staff kept saying they can't help me. When I showed an email from klook they seemed to recognise the QR code. Would have been great if they were familiar with the",

          "I was very disappointed to see that babies weren\u2019t allowed on any rides. Not even the tiny train ride or the submarine ride which is exactly like the one at Disneyland and that one has no height restrictions. Unfortunately this is how most parks are in the UAE. I wish they would",
          "We took our 2 sons to Legoland aged 5 and 2, it was our first visit. We had a blast! The kids really enjoyed it and my husband and I enjoyed it as well. You can get on most of the rides but they r not thrill rides. The park is targeted for a younger age group but it\u2019s really fun",

          "It was the most fun-filled and satisfying visit along with my kid and visiting sister's family from India. The kids had a great time and we had a wonderful weekend.",
          "Perfect for every thing, I was visited with my kids and they liked to much for games, gift and food hight recommmend",
          "This is a great place to spend a day with a Lego obsessed family! The highlight is the indoor mini city, the models are awesome, especially the downtown Dubai layout. The day we visited was quiet so we had little or no queue time for rides. However, having been to LegoLand in",
          "Legoland Dubai was an amazing experience for the kids and the smiles didn\u2019t fade even after our trip is over. The kids keep talking about it and remembering the fun times they had during our visit here and entire day spent and dedicated only to the children. Kids will love this",
          "Overall nicce experience, full of fun, enjoyed ride , submarine and water ride . Nice place to spend with family and children",
          "we stayed for the whole day and totally enjoyed every acitivity in the place. staff were approachable and very friendly. there were lots of things to do, less qeue when we went there because maybe it's a weekday. but overall, we were satisfied. hope to visit again soon.",
          "you will need more then 4-5 hours to check everything and let kids enjoy all the attractions. Food options were pretty limited",
          "Expat living in Dubai. Visited the park twice because I have kids. Nothing really for adults. Maybe the lego exhibit of the buildings which I think is very informative(but thats it). I suggest if you are planning to visit, alway look for a hotel stay that has a free park",
          "Go if u r a Lego fan. Go if u have nothing else to do. The price is hefty and the rides are okay but if u are one of the Lego fans, you can spend good time. The miniland is the main attraction. It is just unbelievable.Rest all is passable. I did not go to the water park so",
          "This place is definitely not for adults. The ride are very short and simple. Do not go there if you are an adult .",
          "Great place to visit with lots of rides for the kids to enjoy for a full day out. Plenty of parking close by and the staff always smiling and friendly. The only thing to be aware of is that the height restrictions in Dubai are different to the same named rides in the UK. The",
          "There is something off about this park. You start off feeling a bit down when you see barely 30 visitors in the park on a weekend at the peak tourist season. When you enter the reason becomes clearer: 1. The height restrictions are in conflict with Motiongate (a much better",
          "A lot of the activities are outside even though Dubai can get very hot. Some of the rides were not open. The place was a bit deserted except for the school group, which we did our best to avoid. The pasta buffet is great, as are the 4D movies. Be prepared for a long walk to the",
          "Timings 10am to 5pm Time duration : about 3 to 4 hours Great place for kids below 12 years. Loads of rides for that age group. Restaurants within legoland serve average food",
          "Whilst there are less rides than the UK Legoland - and there were a couple that were not open the day we visited, overall the experience was more pleasent than Windsor Legoland. No quesues and a more spacious environment. Rides which we had queued for over an hour at Windsor,",
          "This park is really for the kids. My son thoroughly enjoyed. 90% of the rides are for kids, adults can accompany the kids. Children having 105 cm height should be accompanied by an adult for most of the rides. Children having 120 cm of height can go alone for most of the rides.",
          "One of 4 parks in Abu Dhabi that creates the ambience of Indian Bollywood movies songs food culture.Opened at 2pm until 11.North Indian food at the Spicy Dhaba was good and the South Indian food at the train.Simulated rides for the whole family.",
          "I only went to this park to see what it was like as we had tickets included from the lapita hotel.we didnt go on any of the rides. Kids would love it if into lego be a bonus. There were no queues as well. If I was every to return I would probably bring my granddaughters with me.",
          "It was nice. But they should reduce the prices . As it's too much for us as we are having annual pass. And we are coming weekly. And spending too much in food and drinks. Their should be more discount for us or special offers Also my small boy he was not able to play. Most of",
          "I wasn't expecting it to be so in the outdoors...and Dubai can get really hot. It was a little bit of a let down and after a point, we got fed up of seeing legos everywhere. We had a 4-year old with us who could'nt sit on most rides so it was a let down. Please check age limits",
          "Legoland is part of Dubai parks. It is on the outskirts of Dubai city. The park is tailor made for my 5 year old kid. He had a time of his life there! We were there for almost 5 hours. Adults too would enjoy accompanying kids on the rides and activities. The way to reach Dubai",
          "Visited the Legoland with my wife and 1.5 year old daughter, and we didn't enjoy much. Let alone the 1.5 year old kid, I don't think it is worth visiting with the older kids too. There is so much little to do in the park. It definitely not worth the ticket price. We had a",
          "Kids have to be at least 110 cm of height to ride most of the attractions - they are super strict with the height. But a kid with 110cm and above will be bored by most of the attractions. Conclusion: eather the kid is to small or will be bored. Other than that park is clean,",
          "We been yesterday in Legoland Park and it was fabulous fun ! My son enjoyed and we liked that was not much people and we could go to rides without any waiting time . Fire team was great and fun . Boat and play area - amazing fun and of course my boy was happy and we come back",
          "We had a brilliant day out at Legoland with our 4 year old. We went in November and there was hardly anyone there we walked straight on every ride and went around the park twice. The staff were very friendly. The Lego displays were great. You need to be above 105cm to go on most",
          "First of all you need to know that it is an open area with some buildings So summer clothes are required Food is not allowed to bring with you Water inside is expensive 8 dirhams Food is nice open buffet for adults 59 dirhams and kids more than 3 years are 39 dirhams Lokers are",
          "The staff is unsmiling and rude nobody smile there they care only to earn money. Nothing is made from lego everything is plastic made and no lego . Do not spend your money to this fake park",
          "My son was playing with his 6-year-old brother in the lazy river when the lifeguard called him over, presumably, he didn't like how they were playing, although they weren't bothering anyone and I was watching them. This man didn\u2019t see me but I saw the whole thing. He was",
          "Very organized place.. very clean and well maintained We booked the tkts over the phone (call centre) arrived with no headache of Q. It would be much better in a cooler weather",
          "Went with my 4 year old and 18 month old, and had a couple of lovely half days. The submarine ride was brilliant as the whole family could go on it. We spent a lot of time in MiniWorld, where the lego replicas of Dubai were amazing (and air conditioned!)",
          "I'm an young kid at heart, but nothing was really catering for older kids, rides activities etc. So Fun but aimed at families with young children.",
          "Legoland is about 25km from Dubai (Al Barsha) with plenty of parking places covered against sun. There is also wifi free everywhere but count with lower speed, still good for WhatsApp and small photo. Highly recommend to make order online else you waste a lot of money. You will",
          "It is very nice and lovely place, but only for kids below 6 years. For our 7 years old it was very boring and not much activities to do. Instead i would recommend going to Motiongate.",
          "We did LEGOLAND Dubai in Early September. It was very very hot however the park was empty! We did not wait in line for one ride or for one snack! The employees were very nice and helpful the park was clean and beautiful!",
          "I had a very mixed experience at the Par. The upkeeping of the rides, overall facilities are very average standard for such a high-end & famous name. Food & Beverage offering is poor, limited & in some of the cases very cheap (in terms of quality of the products).",
          "Had a sad experience with one of the staff at the junior driving school. Legoland should invest more time in proper training of staff to not shout at customers for a misunderstanding from staff end and absence of any instructions given to the parent before starting the ride",
          "Amazing displays in the city - all the modern wonders of the world including an avenue of the tallest buildings in the world, Petrie, the Taj Mahal and the Sheikh Zayed grand Mosque Center. A v accurate replica of the Sheikh Zayed Road architecture. Truly amazing artistry.",
          "Excellent time with great attractions. Was quiet abut nonetheless I had fun. My son in particular enjoyed all the amenities the park had to offer.",
          "Buy ur tickets online before you go as a lot cheaper. If u buy the park tickets rather than single you save more. Models were amazing, average price for figures. Queues were small 3-7 min wait. Refillable drinks are very small not like Windsor legoland so if u have them",
          "We have the annual pass and take our kids there at least once a month. It is not very busy so very little time queuing... For ages 3 until 9 it is the best park in Dubai",
          "Fun rides, fun themes, no queues. The atmosphere is great. Most of the good rides are for height above 106cm. So if your kid is shorter, he/she might get disappointed at some rides. Apart from that, a must visit.",
          "This has to be one of the best attractions when in Dubai, especially for the kids,and adults too...had the time of our lives!!",
          "Almost no guests so no queuing at all. Park nicely built and a fine mix between the original Legoland and Arabian buildings. Lot of shadows outside and air condition inside. Rides still seem quite new. Primary target group must be families with children aged 3-12. Food ok,",
          "This is our third year in a row visiting Legoland in October (last year the waterpark). We went at 11am on a Sunday and were in the park until 2pm. It was very hot but good taking breaks in the Lego building areas. The park is so quiet, we maybe saw 10 other families in total,",
          "I must say that visiting this place was more than I expected. You van find something for everyone here. As long as you like LEGO. From impresive \u201cMiniland\u201d and rolercosterup to factory and shops. And if you buy double ticket for LEGOland and LEGO water park, you will save a lot",
          "We had a lovely time with our 5-year old, lots of rides suitable for that age. The representation of the world made entirely out of lego in the centre of the park is truly fantastic. Not a lot of or very good food options inside the park, so keep that in mind.",
          "A great place if you and your little ones enjoy LEGO (even if they don\u2019t), LegoLand Dubai remains one of the best places to spend your day there and enjoy all the wonderful attractions available. Playgrounds, open space for lego bricks assembly and creativity, 4D kids short",
          "A nice place to spend quality time with your family as there are a lot of activities to do. A lot of walking is needed and the hot weather does not help. Big fans like the ones at the Bangkok park is a necessity which can give some relief.",
          "Fun day at water park , pool , slides , the big lego bucket that gives you a massive shower ,very convenient summer weather (38 C ) at the water park because you spend most of the time in or around the water , but a bit hot for the theme park nowadays , my 6 yr old daughter",
          "My issue comes down to safety and environmental sustainability. On the day we went in Dubai (Thursday 3rd October) it was 42 degrees Celsius. As a family of 4 (with a pregnant wife) we took with us our 2 large (reusable) water bottles full of water. However upon entry to the",
          "Legoland Dubai and Dubai parks in general is an excellent venue for family filled fun activities. Park cleanliness is superb in comparison to many international venues I have visited.",
          "It was a nice experience of fun and food. All rides were excellent and we enjoyed full day at legoland Park.",
          "We had a great time at Legoland Water Park today. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The food was fresh and served hot with a smile. The park was quite full today but the waiting time was still not so long.",
          "Great theme park for kids and a perfect place to evoke memories on the childhood for the grownups. At least for me, it did. The best toy a kid can have used in so many different shapes and for so many uses. Some of the monumental buildings in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and from the rest",
          "Well organized, lots to do. I was concerned that only our 6 year old son would have a blast but The activities cater for all ages and we all soon got into it. The kids loved the rides. Food and beverages on site a tad pricey but given the cost of things at most theme parks is to",
          "We went in September 2019 and the resort was basically private for us as it was classed as out of season due to the heat. Lots to do, lots of fun, worth taking a look",
          "We chose Legoland Dubai perfect for our boy for his 2nd birthday. This time he could take some rides but most were height restricted but he enjoyed well .You can opt for buying tickets for just one park or both (tickets not very cheap). So we chose the park.. We enjoyed the",
          "My son has always looked forward to coming to Dubai and visiting Legoland. And we were disappointed. My son got bored with the whole park. There were basically nothing to do there. It\u2019s hot, most of the rides were close as well and shops around the park. You can see and smell",
          "The dome where the Lego models are is air conditioned, most of the rest of the park you have to walk outdoors which in the heat was not so good but the park is well worth visiting The staff were all friendly and helpful. This park is fantastic for children. You can even have a",

          "The security system of the resort has a very low standard. Reported a stolen item to guest relation, given all the details on where and the posible time frame but still unable to find the culprit though cctv camera was just right infront of the stolen place. They didnt even",
          "One time go destination.Best for winter outing as we were exhausted after 3 hours due to the summer time.",
          "Interesting place to visit with your kids especially but you need time to enjoy all the attractions,",
          "This place can be considered as one of the top way to satisfy the Children during their travel regardless the age difference",
          "Previously I was a annual card holder, for the last two years. When my annual card expires I usually go for a day and pay for an annual membership. I was very disappointed this time. The park is nice keeping in line with everything lego, however the entry price is very high I",
          "We went here as a young at heart couple. I\u2019m really suprised at the past few reviews, but we never went with young kids. Had we done so my review might have been different. We had a great day out, yes it\u2019s very hot at this time of year. But we were able to cool down quite",
          "We paid 300 DNR (approx \u00a375) return from our hotel in a taxi to this Park. We had been looking forward to it but were disappointed from the moment we entered & were ushered into a side room where a member of staff started to explain how the park worked but then cut it short as",
          "We went here with our 11 and 4 year old . We are huge Lego fans so we' were really looking forward to this park . first thing we noticed was all the fans in the park were switched off . It was 43 degrees outside and they had nothing at all to keep you cool like big fans or water",
          "What a waste of money, very few of the rides were open. The ones that were, were not suitable for our 4 year old grand daughter as she was too small ( even for the tea cups) it is advertised as a park suitable for 2-12 years, but there is very little for a 2-6 year old to do!!",
          "in General it was a really nice visit, had time to visit Legoland, Water park Legoland and didn't have enough time to check the other two parks. it was fun, especially for the kids. will definitely visit again soon.",
          "Thought we went during the summer time, we still enjoyed because of the amusement parks kid friendly environmen",
          "The rides are far too short and it\u2019s too hot. The indoor areas are air conditioned but outside there is nothing to protect you from the heat. The museum showcasing Lego versions of iconic buildings and landmarks is great but that alone is not worth coming for.",
          "Its waste of money and my children were not happy. I got two children\u2019s who just completed 3 years and two months and I was requested to pay full amount and they could not play most of the games because they are below the required length. Just make sure your children above 95",
          "I went to Legoland with my husband and children. At the entrance they search the bags to look for food. They will take your food away because they want you to buy their junk. That\u2019s simply rude and uncivilized. We are not planning to come back. In Legoland in Denmark there are",
          "Staff like Robert, makes us want to come to Legoland all the time. He is very kind and helpful. Displays are good especially if all are turned on and complete with lights, sounds and water. Food offered can have room for improvement, should make it more tasty and affordable.",
          "The theme park is lovely, staffs are helpful. Upon buying the annual ticket, the staffs there are not even helpful explaining the whereabouts of the themepark.",
          "This is a relatively new spot in Dubai, I went with my 2 little daughters (both below 3 years old). Details and quality of lego there are superb, I love the dome. Weather was extremely hot, didn\u2019t help us to enjoy. Second thing, most of games require specific tall, which",
          "Although this place is fantastic for children under the age of 6, it was still a nice visit. One of the best things to see is Miniland ( a miniature version of all the main buildings in Dubai as well as The Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi and the pyramids of Giza. You can see the",
          "I'm definitely not looking forward to go back to LEGOLAND Dubai..Very bad experience in the heat and humidity of August . The ticket price in July and August should be much less.",
          "This is no a great attraction but good place to spend time with kids while visiting Dubai. Before buying tickets make sure your kid qualifies for the rides to avoid disappointment, form many rides kids must be 105 or 122 cm tall. Definitelly go for combined tickets for Legolnd",
          "Much better than Windsor second visit in the last couple of years large area no queuing but very hot during the day!",
          "Not at the top distinction to visit if you count value for money .. terrible time in summer .. if still interested visit in winter",

          "This is our second time visit of Legoland Dubai during last 3 years. And we are happy again. Everything is really great. Children and parents are happy and had a great fun time. Customer Care Service is really excellent. Dubai Resorts and Parks, Dubai Legoland Teams are very",
          "Great time and great food. Easy to get on the rides at lunchtime - 4 pm because it is the hottest time so be prepared. But makes the ridetime easier and the waterpark a dream! Food is good prices are great and the air conditioned miniland as the central hub to return to eases",
          "We visited twice in August with our 7 year old. We had a fantastic time on both occasions. This park has many of the same attractions of the park in the UK but we had to wait for nothing which was a bonus! On several rides we just stayed on and did them multiple times, which is",
          "We enjoyed Legoland as it is aimed for smaller children. Though be advised that for children shorter than 105cm, the rides are more limited, so ideally if your children are above 105, they can take advantage of the whole park. Nevertheless when we went during a weekday it was",
          "I would say it's mainly aimed at younger children this park. My teenage daughter & friend did enjoy it but glad our tickets included the other parks as it is not somewhere I spent too long at. It was a lovely park which is ideal for younger children and would highly recommend.",
          "We're used to busy UK themed parks, this was quiet by comparison. Here over the Christmas break and could not believe how quiet it was, not worth getting fast track type tickets. The park was nicely set up for the little ones, plenty to do without being overwhelming. Combine it",
          "Kids will enjoy the rides, but not so much for the parents. There are no thrilling rides for adults, this place is kids friendly zone. Don't come during summer, you won't be having fun outside.",
          "An absolutely amazing family day out. This is a must do in Dubai if you are a family. Plenty of indoor and outdoor things to do in the heat of the day. Rides are height restricted however my 11 year old and 6 year old could ride on all the rides so perfect for smaller children.",
          "We had a visit to Dubai LEGOLAND and LEGO WATER PARK we were impressed with the whole experience lovely atmosphere green landscape everywhere ,my daughter cant stop going again and again into the lazy river,we tried all the rides ,honestly we find it more better than Florida",
          "Fun for LEGO lovers and for a family day out, with rides catered more toward the younger children. I would also say the park is lacking in atmosphere and we didn\u2019t leave feeling \u2018wowed\u2019, as with other theme parks.",
          "Visited in July with my family and we were very disappointed. The mini city was very impressive but the actual park was rubbish. Didn\u2019t have to cue for any rides but there wasn\u2019t much for my 3yr old daughter and what there was I didn\u2019t rate that well. We got the tickets free",
          "First off, if you're looking for scary, thrilling, more adult rollercoasters, this isn't the park for you. If you have younger children who are tall enough for the rides, then it's a really nice place to spend a relaxed day. But PLEASE do check the height restrictions to make",
          "Legoland Dubai has 2 parks in one: the water park and the rides one. You can opt for buying tickets for just one park or both (tickets not very cheap). So here's what i thought of both parks. Waterpark: We LOVED it! There were rides suitable for all ages. My older kids loved",
          "Got to me the worst experience in terms of staff interaction backed by a very negative attitude from the management staff on site, as a hotelier my response to guest would be to stay far far away from this park Whole point of going to a park like this is fun and really nice",
          "We visited here with our son. The place is great. The mini land inside is quite spectacular and there are some good rides my son was entertained for hours. Food is actually reasonably priced and good. Park is quiet at this time of the year so no queues.",
          "Legoland dubai is not cheap. At 245 dh per person for a family you end up paying more than a 1000 dh just to enter. Then most of the rides are closed for kids under 4 due to height restrictions. Add drinks and food on top and toys that are displayed after every ride and this",
          "A great theme park especially for those who used to spend great time with their bricks. A wonderful feeling to see so many bricks built together to create great structures. You and your kids of all ages can enjoy slow, moderate or fast rollercoaster rides, taking a boat ride,",

          "Well my 6 years old son enjoyed the park and the water park what else is there to say? He said he wants to come back and that\u2019s good enough for me!!! I enjoyed the rides as well hahahaha",
          "Really amazing place for kids, they enjoyed it a lot and we spent the whole day trying to complete all the rides and activities. The most wonderful things that the rides waiting time is ZERO, which is fantastic, as we faced this issue with other places, so you will have to wait",
          "This is a great experience but be warned that it will cost a family of four about $240 and then some. The weather is hot but the rides are shaded so that is helpful. If we had not gone to wild wadi, the day before, we would have tried the water park. It is a must for LEGO",
          "Spent the morning in the waterpark and then the afternoon in the actual park. Travelled during Ramadan and both parks were very quiet. Managed to get on all open rides and attractions. Lots of staff across both parks, attentive service and good value for entry tickets. Soft",

          "We had fun with young kids at Lego Land. There was enough to keep them entertained all day. The submarine, boats and driving where a hit! The oldest kids were 3 and 4. The height restrictions are annoying especially for some of the rides which are very tame. Therefore the kids",
          "LEGOLAND Dubai is not a bad place to entertain younger children (ages 3-8) as most of the attractions and rides are geared up towards fun for this age range. Using the Entertainer guide will normally give you a buy one get one free offer on the tickets (if still available)",
          "I planned to go to Legoland with my sister. I have two kids as six and four years old and my sister has also two kids as five and three years old. It was the most most terrible bad experience ever. After entering inside you will find out that only my six years old daughter was",

          "We visited Legoland on 5th May 2019 with our 5 year old son. The park was empty ..Maybe because it was the start of Ramadan so it worked very well for us. There is no need to take the Qpass or fast pass . We could cover all rides by 5 pm.. that's when it shuts down . There is a",
          "This place is well-priced, but it is about a 25min drive from Dubai. Legoland and the Legoland Waterpark are in the same vicinity, we chose to visit Legoland. We went off-season and all the rides were available. There are loads of activities for kids across all age groups and",

          "The theme park and water park really exceeded our expectations. Everything was well-maintained and quite accessible. September was a great month to travel to Dubai as this attraction (and many others) did not have long queues.",
          "We took our children (6y old boy & 9y old girl) and they spent the whole day having fun! It\u2019s such an amazing thematic park, with lots of activities. Definitely we will come back. And they have together a Waterpark!!!",
          "This is the 2nd Legoland we\u2019ve visited - the first one was in Malaysia a couple of years back. This place does not disappoint at all. Lots of lego displays but features more on what you can actually see in UAE. It\u2019 both an indoor and outdoor park so better be ready and put on",
          "We received complimentary tickets to go to one of the Dubai Parks and decided to go to Dubai LEGOLAND. This was a good day out, but the rides are a bit short.",
          "It\u2019s a good experience. The diversity, the friendliness, the local flair in the huge central LEGO build, the games. It\u2019s all a good experience. Entertaining for younger children. And the shops offer unique merchandise. Recommended.",
          "The water park is well maintained, proper locker facilities, prams are available, things stay safe and so are you. We took our kid's stroller and kept things at near the slides and it was all very handy. The dress code is as per UAE. There is next level Lego land which left me",
          "Legoland in Dubai is exactly what you get when you think of the name. Everything is either made with LEGO or has the LEGO theme. Of course, it is expensive (converting from ZAR) but it is a great way to spend the day with the little ones. However, under a certain height and",
          "I\u2019ll try to make a simple review for anyone looking to go to Lego Land Dubai for the first time. First don\u2019t write lego land on google maps instead Dubai Parks and resorts. Second if you have a kid less than 120cm don\u2019t go he will miss a lot of rides and keep crying as they are",
          "We loved the Legoland park at Dubai. Plenty of rides and hands on activities to keep the whole family entertained. Even the miniland had Lego blocks for kids to build their own towers. The Abu Dhabi grande mosque, burj Al Khalifa, Al-Arab and Dubai airport were some of our",

Last year we didn\u2019t go at all because my three year old was only allowed on the Duplo train and my five year old wasn\u2019t allowed on much more. My three old was allowed on",
          "Our family visited Legoland Dubai 2 days ago and we had a lovely time! The park was very very quiet and very well done. We got there right when it opened and no line-ups at all! Our kids are 4 and 6 years old and I thought was perfect for this age. We went to Disneyland Hong",

          "We are a family with teens so not the usual legoland audience but we couldn\u2019t resist dropping in because we had a multi park ticket. It was so quiet! We have Never been to a legoland without long queues so what an oasis. Lots of nostalgia as we did the rides we could fit on",
          "Perfect theme park for all ages. My son was only 2 years old when we visited Legoland and was less than 95cm. We were not able to try all the attractions because of the height requirements but we still enjoyed it a lot. We'll just be coming back when gets a little taller. The",
          "Visited here yesterday as we were not too sure about the weather. Whilst Legoland was probably a little too young for us we really loved the mini land with all the replicas of the architecture from this area. Some good fun walking around and being big kids. Motionworld was",

          "Visited on a Friday (Dubai weekend) expected it to be busy, but luckily very quiet with no queues!! Arrived at 10am and only a handful of people there. Very friendly staff and no litter. Excellent model buildings (much more impressive than Windsor). Plenty of shade and some",

          "The place is well built with all the outstanding themes and activities. My family spent a full day discovering the area and the different themes in this wonderful magical land. Entry fees are a bit high, but worth a visit for once in a lifetime.",
          "Though most of the rides and fun were for kids but we enjoyed a lot with them. All the creations in the park was made with Lego blocks including replicas of 7 wonders of the world . A beautiful and full day activities to enjoy food and eatables a little bit costly but never mind",
          "I did not know that its for kids. My bad i did not do my research. But it was fun since still im a kid at heart. Cool part was the miniature replica of dubai land marks. With the burj khalifa and dancing fountains. Rest of the rides are for kids. Only the roller coaster was the",
          "We have a 10 year old and a 3 year old. My 10 year old was bored with the thrilling rides that they do have, and my 3 year old was very disappointed that she could not go on mostly all the rides. My daughter is 94cm and she could not go on a lot of the rides. They had a plane",

          "The submarine and the dragon rides were interesting. Otherwise its a rather low key park as compared to neighbouring motiongate but still not worth it for children under 6 years. The ride coordinstors are very strict as fsr as height is concerned. This is highly comendable of",
          "There\u2019s something for everyone at legoland Dubai. It has some great lego models to look around, areas to do interactive play and then loads of rides for all ages. Plus there\u2019s the water park! It\u2019s similar to legoland Windsor but has the benefit of being in a warm, sunny climate!",
          "Young children will enjoy it, dont get the Q pass as it the rides are most of the times empty. food is below average in all restaurants even the brands outside the park. we went to fridays the menu was different and food was terrible. infants have no place for them here so they",

          "Went on a Thursday in Feb with our two young girls (6&7). Zero queues. Very well run, park and toilets super clean. Staff attentive and friendly. Food what you would expect and good. Girls ok to get on every ride/attraction. They loved it. We rented a Cabana, again good value,",
          "Lego is always fascinating and great what people can do with it, since it was invented :) Legoland Dubai is not suitable for under 4 year old. You pay for a full adult ticket for an over 2 year old but the kids cannot go on most of the rides which I find unfair as they paid a",
          "This is situated within the Dubai parks and resorts. It has a very lovely atmosphere. There is a free shuttle service from Ibn Battuta p5 parking to the resort in the morning and afternoon. After 3pm from the resort to it. We were able to travel to the Mall of Emirates by this",
          "It's definitely one of the best places we visited in Dubai. Our son is 5 yrs old and he loved it! However, if you have older kids, older than 10 then they might not enjoy it that much. Same goes for kids below 4 or who aren't fond of legos. The theme park has rides primarily",
          "The place was awesome and clean. We understand the height limit are for safety eventhough we didnt get to play most of the ride the kids enjoyed playing the blocks but of course if you want to play blocks the price is not worth it. Definitely will go here again in the next 5",

          "My daughter had 'the best day of my life' here!! It was quiet so the queues were small and she managed to ride everything she wanted to do. No real big rides for older children so this is not the park for them.",

          "Apart from the fact that you are not allowed to bring your food and are therefor forced to eat their crap I'm disappointed in the activities offered for 3 year olds. Although you pay the full price, if below 105 cm you have limited rides. At least align heights to the age you",

          "The title says it all. Lego fans will love this. My 7 year old spent one full day awestruck and played with abandon. From movies to puppet shows to rides to giant scaled Lego models it houses everything. One full day of adventure. Not to be missed.",
          "The park is perfect for kids aged 4-9, not so much for adults or teens. it has lots of child friendly rides, and very less of adult rides. Food offered within the park are expensive since no outside food is allowed inside.",

Don\u2019t base your holiday around expecting UK sized Legoland, it\u2019s tiny in comparison, very few , and only small rides, but lots of Lego displays in one indoor area,",
          "A very pleasant place. We always go there either on tuesday or wednesday. There are never many people, you do not wait and lines are short. You really enjoy the rides and games once your are there. Kids always want to go there and I think it is worth the visit even several",
          "My grandson loves Lego. I have been to Dubai about 8 times but have never ventured to any of the theme parks so this time I researched what was available. LEGOLAND popped up so I booked my ticket to LEGOLAND & took a taxi to the venue. If I had been sharing the taxi it would",
          "We had a lot of fun here. If you have kids with you they'll surely enjoy! They have 2 parks, land and waterpark, it's better if you get 2 days worth of passes since you'll be spending 1 full day in the waterpark.",
          "A great place to spend the whole day with wife and kids. The place is done up really well ... many rides for kids and lovely play areas where you can leave the kids to build things with lego while you and Mrs probably catch some time off. The central gallery has amazingly done",
          "Great Halloween atmosphere. T&T and lots of competition for the kids. My child had a great time on the rides. The ground staff are great. The fast food restaurant quantity inside legoland is below average, for the price they charge you expect good quality food.",
          "A waste of money is pardonable but a waste of our time is not.We have an annual pass for all the four parks and have been to the parks several times. Most of the rides may at best amuse a 5year old and just a couple for the older ones. Having been to the park on long weekends",

          "Up to my mid, its not worth to see. We were there with 2 kids- 7 and 8 years old girls, noone was interested. Just wasting of time and money. Better to spend more time in Motiongate and to go more than one to some attractions.",
          "We visited here as we were staying at the hotel close by which included tickets to all the theme parks. As a family (children 11 and 8 years) we all really enjoyed this park. We visited multiple times during our stay but could have completed it in a day as it wasn\u2019t busy. The",

          "The park is well maintained and is easy to navigate around. However, i felt that it was pricey for the experience it delivers to the visitors. The Mini Land section is praiseworthy with the replicas of all notable building of Dubai and other places in the Middle East. Most of",

          "Awesome place, fantabulous experience, enjoyed with family. Only difficulty you will face is after each ride you need step out, so preferably when it's cooler in Dubai this place will be great. Loved the Lego store. Lego Technic and Lego Electric was always been favourite.",

          "Spent the afternoon in Legoland at Dubai Parks went for 12 noon, it was quiet and so easy to get around, the main dome with the site\u2019s and buildings of Dubai are amazing, we enjoyed the roller coaster/submarine and lost kingdom adventure was the best, we watched a live puppet",
          "We visited here twice whilst staying at the Lapita hotel in August. Our children age 3 & 10 had a fantastic time. The Lego models are simply stunning, there is a real wow factor when you walk into Mini land. There are lots of buttons for the children to press so they can",

          "Wow what an awesome place! Miniland is amazing for adults and children alike. We visited in the off-season - height of summer so it was very hot (28-30 deg C) BUT that means there were NO QUEUES!! which was fantastic. If we were too hot outside we just sent inside to the air",

          "From my visit to Dubai. We were with children so we visited Legoland. We were amazed to see this place. They have created whole land with help of lego blocks, it sounds unbelievable right?but it\u2019s truth. Unlimited number of colourful lego blocks used beautifully to represent",
          "Today we wanted to visit this park with 5 years old son. Yesterday I checked up the opening time on the official website of Legoland (10 AM), and what a surprise was to know today after spending 80 AED on taxi that since today management decided to open Park at 1PM. Cause it's",
          "Overall the park was nice for my 3 year old daughter. But must advice if ur child is shorter than 95 CM don\u2019t come as the games they can get on wont be worth the trip. Be sure to come on a good day as the heat can kill ya. There were some shades as you walk around but still heat",
          "Excellent experience!!! Amazing rides and adventures... must visit again!! Enjoyed a lot with kiddos in water park and LEGO land dubai.. huge water slides and rides were very good and spacious enough !!",

          "Avoid during summer and come during winter. We have an annual pass and it was worth it. Ages 4- 8 would love this place. It is also cheaper to buy lego rather from outside. They also have sales on lego.",
          "You know what you are getting with Legoland and this one is fairly generic. However, there is something for all ages, the park is immaculate, well maintained and managed with lots of shade. We hardly waited for any rides. They are very health and safety conscious so height",

          "Took my daughters to legoland. We had a lot of fun. Miniland was really nice. As for the park, i think it could handle more rides/stuff to do. I thought given the size and publicity, it would have more to offer. I\u2019m assuming that since it\u2019s new it might have more additions in",
          "Took my twins (5 years old) for the Easter celebrations and it was fantastic, the egg hunt was lovely and the flower making was quite daunting but the staff were of hand to help. All the family really enjoyed the trip. We will return when they are celebrating another occasion",
          "I recently took my 2 year old son to Legloand Dubai and was pleasantly surprised at how well it has been done. From parking to getting around the park, the system is very efficient (reminiscent of Disney actually). There is plenty for little ones to do - I would recommend the",
          "Nice attractions area that you can enjoy with your young kids (from 3 to 8 years). If you're older, you need to be a LEGO's fan to enjoy the park and all the details made with LEGO bricks. The center of the park is very impressive with a MiniDubai as well as some other popular",

          "You must pay and pay and pay... The parking entrance is 20 AED and 235 AED for the park. A bottle of water is 6 and a margarita pizza is 45! Even if it is something special; this prices were acceptable. But it was not a wow really.",

          "On our day trip to Dubai parks and resorts we bought a two park ticket and used the new monthly entertainer voucher. We planned the day thinking that we should go to legoland first because we wouldn\u2019t spend as much time in there as motiongate but we planned wrong. We stayed in",
          "We had an amazing time. We didn't have to pay for our 3 year old which was a bonus. No queues for any of the rides so we were even more efficient. We still spent all day here. Our 3 year old son was the perfect height to just about go on most rides. May be worth checking this",
          "I took my 4 year old son to Legoland Dubai recently. I purchased the tickets online (Dhs 165 for GCC residents + additional 10% discount if you book 3 days in advance) after hearing about the slow queues at the ticket booths. We arrived at opening time (10am) and found 30-40",

          "The travel time from the city to legoland is almost an hour. There is a free shuttle from the city to the park in the morning at 10 am & return at 8 pm. if you are planning to do two parks then you can choose to return by the 8.00 pm shuttle as one park can get covered in around",
          "The park is lovely and very nice for lego lovers, we went thursday morning so there were no ques at all and the food prices is fair as in all theme parks and also they have an offer all you can eat and drink for 90 aed. The disasvantage is that tyhe rides are only for the young",
          "We went there in March 2018 with 2 kids aged 6 and 9 years We bought the tix only for Lego land and not the other parks . We picked up our tix at the counters ( they accept only cards and have a special rate for gcc residents) The highlight of this trip was definitely the mini",
          "We paid 500aed to take our 2 year old and he was turned away from 90% of the slides, even ones that I would put a baby on. We were not allowed on the family flume due to his size and the wave pool was closed. The staff were unhelpful and we left with a very upset little boy.",
          "We live in Dubai. When our 2 grandchildren (aged 2 and 5 years) came to stay this prompted us to go for the first time. I thought Legoland was fantastic for the older grandson and enjoyable for the younger granddaughter. It massively exceeded my expectations and actually now",
          "We have a Lego crazy three year old. We had an amazing day here. From previous reviews I was expecting it to be like the Windsor site, but it wasn't. A few rides were the same. But it all felt different and fresh. We loved how quiet it was compared to Windsor. We went on",
          "Amazing park. It is very good for kids from age 3 until teenage. The adults will enjoy it as well may be more than kids. It takes only one day to ride all the games.",
          "We are coming here with kids regularly. It\u2019s nice entertainment for all ages. The smaller one likes the driving school, the LEGO cubes everywhere to play, submarine and many others. The older one can enjoy the roller coasters, water attractions etc. I don\u2019t like the food options",
          "LEGOLAND is part of Dubai parks which has 4 parks in one so get the full park ticket not just the one for LEGOLAND. this will get you into LEGOLAND, water park , motiongate and Bollywood. the annual tickets are worth the money if you want to go more than once. LEGOLAND is for",

          "Bigger kiddos may not like but my 7year and 9year did. Many of the rides and playgrounds has roofs so it\u2019s nice when kids are not in the sun all the time. Visited here on a Tuesday, maybe that\u2019s why it was so empty. But I won\u2019t complain, there was no lines to anything!",
          "Legoland is nice for a half day perhaps, but I was expecting a much bigger attraction before arriving at Dubai Parks. The park seems to be struggling with footfall and hence our nephew was able to go from ride to ride and complete the park's attraction relatively quickly. It",
          "It was a day full of just being a kid again. I was never a fan of lego but once I step inside Legoland, I realized I belong in this place. First of all because how amazing to see a miniature Dubai all made of Legos, those famous UAE tourist attraction were all in one place. My",
          "Legoland is an amazing place to visit. Specially for the kids. My son really enjoyed playing over there. He participated in many activities like Fire Tender task, Driving Skills and making different things from Legos. We also took the rides over there. You can buy Lego blocks",
          "I love this place, lots of different games and amusing games. Most of the games are for the young children but we still enjoyed it. We couldn\u2019t take photos while playing because it\u2019s dangerous, we wished to capture some photos we understood the rules.",

          "We visited Legoland Dubai on a gorgeous 26 degree day in January. It was after local school holidays had finished, which meant there was no lining up for rides, which was great! My three children - ages 12, 10 and 6 enjoyed the rides, but the level of thrill would not be enough",

          "One of the best places for kids I must say . Must go else u ll regret .",
          "It is one of those very cheap amusement parks and it often give promotions that are a good deal. Not much inside for a grown up but kids can enjoy a ton of fun in here. Take notice that the park closes at 6pm so be sure to visit earlier.",
          "Kids will love the rides. Queue for each ride is abt 45 mins to an hour on holidays. Better to take q fast even if it means paying more. Miniland is an awesome experience. The effort taken in making the legos is commendable.",
          "Very expensive for Worst place I've ever visited especially if have a kid less than 105 cm. The guys who run the games are rude especially the Africans. My 4 years old kid got disappointed in every game because she was 104 cm!! I don't \u2026",
          "Fun place.. Super creative stuff done by lego bricks.. Imagination is redifened at miniature world",
          "Amazing ...must visit n you gotta stay for 2days to explore all the parks",
          "It was nice but I face one issue with girl standing on the gate I try to come out to take something from my car but she refused to let me go out after few minutes I asked the other person he allow me it's very strange.\nEven the google maps it is didn't guide me correct to reach the parking",
          "My children enjoyed themselves. And the staff are all very friendly and helpful making the experience very enjoyable. Would definitely recommend to anyone.",
          "We really enjoyed... number of games is good ... but I rate it 3 because there is no good restaurants inside the park and drinks are really expensive.",
          "Everything is good but for rides need to wait 30 to 40 mints",
          "Very nice I think they need to rethink pricing in my view is too high, and the pricing system must consider larger families",
          "It's a must visit place for kids. You can spend whole day there and have lots of fun. But the height of the kids for some rides must be 105cm.",
          "Sure, there are a lot of attractions where kids need to be 95cm or even 1.05m but there's still enough to do for smaller kids (2-3y old). Next to that kids under 3 can get in for free. Our almost 3y old boy enjoyed the lego creatures and \u2026",
          "A great park for kids and adults as well. If your kid's height is less than 105 cm, he/she will miss many games. Strongly recommended.",
          "I love the time i had with my kids. Never forget.",
          "Nice place,but they are really restricted with hight with kids,some ride really safe and they need 95cm at least!!\nIf you will compare to legoland London ,London bigger and havemore ride",
          "Perfect place. Best time for visit IA a morning.",
          "Great for kids who like lego. Perfect for ages 4 to 7. Very few things for 3 year olds and not much for older kids. \n\nFood options are limited to burgers fries and a buffet place. Which is quite over priced for what's on offer. Best to carry your own or step out to one of the bigger restaurants.",
          "Perfect for 5 - 8 years old. A dream in safe. Wifi free and good service. I my opinion over 10 years old is a little more easy.",
          "It was wonderful experience at Legoland. All age group  can enjoy here. Driving, waterboat, and many more to enjoy. Kids will enjoy playing with Legos. Building with Legos,  car, animals and \u2708\ufe0f.  Inside Legoland main four areas to play 1) logo city, 2)kingdoms, 3) adventure and 4) imagination.",
          "Very nice place for kids and adults , you'll enjoy your day there  .restorant , lego shops, nice stuff.",
          "Good place to take kids. Has both rides and activities. No direct transportation if you plan to use public transport.",
          "If you are in Dubai with kids then this is THE PLACE TO GO. It was my kid's dream come true. Coincidentally we went during the Halloween week and had so much fun with all the games and shows set up. Two thumbs up to the Legoland team.",
          "Beautiful place if travelling with kids. Lego water park was under maintenance which is actually better than land. Outside food not allowed as they chk your bags too. Baby food and water is allowed. Free and paid parking is available. A \u2026",
          "What a joy for children. Great service all round. Great meal options. Lots of different activities for younger children.",
          "Ideal for kids and families... great fun.. specially the dragon ride \ud83d\ude00",
          "Visited in November - every third object was under maintenance or closed. Also it makes no sense to bring 3-4 years old kids there - you will pay full price for them, but most attractions will be not available, because staff doesn't allow \u2026",
          "Good for kids, not that many adult activities. Takes about 3 to 4 hours if there is no waiting.",
          "Great place for kids all ages even the adults.\nI heavily recommend.",
          "Much fun! Very fun rides for small children, the submarine was our favourite. Short distances between park areas/rides, so easy walkable. Where there when the park opened, had the park almost to ourself. Was very quiet, also the rest of the \u2026",
          "Very nice theme park, but it's purely for families with kids.",
          "No Comments, I had fun more than my kids, great place for everyone, the staff is extremely friendly",
          "Awesome and adventure place for kids... Wonderful experience and had lots of fun dar...but the food is lil bad I think the management should think about food coz 1st thing food is lil expensive and 2nd is not worth",
          "The place is so amazing!! It shows the iconic buildings made of lego and the rides are enjoyable.",
          "Good theme park to visit with the family. Spent good time with my family and had a lots of fun.",
          "There is no reasonbility in the ticket price. The rides are too immature, just like a regular fun fair. If someone is expected to pay such a high enterance price for these stupid rides and staff response, the Management is seriously \u2026",
          "One of the best park and only park where you could get a free entry if you are clever enough to find it out!!!",
          "There is no reasonbility in the ticket price. The rides are too immature, just like a regular fun fair. If someone is expected to pay such a high enterance price for these stupid rides and staff response, the Management is seriously \u2026",
          "LEGO land is amazing nice rides but the water rides one of them were very fast keep doing the good work in 2020",
          "Wonderful place! My kids enjoyed all the rides.",
          "We did LEGOLAND Dubai in Early October2019. Very organized place, very clean and well maintained.\nThe employees were very nice and helpful. Fun rides and no queues that\u2019s great.  Food is not allowed to bring with you.",
          "This place is awesome! 60 Billion Lego bricks to build an amazing park.\nPrices were reasonable and throughout the park the drinks and food weren't too pricey which was a nice surprise! Make sure to get an unlimited refill cup as it's only \u2026",
          "Mainly for kids, have lots of kids ride only. If you are looking for adult rides you must visit motion gate instead.\n\nLegoland needs lots of maintenance and new kids rides though. They have too many rooms to play Lego buildings.\n\nMy son enyoyed alot and couldn't stop discussing about it to his other friend next day..",
          "Very nice Park. Low footfall as it's very far from city. Since most of its outdoor, you will feel uncomfortable during hot summer.",
          "I want to give my 5 star rating for legoland .. but so sad they close the water theme park and will open on Mar. 26, 2020 which is quite very hot to go there. we waste our time going there because we really loved to swim and we\u2019re all \u2026",
          "Only for Lego lovers not much fun and rides.. If water Park was opened then it might be good ...",
          "Lego land was fantastic! We took our boys age 8 & 5 and they loved it. Everyghing you'll expect to see at legoland, we were out there Feb 2020. Waiting time for most rides were 5mins or instant, food and drinks halls was plentiful and price \u2026",
          "Enjoyed by my 7 year old. Rides, shows, activities and displays provide hours of fun.",
          "My kids had lots of fun here but unfortunately, a few of the rides at the water park were closed. Also, it was a bit of a downer that my 2+ year old couldn't go on most of the rides at the Lego city. Overall, it was a fantastic day out.",
          "Spent the whole day here. It was amazing my son loved it! Only downfall was the changing rooms weren't as clean as i expected it to be, both lockers were flooded.",
          "Amazing Park. Kids loved it.",
          "Amazing interesting place for all family \u2764\ufe0f enjoy \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Nice place to visit. Whole family can enjoy.",
          "It's nice in general but not too many games for kids under 1.10m. There 2 or 3 games plus the play area. There is also the 4d movie  which kids likes and the theater is also nice I like it. I like also the boat games it's nice for small \u2026",
          "It's ok. It feels like they could have done better with this park. Not a lot of rides and it's more suitable for kids under the age of 5",
          "It's nice but u people closed it at 6:00 clock I want to do more fun.. \ud83d\ude44",
          "Nice park, but is little.It is suitable for kids 3-6 years, is boaring for bigger kids.We visited with 2 kids of 9 and 11 and in 3 hours they finished all the attractions.There were no queues, as we visited on a Wednesday.",
          "It is a nice place, the older boy enjoyed too much but we felt bad for the little one he was not allowed to do most of the activities!! The other thing we did not like that you are not allowed to bring your food with you and at the same \u2026",
          "Love the place, for residents better to purchase  the annual passes for at least 2 parks.",
          "Ohhh... Had so much fun here. Kids love it much also. Be back here for sure. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Very well planned n perfect place for kids day out....",
          "Very nice place for young kids, rides were also very nice",
          "Legoland is always fun. This one is slightly smaller in size compared to the ones in USA. I like the fact that walkway is shaded because of Dubai heat. Brick work and models are great. Definitely worth visiting if you haven't been to a Legoland before.",
          "Place for family fun and huge collection of lego. Awesome rides too",
          "Perfect for young children. Keep away during weekends as the waiting time will be way long.",
          "The kids loved the experience here. They enjoyed every moment there.",
          "I think it\u2019s a bit over priced, with taxi back and forth from downtown and nasty lunch we ended with total of:\n\n- 1100 AED for entrance (Legoland only).\n- 150 AED lunch\n- 200 AED Taxi\n\nSo two kids and two adults 1450 AED.",
          "Great place for the kids. We went on Christmas day so it wasn't too busy. Food and drinks are pricey but you expect that at theme parks.",
          "It's part of a complex of theme parks far away from dubai city center. Unique features present although the park lacks that happy energetic vibrance. The staff are not so pleasant I guess comparing it to other Legoland. Overall it was a nice experience for my nieces.",
          "Amazing place for the kids above 6 years in order to play in most of the locations",
          "Very good place to enjoy with your family.\nSpecial moments at special place",
          "Definitely worth getting a seasonal pass. A great source of entertainment for the kids and there are no queues which is awesome! It includes access to the water park as well! Some highlight rides include the firetruck, and submarine, plane ride, roller-coaster. Mostly for the kids though, not so exciting for adults.",
          "Nice place of amusement for kids, however too expensive and long walking distance betweento reach each  entertainment makes kids tired.",
          "Not many rides here as the other theme parks. But good enough for small children.",
          "Wonderful experience for kids, quiet costly photos, the gift items are overrated. Rides are custom created for kids, so adults might not be entertained (other than the dragon roller coaster ride).",
          "Good Amusement park..\nWhich gifted us wonderful moments..",
          "Good place for kids and elder one few option",
          "Awesome. Plan to spend a whole day here. \nEspecially if with kids. Or if you are a kid at heart. The rides are lovely. The park is well maintained. \nNo outside food or drink is allowed . Purchase  a rechargeable bottle at the entrance. \u2026",
          "There are two LEGO parks in Dubai Parks and Resorts, one of them is for water activities and the other consists of a wide range of games and some of the most impressive LEGO bricks buildings I have ever seen in my life... LEGO land also hosts many nice LEGO shops of different sizes, also a few restaurants.",
          "Cool place, sooooo much to do, the kids had a wonderful time",
          "Nice Park but rides are not great. Even for kids the rides are not exciting as such. Waterpark was good.",
          "Kids absolutely love this place , specially the water park of legoland. Its extremely well built and maintained and super clean",
          "It is a very nice park, I liked it much more than Legoland in Germany, but also because it was not as tremendously crowded as there. Part of the rides are outside, so it would be best to go when it is cooler outside. Also, most of the rides are for kids +105cm. All in all very nice.",
          "Perfect place for kids upto 7yrs. Can't visit in summers",
          "Good atmosphere for children and adults but heavy Q",
          "It's an amazing place for children and adults. Visiting this place is whole worth it. The environment is so beautiful and the place is so clean. Restaurant service is up to the point. The parks are so amazing where you can have a lot of fun. If you visit this place, hope you have an Amazing Day..",
          "It was such a lovely lovely experience.  A couple of the rides were out of order but still had an amazing fun filled time.. thank God we have an annual pass so that we can visit multiple times.. the inner child in me pops up whenever I come to.such places..",
          "Easy access\nGreat place for the whole family\nFriendly staff\nLocker rental seems expensive and small\nDon't forget to bring your own towel or you have to rent one",
          "Nice place for kids.whole day entertainment,keeping kids busy.one can use waterpark for unlimited fun",
          "Interesting and not usual place. Especially if it are pleasant to children of Lego that will remain delighted. Too it wont be boring for adults. But if the child less than 130 cm in height, then the majority of attractions in the park arent available. From minuses water and drinks costs very much. Were satisfied with the park.",
          "A good place to take the kids. Its educational and fun. Well worth its price. Its a place where children should be taken, a good break from video games and television.\nIt has cafes and restaurants that are reasonably priced.\nIts all about the experience and interaction of parents and their kids. \nMemories are made of these.",
          "Intense creativity. Nice models. Need more global models rather to local ones. Did not accept my 2.5 year old in most of the rides. This theme park is mainly for kids, and should allow 1 + year old in all rides.",
          "Excellent overall, however most rides are suitable for kids under 5 only. Food options are limited to junk food at exorbitant prices, except buffet options which also wan\u2019t great.",
          "Normal theme park. Over rated I guess. Not much people when I came in December. Waiting time for rides is less than 5 mins. Disappointing part is that children aged 4 has to pay for the entrance fee. There was a family who was there buying \u2026",
          "A place where fun and creativity collides. It stimulates the imagination of all ages. Enjoins family to enjoy and be merry with all the rides and fun, intuitive, imaginative, creative and informative activities. A place to go when in Dubai. \u2026",
          "Huge place with tons of things to do .. suitable for all ages",
          "The park is interesting, but time is limited. we have got two tickets different types of park. The lega waterpark works to 18.00.",
          "Very disappointing. Not well organized. It is suitable for max 6 years old child",
          "Wonderful experience for young kids. Try to come early so you don't have to wait for rides and check height limit on legoland website because they are strict about it",
          "It was my first time with family, but I should say we missed this wonderful place all this time.  The atmosphere is so serene, that after breaking the fast, we were enjoying roaming around within the beautifully created surroundings.  It is different and cannot be described, worth visiting",
          "Good place for the kids and family in the weekend",
          "They got alot of activities and fun games to explore, it's an all day affair you can't do all in a couple of hours...",
          "It's best for children.Huge place for family bonding.",
          "It was a wonderful expreience. actually it was a typo error from my end clicking the star.  My kids are on visit for diwali vacation and they thoroughly enjoyed the rides, it was a fun ride  be it water park  and all the 5 land we entered \u2026",

          "good park for kids below 10 years. all easy and fun rides.",
          "Went with my 4 year old and 18 month old, and had a couple of lovely half days. The submarine ride was brilliant as the whole family could go on it. We spent a lot of time in MiniWorld, where the lego replicas of Dubai were amazing (and air conditioned!)",
          "Wonderful place for kids. Excellent rides and mind games",
          "I have never been to a a theme park that is so empty... which is a big plus. Lots to do for kids (age 4 -7). Liked the submarine and the driving academy a lot. And the mini city built at the ce ter of the park is awsome. \nIt is however starting to show signs of aging.",
          "This is very wonderful place for spending a day, great place",
          "Better than LEGO land USA, so clean.",

          "The refill plastic container. Which Price is 25 AED. Has a plastic smell even if it has been flashed many times. Which change the taste the water or the soft drinks filled in it. I ask the administration of Lego land Dubai to change it to another type.",
          "I like the experience, a must see thier is the entrance area, all of it made out of lego amazing, all dubai famous attractions, ancient Egypt and so many. Lots and lots of rides and playing area .\nSuitable for 6 yrs old children or less.\nA must try rides are submarine and wave racer.",
          "Good for kids 7 years and above. Its rediculous to buy a full ticket for the kids below 6 years of age. If the kids height is not more than 105cm then definetly he id going to miss77",
          "Incredible land all made of thousand piece of lego",
          "Surprisingly slow ticket counters, very slow rather. \nPoor planning for Q fast passes between different theme parks\nRides were OK",

          "Legoland! Great childhood memories... A place you must not miss!",
          "Summer is definitely not the best time to go. The heat was outa this world. The kids loved the few rides they were able to go on though. But we couldn't spend the whole day as we planned. Will be back in winter",
          "Very good theme park to spend great time with family and kids.",
          "Not worth for the money, for this price they should give more rides. Food prices inside legoland are  super expensive. .\n\nMetro connectivity is there however it is available every 75 min, so if you miss the bus you have to take taxi or wait in the metro for 75 min.",
          "Awesome......most ever satisfying experience....",

          "It appears cute for kids under 6 years and it too has rides which are involving for parents as well and soft play areas children. In fact schools can bring children for traffic awareness and rules which they can understand and have a \u2026",
          "Buy at least 1 ticket 2 parks pass. You have to see at least motiongate with legoland if you have time. But at any case, legoland is a must go to place for family",
          "Amazing place especially for the little ones! There are rides, play areas and activities scheduled so make sure you check their schedule if you want to participate with the activities. Too hot for the summer though because it is mostly outdoor.",

          "I had fun today with my kids. It's the best water park for kids aged 3-13 all ride made and designed to accommodate this age range.

          "It is an amazing place for the kids - I strongly recommend to take your kids over there during winter/springtime - my kids love it a lot.",
          "An excellent place to hang out with family and friends. It's a mix of open and indoor activities so plan your visit especially in the summer. Bring water with you as it's the only drink allowed inside. My advice is don't go during humid \u2026",

          "Good fun but height restrictions pedantic and unrealistic given audience legoland is aimes at and compared to Disney parks that allow so much more for younger children.",
          "It was fun place to be, for children and adults alike. We went on the 30th of October and they have designs for the Halloween along with the mascots and dance ahow. There was also brick or treats for the children to collect.",

          "Water park good for kids",
          "Very nice place I recommend for kids",
          "As expected a great themed park! Not much for toddlers below two tho. We have annual passes but can't do much in there with the kid. The water park is better in that sense. Food and lockers are super expensive tho.",
          "Great place to hangout with kids, under 9 will enjoy most, first time travelers if want to go by bus get it from IBN batuta bus station, bus number DPR1, go on weekends to avoid lines, if lines are there it will consumed good time, open till 8pm",
          "Very cool very big very very impressive especially legoland miniland",
          "One of the best places in Dubai to spend your time. Especially if you have kids in the group. There were fourteen members in our group including kids. We thoroughly enjoyed the rides. The staff there is very professional. The restaurants offer good variety of food and drinks though are a bit expensive.",

          "The best park fir kids and adults too",
          "Amazing Park! Great to go with small kids! If your smallest kids is less than 95cm, maybe is better to wait until he/she grows a bit to visit otherwise won't be able to do much. Great place!",
          "It was awesome... All very well",
          "What a place they have built for Lego lovers. My 9 yr son is an extreme fan of Lego and he had a time of his life. All rides are fun. We went there at 3 pm and we carried on till 8 pm, still my children were like they could carry on for \u2026",
          "Good fun learning activities and rides for children's",
          "Good place for kids to spend some time, food options for Indian Veg family is limited.",

          "Great place for young kids upto age 10..\nBasic, non scary rides for the kids. \nCleanliness can be improved, not upto Dubai standards.",
          "Really great place, however my daughter couldn't go on any of the rides bar 2 because she had a hard plaster cast on. So we left after 10mins",
          "First of all it's not worth money, I've been to different water parks cheaper but good one. Second there was none slides for 1.5 years old child what disappointed me!!! On their webside there is not enough information about toddlers activities... Sound big but nothing special",
          "Place for child. Comfy water park close to. Some roads under construction",
          "Spent the day here with family .One of Abu Dhabis great attractions at the DubaiParksandResort..With 4 theme parks for the whole family .Lego Land is a great treat for lego lovers to see the great effort put into these miniture building.Lots of great food and snacls available .Toy stores rides for the young and old.",
          "Great Experience for my son and all of us adults. It is a part of Dubai parks and resorts along with other 3 other parks.\n\nYou can enjoy great rides inside the park. Mini Dubai city model built with Legos\n Bricks is great to experience. \u2026",
          "Amazing for kids and toddlers as well. We spent a whole morning till about 4pm. It wasn't  very hot and pleasant. The life guards are very strict when it comes to checking heights. Slides are safe and there are plenty of space.",
          "Amazing park with lots of rides... perfect place for Kids.",
          "It s far from but Dubai but kid's love this place because lot of ride's for kid's and  Lego games in Dubai Park in one day with two Park pass is more than enough because lot of time required for Lego ride ,in Lego park no water refill \u2026",
          "A must place for kids aged 8-15. A day is not enough to fully enjoy this park",
          "Wonderful experience for young toddlers and family alike..  a caution.. be ready to be a child again once you enter!!",
          "A really nice theme park for kids. Height of 1m20 and more will enjoy it entirely but it might lacks a bit more activities and attractions for kids under 95cm. Food and drinks are inexpensive.",
          "Excellent place for tiny tots to enjoy a water part as well as a theme park. I would recommend people with small kids must visit. Grown ups might like more to go to Aquaventure.",
          "Recently my annual pass is expired. I was happy and my family too. It's worth taking annual pass for Dubai parks. Better if you take for all parks. Every month also if you are making single trip you make-up 12 trips in annual pass.  This is one of the best destination in Dubai.",
          "Great place for kids. Suggestion is that you come early to maximize the fun and experience. Parking is plenty and not too far out the premises. However, I believe prices are too steep for very simple rides especially if everything is only designed for kids.",
          "Motiongate better than legoland",
          "Went there for the Phil Independence day last week.. And I say, we will definitely returning again. It was an amazing place for my 5 years old son specially he reached more than the height requirement! He loves the 3d and all the legos that \u2026",
          "Looked a little rundown. The Lego demo at the entrance was the only highlight",
          "So much fun!!!! Even on the hottest day you can have a great day out. Also not forgetting the Lego shop that stocks some rare and hard to find kits!! For grown up kids and little ones alike!",
          "Visited Legoland and Legoland water park some days before..... It was excellent experience.... U can spend whole day in water park ... If u dont have any interest in lego then don't bother to go for lego factory....just visit the miniature \u2026",
          "First time and Bad customer service, one star is too much for them, zero star batter,",
          "One of the best parts of DPR and less crowded than motion gates. There are still waiting lines and having a fast pass is helpful but very expensive",
          "Legoland is part of Dubai parks. It is on the outskirts of Dubai city. The park is tailor made for my 5 year old kid. He had a time of his life there! We were there for almost 5 hours. Adults too would enjoy accompanying kids on the rides \u2026",
          "Nice place, my son loves it but very very overpriced to be honest.\nGolden advice, don't go if you're kid is 4 or shorter than average 4y old kid, there's a height restriction for each game and most probably they will be sent back (trust me you don't want that)",
          "Legoland Dubai Resort (stylized as LEGOLAND Dubai) is a family theme park in Dubai. It opened on October 31, 2016. It is the first Legoland park in the Middle East and was the seventh worldwide. The park was originally scheduled to open in \u2026",

          "Awesome time for family, lot of things to do. Worth the money.",
          "First time at Legoland and it did not disappoint! Our 4yo enjoyed all the rides he could go on. Miniland was great! (The AC cooled dome was a savior to the beating sun).  The details that went into making each of the displays was amazing. Some bits even humorous. Would recommend to avoid the crowds if you're traveling with kids.",
          "It was a great experience with family. Enjoyed alot",
          "A day without stress, it's a small but packs a good variety of fun, good place to visit with family and friends. But prefer to have an annual pass. Worth the money.",

          "Great park to start your day out at the resort. The park is targeted toward the younger crowd but as adults we're still found it fun and quite enjoyed ourselves. Really hope they bring the Lego movie themed area here like in Florida.",
          "Nicely made, water pool can be improved",
          "Enjoyed to the fullest with my 7 yr old son. All rides were good and meant for kids of his age. If gone in groups, would be more fun. Indian food options were not there and outside food was also not allowed. Driving school was the most \u2026",

          "This rating of 1 star is not for the rides or the park. The park on its own is very good, but this rating is for the problems we faced while walking down to the park. My mother is a lady with determination and always wanted to visit Lego \u2026",
          "A good theme park for children between 2 - 12 years. Have about 15000 Lego model made from Lego bricks along with 40 Lego theme rides in the park within these 6 theme area Factory, Lego City, Kingdoms, Mainland, Imagination & Adventure.  Overall a fun filling experience with family.",

          "A wonderful place where kids and adults can all enjoy together, their rides and the environment is fine tuned for a family outing and the fun never ends there. It felt like going back to your childhood again as Lego was an integral part of it, thank you Lego land parks team for the standards you have set and maintained.",

          "Great for kids, very far away from Dubai or Abu Dhabi. I don't think it's great during the summer because it's just too hot, and in the winter it's too cold. You need to pick the perfect weather in spring or fall because it is all outdoors. \u2026",
          "Legoland is about 25km from Dubai (Al Barsha) with plenty of parking places covered against sun. There is also wifi free everywhere but count with lower speed, still good for WhatsApp and small photo. Highly recommend to make order online \u2026",
          "Lovly place. But not in summer. Mostly is open areas which will ruin your experience if you visited during summer time.",
          "My 6 years old daughter loved it. Visit during week days! \ud83d\ude09",
          "Lovely. Wasnt bust when i went as it was so hot. Went on rides 2 or 3 times each. Worth the money",

          "Fun for the kids but relatively small compared to Windsor",
          "For our boy was ok, but we have higher expectations. Legoland in Germany is more animated, more attractive, in Dubai is plain, not remarkable as we thought it should be.",
          "Excellent location for kids. I am sure almost all kids across the world love to visit here. \n\nTry avoiding weekends as it will be over crowded.",
          "Amazing place for the kids. They\u2019d love it! \n\nGo for the annual pass. It worths! Remember, if you took a day pass, you could upgrade it to annual within the same day (in your way out ;)).",
          "Amazing place where you can see famous buildings made by lego blocks, and there is many indoor and outdoor rides. But don't go there in summer!",

          "Staff on the dragon ride are completely useless, unfriendly,  and not understanding of my brothers condition.  They discriminated against him because of the way he is, we tried to speak with the manager but the manager was equally incompetent.  A word of as advice,  avoid legoland all together.",
          "Legoland Dubai is one of the best attractions for children and adults alike. Kid's can see the things and structure's made from Lego pieces. There are various rides which are amazing. I would insist to visit the park once when you are in Dubai.",
          "Its a full time enjoymnt. Everythng is fun.",
          "Considering that we have visited another Lego Land, this one was very similar.  The rides weren't any different. Perhaps if we had bought tickets to the water park, we would have been more amazed. I guess it's an OK experience and I am sure the kids will love it (especially not knowing how much it costs to enter!!).",
          "Kids paradise and those who love legos will mesmerised seeing this place.\nThis place has such a beautiful monuments constructed by Legos \nThis place has such a beautiful and good rides constructed by Legos \nGood motion movies \nKids can play whole day long in the legoland \n\nMust visit place !!!!!",

          "I love this place. As a lego fan growing up this place is perfect! The models are amazing and the rides are great too.\nI love the food here and the shops are really great and have exclusives lego items like star wars and similar.",
          "Amazing place, must visit, you can\u2019t complete the park in one day due to lots of activities, for Dubai residents I must suggest to buy annual pass, it will less costly and secondly you won\u2019t be get tried. I have found less activities for 2 \u2026",
          "Been to both parks - the waterpark is a bit small yet offers enough playtime to keep the family busy. As for legoland, it is quite enjoyful and offers fun to most ages",

The place is magical \ud83d\ude0d especially around Christmas with snowflakes falling down. A small show would have been a nice addition. Btw food is not bad at all.",

        "wiki": "Atlantis The Palm, Dubai is a luxury hotel resort located at the apex of the Palm Jumeirah in the United Arab Emirates. It was the first resort to be built on the island and is themed on the myth of Atlantis but includes distinct Arabian elements. The resort opened on September 24, 2008 as a joint venture between Kerzner International Holdings Limited and Istithmar.\n\n\n== Hotel ==\nThe 1,548 room nautically themed resort has two accommodation wings, consisting of the East and the West Tower, linked together by the Royal Bridge Suite. It is complemented by the Aquaventure water park and the Lost Chambers Aquarium, home to over 65,000 marine animals.\n\n\n== Development ==\nAtlantis The Palm, opened on 24 September 2008 as a joint venture between Kerzner International Holdings Limited and Istithmar. In April 2012, Istithmar acquired Kerzner's 50-percent stake in the property for US$250 million. The property continues to be managed by Kerzner International Resorts. The architect was design firm Wimberly, Allison, Tong and Goo (WATG) an international firm specializing in Luxury Hotels. The principal contract for the project was awarded to Laing O'Rourke, a multinational construction firm based in United Kingdom. Laing O'Rourke was responsible for the design and construction phases of the 23-story hotel and water park.\n\n\n== Official launch ==\nAfter the construction of the hotel carried out by Laing O'Rourke it was officially opened on 24 September 2008.As part of the opening, a light show of moving images was illuminated onto the hotel. 100,000 fireworks, around seven times the amount that were used for the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, were let off, lasting 15 minutes.\nThe display of fireworks across the full 5 km (3.1 mi) stretch of The Palm lit up the entire island and Atlantis, The Palm. Custom-made shells shipped in from across the globe created a light spectacle taking off from the 716 firing locations around the island, including 400 balconies at the resort. Display creator Fireworks by Grucci claims the display set a new world record, but records curator Guinness World Records has yet to announce the status.\n\n\n== Dolphin controversy ==\nIn October 2007, the hotel received a shipment of 28 bottlenose dolphins from the Solomon Islands, to be used as part of their aquarium exhibit, called Dolphin Bay.  The move was decried by several environmental groups, particularly for the fact that the export of dolphins had earlier been banned by the Solomon Islands government (after a similar controversial shipment to Mexico).  Hotel managers have said that though the dolphins are being trained to interact with visitors, they will not appear in any sort of show or circus-like performance.  They have also stated that the health of the dolphins is paramount, and because the bottlenose is not an endangered species, their shipment did not pose a problem.  The deal was done with the approval of the United Arab Emirates and Solomon Island governments, through the company Solomon Islands Marine Mammal Education Centre and Exporters Limited (who had overturned the earlier ban in court). The amount of money paid for the dolphins has not been disclosed.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nA task in the sixth leg of The Amazing Race 15 took place at its water park. The 14 team members had to slide down the resort's Leap of Faith water slide, which dropped them along 60 m (200 ft) and 30 m (90 ft) down an 84\u00b0 incline and through a tunnel beneath the aquarium's shark lagoon. After retrieving the clue at the bottom of the exit pool, teams had to search the water park for Dolphin Bay Beach located near a lagoon, which was the sixth Pit Stop of the season. However, only 13 team members made it down the slide, as one of the team members, Mika was afraid of heights and water, and she and Canaan were eliminated. The water park was visited once again on the eighth leg of The Amazing Race 28. Teams were required to solve a puzzle at an aquarium for the Roadblock. Following that, they had to slide down the Poseidon's Revenge water slide as a miscellaneous task.\nIn 2009, an episode of The X Factor was partially filmed at the hotel, with Dannii Minogue using it to choose which female contestants joined her in the live shows.\nIn the video game Ace Combat: Assault Horizon, mission 7 takes place in Dubai, in which one can fly through the hotel gates to get an achievement. The achievement will give 10 Gamer score points to the player on Xbox 360 and a bronze trophy on PlayStation 3.\nBollywood film Happy New Year, directed by Farah Khan starring Shah Rukh Khan, has been shot almost entirely at the Palm. The film also stars Abhishek Bachchan, Deepika Padukone, Boman Irani, Sonu Sood, and Vivaan Shah and released on October 24, 2014.\nIn 2016, three season 3 episodes of The Real Housewives of Melbourne were based at the Palm Atlantis, with an Episode 10 visit to the Royal Bridge Suite.\nIn 2015, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills stayed at the Palm Atlantis.\nIn 2017, Kim Kardashian West visited the Royal Bridge Suite, part of her reality show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians. The suite has an average rate of $23,000 a night.\nThe 2013 visual novel Kissed By The Baddest Bidder has a hotel based on it\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nDubai World\nList of hotels in Dubai\nAtlantis Paradise Island - similar looking Hotel by Sol Kerzner too\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAtlantis, The Palm Official Site",

          "Breathtaking Aquarium with thousands of species of fishes to see around. always a pleasure to see the gigantic creatures over us on a glass window above us. One can sit and adore the beauty for hours. They have put up loads of seats for the same. Very much recommended.",
          "Great place for kids and adults. Plenty of activities to indulge in.",
          "Good aquarium. Takes about 30 mins to stroll through. Limited variety of species but definitely worth a visit. Free access for guests at the Atlantis",

          "How much time do we need here?",
          "It's not an ordinary aquarium, but it has a story, you feel like you are actually lost in this chambre, it's not a huge aquarium but I like the idea and I enjoyed the new experience, the best thing I liked in it that I could sit and relax \u2026",
          "Beautiful. U will actually feel lost in lost chambers.. amongst 65k fishes.. sting Ray's the most common and sharks as well..",

          "A bit short but I liked it",

          "Amazing Aqua Trek  - just tried this for the first time and wow! What an amazing experience. It really is something to try. Being under water with sting rays, sharks and exotic fish brushing past you. Very helpful team. It's 20 mins you'll remember in your life. Highly recommended",

          "Not the best aquarium I have seen, or definitely not for the price paid. It takes 15 minutes to see everything and besides some small sharks there is nothing that justifies the ticket rates. As a plus, it has a nice theme, so from an architectural point of view it's worth considering (only if you're doing the waterpark too).",
          "It's ok but it's no Dubai mall aquarium... lucky our entry was free with our big bus tour tickets .",

          "The Aquarium is good. There are bigger and better ones around (uShaka in Durban). But opt for the behind the scenes and fish hospital tour. Its worth the extra as you get a fascinating tour to see how new fish are integrated, sick fish treated and a jelly fish breeding programme. You get a chance to feed some of the fish too.",

        "wiki": "Dubai ( doo-BY; Arabic: \u062f\u0628\u064a\u200e, romanized: Dubayy [d\u028a\u02c8bajj], Gulf Arabic pronunciation: [d\u0259\u02c8baj]) is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai.Located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf, Dubai aims to be the business hub of Western Asia. It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo. Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a major mercantile hub. Today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue comes from oil. A centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. According to government data, the population of Dubai is estimated at around 3.38 million as of January 2020.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nMany theories have been proposed as to origin of the word \"Dubai\". One theory suggests the word was used to be the souq, which was similar to the souq in Ba.  An Arabic proverb says \"Daba Dubai\" (Arabic: \u062f\u0628\u0627 \u062f\u0628\u064a\u200e), meaning \"They came with a lot of money.\" According to Fedel Handhal, a scholar on the UAE's history and culture, the word Dubai may have come from the word daba (Arabic: \u062f\u0628\u0627\u200e) (a past tense derivative of yadub (Arabic: \u064a\u062f\u0628\u200e), which means \"to creep\"), referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland. The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word, but to its alternative meaning of \"baby locust\" (Arabic: \u062c\u0631\u0627\u062f\u200e) due to the abundant nature of locusts in the area before settlement.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of human settlement in the area now defined by the United Arab Emirates is rich and complex, and points to extensive trading links between the civilisations of the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia, but also as far afield as the Levant. Archaeological finds in the emirate of Dubai, particularly at Al-Ashoosh, Al Sufouh and the notably rich trove from Saruq Al Hadid show settlement through the Ubaid and Hafit periods, the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods and the three Iron Ages in the UAE. The area was known to the Sumerians as Magan, and was a source for metallic goods, notably copper and bronze.The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland, becoming part of the city's present coastline. Pre-Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th centuries. Prior to the introduction of Islam to the area, the people in this region worshiped Bajir (or Bajar). After the spread of Islam in the region, the Umayyad Caliph of the eastern Islamic world invaded south-east Arabia and drove out the Sassanians. Excavations by the Dubai Museum in the region of Al-Jumayra (Jumeirah) found several artefacts from the Umayyad period.An early mention of Dubai is in 1095 in the Book of Geography by the Andalusian-Arab geographer Abu Abdullah al-Bakri. The Venetian pearl merchant Gasparo Balbi visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai (Dibei) for its pearling industry.\n\n\n=== Establishment of modern Dubai ===\nDubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century and was, by 1822, a town of some 700\u2013800 members of the Bani Yas tribe and subject to the rule of Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi.In 1833, following tribal feuding, members of the Al Bu Falasah tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves in Dubai. The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by Obeid bin Saeed and Maktoum bin Butti, who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836, leaving Maktum to establish the Maktoum dynasty.Dubai signed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 along with other Trucial States, following the British punitive expedition against Ras Al Khaimah of 1819, which also led to the bombardment of the coastal communities of the Persian Gulf. This led to the 1853 Perpetual Maritime Truce. Dubai also \u2013 like its neighbours on the Trucial Coast \u2013 entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the United Kingdom took responsibility for the emirate's security in 1892.\n\nIn 1841, a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality, forcing residents to relocate east to Deira. In 1896, fire broke out in Dubai, a disastrous occurrence in a town where many family homes were still constructed from barasti \u2013 palm fronds. The conflagration consumed half the houses of Bur Dubai, while the district of Deira was said to have been totally destroyed. The following year, more fires broke out. A female slave was caught in the act of starting one such blaze and was subsequently put to death.\n\nIn 1901, Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum established Dubai as a free port with no taxation on imports or exports and also gave merchants parcels of land and guarantees of protection and tolerance. These policies saw a movement of merchants not only directly from Lingeh, but also those who had settled in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah (which had historical links with Lingeh through the Al Qawasim tribe) to Dubai. An indicator of the growing importance of the port of Dubai can be gained from the movements of the steamer of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, which from 1899 to 1901 paid five visits annually to Dubai. In 1902 the company's vessels made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on, the steamers called fortnightly \u2013 in 1906, trading seventy thousand tonnes of cargo. The frequency of these vessels only helped to accelerate Dubai's role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference. Lorimer notes the transfer from Lingeh 'bids fair to become complete and permanent', and also that the town had by 1906 supplanted Lingeh as the chief entrep\u00f4t of the Trucial States.The 'great storm' of 1908 struck the pearling boats of Dubai and the coastal emirates towards the end of the pearling season that year, resulting in the loss of a dozen boats and over 100 men. The disaster was a major setback for Dubai, with many families losing their breadwinner and merchants facing financial ruin. These losses came at a time when the tribes of the interior were also experiencing poverty. In a letter to the Sultan of Muscat in 1911, Butti laments, 'Misery and poverty are raging among them, with the result that they are struggling, looting and killing among themselves.'\n\n\n=== Pre-oil Dubai ===\nDubai's geographical proximity to Iran made it an important trade location. The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen, chiefly those from Iran, many of whom eventually settled in the town. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was an important port. At that time, Dubai consisted of the town of Dubai and the nearby village of Jumeirah, a collection of some 45 areesh (palm leaf) huts. Dubai was known for its pearl exports until the 1930s; the pearl trade was damaged irreparably by the 1929 Great Depression and the innovation of cultured pearls. With the collapse of the pearling industry, Dubai fell into a deep depression and many residents lived in poverty or migrated to other parts of the Persian Gulf.In the early days since its inception, Dubai was constantly at odds with Abu Dhabi. In 1947, a border dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on the northern sector of their mutual border escalated into war. Arbitration by the British resulted in a cessation of hostilities.\n\nDespite a lack of oil, Dubai's ruler from 1958, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, used revenue from trading activities to build infrastructure. Private companies were established to build and operate infrastructure, including electricity, telephone services and both the ports and airport operators. An airport of sorts (a runway built on salt flats) was established in Dubai in the 1950s and, in 1959, the emirate's first hotel, the Airlines Hotel, was constructed. This was followed by the Ambassador and Carlton Hotels in 1968.Sheikh Rashid commissioned John Harris from Halcrow, a British architecture firm, to create the city's first master plan in 1959. Harris imagined a Dubai that would rise from the historic center on Dubai Creek, with an extensive road system, organised zones, and a town center, all of which could feasibly be built with the limited financial resources at the time.1959 saw the establishment of Dubai's first telephone company, 51% owned by IAL (International Aeradio Ltd) and 49% by Sheikh Rashid and local businessmen and in 1961 both the electricity company and telephone company had rolled out operational networks. The water company (Sheikh Rashid was Chairman and majority shareholder) constructed a pipeline from wells at Awir and a series of storage tanks and, by 1968, Dubai had a reliable supply of piped water.On 7 April 1961, the Dubai-based MV Dara, a five thousand ton British flagged vessel that plied the route between Basra (Iraq), Kuwait and Bombay (India), was caught in unusually high winds off Dubai. Early the next morning in heavy seas off Umm al-Quwain, an explosion tore out the second class cabins and started fires. The captain gave the order to abandon ship but two lifeboats capsized and a second explosion occurred. A flotilla of small boats from Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman and Umm al-Quwain picked up survivors, but 238 of the 819 persons on board were lost in the disaster.Construction of Dubai's first airport was started on the Northern edge of the town in 1959 and the terminal building opened for business in September 1960. The airport was initially serviced by Gulf Aviation (flying Dakotas, Herons and Viscounts) but Iran Air commenced services to Shiraz in 1961.In 1962 the British Political Agent noted that \"Many new houses and blocks of offices and flats are being built... the Ruler is determined, against advice [from the British] to press on with the construction of a jet airport... More and more European and Arab firms are opening up and the future looks bright.\"In 1962, with expenditure on infrastructure projects already approaching levels some thought imprudent, Sheikh Rashid approached his brother in law, the Ruler of Qatar, for a loan to build the first bridge crossing Dubai's creek. This crossing was finished in May 1963 and was paid for by a toll levied on the crossing from the Dubai side of the creek to the Deira side.BOAC was originally reluctant to start regular flights between Bombay and Dubai, fearing a lack of demand for seats. However, by the time the asphalt runway of Dubai Airport was constructed in 1965, opening Dubai to both regional and long haul traffic, a number of foreign airlines were competing for landing rights. In 1970 a new airport terminal building was constructed which included Dubai's first duty-free shops.Throughout the 1960s Dubai was the centre of a lively gold trade, with 1968 imports of gold at some \u00a356 million. This gold was, in the vast majority, re-exported - mainly to customers who took delivery in international waters off India. The import of gold to India had been banned and so the trade was characterised as smuggling, although Dubai's merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.In 1966, more gold was shipped from London to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (Only France and Switzerland took more), at 4 million ounces. Dubai also took delivery of over $15 million-worth of watches and over 5 million ounces of silver. The 1967 price of gold was $35 an ounce but its market price in India was $68 an ounce \u2013 a healthy markup. Estimates at the time put the volume of gold imports from Dubai to India at something like 75% of the total market.\n\n\n=== Oil era ===\n\nAfter years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring Abu Dhabi, oil was eventually discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966, albeit in far smaller quantities. The first field was named 'Fateh' or 'good fortune'. This led to an acceleration of Sheikh Rashid's infrastructure development plans and a construction boom that brought a massive influx of foreign workers, mainly Asians and Middle easterners. Between 1968 and 1975 the city's population grew by over 300%.As part of the infrastructure for pumping and transporting oil from the Fateh field, located offshore of the Jebel Ali area of Dubai, two 500,000 gallon storage tanks were built, known locally as 'Kazzans', by welding them together on the beach and then digging them out and floating them to drop onto the seabed at the Fateh field. These were constructed by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company, which gave the beach its local name (Chicago Beach), which was transferred to the Chicago Beach Hotel, which was demolished and replaced by the Jumeirah Beach Hotel in the late 1990s. The Kazzans were an innovative oil storage solution which meant super-tankers could moor offshore even in bad weather and avoided the need to pipe oil onshore from Fateh, which is some 60 miles out to sea.Dubai had already embarked on a period of infrastructural development and expansion. Oil revenue, flowing from 1969 onwards supported a period of growth with Sheikh Rashid embarking on a policy of building infrastructure and a diversified trading economy before the emirate's limited reserves were depleted. Oil accounted for 24% of GDP in 1990, but had reduced to 7% of GDP by 2004.Critically, one of the first major projects Sheikh Rashid embarked upon when oil revenue started to flow was the construction of Port Rashid, a deep water free port constructed by British company Halcrow. Originally intended to be a four-berth port, it was extended to sixteen berths as construction was ongoing. The project was an outstanding success, with shipping queuing to access the new facilities. The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972, although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built. Port Rashid was to be further expanded in 1975 to add a further 35 berths before the larger port of Jebel Ali was constructed.Port Rashid was the first of a swath of projects designed to create a modern trading infrastructure, including roads, bridges, schools and hospitals.\n\n\n=== Reaching the UAE's Act of Union ===\n\nDubai and the other 'Trucial States' had long been a British protectorate where the British government took care of foreign policy and defence, as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Gulf, the result of a treaty signed in 1892, the 'Exclusive Agreement'. This was to change with PM Harold Wilson's announcement, on 16 January 1968, that all British troops were to be withdrawn from 'East of Aden'. The decision was to pitch the coastal emirates, together with Qatar and Bahrain, into fevered negotiations to fill the political vacuum that the British withdrawal would leave behind.The principle of union was first agreed between the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and Sheikh Rashid of Dubai on 18 February 1968 meeting in an encampment at Argoub Al Sedirah, near Al Semeih, a desert stop between the two emirates. The two agreed to work towards bringing the other emirates, including Qatar and Bahrain, into the union. Over the next two years, negotiations and meetings of the rulers followed -often stormy- as a form of union was thrashed out. The nine-state union was never to recover from the October 1969 meeting where heavy-handed British intervention resulted in a walk-out by Qatar and Ras Al Khaimah. Bahrain and Qatar dropped out of talks, leaving six of the seven 'trucial' emirates to agree on union on 18 July 1971.On 2 December 1971, Dubai, together with Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Quwain and Fujairah joined in the Act of Union to form the United Arab Emirates. The seventh emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the UAE on 10 February 1972, following Iran's annexation of the RAK-claimed Tunbs islands.In 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency: the UAE dirham. In that same year, the prior monetary union with Qatar was dissolved and the UAE Dirham was introduced throughout the Emirates.\n\n\n=== Modern Dubai ===\n\nDuring the 1970s, Dubai continued to grow from revenues generated from oil and trade, even as the city saw an influx of immigrants fleeing the Lebanese civil war. Border disputes between the emirates continued even after the formation of the UAE; it was only in 1979 that a formal compromise was reached that ended disagreements. The Jebel Ali port, a deep-water port that allowed larger ships to dock, was established in 1979. The port was not initially a success, so Sheikh Mohammed established the JAFZA (Jebel Ali Free Zone) around the port in 1985 to provide foreign companies unrestricted import of labour and export capital. Dubai airport and the aviation industry also continued to grow.\nThe Gulf War of 1990 had a negative financial effect on the city, as depositors withdrew their money and traders withdrew their trade, but subsequently, the city recovered in a changing political climate and thrived. Later in the 1990s, many foreign trading communities\u2014first from Kuwait, during the Gulf War, and later from Bahrain, during the Shia unrest\u2014moved their businesses to Dubai. Dubai provided refuelling bases to allied forces at the Jebel Ali Free Zone during the Gulf War, and again during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Large increases in oil prices after the Gulf War encouraged Dubai to continue to focus on free trade and tourism.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nDubai is situated on the Persian Gulf coast of the United Arab Emirates and is roughly at sea level (16 m or 52 ft above). The emirate of Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi in the south, Sharjah in the northeast, and the Sultanate of Oman in the southeast. Hatta, a minor exclave of the emirate, is surrounded on three sides by Oman and by the emirates of Ajman (in the west) and Ras Al Khaimah (in the north). The Persian Gulf borders the western coast of the emirate. Dubai is positioned at 25.2697\u00b0N 55.3095\u00b0E\ufeff / 25.2697; 55.3095 and covers an area of 1,588 sq mi (4,110 km2), which represents a significant expansion beyond its initial 1,500 sq mi (3,900 km2) designation due to land reclamation from the sea.Dubai lies directly within the Arabian Desert. However, the topography of Dubai is significantly different from that of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai's landscape is highlighted by sandy desert patterns, while gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country. The sand consists mostly of crushed shell and coral and is fine, clean and white. East of the city, the salt-crusted coastal plains, known as sabkha, give way to a north\u2013south running line of dunes. Farther east, the dunes grow larger and are tinged red with iron oxide.The flat sandy desert gives way to the Western Hajar Mountains, which run alongside Dubai's border with Oman at Hatta. The Western Hajar chain has an arid, jagged and shattered landscape, whose mountains rise to about 1,300 metres (4,265 feet) in some places. Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases; however, Dubai does have a natural inlet, Dubai Creek, which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through. Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes, which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains. A vast sea of sand dunes covers much of southern Dubai and eventually leads into the desert known as The Empty Quarter. Seismically, Dubai is in a very stable zone\u2014the nearest seismic fault line, the Zagros Fault, is 200 kilometres (124 miles) from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai. Experts also predict that the possibility of a tsunami in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami.\n\nThe sandy desert surrounding the city supports wild grasses and occasional date palms. Desert hyacinths grow in the sabkha plains east of the city, while acacia and ghaf trees grow in the flat plains within the proximity of the Western Al Hajar mountains. Several indigenous trees such as the date palm and neem as well as imported trees such as the eucalypts grow in Dubai's natural parks. The houbara bustard, striped hyena, caracal, desert fox, falcon and Arabian oryx are common in Dubai's desert. Dubai is on the migration path between Europe, Asia and Africa, and more than 320 migratory bird species pass through the emirate in spring and autumn. The waters of Dubai are home to more than 300 species of fish, including the hammour. The typical marine life off the Dubai coast includes tropical fish, jellyfish, coral, dugong, dolphins, whales and sharks. Various types of turtles can also be found in the area including the hawksbill turtle and green turtle, which are listed as endangered species.Dubai Creek runs northeast\u2013southwest through the city. The eastern section of the city forms the locality of Deira and is flanked by the emirate of Sharjah in the east and the town of Al Aweer in the south. The Dubai International Airport is located south of Deira, while the Palm Deira is located north of Deira in the Persian Gulf. Much of Dubai's real-estate boom is concentrated to the west of Dubai Creek, on the Jumeirah coastal belt. Port Rashid, Jebel Ali, Burj Al Arab, the Palm Jumeirah and theme-based free-zone clusters such as Business Bay are all located in this section. Dubai is notable for sculpted artificial island complexes including the Palm Islands and The World archipelago.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nDubai has a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh). Summers in Dubai are extremely hot, windy, and humid, with an average high around 41 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) and overnight lows around 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in the hottest month, August. Most days are sunny throughout the year. Winters are comparatively cool with an average high of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) and overnight lows of 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in January, the coolest month. Precipitation, however, has been increasing in the last few decades, with accumulated rain reaching 110.7 mm (4.36 in) per year. Dubai summers are also known for the very high humidity level, which can make it very uncomfortable for many with exceptionally high dew points in summer. Heat index values can reach over 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F) at the height of summer. The highest recorded temperature in Dubai is 49.0 \u00b0C (120.2 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nDubai has been ruled by the Al Maktoum family since 1833; the emirate is a constitutional monarchy. Dubai citizens participate in the electoral college to vote representatives to the Federal National Council of the UAE. The ruler, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is also the Vice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and member of the Supreme Council of the Union (SCU). Dubai appoints 8 members in two-term periods to the Federal National Council (FNC) of the UAE, the supreme federal legislative body.The Dubai Municipality (DM) was established by the then-ruler of Dubai, Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, in 1954 for purposes of city planning, citizen services and upkeep of local facilities. DM is chaired by Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum, deputy ruler of Dubai, and comprises several departments such as the Roads Department, Planning and Survey Department, Environment and Public Health Department and Financial Affairs Department. In 2001, Dubai Municipality embarked on an e-Government project with the intention of providing 40 of its city services through its web portal, [dubai.ae]. Thirteen such services were launched by October 2001, while several other services were expected to be operational in the future. Dubai Municipality is also in charge of the city's sanitation and sewage infrastructure.The UAE has a Minister of Happiness, appointed by Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The UAE has also appointed a Minister of Tolerance to promote tolerance as a fundamental value of the UAE, a country filled with a diverse range of faiths and ethnicities, and also a Minister for Youth Affairs.\n\n\n=== Law enforcement ===\nThe Dubai Police Force, founded in 1956 in the locality of Naif, has law enforcement jurisdiction over the emirate. The force is under direct command of Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum.\n\nDubai and Ras al Khaimah are the only emirates that do not conform to the federal judicial system of the United Arab Emirates. The emirate's judicial courts comprise the Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Cassation. The Court of First Instance consists of the Civil Court, which hears all civil claims; the Criminal Court, which hears claims originating from police complaints; and Sharia Court, which is responsible for matters between Muslims. Non-Muslims do not appear before the Sharia Court. The Court of Cassation is the supreme court of the emirate and hears disputes on matters of law only.\n\n\n=== Alcohol laws ===\nAlcohol sale and consumption, though legal, is tightly regulated. Adult non-Muslims are allowed to consume alcohol in licensed venues, typically within hotels, or at home with the possession of an alcohol licence. Places other than hotels, clubs, and specially designated areas are typically not permitted to sell alcohol. As in other parts of the world, drinking and driving is illegal, with 21 being the legal drinking age in the Emirate of Dubai.\n\n\n== Human rights ==\n\nCompanies in Dubai have in the past been criticised for human rights violations against labourers. Some of the 250,000 foreign labourers in the city have been alleged to live in conditions described by Human Rights Watch as \"less than humane\". The mistreatment of foreign workers was a subject of the difficult-to-make documentary, Slaves in Dubai (2009). The Dubai government has denied labour injustices and stated that the watchdog's (Human Rights Watch) accusations were 'misguided'. The filmmaker explained in interviews how it was necessary to go undercover to avoid discovery by the authorities, who impose high fines on reporters attempting to document human rights abuses, including the conditions of construction workers. Towards the end of March 2006, the government had announced steps to allow construction unions. UAE labour minister Ali al-Kaabi said: \"Labourers will be allowed to form unions.\"Homosexual acts are illegal under UAE law. Freedom of speech in Dubai is limited, with both residents and citizens facing severe sanctions from the government for speaking out against the royal family or local laws and culture. Most of the low paid labourers are victims of human trafficking or forced labour while some women are even trafficked into the growing sex trade in Dubai, a centre of human trafficking and prostitution.Defamation on social media is a punishable offence in Dubai with fines up to half a million dirhams and jail term for up to 2 years. In January 2020, three Sri Lankan expats were fined AED 500,000 each for posting defamatory Facebook posts.\n\n\n== Crime ==\nDubai has one of the world's lowest crime rates, and in 2019 was ranked the seventh-safest city in the world. The Security Industry Regulatory Agency classified the crimes into six categories. These crimes include theft, forced robbery, domestic burglary, fraud, sexual assault and abuse, and criminal damages.As per Gulf News, Dubai Police stated that the crime in Dubai is reduced by fifteen percent during 2017. However, the cases of drugs operation increased by eight percent. Major-General Abdullah Khalifa Al Merri, Commander-in-Chief of Dubai Police, hailed the force which solved 86 percent of criminal cases.The statistics also indicated that murder crimes dropped from 0.5 in 2016 to 0.3 in 2017 for every 100,000 population, while violent and aggressive crimes in the past 5 years went from 2.2 crimes per 100,000 and dropped to 1.2 by the end of 2017, pointed out Al Mansouri. General crimes have decreased since 2013, registering around 0.2 by the end of 2017. Robberies went from 3.8 in 2013 to 2.1 by the end of last year, while kidnapping cases also dropped from 0.2 in 2013 to 0.1 in 2017.\nVehicle thefts in 2013 were 3.8 per 100,000 population and fell to 1.7 in 2017. All the stolen vehicles were also recovered after being smuggled to neighbouring countries, in cooperation with the competent authorities there. According to the US Bureau of Diplomatic Security, petty theft, pickpocketing, scams, and sexual harassment still occur although they are usually not violent and weapons are not involved.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Ethnicity and languages ===\n\nAs of September 2019, the population is 3,331,420 \u2013 an annual increase of 177,020 people which represents a growth rate of 5.64%. The region covers 1,287.5 square kilometres (497.1 sq mi). The population density is 408.18/km2 \u2013 more than eight times that of the entire country. Dubai is the second most expensive city in the region and 20th most expensive city in the world.As of 2013, only about 15% of the population of the emirate was made up of UAE nationals, with the rest comprising expatriates, many of whom either have been in the country for generations or were born in the UAE. Approximately 85% of the expatriate population (and 71% of the emirate's total population) was Asian, chiefly Indian (51%) and Pakistani (16%); other significant Asian groups include Bangladeshis (9%) and Filipinos (3%). There is a sizeable community of Somalis numbering around 30,000, as well as other communities of various nationalities. A quarter of the population (local and foreign) reportedly traces their origins to Iran. In addition, 16% of the population (or 288,000 persons) living in collective labour accommodation were not identified by ethnicity or nationality, but were thought to be primarily Asian. There are over 100,000 British expatriates in Dubai, by far the largest group of Western expatriates in the city. The median age in the emirate was about 27 years. In 2014, there were estimated to be 15.54 births and 1.99 deaths per 1,000 people. There are other Arab nationals, including GCC nationals.Arabic is the national and official language of the United Arab Emirates. The Gulf dialect of Arabic is spoken natively by the Emirati people. English is used as a second language. Other major languages spoken in Dubai due to immigration are Malayalam, Hindi-Urdu (or Hindustani), Gujarati, Persian, Sindhi, Tamil, Punjabi, Pashto, Bengali, Balochi, Tulu, Kannada, Sinhala, Marathi, Telugu, Tagalog and Chinese, in addition to many other languages.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nArticle 7 of the UAE's Provisional Constitution declares Islam the official state religion of the UAE. The government subsidises almost 95% of mosques and employs all Imams; approximately 5% of mosques are entirely private, and several large mosques have large private endowments. All mosques in Dubai are managed by the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department also known as \"Awqaf\" under the Government of Dubai and all Imams are appointed by the Government. The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates provides for freedom of religion. Any person held preaching religious hatred or promoting religious extremism is usually jailed and deported.Dubai has large Christian, Hindu, Sikh, Bah\u00e1'\u00ed, Buddhist and other religious communities residing in the city.Non-Muslim groups can own their own houses of worship, where they can practice their religion freely, by requesting a land grant and permission to build a compound. Groups that do not have their own buildings are allowed to use the facilities of other religious organisations or worship in private homes. Non-Muslim religious groups are also permitted to advertise group functions openly and distribute various religious literature. Catholics are served pastorally by the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia. British preacher Reverend Andrew Thompson claimed that the United Arab Emirates is one of the most tolerant places in the world towards Christians and that it is easier to be a Christian in the UAE than in the UK.\nOn 5 April 2020, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced the building of one of their Temples in Dubai. As part of the announcement, church President Russell M. Nelson said that \u201cThe plan for a temple in Dubai comes in response to their gracious invitation, which we gratefully acknowledge.\u201d\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nOne of the world's fastest growing economies, Dubai's gross domestic product is projected at US$107.1 billion, with a growth rate of 6.1% in 2014. Although a number of core elements of Dubai's trading infrastructure were built on the back of the oil industry, revenues from oil and natural gas account for less than 5% of the emirate's revenues. It is estimated that Dubai produces 50,000 to 70,000 barrels (7,900 to 11,100 m3) of oil a day and substantial quantities of gas from offshore fields. The emirate's share in the UAE's total gas revenues is about 2%. Dubai's oil reserves have diminished significantly and are expected to be exhausted in 20 years. Real estate and construction (22.6%), trade (16%), entrep\u00f4t (15%) and financial services (11%) are the largest contributors to Dubai's economy.Dubai's non-oil foreign trade stood at $362 billion in 2014. Of the overall trade volumes, imports had the biggest share with a value of $230 billion while exports and re-exports to the emirate stood at $31 billion and $101 billion respectively.By 2014, China had emerged as Dubai's largest international trading partner, with a total of $47.7 billion in trade flows, up 29% from 2013. India was second among Dubai's key trading partners with a trade of $29.7 billion, followed by the United States at $22.62 billion. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was Dubai's fourth trading partner globally and first in the GCC and Arab world with a total trade value of $14.2 billion. Trade with Germany in 2014 totalled $12.3, Switzerland and Japan both at $11.72 billion and UK trade totalled $10.9 billion.\n\nHistorically, Dubai and its twin across Dubai Creek, Deira (independent of Dubai City at that time), were important ports of call for Western manufacturers. Most of the new city's banking and financial centres were headquartered in the port area. Dubai maintained its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s. Dubai has a free trade in gold and, until the 1990s, was the hub of a \"brisk smuggling trade\" of gold ingots to India, where gold import was restricted. Dubai's Jebel Ali port, constructed in the 1970s, has the largest man-made harbour in the world and was ranked seventh globally for the volume of container traffic it supports. Dubai is also a hub for service industries such as information technology and finance, with industry-specific free zones throughout the city. Dubai Internet City, combined with Dubai Media City as part of TECOM (Dubai Technology, Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority), is one such enclave, whose members include IT firms such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Google, EMC Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Dell and IBM, and media organisations such as MBC, CNN, BBC, Reuters, Sky News and AP.\n\nThe government's decision to diversify from a trade-based, oil-reliant economy to one that is service- and tourism-oriented made property more valuable, resulting in the property appreciation from 2004 to 2006. A longer-term assessment of Dubai's property market, however, showed depreciation; some properties lost as much as 64% of their value from 2001 to November 2008. The large-scale real estate development projects have led to the construction of some of the tallest skyscrapers and largest projects in the world such as the Emirates Towers, the Burj Khalifa, the Palm Islands and the most expensive hotel, the Burj Al Arab. Dubai's property market experienced a major downturn in 2008 and 2009 as a result of the slowing economic climate. By early 2009, the situation had worsened with the Great Recession taking a heavy toll on property values, construction and employment. This has had a major impact on property investors in the region, some of whom were unable to release funds from investments made in property developments. As of February 2009, Dubai's foreign debt was estimated at approximately $80 billion, although this is a tiny fraction of the sovereign debt worldwide.\n\nThe Dubai Financial Market (DFM) was established in March 2000 as a secondary market for trading securities and bonds, both local and foreign. As of the fourth quarter 2006, its trading volume stood at about 400 billion shares, worth $95 billion in total. The DFM had a market capitalisation of about $87 billion. The other Dubai-based stock exchange is NASDAQ Dubai, which is the international stock exchange in the Middle East. It enables a range of companies, including UAE and regional small and medium-sized enterprises, to trade on an exchange with an international brand name, with access by both regional and international investors.DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Centre) was established in 2002. It's world's fastest-growing free zone and been nominated as \"Global Free Zone of the Year 2016\" by The Financial Times fDi Magazine.\nDubai is also known as the City of Gold because a major part of the economy is based on gold trades, with Dubai's total gold trading volumes in H1 2011 reaching 580 tonnes, with an average price of US$1,455 per troy ounce.A City Mayors survey ranked Dubai 44th among the world's best financial cities in 2007, while another report by City Mayors indicated that Dubai was the world's 27th richest city in 2012, in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). Dubai is also an international financial centre (IFC) and has been ranked 37th within the top 50 global financial cities as surveyed by the MasterCard Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index (2007), and 1st within the Middle East. Since it opened in September 2004, the Dubai IFC has attracted, as a regional hub, leading international firms and set-up the NASDAQ Dubai which lists equity, derivatives, structured products, Islamic bonds (sukuk) and other bonds. The Dubai IFC model is an independent risk-based regulator with a legislative system consistent with English common law.In 2012, the Global City Competitiveness Index by the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Dubai at No. 40 with a total score of 55.9. According to its 2013 research report on the future competitiveness of cities, in 2025, Dubai will have moved up to 23rd place overall in the Index. Indians, followed by Britons and Pakistanis are the top foreign investors in Dubai realty.Dubai has launched several major projects to support its economy and develop different sectors. These include Dubai Fashion 2020, and Dubai Design District, expected to become a home to leading local and international designers. The AED 4 billion first phase of the project will be complete by January 2015.In September 2019, Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum ordered to establish the Higher Committee for Real Estate Planning to study and evaluate future real estate construction projects, in ordered to achieve a balance between supply and demand, which is seen as a move to curb the pace of construction projects following property prices fall.Since the economy of Dubai relies majorly on real estate, transportation and tourism, it was highly exposed to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In April 2020, the American business and financial services company, Moody's Corporation reported that the coronavirus outbreak is likely to pose acute \u201cnegative growth and fiscal implications\u201d in Dubai. It was reported that in order to bolster its finances and overcome the impact of coronavirus on its economy, Dubai was in talks to raise billions of dollars of debt privately, where it was seeking loans of 1 billion dirhams ($272 million) to 2 billion dirhams from each lender. On 6 May, Dubai\u2019s businessman from the hospitality sector, Khalaf Al Habtoor stated that the coronavirus pandemic left the economy and his companies \u201cbleeding\u201d. The owner of seven hotels in the country, including the Waldorf Astoria on the man-made island Palm Jumeirah, Habtoor stated that Dubai\u2019s economy cannot afford to wait for the vaccine, before resuming the major activities.\n\n\n=== Tourism and retail ===\n\nTourism is an important part of the Dubai government's strategy to maintain the flow of foreign cash into the emirate. Dubai's lure for tourists is based mainly on shopping, but also on its possession of other ancient and modern attractions. As of 2018, Dubai is the fourth most-visited city in the world based on the number of international visitors and the fastest growing, increasing by a 10.7% rate. The city hosted 14.9 million overnight visitors in 2016, and is expected to reach 20 million tourists by 2020.\n\nDubai has been called the \"shopping capital of the Middle East\". Dubai alone has more than 70 shopping centres, including the world's largest shopping centre, Dubai Mall. Dubai is also known for the historical souk districts located on either side of its creek. Traditionally, dhows from East Asia, China, Sri Lanka, and India would discharge their cargo and the goods would be bargained over in the souks adjacent to the docks. Dubai Creek played a vital role in sustaining the life of the community in the city and was the resource which originally drove the economic boom in Dubai. As of September 2013, Dubai creek has been proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Many boutiques and jewellery stores are also found in the city. Dubai is also referred to as \"the City of Gold\" as the Gold Souk in Deira houses nearly 250 gold retail shops.\n\nDubai Creek Park in Dubai Creek also plays a vital role in Dubai tourism as it showcase some of the most famous tourist attractions in Dubai such as Dolphinarium, Cable Car, Camel Ride, Horse Carriage and Exotic Birds Shows.Dubai has a wide range of parks like Safa park, Mushrif park, Hamriya park, etc. Each park is uniquely distinct from the other. Mushrif park showcases different houses around the world. A visitor can check out the architectural features of the outside as well as the inside of each house.\nSome of the most popular beaches in Dubai are Umm Suqeim Beach, Al Mamzar Beach Park, JBR Open Beach, Kite Beach, Black Palace Beach and Royal Island Beach Club.\nMastercard's Global Destination Cities Index 2019 found that tourists spend more in Dubai than in any other country. In 2018, the country topped the list for the fourth year in a row with a total spend of $30.82 billion. The average spend per day was found to be $553.In October 2019, Dubai loosened its liquor laws for the first time in history, under which it allowed tourists to purchase alcohol from state-controlled stores. Previously, alcohol was only accessible for the locals with special licences. The crucial policy shift came as the United Arab Emirates witnessed severe economic crisis that led to a drop in alcohol sales by volume in a decade.\n\n\n=== Expo 2020 ===\n\nOn 2 November 2011, four cities had their bids for Expo 2020 already lodged, with Dubai making a last-minute entry. The delegation from the Bureau International des Expositions, which visited Dubai in February 2013 to examine the Emirate's readiness for the largest exposition, was impressed by the infrastructure and the level of national support. In May 2013, Dubai Expo 2020 Master Plan was revealed. Dubai then won the right to host Expo 2020 on 27 November 2013. The event will bring huge economic benefits by generating activities worth billions of dirhams and may create over 270,000 jobs.The main site of Dubai Expo 2020 will be a 438-hectare area (1,083 acres), part of the new Dubai Trade Centre Jebel Ali urban development, located midway between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Moreover, the Expo 2020 also created various social enlistment projects and monetary boons to the city targeting the year 2020, such as initiating the world's largest solar power project.The Dubai Expo 2020 is to take place from 20 October 2020 till 10 April 2021 for 173 days where there are to be 192 country pavilions featuring narratives from every part of the globe, have different thematic districts that would promote learning the wildlife in the forest exhibit to many other experiences.Due to the impact of COVID-19 the organisers of EXPO are seeking to postpone the EXPO by one year to begin in 2021.Dubai is trying to build an inclusive, barrier-free and a disabled-friendly city by the time it hosts Expo 2020. The city has already brought in changes by introducing wheelchair friendly taxis, pavements with slopes and tactile indicators on floor for the visually-impaired at all the metro stations.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nDubai has a rich collection of buildings and structures of various architectural styles. Many modern interpretations of Islamic architecture can be found here, due to a boom in construction and architectural innovation in the Arab World in general, and in Dubai in particular, supported not only by top Arab or international architectural and engineering design firms such as Al Hashemi and Aedas, but also by top firms of New York and Chicago. As a result of this boom, modern Islamic \u2013 and world \u2013 architecture has literally been taken to new levels in skyscraper building design and technology. Dubai now has more completed or topped-out skyscrapers higher than 2\u20443 km (2,200 ft), 1\u20443 km (1,100 ft), or 1\u20444 km (820 ft) than any other city. A culmination point was reached in 2010 with the completion of the Burj Khalifa (Khalifa Tower), now by far the world's tallest building at 829.8 m (2,722 ft). The Burj Khalifa's design is derived from the patterning systems embodied in Islamic architecture, with the triple-lobed footprint of the building based on an abstracted version of the desert flower hymenocallis which is native to the Dubai region.The completion of the Khalifa Tower, following the construction boom that began in the 1980s, accelerated in the 1990s, and took on a rapid pace of construction during the decade of the 2000s, leaves Dubai with the world's tallest skyline as of 4 January 2010. At the top, Burj Khalifa, the world's second highest observatory deck after the Shanghai Tower with an outdoor terrace is one of Dubai's most popular tourist attractions, with over 1.87 million visitors in 2013.\n\n\n==== Burj Al Arab ====\n\nThe Burj Al Arab (Arabic: \u0628\u0631\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628, Tower of the Arabs), a luxury hotel, is frequently described as \"the world's only 7-star\", though its management has said it has never made that claim. A Jumeirah Group spokesperson is quoted as saying: \"There's not a lot we can do to stop it. We're not encouraging the use of the term. We've never used it in our advertising.\" The hotel opened in December 1999.\n\n\n==== Burj Khalifa ====\n\nBurj Khalifa, known as the Burj Dubai before its inauguration, is a 828 metres (2,717 ft) high skyscraper in Dubai, and the tallest building in the world. The tower was inspired by the structure of the desert flower Hymenocallis. It was constructed by more than 30 contracting companies around the world with workers of a hundred nationalities. It is an architectural icon. The building opened on 4 January 2010.\n\n\n=== Palm Jumeirah ===\n\nThe Palm Jumeirah is an artificial archipelago, created using land reclamation by Nakheel, a company owned by the Dubai government, and designed and developed by Helman Hurley Charvat Peacock/Architects, Inc. It is one of three planned islands called the Palm Islands which extend into the Persian Gulf. The Palm Jumeirah is the smallest and the original of three Palm Islands, and it is located on the Jumeirah coastal area of Dubai. It was built between 2001 and 2006.\n\n\n=== Dubai Miracle Garden ===\n\nOn 14 February 2013, the Dubai Miracle Garden, a 72,000-metre (236,000-foot) flower garden, opened in Dubailand. It is the world's largest flower garden. The garden displays more than 50 million flowers with more than 70 species of flowering plants. The garden uses retreated waste water from city's municipality and utilises drip irrigation method for watering the plants. During the summer seasons from late May to September when the climate can get extremely hot with an average high of about 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F), the garden stays closed.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nTransport in Dubai is controlled by the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), an agency of the government of Dubai, formed by royal decree in 2005. The public transport network has in the past faced congestion and reliability issues which a large investment programme has addressed, including over AED 70 billion of improvements planned for completion by 2020, when the population of the city is projected to exceed 3.5 million. In 2009, according to Dubai Municipality statistics, there were an estimated 1,021,880 cars in Dubai. In January 2010, the number of Dubai residents who use public transport stood at 6%.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nFive main routes \u2013 E 11 (Sheikh Zayed Road), E 311 (Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road), E 44 (Dubai-Hatta Highway), E 77 (Dubai-Al Habab Road) and E 66 (Oud Metha Road, Dubai-Al Ain Road, or Tahnoun Bin Mohammad Al Nahyan Road) \u2013 run through Dubai, connecting the city to other towns and emirates. Additionally, several important intra-city routes, such as D 89 (Al Maktoum Road/Airport Road), D 85 (Baniyas Road), D 75 (Sheikh Rashid Road), D 73 (Al Dhiyafa Road now named as 2 December street), D 94 (Jumeirah Road) and D 92 (Al Khaleej/Al Wasl Road) connect the various localities in the city. The eastern and western sections of the city are connected by Al Maktoum Bridge, Al Garhoud Bridge, Al Shindagha Tunnel, Business Bay Crossing and Floating Bridge.The Public Bus Transport system in Dubai is run by the RTA. The bus system services 140 routes and transported over 109 million people in 2008. By the end of 2010, there will be 2,100 buses in service across the city. In 2006, the Transport authority announced the construction of 500 air-conditioned (A/C ) Passenger Bus Shelters, and planned for 1,000 more across the emirates in a move to encourage the use of public buses.All taxi services are licensed by the RTA. Dubai licensed taxis are easily identifiable by their cream bodywork colour and varied roof colours identifying the operator. Dubai Taxi Corporation, a division of the RTA, is the largest operator and has taxis with red roofs. There are five private operators: Metro Taxis (orange roofs); Network Taxis (yellow roofs); Cars Taxis (blue roofs); Arabia Taxis (green roofs); and City Taxis (purple roof). In addition, there is a Ladies and Families taxi service (pink roofs) with female drivers, which caters exclusively for women and children. There are more than 3000 taxis operating within the emirate making an average of 192,000 trips every day, carrying about 385,000 persons. In 2009 taxi trips exceeded 70 million trips serving around 140.45 million passengers.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nDubai International Airport (IATA: DXB), the hub for Emirates, serves the city of Dubai and other emirates in the country. The airport is the third-busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic and the world's busiest airport by international passenger traffic. In addition to being an important passenger traffic hub, the airport is the sixth-busiest cargo airport in world, handling 2.37 million tons of cargo in 2014. Emirates is the national airline of Dubai. As of 2018, it operated internationally serving over 150 destinations in over 70 countries across six continents.The development of Al Maktoum International Airport (IATA: DWC) was announced in 2004. The first phase of the airport, featuring one A380 capable runway, 64 remote stands, one cargo terminal with annual capacity for 250,000 tonnes of cargo and a passenger terminal building designed to accommodate five million passengers per year, has been opened. When completed, Dubai World Central-Al Maktoum International will be the largest airport in the world with five runways, four terminal buildings and capacity for 160 million passengers and 12 million tons of cargo.\n\n\n=== Metro rail ===\nDubai Metro consists of two lines (Red line and Green line) which run through the financial and residential areas of the city. It was opened on September 2009. UK-based international service company Serco is responsible for operating the metro.\nThe Red Line, which has 29 stations (4 underground, 24 elevated and 1 at ground level) running from Rashidiya Station to UAE Xchange Station in Jebel Ali, is the major backbone line. The Green Line, running from the Etisalat Station to the Creek Station, has 20 stations (8 underground, 12 elevated). An extension to the Red Line connecting the EXPO 2020 site is due to open in April 2020. A Blue and a Purple Line have also been planned. The Dubai Metro is the first urban train network in the Arabian Peninsula. The trains are fully automated and driverless.\n\n\n=== Palm Jumeirah Monorail ===\n\nA monorail line connecting the Palm Jumeirah to the mainland opened on 30 April 2009. It is the first monorail in the Middle East. An extension to connect to the Red Line of the Dubai Metro is planned.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nA tramway located in Al Sufouh, will run for 14.5 km (9.0 mi) along Al Sufouh Road from Dubai Marina to the Burj Al Arab and the Mall of the Emirates with two interchanges with Dubai Metro's Red Line. The first section, a 10.6 km (6.6 mi) long tram line which serves 11 stations, was opened in 2014.\n\n\n=== High speed rail ===\nDubai has announced it will complete a link of the UAE high-speed rail system which will eventually hook up with the whole GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council, also known as Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf) and then possibly Europe. The High Speed Rail will serve passengers and cargo.\n\n\n=== Waterways ===\nThere are two major commercial ports in Dubai, Port Rashid and Port Jebel Ali. Port Jebel Ali is the world's largest man-made harbour, the biggest port in the Middle East, and the 7th-busiest port in the world. One of the more traditional methods of getting across Bur Dubai to Deira is by abras, small boats that ferry passengers across the Dubai Creek, between abra stations in Bastakiya and Baniyas Road. The Marine Transport Agency has also implemented the Dubai Water Bus System. Water bus is a fully air conditioned boat service across selected destinations across the creek. One can also avail oneself of the tourist water bus facility in Dubai. Latest addition to the water transport system is the Water Taxi.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe UAE culture mainly revolves around traditional Arab culture. The influence of Arab and Islamic culture on its architecture, music, attire, cuisine, and lifestyle is very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques which are scattered around the country. Since 2006, the weekend has been Friday and Saturday, as a compromise between Friday's holiness to Muslims and the Western weekend of Saturday and Sunday. Prior to 2006, the weekend was Thursday-Friday.\nBecause of the touristic approach of many Dubaites in the entrepreneurial sector and the high standard of living, Dubai's culture has gradually evolved towards one of luxury, opulence, and lavishness with a high regard for leisure-related extravagance. Annual entertainment events such as the Dubai Shopping Festival (DSF) and Dubai Summer Surprises (DSS) attract over 4 million visitors from across the region and generate revenues in excess of $2.7 billion.\n\nDubai is known for its nightlife. Clubs and bars are found mostly in hotels because of liquor laws. The New York Times described Dubai as \"the kind of city where you might run into Michael Jordan at the Buddha Bar or stumble across Naomi Campbell celebrating her birthday with a multiday bash\".The city's cultural imprint as a small, ethnically homogeneous pearling community was changed with the arrival of other ethnic groups and nationals\u2014first by the Iranians in the early 1900s, and later by Indians and Pakistanis in the 1960s. In 2005, 84% of the population of metropolitan Dubai was foreign-born, about half of them from India.Major holidays in Dubai include Eid al Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, and National Day (2 December), which marks the formation of the United Arab Emirates.The International Festivals and Events Association (IFEA), the world's leading events trade association, has crowned Dubai as IFEA World Festival and Event City, 2012 in the cities category with a population of more than one million. Large shopping malls in the city, such as Deira City Centre, Mirdiff City Centre, BurJuman, Mall of the Emirates, Dubai Mall (the world's largest) and Ibn Battuta Mall as well as traditional Dubai Gold Souk and other souks attract shoppers from the region.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nArabic cuisine is very popular and is available everywhere in the city, from the small shawarma diners in Deira and Al Karama to the restaurants in Dubai's hotels. Fast food, South Asian, and Chinese cuisines are also very popular and are widely available. The sale and consumption of pork is regulated and is sold only to non-Muslims, in designated areas of supermarkets and airports. Similarly, the sale of alcoholic beverages is regulated. A liquor permit is required to purchase alcohol; however, alcohol is available in bars and restaurants within hotels. Shisha and qahwa boutiques are also popular in Dubai. Biryani is also a popular cuisine across Dubai with being the most popular among Indians and Pakistanis present in Dubai.The inaugural Dubai Food Festival was held between 21 February to 15 March 2014. According to Vision magazine, the event was aimed at enhancing and celebrating Dubai's position as the gastronomic capital of the region. The festival was designed to showcase the variety of flavours and cuisines on offer in Dubai featuring the cuisines of over 200 nationalities at the festival. The next food festival was held between 23 February 2017 to 11 March 2017.\n\n\n=== Entertainment ===\nDubai Opera opened its door on 31 August 2016 in Downtown Dubai with a performance by Pl\u00e1cido Domingo. The venue is a 2000-seat, multifunctional performing arts centre able to host not only theatrical shows, concerts and operas but also weddings, gala dinners, banquets and conferences.  \nArabic movies are popular in Dubai and the UAE. Since 2004, the city has hosted the annual Dubai International Film Festival which serves as a showcase for Arab and Middle Eastern film making talent. The Dubai Desert Rock Festival was also another major festival consisting of heavy metal and rock artists but is no longer held in Dubai.\nOne of the lesser known sides of Dubai is the importance of its young contemporary art gallery scene. Since 2008, the leading contemporary art galleries such as Carbon 12 Dubai, Green Art, gallery Isabelle van den Eynde, and The Third Line have brought the city onto the international art map. Art Dubai, the growing and reputable art fair of the region is as well a major contributor of the contemporary art scene's development.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nMany international news agencies such as Reuters, APTN, Bloomberg L.P. and Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC) operate in Dubai Media City and Dubai Internet City. Additionally, several local network television channels such as Dubai One (formerly Channel 33), and Dubai TV (EDTV) provide programming in English and Arabic respectively. Dubai is also the headquarters for several print media outlets. Dar Al Khaleej, Al Bayan and Al Ittihad are the city's largest circulating Arabic language newspapers, while Gulf News, Khaleej Times, Khaleej Mag and 7days are the largest circulating English newspapers.Etisalat, the government-owned telecommunications provider, held a virtual monopoly over telecommunication services in Dubai prior to the establishment of other, smaller telecommunications companies such as Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC\u2014better known as Du) in 2006. Internet was introduced into the UAE (and therefore Dubai) in 1995. The network has an Internet bandwidth of 7.5 Gbit/s with capacity of 49 STM1 links. Dubai houses two of four Domain Name System (DNS) data centres in the country (DXBNIC1, DXBNIC2). Censorship is common in Dubai and used by the government to control content that it believes violates the cultural and political sensitivities of Emirates. Homosexuality, drugs, and the theory of evolution are generally considered taboo.Internet content is regulated in Dubai. Etisalat uses a proxy server to filter Internet content that the government deems to be inconsistent with the values of the country, such as sites that provide information on how to bypass the proxy; sites pertaining to dating, gay and lesbian networks, and pornography; and sites originating from Israel. Emirates Media and Internet (a division of Etisalat) notes that as of 2002, 76% of Internet users are male. About 60% of Internet users were Asian, while 25% of users were Arab. Dubai enacted an Electronic Transactions and Commerce Law in 2002 which deals with digital signatures and electronic registers. It prohibits Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from disclosing information gathered in providing services. The penal code contains official provisions that prohibit digital access to pornography; however, it does not address cyber crime or data protection.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nFootball and cricket are the most popular sports in Dubai. Three teams (Al Wasl FC, Shabab Al-Ahli Dubai FC and Al Nasr SC) represent Dubai in UAE Pro-League. Al-Wasl have the second-most number of championships in the UAE League, after Al Ain. Dubai also hosts both the annual Dubai Tennis Championships and The Legends Rock Dubai tennis tournaments, as well as the Dubai Desert Classic golf tournament and the DP World Tour Championship, all of which attract sports stars from around the world. The Dubai World Cup, a thoroughbred horse race, is held annually at the Meydan Racecourse. Dubai also hosts the traditional rugby union tournament Dubai Sevens, part of the Sevens World Series Event pictures of Rugby 7 Dubai 2015. In 2009, Dubai hosted the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens. Auto racing is also a big sport in Dubai, the Dubai Autodrome is home to many auto racing events throughout the year. It also features a state-of-the-art indoor and outdoor Kartdrome, popular among racing enthusiasts and recreational riders.\n\n\n=== Dress code ===\nThe Emirati attire is typical of several countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Women usually wear the \"abaya\", a long black robe with a hijab (the head-scarf which covers the neck and part of the head-all of the hair and ears). Some women may add a niqab which cover the mouth and nose and only leaves the eyes exposed. Men wear the \"kandurah\" also referred to as \"dishdasha\" or even \"thawb\" (long white robe) and the headscarf (ghotrah). The UAE traditional ghotrah is white and is held in place by an accessory called \"egal\", which resembles a black cord. The younger Emiratis prefer to wear red and white ghotras and tie it round their head like a turban.The above dress code is never compulsory and many people wear western or other eastern clothing without any problems; but prohibitions on wearing \"indecent clothing\" or revealing too much skin are aspects of the UAE to which Dubai's visitors are expected to conform, and are encoded in Dubai's criminal law. The UAE has enforced decency regulations in most public places, aside from waterparks, beaches, clubs, and bars.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe school system in Dubai follows that of the United Arab Emirates. As of 2009, there are 79 public schools run by the Ministry of Education that serve Emiratis and expatriate Arab people as well as 145 private schools. The medium of instruction in public schools is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language, while most of the private schools use English as their medium of instruction. Most private schools cater to one or more expatriate communities.More than 15 schools offer an international education using the one or more of the four International Baccalaureate Programmes for students aged 3\u201319. Several schools have introduced the new IB Career-related Programme that can be combined with a vocational qualification such as a BTEC. The Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) signed an agreement with the IB in efforts to widen the options offered for parents and to meet the different needs of students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Additionally a number of schools offer either a CBSE or an Indian Certificate of Secondary Education Indian syllabus. The Indian High School, DPS, DMHS are some examples. Similarly, there are also several reputable Pakistani schools offering FBISE curriculum for expatriate children in Dubai.A number of schools also offer British primary education up to the age of eleven. British style eleven-to-eighteen secondary schools offering General Certificate of Secondary Education and A-Levels include Dubai Gem Private School, Dubai British School, English Language School Pvt. Some schools, such as The American School of Dubai, also offer the curriculum of the United States.The most well-known universities in Dubai are American University in Dubai, Hult International Business School, Al Ghurair University, The American College of Dubai, University of Wollongong in Dubai, British University in Dubai offering courses in Business Administration, Engineering, Architecture and Interior Design. American University in Dubai is one of the six UAE universities featured in QS World University Rankings 2014/2015. In 2013 Synergy University Dubai Campus opened its campus in Jumeirah Lakes Towers being a first University in Dubai to be located outside of Educational Zones (Knowledge Village or Academic City).\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nHealthcare in Dubai can be divided into two different sectors: public and private. Each Emirate is able to dictate healthcare standards according to their internal laws, although the standards and regulations rarely have extreme differences. Public hospitals in Dubai were first built in the late 1950s and continued to grow with public health initiatives. There are now 28 hospitals in Dubai, 6 public and 22 private, with 3 more major hospitals scheduled to be built by 2025.By the end of 2012, there were also a total of 1,348 medical clinics, 97% of which are operated privately. In 2015, Dubai phased in mandatory health insurance for all inhabitants, thereby leading to increased demand for medical services.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nDubai is twinned with the following cities:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nArchaeology of the United Arab Emirates\nAl Sufouh Archaeological Site\nDubai Desert Conservation Reserve\nList of buildings in Dubai\nList of people from Dubai\nSustainability in Dubai\nOutline of Dubai\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSyed Ali.

          "We took our parents here when they cane to visit and it showed them a different side to Dubai. Older, less high rises and much busier. It's 120AED for a 45minute tour on the A4 boat. So the more people the cheaper it works out. A boat holds about 12. It's a traditional Dhow",
          "I think it would be better to take the Dhow cruise on the creek at dusk and in an airconditioned boat. It is very hot and therefore being in the open air at the top of the boat is very uncomfortable.",

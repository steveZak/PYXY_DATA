          "Monkeys will bite you even if you are not interacting with them. I was walking the path and one ran up behind my leg and bit me, breaking the skin. (I did not have any food or anything on me). The front desk did not have much to clean the wound; however, a nice girl gave me",
          "So fun! The monkeys will only get irritated if you get too close to them, so just don't bother them and they won't bother you. You can still take photos with them, and just be careful if you have food in your bag on in your pockets. You don't really need a guide. It's easy",
          "A must-do in Bali, for animal nature buffs. Yes, the monkeys are the stars, but those who are into; botany, architecture, stone masonry and or sculpture work (see my YouTube V-log), will be equally enthralled. It is also, just a great place to go for walk.",
          "very cute. my favorite spot in Ubud. the sanctuary is very big and a lot of monkeys inside. but don't touch the monkey.",
          "We loved our visit to the monkey forest in Ubud. We drove on our moped and there was plenty of parking available outside the forest. Tickets were cheap and getting there was super simple. Be prepared to get waved down by people trying to get you to visit the nearby coffee",
          "This is definitely one of the highlights when you stay in Ubud. It's a popular, touristy place but worth a visit regardless. If you like monkeys - there are plenty of them here! There's also an art exhibition and the park itself is quite nice as well, with bridges, statues, a",
          "When we visited Bali, one of us was on crutches with a broken ankle. This made ALL tourist attractions very difficult and tiring to navigate. This was one of the most expensive places to get into but that being said - just getting to see these little guys up close made it so",
          "A trip to Bali is not complete without visiting these precious monkeys! Give yourself a lot of time as the sanctuary gets busy! Don't wear shiney anything (jewelry) as the monkeys will stop at nothing to grab hold of it and not let go. DO keep your purses closed as they like",
          "Bali always has a view to charm its tourists with the nature and its spectacular innocence of how everything is being kept there. If you are scared of monkeys; dont go there.",
          "This place is fun, but there were so many people there interacting with the monkeys and not always being very nice. There was no one to monitor it, and so it was fun and beautiful but kind of stressful if you care about the animals.",
          "We went there the 4 of us (wife & I with our 2 boys 11 & 13) with no expectations not really knowing what it\u2019s like and we were blown away how genuinely amazing it was to observe the monkeys in their almost natural habitat!",
          "I really loved monkeys those were really fun to see. Actually they caught my sunglass but i had another one. Be prepared not to loose your stuffs. Very calm forest with full of wild animals. I took selfie with bats and giant snake. Totally, I would recommend. Great place with",
          "Our visit to Ubud took us to the Bali swings, a visit to a coffee plantation and then on to the Monkey Forest. It is a chance to see wild monkeys wandering around the forest and also various plantations, trees and temples. The monkeys roam wild although the rangers know how to",
          "We lied right next the Monkey Forest for about 15 months It was always a \"barrel of monkeys\", Sometimes at the break of dawn, on our upstairs balcony...There was an old man on the corner that we called the \"monkey minder\" because he tried to keep the monkeys in the Monkey",
          "Beautiful, shady, very well run, this is a great place to visit. Particularly good so see the Rangers interacting with the monkeys, who are extremely well cared for.",
          "Quite a intriguing place to visit. A lot of free roaming monkeys. Don\u2019t be wearing any jewellery or loose items as the monkeys may snatch these. The monkeys will jump on you even when you least expect it. So be prepared. I don\u2019t mind animals so I enjoyed it whereas my wife stood",
          "My second visit to the Monkey forest. It alot of relaxed walking with much to see and be entertained my monkey families.. There is an art gallery, a fish pond and a waterfall which now block to visitors. There are many temple complexes and lots of opportunities for photography.",

Maybe he thought it was a food",

          "We really enjoyed the Monkey Forest!! The price of admission was reasonable. Lots of photo opportunities at the temples and with the monkeys. The monkeys were either engaging or aloof to our presence(One got away with my lipstick). There are large ones and small ones, as well",
          "I was hesitant about going to the Monkey Forest because the last thing I want is some monkey crawling all over me and possibly biting me. I am happy to say I would gladly go back here. There are a lot of staff around that are occupying and feeding the monkeys. Also the grounds",
          "Loved this place. Really beautiful grounds and a lot of little rascals. It's also convenient to walk from the south to the north of the monkey forest to get to the other side of town. As long as you don't mess with the monkeys they won't mess with you. Really loved this place.",

          "If you are in Ubud it is a must do thing! The heavy tree cover keeps you cool, the jungle running up and down the ravines with all the stone work is just like an Indiana Jones movie. Very memorable......Be warned though, the monkeys WILL try to take things out of your bags /",

          "We went in the late morning and the monkeys were pretty active. Everything everyone says about securing your phones, bottle water, snacks is true. The monkeys will come up and steal it straight from your pockets and hands. Pretty funny when someone isn't paying attention to",
          "Monkey tried to grab my sunglasses. It was awesome. You could sit next to them and the more friendly of them would be totally cool with that.",
          "Arrived at feeding time so the monkeys wern't as active. The fact that there is a simple fence seperating the sanctury from the town is trippy. Still an interesting experiance and would encourage anyone to go.",
          "Had a ball going here and seeing all the monkeys. Be careful though and follow the instructions, they can be naughty. But the monkeys look well cared for. The forest is lovely and cool too.",
          "Unsure how i feel about this, i saw some of the park staff goad the monkeys to get a reaction and a life from the tourist. You have to have your eyes everywhere as one monkey jumped on my back and hugged me like a backpack - not as cute as it sounds as it wanted to take",
          "This is a Beautiful forest with a lot of free range monkeys. The staff were helpful and very observant as to how the tourists and monkeys interacted with one another creating a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere.",
          "I love monkey forest!! I recently went for my 3rd time and it didn't disappoint. It's been upgraded since my last trip, a much nicer tourist friendly entrance and they've changed some rules. In the past we were able to feed the monkeys, they no longer allow this for safety.",
          "Must-do experience in Ubud. Amazing temples with monkey running everywhere. My boyfriend and I had a great time walking around, seeing and getting up-close with monkeys. We didn't try to touch or feed the monkeys, but one of them still ended up getting on my boyfriend and even",
          "So good to see the monkeys roaming free in a lovely setting and so close to the main bit of Ubud, walking distance with some great bars lining the streets on the way",
          "I must say not to often do you get a selfie w a monkey, however, i didn\u2019t like the energy at this place. The monkeys were sneaky and the locals were panhandlers. They tell you not to feed the monkeys bc they want u to pay them to take a selfie and the only way to do that is to",
          "This experience is amazing. Learning about the culture and history of the Sacred Monkey Forest, while seeing these unique animals free roaming is an experience we will never forget.",
          "Very nice scenery, but they fire slingshots at the monkeys which make them aggressive and hassle the tourists.",
          "This place was such a neat experience. Its nothing like a zoo considering you're in the monkeys home. This is like a true rainforest and it is such a great experience to see everything. I would highly recommend this little tourist destination especially if it is your first time",
          "Visited with my hubby and for the cost it was definitely a worth while visit the Grounds are well kept and such an entertaining day the monkeys fairy made me smile.. Especially when they grabbed my bag off my hubby and I couldn't help for laughing.. Would fully recommend a visit",
          "Interesting place to see, monkey can be a bit agressive if you don\u2019t follow the rules. Worth 1 hour to spend.",
          "Great couple of hours had exploring this place. In a word \u201cAmazing\u201d. Hundreds of monkeys roaming about and the grounds are beautiful and clean. Very easy walk for all ages. The staff that look after the monkeys are great. They feed them and let visitors take photos up",
          "In the Monkey Forest you can see the monkeys live free, in fact when you walk around the forest they could be just near you. The target of the forest is the principle of Sri Hits Karan. It is a physiological current of Hinduism, the meaning of which is formed by uniting the",
          "Beautiful forest with friendly monkeys if you stay away from their babies...just like humans!(I am also unfriendly if a stranger wants to play with my babies!)",
          "There is entrance fee. You will get park map and do and don't instructions. You follow the path. You will come across lots of monekys. Caution is required, do not display any water bottle or food bag. They are very aggressive and will snatch it from you. Park rangers provides",
          "A great place to spend a couple of hours. The surroundings are beautiful with some really old temples and lots of history. Good facilities but could do with a cafe ( maybe we missed it!). It\u2019s the monkeys that make the most fun though- clearly very well cared for and both",
          "My boyfriend and I came here on a rainy day but still has fun. It is a beautiful maintained sanctuary with lots of energetic monkeys. We were able to capture some food photos of the monkeys and enjoyed watching them.",
          "We loved hanging around with the monkeys. They weren\u2019t dangerous and tried to steal from us. They were well taught and quite friendly. It is a beautiful and calm place.",
          "Becareful in there. Do not bring a knapsack or backpack or any food unless you want a monkey to jump down on you for out of no where and start to unzip your back. I witness it. It is not pretty. Remember you are not at the ZOO. You are in their environment. You are a visitor in",
          "Amazing monkey park located in a forest nearby Ubud. You can get there using their free transfer. Be careful with your camera and other properties because monkeys go crazy with sparkling things. If you are lucky you will be able to shoot a great photo with these funny animals.",
          "It was great fun to walk and observe monkeys. It is safe just don't disturb animals and everything will be fine.",
          "A good place to unwind and take photos, but be careful not to tease them. Easy to find at the end of Monkey Forest Road.",

          "We arrived around 3 pm and we were the only ones there! So we get the whole place to our selves. A lovely guide showed us around in a calm, relaxing pace and she told us all the stories about the monkyes. If you follow the rules you will have a great experience! The monkeys",
          "It\u2019s safe and fun if you are obeying the rules listed in the entrance area. Do not bother monkeys and they can be very cute. Do not bring any food while visiting!!! They are going to take it anyway so to be safe it\u2019s better not to have any food in your bag.",
          "Monkeys are Mischievious. Keep everything on lockdown and don't forget monkeys have thumbs. Great ambling afternoons. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude09",
          "Worth the visit. Nice sanctuary. Of course there are monkeys all over the place. We were worried about the monkeys aggressiveness from reading on internet but in reality monkeys live their lives and leave you alone if you don\u2019t bother them and don\u2019t have food. We had no issue",
          "My husband and I had a lovely afternoon walking around the Monkey Forest. As soon as you walk through the gates there are monkeys sitting, running, playing, fighting and swinging in the trees. It was relaxing, and engaging, from the start. The trees have developed",

          "we all enjoyed the monkey forest but make sure all your belongings are secure! We lost some bushmans insect repellent and think the monkeys are all mozzie free now \ud83d\ude01",
          "We hired a taxi and visited the monkey sanctuary. The ethos of the place is good and the monkeys seem well cared for. We were able to walk around freely and weren't troubled by the monkeys at all, but there were always plenty of staff on hand if there had been a problem. There",
          "We visited the sanctuary in the afternoon as we read the monkeys are less aggressive after they\u2019ve been fed at 2pm. The monkeys were great and so were the staff who work in the park. You\u2019re not allowed to touch the monkeys however they one did climb on my boyfriend and wasn\u2019t",
          "Great day but be careful of your belongings. Jeep things in bags and zipped up. They are very clever",
          "Lovely sanctuary and great to see the monkeys living as they should. Great walks and marvelous photo opportunities without disturbing the monkeys",
          "Nice place. I hate zoos but this is such a lovely place where the monkeys run freely and they can come and sit on you if they want. Super nice and really worth a little fee paid.",
          "We visited some days ago and the forest had so many monkeys. Some aggressive, fighting eachother and stole a water bottle from a woman. The surrounding was great, a nice forest. We were a bit uncomfortable being so close to the monkeys but we knew what we got into \ud83d\ude05 if you like",
          "Went there with my wifei and had a lof of fun for a couple of hours. You get to be surrounded by monkeys from everywhere and if you are \"lucky\" you get to be touched by the monkeys, yes, they touch you and not viceseversa. While taking pictures there a few times monkey jumped",
          "Lovely setting. Be prepared to be surrounded by monkeys. Cover up because the mosquitoes are about. Loads of fun and close to the Ubud markets.",
          "Nice way to spend the morning walking amongst nature and seeing the cheeky monkeys doing their thing. Advise to go in the morning as the natural canopies in the sanctuary trap in the heat making it hotter and steamier than it already is. Also avoid wearing backpacks as the",
          "This was part of our sight seeing tour and was definitely worth the visit. Definitely fun and something out of the norm",
          "Absolutely loved the Monkey Forest! Had read a ton of reviews saying it was a scam and it was pretty lame but I literally had the time of my life! So so so many monkeys of all sizes everywhere, some friendly and some scary! We walked around for about 4 hours without getting",
          "A very pleasant few hours spent here. Beware though, these monkeys will steal anything, they can unzip backpacks, will take glasses, hats etc. Don't make yourself a target. Saying that, most will leave you alone, especially if you have nothing worth taking.",
          "The monkey forrest was walking distance to our hotel so we decided to give it a go. The entrance fee is quite reasonable. The nature in the forrest is beautiful, and it was fun to see the monkeys doing their tricks. I did not enjoy some tourists clearly breaking the rules and",
          "Fun to check out the monkeys who were cute, as long as you left them on their own. Great to have been there to experience it. Awesome family activity!",
          "A 20min walk from Ubud centre. Wonderful experience, so glad I went. Obey the rules and you will be just fine. Highly recommend you don't wear sunnys, hat etc. I watched 2 pairs of sunnys get taken, a bottle of orange juice from lady's open bag and a cliff bar from bag. Was",
          "It was nice to observe the monkeys in their natural habitat, at the same time rather sad that most of the forest around them has disappeared,",

          "I wasn't at all interested in visiting the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, but I sure am glad I did. We spent a delightful few hours wandering among the beautifully maintained shady trees and temple buildings, watching the monkeys' antics. Not one bit of bad or aggressive",
          "It\u2019s been always great to visit this special place! The guest should however remember that this is not a Nat Geo and respect the nature and monkeys (unless one is looking for troubles).",

          "A lovely place to walk round and see monkeys hanging about and playing in teh park. They are free to roam around and are very interested in people and inquisitive of your belongings , so be careful. The park keepers ensure that the monkeys are well fed which keeps them attached",

          "The park is nice, lots of monkey which will steal your stuff of you do not pay attention. Some can be aggresive if you try to touch them or if you look straight into their eyes. I wanted to take a picture, sitting near one and probably I have looked into her eyes, as she grabed",
          "Great place to take pictures. If you are alert and follow the rules... you will be fine and having a great time.",
          "As long as they are fed, and you follow rules...the forest is worth it alone. Cool and graceful. Overgrown roots, mossy strobe, chuckling river.",
          "Look, I love this place. It\u2019s forest, there\u2019s a temple and lots of sculptures, but how many stupid tourists did I see touching baby monkeys then getting more than they bargained for? LOTS! There are signs everywhere saying don\u2019t touch the young monkeys, watch your belongings",
          "Great experience, monkeys are free to go where ever they like. Well looked after and fed by the locals every morning. Keep everything in a bag zipped up and close to you, because the cute monkeys will take it. They love water bottles \ud83d\ude02",
          "The monkey forest is a MUST SEE in Bali! The park is a really cool place to visit with so many monkeys walking all throughout the park. Its centrally located with several shops and restaurants around too!",
          "It was neat to see all of the monkeys interacting in a natural environment as opposed to something like a zoo. We had a guide with us; he gave a great background on behavior, history, and warnings. The monkeys, much like all the roaming Balinese dogs, are free to be",
          "This is a s park-like sanctuary where macaque monkeys roam freely. They are also free to leave the sanctuary, and you will see them on the power lines down the street. There is about a $8 USD sanctuary entrance fee. If a monkey sees you have something and wants it, they will",
          "Lovely settings but a bit nerv wrecking when the monkeys are getting a bit to close or visitors stir them up with their shouting and screaming. Abolutely a must while in Ubud but don't forget to follow the rules while in the forrest",
          "I was staying nearby the monkey forest and decided to walk through the forest on my way to the central Ubud . I arrived first thing in the morning and page and insert the monkey forest and 8:30 am. I followed all the instructions regarding safety and security inside the monkey",
          "We got a driver for the day out to ubud. Great trip out. The forest is surrounded by roads but the entrance and walk in is beautiful. Most accessible place I have seen in Bali for pushchairs or wheelchairs, wear shoes that can get muck on them. We didn\u2019t take anything in as",
          "Place worth to visit for everyone, from kids to adults. Big forest with a lots of funny creatures. Hide your sunglasses, water, jewelry in your bag or don't wear it at all, as monkeys might still it from you. Keep your bag closed and by your side. Overall we enjoyed watching",
          "We were picked up at the hotel and our first stop was the Sacred Monkey Forest in Ubud. Of course there are many monkeys, but as well a lot of nice spots to take photos. Even though it is a park where you have to pay an entrance fee, it is pure nature and you feel like you are",
          "Fun day out with friends - totally recommend for families. Don\u2019t be afraid, they will only come to you if you are poking for it.. otherwise they mind their own business. The Monkey Forest is a walk, you can probably finish it in about 2.5 hours depends on how busy and how long",
          "It\u2019s a great place to get close to The monkey true environment. Fully recommend. The monkeys are used to visitors so they are not violent with people. Also it\u2019s full of guards in case of any attack.",

          "The best place to meet monkeys. Also the forest is nice in hot weather because of the shadow. A lot of monkeys, they are not aggresive if you are not an idiot. We met group of russian young men which yelled at monkeys and behave like total idiots, really disappointing, poor",
          "Probably the best thing to do in Ubud. It's quite a large circuit so can take awhile. The monkeys are very cool. A little scary lol but very cool. You can just stand and watch a group for ages. Quite entertaining. Some parts are stinky and it's quite hot but that's to be",
          "This was a very cool experience. We were told to hide anything the monkeys might want to grab and we kept the toddler in a baby backpack. No monkey\u2019s bothered us or jumped on him. We did see them chase a boy and pull a few ladies skirts. I\u2019d recommend not wearing a skirt if you",
          "An awesome spot to come and get up close to the local monkeys. They are very curious and will have no hesitation at getting up close to you. Even with the knowledge of trying to keep you property close so they can\u2019t grab it they were able to still steal my water bottle.",

          "This is a fabulously well set-up area but despite being \u201coff-season\u201d here, the tourists flicking through (ovs including ourselves) way exceeded monkeys. Every photo opportunity has numerous people boggling for prime position. Despite warnings and others experiences, there was",

          "On previous visits here we have visited the forest and found it interesting but only for a short time. We stayed in a different part of town this time where we needed to walk alongside monkey forest to get into the centre. There is a path that runs alongside it for quite a",
          "I enjoyed the natural environment of being in the monkeys habitat even though the monkeys have a bad habit of being sneaky and naughty... I was fortunate to see a monitor lizard big one at least 1 meter long... Definitely recommend visiting the forest...",
          "We loved walking around the monkey forest there were so many monkeys here. Some were a bit cheeky as to be expected but common sense around wild animals is a given. We saw people trying to sit next to monkeys and trying to give them water bottles etc. There are signs everywhere",
          "Walking around the sanctuary takes more or less half an hour with monkeys everywhere. There is the staff who would help you take photos with the monkeys as well!",
          "This was such a fun stop! There are monkeys EVERYWHERE. We got some great pictures. The only downside is that you can't take water in with you and it is so so so so hot in Bali! :)",

          "The site is not well maintained and the monkeys are not particularly well behaved. I would suggest simply encountering monkeys in the street in Ubud near the forest.",
          "This was so much better than I expected, the entrance fee is worth it just for the beautiful grounds but the monkeys really make this extra special. This was so good I am going back again, definitely my highlight of Ubud so far !!",
          "Great day out. Beautiful sacred forest where the animals run freely. After going to Bali for a yoga retreat, we took a day out to do some fun activities. A trip to the sacred forest in Ubud was a highlight of our day. Not a lot of places offer seeing animals in their natural",
          "This place gets 10/10 from all my children. We are generally avoiding places with animals after being horrified in Vietnam and reading mixed reviews for most places here. For every person writing enthusiastically about birds flying round freely in Bali Bird Park there is another",
          "I was anxious about visiting here but many of my friends had been and recommended this. Its great to see the monkeys in their natural environment. They will not come near you unless you have a water bottle. Please do not take this in with you or hide it from the monkeys as they",
          "Nice place to walk around if you get there early, it's peaceful and nice and the monkeys are generally pretty well behaved. However, while we were there a big group of school students came on busses and were really loud which changed the whole vibe of the place, and also got the",
          "Great place to visit. Effortless walking and nicely paved pathways. Much of the sculptures are in mosaic and a few covered with green moss. An abundance of trees that provide great shade. One is not allowed to carry food r feed the monkeys. Only when you inside you will",
          "This forest looks like the Lord of the rings, beautiful and very well take care, the monkeys is the best and they well taken care and free to move around",
          "For only 70k IDR per person you cannot go wrong spending a couple of hours walking around these beautiful grounds. Preserved for the monkeys and local wildlife. It is so nice to see animals in their natural jungle habitat instead of in cages. I have been twice and both times got",
          "Well worth the price! Beautiful statues and jungle vegetation! The monkeys were a lot of fun. They did an amazing job developing this place",
          "So many cheeky monkeys in a lovely sanctuary. Easy to spend time watching the monkeys playing, eating & just being cheeky, also amusing to see different reactions from other visitors. Our 2nd visit in 2 years on a day trip to Ubud we wouldnt have missed seeing the monkeys",
          "Pros: The forest was clean and the staffs were helpful when a monkey snatched our belongings. Cons: Inconveniently located. No food available nearby. Nobody was allowed to go into the temples (correct me if I am wrong). Overall, it was not worth the long car ride from DPS",
          "I have been to all kinds of nature parks, including Night Jungle etc in Singapore. Never have we experienced such a fabulous environment for animals as this forest, had to be over 1000 monkeys of all ages, in a huge undated free roaming environment, with streams , waterfalls,",
          "The monkey forest is always one of our highlights of our Bali trips. Not only are the monkeys adorable, the forest itself is a beautiful area to spend a couple of hours strolling through. Whenever we are in Bali we always plan at least one trip to Ubud just so we can include a",
          "We had a nice trip to the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary. Not to expensive, and you can walk around in the forest for hours if you want. Monkeys everywhere.",
          "The entrance fee is reasonably priced and the experience is wonderful. There are so many monkeys and seeing them just live in their natural habitat is so interesting and fun. The natural landscape is quite breathtaking as well, and there are many temples along the path.",
          "Beautiful forest. There is not much to walk inside, a small temple. The monkeys come when the employee calls them. Not to be touched, they jump on you when the employee gives the monkeys snacks.",
          "Up close with the monkeys worthwile attraction kids love it , Good value for money take plenty of photos",
          "Read visiting rules: hide all bottles, toys, glasses, food and watch your kids. Nice but small park. Take a map at the entrance to find a way",
          "If you are in Ubud, this is a must see. Very beautiful. Not big of a forest. It took us about half an hour to walk the whole forest. The monkeys are very cute but be careful with your belongings. We heard multiple stories that the monkeys can and will sniff out any food. So we",
          "Ubud Monkey Forest (Mandala Suci Wenara Wana) is a reserve located at Padangtegal Ubud, Bali. There are hundreds of long-tailed Balinese macaques living in the forest. Here, you can observe the monkeys in their natural habitat and click many amazing photos. There are also three",
          "So worth the relatively low admittance price, cannot recommend enough. The monkeys are very interactive so keep your things close!",
          "Very nice and big place. We stayed there few hours watching the monkeys, taking photos and walking around. Friendly customer service.",
          "We visited here as part of the full day Baki Tour. The monkeys are in the wild, sort of. They are fed by humans and they are totally use to being around humans. That said, they may take your glasses or anything else they\u2019re interested in. We watched attendants retrieve a pair",
          "Can\u2019t visit Bali without this experience! The monkeys were very friendly and loved seeing them in their natural (as can be) state. Very shocked at their level of intelligence.",
          "Based on reviews, we opted to arrive right at 8:30, and were so glad we did for a few reasons. It was easy to purchase tickets (no line, credit cards accepted). We were the first ones in, and therefore we had an unfettered view of the sanctuary and monkeys. We were there alone",
          "Have been here 5 times Love the scenery So much to look at & experience If you\u2019re scared of the monkeys go in the afternoon when they\u2019ve been fed all day & just stay away from them Don\u2019t put your hands in your pockets or carry bags as they think you have food I\u2019m not",
          "It is bit expensive in comparison to other attractions here but fully recommend it. Monkeys seem to be happy as well ;)",
          "This is a fantastic experience to walk amongst the monkeys and watch them interact and go about their day.",
          "The Sacred Monkey Forest was so much fun! I had no idea we would be in such close proximity to the monkeys but we had no issues with aggressive or violent primates. A monkey did jump on my husband\u2019s back (he was wearing a backpack) and managed to steal our bug lotion out of a",
          "We were advised to take a visit and we did we were dropped there by our hotel and walked back. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Well signposted route around the sanctuary. The monkeys were being fed at sites all around the park. Impressive river valley. One of our members was bitten by a monkey , probably better not to hang around in crowds of human visitors.",
          "This is the place you must visit while you arround in Ubud. Recommended this place but please makesure your important thing is not show while you take picture with the monkey. Heheh",
          "Amazing place with amazing energy! Definitelly going back! Had a lot of fun with the mokeys and took amazing photos!",
          "There are Monkeys all around...They sometimes like to play with you...safe though. Dont feed the monkeys and dont disturb them they are used to human beings and are curious like small children..may like to check out your bags and carry on for eatables or something to play with.",
          "Pretty average, give it a miss unless u have nothing to do. But typical Bali tourist stuff, so this review is probably meaningless",
          "Brilliant trip to the Monkey Forest. It was lovely to see them all running around in their natural habitat. There were staff on hand to capture amazing photos too. There was also a blind monkey, and one who had an injury, which were housed separately to keep them safe and given",
          "Warm greetings and smiles as I walked up.. Even the security in the parking area greeted and smiled.. A very clean and modern venue.. Combined with the forest.. A family outing for sure.. And several areas where tourists could watch and observe the monkeys doing their thing.. A",
          "What can I say...this place is brilliant and the other reviews say it all really. Top tip...go early to avoid the crowds.",
          "Really enjoyed our visit - the monkeys were very cute and fun to watch - just do t look them in the eye!!! The surrounds are beautiful. We went about 11am and it was busy with tourists.",
          "Great outing to see the Monkeys and the Temple. Be sure not to wear anything that stands out or carry any food, as the monkeys are very good at grabbing items from you. Forest is well kept and there are hundreds of Monkeys.",
          "This is not like a typical zoo in the US. This is truly a monkey sanctuary where you are walking in their domain. They are free to run and jump everywhere around you and run along with you as you stroll through the beautiful grounds. Luckily none of the monkeys climbed on us,",
          "I enjoyed visiting the sanctuary and learning more about the Balinese culture and history of the sanctuary. We visited around 1pm and had no issues with the animals. The monkeys did not pose any trouble and mainly stayed away unless you broke the rules, for example chasing",
          "Loved it here, there are litterally monkeys everywhere. I was a bit nervous about them jumping all over me but think if you follow the rules you will be fine. Did see a few dive on people but from what I saw it was the tourists own fault.",
          "The Monkey forest is \u201ca must\u201d if you go to Ubud, and I don\u2019t see why it is. Yeah, it\u2019s fun for maybe half an hour to see all of the monkey playing around and everything, but you can even see that from outside without even paying the entrence fee. Also, we thought that it would",
          "It is a great attraction for these that want to spend a nice time on an easy going walk. It is indeed a lot of monkeys and they are not shy at all. Actually, they are carefully checking if you only have something that they could steal. There are also guardians that make sure",
          "They feed the monkeys and keep them somewhat contained in this sanctuary so the monkeys are really all over the place. The employees are great with the monkeys. Monkeys are so so cute!",
          "This was included in a day tour. Be careful of the monkeys. While I was there one girl got bitten as she tried to feed one. Plenty of signs around saying don\u2019t feed them. Another monkey stole a woman\u2019s earring. Just be very wary of the monkeys as some of them are very cheeky.",
          "The monkeys don't bother you, there are plenty of workers feeding them corn so lots of photo opportunities, good walks a few stairs, very well maintained and definitely in our opinion worth a visit, we would visit again when back in Ubud",
          "Get there early when there are fewer people. Shady area and plenty of relaxed monkeys around doing there own thing. Nice coffee shop just outside exit 3.",
          "The Monkeys are somewhat agressive and don't hesitate to steal You things they want ! If you try to retreive it they show their teeths and You better let it go !!!",
          "It feels scary, but i really think it's just of human nature to get scared of unknown things. Otherwise it's nice to see much monkeys at one place. Although if you take a road which is monkey crossing, you can easily save some 80k of IDR, cause there are a lot of monkeys too.",
          "Really good monkey forest located in Ubud. There much more friendly monkey. Make sure you read the guidelines before you enter the forest. The entrance tickets not so expensive IDR 80k per person. For you like to see monkey, We recommend to visit this park.",
          "Definitely worth a visit, the entry fee is pretty reasonable and it\u2019s generally cooler than elsewhere due to being in basically jungle climate! You really are up close to the monkeys which in reality we found a bit intimidating but it was still a good trip",
          "Went to monkey forest as my friend wanted to go there . The monkey seem happy enough and are feed often . It seemed odd to me a little like a Disney theme park .Lots of photo opportunities most of the monkeys seem friendly and some were shaking hands with people and climbing on",
          "A beautiful Walk into the Woods with plenty of Monkeys in their natural habitat. The sculptures are marvelous. Entry Fees per adult is 80k. Chill place to relax and spend some time with nature.",
          "Really not expensive. It's clear the monkeys are well cared for. From the moment you arrive you can't walk 2 minutes without seeing some monkeys. They will get close to you. Many staff on hand to help if you need it. Out of respect please just obey the local rules.",
          "Love the monkeys \ud83d\udc12 We got there early in the morning while the monkeys were eating, so we did experience any animal bad intentions because we had heard they would try to take things from you. Had a great time taking pictures.",
          "The park is a self walking tour through a nice little park. Entrance fee was about 6-7 usd a person. Apparently the monkeys here aren't as friendly as other Monkeys around the island. you can't touch and do much with the monkeys and we were done with it in about an hour. I was",
          "U can see these many monkey at any odd place at delhi, agra l, shimla and other monkey menace places.. Beware of them.. They can snatch anything.. Keep tight",
          "I have been to s monkey forrest in England, this one is a different league. There are lots of monkeys that just ignore you but watch out for monkeys stealing food and bags. My wife had two monkeys climbing over her trying to steal her glasses and hat. I thought it was funny",
          "The park was a lot smaller than I expected, especially knowing it was in a jungle, however the trip was still enjoyed and we did have encounters with some beautiful, placid monkeys.",
          "Gorgeous place, was a bit taken back by all the monkeys. My bag was grabbed and took a few pulls to get it back.",
          "First time to this Monkey Forest, had a good day. The walk through the forest is mostly in the shade and is an easy walk. Will you see monkeys? They are all over and are very active. Strolling through the grounds you hear the chatter and squealing of the groups and individuals.",
          "Very nice place...the staff are friendly you must be careful from the monkeys don\u2019t look them in eyes.",
          "Seems to be well run, advise not to feed the monkeys and a pleasant place to take a walk around. Hard to find information on the shuttle bus.",
          "I love these kind of places to be able to watch the animals up close and personal. Some of the monkeys can get a little too close and try to take whatever you have that they seem to like. Just be aware of your surroundings. When you walk around you will be able to see how the",
          "Didn\u2019t know what to expect as visits to the temples has been a bit of a let down. Pleasantly surprised, great guides to help scattered throughout the sanctuary",
          "Like going for a pleasant walk in a park. Don\u2019t bring food or drinks and you\u2019ll be ok. Not stroller friendly. There are ground staff around for helpful info. Signboards provide adequate information. Would probably it go again.",
          "Nice view on the natural surrounding. Big trees, monkeys, and trees again. Make you think hiw many wonderful trees are there in the island and how would have been the area before cutting most of them for rice fields...",
          "Great to see free ranging monkeys. Very safe, just give them space and don\u2019t stick camera in their faces. Don\u2019t tease them with food. Clean, well-kept park with waterfalls and pools that the monkeys jump into. Don\u2019t miss it",
          "The Monkey forest is definitely one of the must-go places in Bali. The forest is located right in the heart of the Ubud area in Bali. The forest is a small closed area with lots and lots of trees, monkeys, very old sculptures and 3 temples - Pura Dalem, a shiva temple, Pura",
          "Fabulous to see how animals and humans can live together in harmony. The people see the monkeys As sacred and leave them alone. In return the monkeys are not afraid and allow you to see them up close - even the tiny babies",
          "Always enjoy monkeying around with these cheeky animals! The forest itself is full of fascinating statues and temples and so green and lush. Watch your possessions carefully as the monkeys have nimble fingers. There is also a great cafe nearby you shoud visit Cafe du Monyet...",
          "The old temples in Bali are so artistic and beautiful. They have a lot of monkeys that are not in total captivity. The staff are nice and are always attentive to guests.",
          "Having ventured here 25 years ago I wanted to take my kids for the experience. It has certainly changed from the crude forest where you bought some bananas and the monkeys come running at you. A beautiful visitors entrance and lovely timber walkways take you through the forest.",
          "We had the most amazing experience with our guide Putro. He was friendly and helpful, he even carried our backpack for us. Thank you Putro for making oir day trip so amazing. Leon & Madeleine from South Africa",

          "The walk through the natural rainforest is worth the cheap admission price alone. The monkeys were not interested in us during our visit. Allow up to 1 hour to wander around the Sanctuary.",
          "Forest is so good also you feel your in movie of monkey I like it this experience so so much and I like old style and culture",
          "It is iconic to Bali spend one hour taking pictures so long one does not have connections with the monkeys it is safe",

          "The park is well organised and clean. It is easy to walk around and lots of info how to walk and behave against the monkeys. The monkeys seams very ok and live their lives and interact now and than with visitors. They are not scary but funny. The guards are keeping the visitors",
          ".....this is one place you can see them close up, feeding, relaxing, playing and getting friendly with one another. You are asked not to approach them, feed or try to pet them for a reason. You are in their evironment, so leave them to it. You will see odd ones outside the",

          "The green around and a pleasant place with monkeys around. It feels good to see where we all had come from . You will find many active monkeys which are even ready to pose with you but it's definitely at one's own risk. It's prohibited to disturb monkeys but I saw feel people",

          "It\u2019s a well laid out and organised sanctuary - lots of monkeys seen in their natural environment. But if you are short on time, and/ or have older kids, could potentially give it a miss.",
          "Enjoyed my visit there. Fascinating to observe monkeys going about their lives and interacting with each other. Do drop by. You won't regret it.",
          "I would skip this on a trip to Ubud. I had been warned by a few folks not to go because it was so touristy but I wanted to see the temples since we were staying in a hotel nearby. Not worth it and actually dangerous. You cannot go inside the temples, they are always closed and",
          "We were staying in Ubud so took a walk to see the monkey forest. Apparently money is being invested in the area and it looks quite something as you approach the entrance. The monkeys are essentially wild within the forest area and although lined with fences, there is nothing but",

          "The first ten minutes will get you to plenty of monkeys... the next 60-90 a lot more of the same. Interesting to see (but up to a point). A subset of visitors manage to behave more like monkeys than those with tails, doing everything the signs say not to do. Guess what? The",
          "This visit had been recommended by friends and was one of our first activities in Ubud. Overall it is a good place to spend a few hours without having to travel to nearby forests. They have staff looking after the safety of visitors and fauna and the monkeys are used to having",
          "2nd time i visited monkey forest and I enjoyed it even more. Don\u2019t wear anything loose like glasses or jewelry. They\u2019ll sometimes climb your back and if you have a bag, they\u2019ll open it and steal things from it. Walk around the area and just enjoy. If you have food, they will",
          "Lots of Monkeys, it\u2019s a pretty cool walking around this park and there are temples inside the park as well, it\u2019s worth the visit I think it\u2019s a must do if you\u2019re Ubud",
          "Great place with beautiful temples, Indiana Jones feel like! And bunch of monkeys all around! You need to go there!!!",

          "Visited the monkey forest with my sister and we both really loved it! Sure, you can see some monkeys without paying the entrance fee but just hanging outside the forest but you miss the best bits. It\u2019s fun watching the cheeky little monkeys playing togeher and we were worried of",
          "It was a complete immersion in the Indonesian forest and it was fun to see the monkeys bathing in the fountain or being able to push on the sink's knob to drink tap water! Be careful, if you kneel down to take a pic they will jump on your shoulders! Anyway, there are guards",

          "The best surprise we've got when we wolked around the big monkey forest and their temple, was meeting the big bats and how friendly they were. Even if the 5 macaco monkey families (more than a thousand members),they were living on that place fot a long Time, and being benereited",
          "An extremely beautiful place. Extremely clean and constantly getting swept and cleaned while being there. Very friendly staff. Just a warning something everyone should inform themselves about at the start is what do you do when a monkey climbs you and then starts biting. What",
          "Great fun for the family. Well priced for the experience. The views were spectacular. We just took one small bag and kept our hands out of our pockets and the monkeys did not hassle us. People with backpacks, brightly coloured clothing and camera bags etc. hanging everywhere had",
          "To walk around the forest and see little monkeys frolicking around, not in cages and free to do what they want, it\u2019s definitely a must do in Bali. The coffee shop is also a must have at the end.",
          "Having been to the monkey forest approx 5 years ago it seems to have lost some of its authenticity and become more commercialized. It\u2019s still a fun place to visit though. Go early to avoid the crowds!",
          "We expected to see a few monkeys but gees, I think we would have seen around 100+ on our stroll through the park. Babies, families, pack leaders and Mums. They just go about their own business, although one took issue with my partner\u2019s orange shorts. See pic. The minute he",
          "Must visit in Bali and kids will enjoy here to the fullest. We visited here again after four years and was definitely more crowded than our last visit. Do keep any of your food item inside and no small item out of your bag. I had a green dettol sanitizer bottle hanging from my",
          "I cannot recommend this highly enough! Peaceful forest and canyon setting with easy paths and excellent views. As if that wasn't enough...MONKEYS!!! They are everywhere, roaming around freely. This is a sanctuary for them and they clearly own the place. What's yours will rapidly",

          "We visited the monkey forest January 2020, our experience was really good and exciting, the monkeys are well looked after and the park attendants very good with the tourists and monkeys. The monkeys of course can be temperamental so you must be careful and not go too close",

          "I was not keen on a visit since we encountered aggressive monkeys a few years ago but it seemed a lot nicer, I think stopping people from feeding them has calmed them down. I saw no aggression at all which was very different from last time. It\u2019s a beautiful walk up and down",

          "This was a great experience and lovely to see the monkeys in a natural habitat rather than ring fenced. Circular walk around the sanctury made the trip easier to facilitate. Good facilities as well",

          "My boyfriend had been before so suggested we leave bags etc in the hotel which was nearby. I'm so glad we did. The monkeys are very clever. They will get into a backpack in seconds and pull out what ever they can find and it will be gone. Dont bring food or drink in as they can",
          "What isn't there to like about Monkeys playing in trees and bushes as you take a leisurely walk through the forest. There is plenty to look out for especially the young ones. People with Bags and backpacks are of special interest to the monkeys, they love jumping on you to see",

          "The Monkey Forest is truly a beautiful place to visit, so many monkeys to see from fully grown (slightly aggressive males) to females holding their babies. My guide was brilliant and gave me some tips - don't look directly at the males, they take this as confronting behaviour",
          "The improvements at the Monkey Forest are awesome - we were a group of 12 travelling & it provided \"surprise & delight\" moments for everyone - especially loved the young monkeys playing in the water fountain. The new ticket booths & entrance area really show the care &",

          "We had a great time at the forest. The monkeys are obviously used to tourists being around but you do still need to pay attention to what you are doing while there. Follow the rules and you will have an excellent experience. A top tip would be to get here early, ideally as",
          "This is our second visit to the Sacred Monkey Forest. Amazing experience and great walk through. Many facilities at hand. We booked a private driver and this was one of our chosen stops. Monkeys will jump on you if you have food or water. Dont panic, walk away and they jump off.",

          "Although a typical tourist attraction, we enjoyed our walk through this park and interacting with the Monkeys. If you are in Ubud, it is worth taking a 30-60 min stroll through this attraction even if created for tourists.",
          "There is possibility to see monkeys in Ubud without paying for it. It was disturbing to see how ramgers in the park behave with monkeys. Some toourists also forget that these are wild animals. Overall nice walk in natural forest, home for monkeys.",
          "Took a trip into Ubud to visit the monkey forrest and the kids loved it even though at first they weren't too sure about the monkeys. Shame that they stopped letting you buy bananas for them but I can understand that some of the more \"adventurous\" monkeys can be quite",
          "This is a very popular tourist location where the monkeys roam free and the visitors walk along paths amongst the monkeys. Our bus driver said we should spend between 60 and 90 minutes there. Signs warn you about the rules for the park. They emphasise that you must look after",

          "We came here on a day trip up to ubud and it was very fun and cool. We saw hundreds of monkey that all were friendly to us. We have heard some horror stories so we kept our distance and didn\u2019t get to close which they seemed to like. Great place to visit as the monkeys are well",
          "I was a bit hesitant to visit the Monkey Forest after hearing about people being bitten and scratched however my friends really wanted to check it out. It was great! There were so many monkeys and a majority of them were well behaved. There was clear signage showing you the",

          "We felt we couldn\u2019t leave ubud without doing the monkey forest. We are glad we did but Felt it would have been fine to miss it also. You can walk there at the end of the Main Street in ubud. Maybe 10 min walk from the centre of town. We had read and heard so many scary",
          "I created a Tripadvisor account just to post this. As an inveterate worrier, I trawled through Tripadvisor reviews for the Monkey Forest, concerned for losing my belongings or (more extremely) having to get shots if I was bitten. I almost didn't go, because I didn't think it",
          "Alot of monkeys and nice environment, you get alot of opportunity to get good pictures. Go there in the morning if you don\u2019t want to much people there.",
          "I really like it but please follow the rules, we didn't pay a lot of attention to all of them and some monkeys stole our things ( they open our bag ) but it was our fault. Now is funny to remember that. So just be careful and you will enjoy it 100%",

          "We visited the Ubud Monkey Sanctuary in 2015, at the time when you could still buy bunches of bananas from vendors in the park and feed them to the monkeys. The monkeys were very aggressive, jumping on visitors, stealing things like phones and bags, and yelling and fighting.",
          "Spent almost two hrs walking through here. Lots of monkeys, everywhere. Some beautiful pathways. In the heat of the day you get a fair amount of shade amongst the trees. Nice walk.",

          "We loved the monkey sanctuary. It was fascinating to watch them roam, feed and in some cases cause mayhem! My daughter loved it. The grounds are well kept and we saw several feeding sessions. No cages? Just a huge forest. One tip- keep your water bottle out of sight. If they",
          "The monkeys are very spoiled here and that is exactly what I like to see. They are happy and thriving and so adorable. I had two monkeys \u2018attack\u2019 me but it doesn\u2019t hurt.. they saw my large handbag and wanted to get whatever was in it. I simply shook them off my arms, they are",
          "I love the fact that these monkeys are not caged. They are free to roam around at thier free will. It's not wise to play with them. Nice place to visit",

          "We left early in the morning to beat the sun, and the forest was beautiful! Macaques were everywhere and we never had a problem with them stealing anything, even though I had read it could be a problem. The monkeys were docile and friendly. I even saw a Komodo Dragon lurking in",
          "We had a great time walking around and looking at the monkeys and temples. Definitely worth a stop in. We spent about an hour there.",
          "Staff are pretty rude and disinterested and the whole thing takes less than 30 mins to walk around. Monkeys are actually pretty scary here too - quite aggressive!",
          "The area is big and quite a walk... fun to watch them and the way they behave while eating, playing, fighting with each other etc but need to be careful as sometimes they become violent. Follow the rules on the notice board and act smart.",
          "We enjoyed our walk through the monkey forest. The monkeys are not shy so do NOT take any white plastic bags or tote bags that can\u2019t be properly zipped up, or else you\u2019d better hold it for dear life. The monkeys just jump right on in and open your tote bags or grab your white",
          "This is a well set up venue for tourists with plenty of wide paths and so many monkeys to see! Don\u2019t take in food or drink or they will be after you! A must if in the Ubud region, or from anywhere really.",
          "Abode to the hordes of monkeys, it's not that quiet walk. Monkeys are harmless if you don't bother them. Do not carry anything that catches their attention namely food, wide hats, shiny ornaments etc. Do not startle them. Do not try to pet them. Don't go near a mother with baby.",
          "The monkeys are not timid, literally saw one reach up to try and attack a few people who were waking by. The park is lovely itself but be cautious.",
          "For an eurpean guy, is a very nice experience to walk around monkeys, see them into their own home playing, eating, fighting and more! :) The moneys are very smart so, you have to be careful with your backpack because they know well to open a zipper and still anything they can.",
          "Absolutely in love with this place! If you\u2019re an animal lover but dislike zoos this will make your day! So nice to see monkeys roaming free with not a cage in sight. Watch your belongings though the cheeky devils will rob you of any thing they can get hold of!",
          "The monkey forest in Ubud has nothing much to boast of other than the beauty of the forest and the regular monkeys that come to forage into human territory. For those who haven't seen these primates before it's thrilling otherwise nothing special other than the only attraction",

          "We had a good time strolling through the beautiful forest in the company of the monkeys who were curious about the visitors but very tranquil. I would recommend visiting, I think it could be especially fun for children.",

          "The park is quite big.. some places remind Tarzans jungle. And the main cute bandits on the area are the monkeys of course",
          "Very exciting but scary at the same time! The monkeys are unpredictable and will jump on you on any given time! You just have to follow the rules listed around the sanctuary. Great experience",
          "Full of people but still shady and peaceful. The monkeys are a joy to watch and the temples and carvings are amazing. Please be respectful of the animals. We are the intruders.",

          "Lovely place to visit and the setting is spectacular. Unfortunately a little ruined by the number of people there BUT it is not so much that it ruins the trip/visit. On an ethical note, it does seem that this is a good place to go as you're not feeding the monkeys junk food,",
          "It's one of the main attractions. Just do not take any food of any kind with you! The monkeys are intelligent and can be aggressive if they see food or even food packaging. They love Pringles chips for example.",
          "Came here with my partner. It was very cool to see all of the monkeys. We were very mindful of all of the guidelines to avoid aggression from the monkeys. We were standing on a walk way, quietly watching the monkeys. One came up behind my partner, very calmly, and bit her in the",
          "Excellent for a morning walk before it gets too hot.. Lots of monkeys, beautiful temples and walks.. Good value..",
          "Like a lot of other reviewers, beware of these semi-cute primates. It's a little unnerving that at the entrance of the park, there's a prominently featured first aid clinic. The gardens are nice and the entrance fee is reasonable, but I regret having gone. You can see the",
          "Forest in the middle of the city, surround by good nature, springs, temple, implementations of Tri Hita Karana",
          "A nice park, though serving as a natural monkey habitat. Can't call it exceptional as we had freely-walking monkeys in our hotel, as well, so something usual in Bali. Beware that some of the animals might be aggressive, but overall friendly and accustomed to men presence.",

          "Loved walking here seeing the monkeys \"monkeying\" around and taking pictures. One hopped on my back but did not harm me. Mainly because I am a wildlife enthusiast and did not react in a way to panic the animal. Do not engage or feed them, always maintain a safe distance and",

          "I do try to stay away from overly touristy attractions and I have seen a lot of monkeys in the past however, we had friends in town who really wanted to go to the Sacred Monkey Forest so we headed over. The entrance fee was $80K per person. The sanctuary is larger than I",
          "If you love monkeys, this is a must. They are absolutely everywhere and it becomes quite obvious that you are in their domain because you must follow their rules! The best bit, in my opinion, is the spring temple which has this beautiful stone bridge and lots of old trees. It",

          "You had me at monkey! This was my favorite thing we did in Bali! The monkey\u2019s were a laugh riot to watch. For the most part they could careless that you\u2019re there. So you can get right next to them for amazing pix. They\u2019d go flying past you chasing each other. One monkey",
          "My friend wanted to take a photo with the monkeys here in the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary.. As we arrived at this place, they're like 4-6 couples taking their Pre-Nup shoot here wearing their traditional Balinese Wedding Attire. At first first I was a bit scared as this",
          "Excellent spot where literally hundreds of very tame monkeys are running around playing with eachother. Unlike other places in Bali where the monkeys are highly aggressive, here they regularly feed the monkeys which makes them very tame a friendly.The temple itself is a fun walk",

          "This surpassed all my expectations! It was clean, tidy and the monkeys appeared to be well looked after, with plenty of rules for the tourists to ensure the monkeys safety. Entry was only $80k per person and it was a lovely experience.",

          "Despite the signs, these little beasts can be angry but only if you do stupid things around them, they are quite capable of unzipping a back-pack so don't take yours off, they will steal food also, don't intimidate them and enjoy a couple of hours walking around the forest :)",
          "Really enjoyed our time here. As long as you don't get too close to the monkeys, they're quite fine. They are comfortable among people, and not camera shy at all haha. A must visit when in Ubud",

          "I had three monkeys jump on me right at the entrance... once they realized I had no food they hopped off. The rest of the monkeys inside were better behaved! Nice shady walk with cool and cute monkeys all around! If you go with kids, keep em close and discourage them from",
          "We read reviews about getting bitten and monkeys climbing on you steeling your personal effects so we were a bit weary We did see Monkeys steel personal effects but the reason was people had them in open bags or pockets if you follow the basic rules we found this a very fun",

          "Recently visited the forest again and was extremely disappointed. Within two years the entry price has doubled and it was run down. Too busy spending the money on other thing rather than upkeep. Plenty of other things and places to go rather than the monkey forest. Warning.",
          "The monkeys are nice to look at but inevitably exploited and looking for tourists giving them food. We saw a bunch of people get bitten so be careful!",
          "So OK, after reading negative reviews, I was wary. I wasn't even going to go. But our day-trip-driver assured me that it would be fine. It helped that he was really chill. We went first thing when it opened, the monkeys had plenty of food, it wasn't too hot and everyone was",
          "Great price, cool statues and history with so many monkeys! Loved this area and would definitely visit again.",

          "I was wary of going here but was swayed by the fact that it is run and owned by local people, who want to rescue monkeys. As a result, it has about 700 monkeys scattered within its confines. It is not a very large area but the monkeys don't seem to be overcrowded and they don't",
          "It was really nice to see the monkeys around so close to us and super comfortable with all the tourists around taking pictures all the time. There are some restrictions obviously, because they are in their natural habitat, so we need to respect them! (Don't feed them, stare them",

          "If you're in Ubud, the monkey forest is a must-see, even if you're a bit scared of them like me. It was a bit nerve-racking to be in an element where monkeys have run of the land. That is what also makes the experience so unique. There are also temples in the sanctuary as well.",
          "Great spot to visit in Ubud with kids. We traveled as 4 adults and 4 kids aged 4-11yrs old and we all loved it. Monkeys weren\u2019t at all aggressive and the grounds are a beautiful jungle to walk through. Good bathroom facilities and small cafe for refreshments at the",

          "Monkey forest overall is nice experience, however, please do NOT bring any water in plastic bottles with you, or any paper as monkeys will try obtain them. Staff advised to hold bottle tight in case monkeys want to take it off from you - that is NOT a good advise - do not listen",

          "When we first entered the park, we were wondering where all the monekys were. Once we went into the \"cave\" there was no question that there would be plenty of monkeys to see! We arrived during feeding time, and we're not disappointed by the \u2026",

A must-see in Bali!",

          "Most friendliest monkeys. Don't be scared of them, the signs and warnings make you feel like you don't even want to look at them. As long as you stay calm and let them even climb you they wont harm you.  Don't wear earnings, they will try \u2026",

          "Awesome up-close experience with the monkeys. \n\n80k pp entrance fee was worth it for sure. Plenty of chances for your belongings to be snatched by the cheeky buggers but just keep a hand on your sunglasses if they get close and you\u2019ll be fine. Bring a bag and you can leave it at reception for peace of mind. \n\nWill definitely return",

          "The Forest is stunning. Very interesting and  at a low cost. The monkeys are well looked after and given plenty of food. It is not a good idea to take food in or eat it during your walk. The monkeys would still prefer your ice cream \ud83d\ude09. \u2026",
          "A must see out here. Well kept place and monkeys seems healthy and aplenty. Cost $80,000 idr per adult. Didn\u2019t use any restrooms so can\u2019t comment on it. Monkeys are good attitude if you follow the rules. They don\u2019t mind getting close or \u2026",

The natural landscape is quite breathtaking as well, and there are many temples along the path.",
          "Great 2 hour activity! The monkeys are cute and interesting and the beautiful forest is an attraction itself.  I've never seen so many shades of green! Also, getting a photo with a monkey is so cute! We weren't supposed to touch them, but \u2026",

          "Liked it. Would be nice to be able to feed the monkeys but I understand they would get fat. Keep your eye out over the bridge in the forest you can sometimes spot big lizards.\nBeautiful architecture and views",
          "The people working were polite and friendly. The monkeys were super cute and neat and energetic. The forest itself was amazing and lush. A quick walk from downtown Ubud was well worth the very reasonable entry fee.",
          "Good place to spend couple of hours. It's very nice to walk around the monkeys. Not only you see monkeys, but also you could see the architecture of the buildings, sculptures, nature, temples. Be careful if you feed the monkeys, sometimes \u2026",
          "Full of naughty monkeys who are fed 8 times a day so visitors should catch a feeding time. There are some enormous trees that make this a cool place on many levels. The atmosphere is meditatively relaxing. Just make sure to have antimossie spray or lotion so you can sit for a while to chat to the staff and enjoy the ambience.",
          "Good place in Bali. Be aware of your belongings. Well maintained and would request you not to tease monkeys here for food.",
          "The area is awesome it's crazy how it is surrounded by the city still. It's a great get away. Only problem is when I got attacted by a monkey none of the people were around to assist in getting the monkey off my head and out of my bag, which I would expect since you have to pay to get in.",
          "So many cute monkeys! A lot of area to walk around and explore and observe the monkey families. The architecture of the place made me feel like i was in tomb rader. It was pretty out of the way though and I had to take a motorbike there and back to town.",
          "Very shady place to hang out in the hot days. We visited the rice terrace in the morning and monkey forest in the afternoon. What a great arrangement to avoid the heat. The monkeys are kept in a semi natural environment and you will get lots of funny photos of them. Temple and forest also make this place more enjoyable.",
          "Good place with lots of monkeys playing around. Very clean and green. There are washrooms at intervals. There were two temples inside the forest but they were closed for some reason(we went on a Sunday) that was a bit downer. \nThe staff is helpful",
          "MUST SEE - No trip to Bali would be complete without visiting here. The monkeys are free to roam wherever they please and can interact with people as much as they like. The monkeys are playful but very much still wild animals that are not \u2026",
          "Very well maintained forest. Monkeys everywhere. But beware of the ladies at the parking lot. They will try to sell Sarong which is not at all required. At times it becomes irritating as whichever place you go in Bali, it's the ladies who jump at you to sell Sarong. Apart from that it's all good.",
          "This was one of my favorite places to visit in Ubud. I was amazed on how many monkeys we saw there. I wouldn\u2019t recommend bring a backpack or anything that is valuable. The monkeys can unzip or take your belongings with ease. It\u2019s a most if you are in Ubud to visit.",
          "You will get Unique experience definitely. Monkeys can communicate with you as one of a kind. Or ignore you which sometimes is better because they bite.\n\nWe came at 8.30 and there were few visitors. Monkeys are getting food in the morning \u2026",
          "The monkeys are well behaved compared to those at uluwatu temple. But still there was some moments they got too close to the visitors. Thus everyone must take note of the important notes being put up by the authority. A wonderful place to \u2026",

          "With all this vegetation, you have the impression to be in the jungle. The monkeys, which live their life's are a great attraction. Only be careful with the male monkeys because they can be really aggressive.",
          "Saw someone doing the exact opposite of what the signs advise, so a monkey went for him. But if you follow the rules it's all good. The babies in particular are so cute!",
          "We visited around 9.30am in the morning and the weather was so calming you'll feel the essence of jungle. Be careful of ur stuffs because the monkeys could snatch them. Don't engage with monkeys for your own safety though the guards are very protective. Please enjoy the wildness.",
          "I would say it is a tree forest rather than monkey forest.\n\nThe forest is located in the middle  Ubud city center. It is pretty in the city.\n\nThe monkeys are harmless and they are roaming around in the  forest very freely.\n\nThe trees in the \u2026",
          "Beautiful! Not sure who can give this place less then 5 stars! Absolutely amazing! Be careful with locals though, don't feed and try not to interfere a lot. Also don't leave the trash around, but take everything with you back to the city.",
          "A must for all tourists. Just keep hydrated as its gets very hot walking around and its a big forest. Great experience with very tamed monkeys and definitely do not carry anything in your hands they will grab it. When you drink water or cold rink do it away from the monkeys.",
          "It\u2019s such a beautiful place to enjoy nature, temples and of course monkeys. The staff is always around in case you need any assistance. It\u2019s huge stretch of area but marked very well with signs everywhere to ease your experience.",

There are few places which have breathtaking view of the trees. A few monkeys who are old and injured, are kept separately and are very well taken care of.",
          "It was an amazing experience. Tried my best to observe and learn about monkeys in short period of time. Overall, the place is well maintained as well as the monkeys are being taken care off very well by the trust and care takers of sacred monkey forest sanctuary. Cheers!",
          "So beautiful and peaceful. I had this idea that the monkeys were going to try to steal my stuff as seen on the internet. But that wasn\u2019t case here. It was an amazing experience and very well kept sanctuary. Very nice and helpful people all over to explain things.",

        "wiki": "Uluwatu Temple (Balinese: Pura (Luhur) Uluwatu) is a Balinese Hindu sea temple (Pura Segara) located in Uluwatu (South Kuta, Badung). The temple is regarded as one of the sad kahyangan and is dedicated to Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa in his manifestation as Rudra.\n\n\n== History and etymology ==\nThe temple (pura in Balinese) is built at the edge (ulu) of a 70-meter-high (230 ft) cliff or rock (watu) projecting into the sea. In folklore, this rock is said to be part of Dewi Danu's petrified barque.Though a small temple was claimed to have existed earlier, the structure was significantly expanded by a Javanese sage, Empu Kuturan in the 11th Century. Another sage from East Java, Dang Hyang Nirartha is credited for constructing the padmasana shrines and it is said that he attained moksha here, an event called ngeluhur (\"to go up\") locally. This has resulted in the temple's epithet Luhur.\n\n\n== Monkeys ==\n\nThe temple is inhabited by monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), who are notorious for snatching visitors' belongings, such as flip-flops, cameras, and sunglasses. They can usually be persuaded into ransoming the items for fruit, nuts, or candies, although this only encourages them to steal more.\nScientist and experts on primate behavior have conducted studies on the Macaque monkeys in the area and have collected data suggesting that they learn bartering behavior.  This trade is passed down to the young offspring.  New groups of Macaque monkeys introduced into the area quickly adapt and learn the new skill from the locals.\n\n\n== Kecak Dance performance ==\n\nA Kecak dance performance based on the Ramayana is performed daily in Uluwatu temple at every 6pm on the cliff-side. The performance which is outdoors also shows the beautiful sunset at the background of the performance.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJulian Davison, Nengah Enu, Bruce Granquist, Luca Invernizzi Tettoni (2003) Introduction to Balinese architecture (Illustrated by Nengah Enu, Bruce Granquist) Tuttle Publishing,  ISBN 0-7946-0071-9, ISBN 978-0-7946-0071-6\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "I had vacation before, and I'm astonished by the Kecak Dance. The dance was really historical and mythical, since it was played on full moon and depended on moon phase. It was enjoyable to watch and really hope I can visit it again next time.",
          "Worth the visit. Wonderful 1000 year old history, and poses the question how did they do it? Spectacular location and views.",
          "The temple itself is for praying only so you can't get that close. You will only be able to see it from afar but the cliff and sea views are very beautiful. There is also a dance performance that happens every day in the afternoon. Walking around you many encounter some of the",
          "For us, it\u2019s a must to go there! The beautiful cliffs and the ocean make it an absolute photographers dream. The place is crowded, but only at the start of the walk. You can walk your way to the other side and you will be almost alone!There are some monkeys there, and they are",
          "The temple was serene, beautiful, clean a place to be with your own thoughts. The view over the ocean was breathtaking. The walk along the cliff was peaceful and many places to just stop and enjoy the view.",
          "The temple itself isn't that great but the view of the ocean from the cliff is spectacular. We came here for the Kecak dance and it was okay.",
          "Overly crowded during evening period because many tourists arrived for the Uluwatu Dance. Though the sight at the top was beautiful, it was definitely not as impressive as Tanah Lot nor any other sights with an ocean cliff. Not suitable areas to really sit and enjoy the views",
          "Uluwatu Temple is calmly run site well worth visiting. Sweeping views and significant sites with clif top walks connecting all.",
          "Its an old Hindu temple built at a cliff. More than temple its famous for Kecak Dance performance that takes place every evening in an open theater with beautiful sunset in the background. For me not a must visit place except for Kecak performance.",

          "First I want to say that I love the Kecak dance. Saw it in Ubud and decided to see it again in Uluatu temple at sunset. Besides the wonderful setup of this show and the high level of the dancer, the show is disappointing for the following reasons: 1. They let in people far",
          "We visited the temple and i find it an overwhelming experience. The scenery is very beautiful and very majestic! We watch the kecak and fire dance show that was the cherry on the top of this amazing afternoon!!",
          "lots to see and do with some breathtaking views over the ocean. There are a few cheeky monkeys, but they seemed harmless. Lots of culture to become immersed in and a great way to experience a traditional Balinese temple.",
          "Visited at sunset, not too crowded. It is not the most impressive temple in Bali but it is a nice visit especially at sunset due to its West location.",
          "The best location to visit in Bali. The temple on cliff One should BV take care of belongings as monkeys try to take away",
          "I travelled for 3 hours because I wanted to see the peninsular but what I saw was quite disappointing. The monkey menace made things worse. As we entered, my driver let me know that the monkeys at Uluwatu are quite 'naughty' as compared to other areas. As soon as we stepped",
          "Amazing scenery, go in the morning to avoid monkeys. We only saw 5 monkeys and every time anyone got close they would grab their bags or hats. Follow the rules and keep everything in your closed bag. If you are travelling with prams I wouldn\u2019t risk a sunset visit.",
          "A best spiritual experience in Bali. My first time to saw Kecak dance with a beautiful sunset. A must visit place in pecatu",

          "It's a beautiful location with the views of the cliffs. Monkeys are a bit cheeky so hold onto your sunglasses and jewellery. Arrive early if you are purchasing tickets for the fire dance. Lots of people prior to sunset. We booked a tour guide and driver but all the tour guide",

          "Temple itself and the surroundings are beautiful. Ocean and cliffs are very beautiful to look at from this place. If you are visiting this place then do take time to marvel at the views of ocean. Monkeys are very naughty and will try to take things from you so keep everything",
          "We visited the temple with the family, as we had been there previously without the kids. It was so busy with long lines and very restricted parking. It\u2019s a temple, not an amusement park guys. You are expected to wear long pants at all times and ladies are not allowed to visit",
          "This review applies for those with children. We went with a toddler and a baby. A group of aggressive monkeys made multiple attack runs at our baby. We managed to dodge them and run the baby to safety while they circled us and made repeated lunges. Our toddler was screaming with",
          "This temple offers a spectacular view of the coast line. I could have spent hours on end here but the weather conditions were extremely hot and there is little shade so i recommend to take sunscreen. The monkeys can get rather aggressive so I've been told by the tour guide Ketut",
          "There are some very good spots on the cliff that have a really good views, and the temples are very interesting. Just be sure to go on a cool day as it can get very hot with little shade around and get very crowded due to the popularity of this place.",
          "Beautiful spot on the cliff to see the temple and the scenery. Take a walk down to one of the view points. We also took a walk up to see the statue at the top of the hill. Do not enter the space around the statue though.. there are a lot of monkeys around this temple especially",
          "Not at all something that leaves u spell bound. After waiting in the sun for an hour for the tkts, being seated in the heat for an hour minimum, when it starts, it lasts for 53 mins, very little dance. We noticed they missed Act 2 of the 5 Acts they had written in the pre-read.",
          "We stayed in Uluwatu and rented a small scooter - essential for getting around. The temple was nice in the morning without crowds. Lots of stairs as always! Best views are from the cliffs away from the temple (down to the right) Monkeys seemed relaxed when less people!\ud83d\ude00",

          "The attraction of visiting this 11th century temple isn't the temple itself, which is small and only open to those of the hindu faith. Rather it's the magnificent views over the cliffs and waters below. There is about a 1km walk along the seafront that allows you to take it in.",

          "Uluwatu temple is worth a visit for sunset - temple is ok, the main pull factor would be the views on the cliff of the sea. Sunset is a nice time to go and spent time walking around here.",
          "It was so hot and somewhat crowded. We went around 1100am which was too late in the day. The views are incredible and thats what you are really there for. The temple was less than impressive but blow away by the scenery overlooking the Indian Ocean.",

          "Don't waste your time. They crowd soooo many ppl in the place and it's $15 per person for the show and $10 to get into the temple. The seats are on concrete and very uncomfortable. The show isnt even that good. Spend your money else where",

          "31 years since we visited Uluwatu and much has changed in the interim. I guess it's progress to cater for the hordes of tourists now visiting. Understandable that so many want to make the trek to the Temple located spectacularly on the edge of the cliff overlooking the sea some",
          "Uluwatu temple is a misnomer for a tourist in my opinion. It's a perfect spot to watch a awe inspiring sunset. Couple it with Kecak dance performance and you'd get mesmerized with Bali. Go to the top of the temple till you see exit sign. Also, it gets cold after sunset so",

          "Uluwatu Temple and cliff has excellent views, Sunset is spectacular and should not miss Kachak dance show.",
          "This temple is worth visiting for the views alone as it is built on top of a cliff. There is a nice walk on either side of the temple along the cliffs. Not sure if it was just the day we were there, but the monkeys were never an issue and we only really saw a few of them.",
          "this temple will surprise you with its amazing sea view. I will never forget the sound of waves crashing the shore right beneath the temple. the view simply took my breath away. while being here, don't miss the kecak dance during sunset. temple entrance ticket and kecak dance",

          "First of all monkeys! They steal anything they can get their hands on, so be aware of your sunglass, camera, etc. Also you need to be properly dressed, but do not worry about it. The temple will provide sarongs/sashes to visitors. Once inside you will have stunning views of",
          "Extremely boring! Temple is closed, so nothing to see, except for some really nice views from cliffs. We took a cab to reach there, but were really disappointed seeing what it was there. Take a walk around the place,monkeys and that's it. Monkeys!!! so avoid taking shiny",

          "The temple itself was quite small but it takes a beautiful trek along the side of a mountain (overlooking the sea) to get to it. When we went they were charging 50,000$idr but we've heard in the past they sometimes charge 30,000$ to 80,000$, I guess depending on what",

          "We visited Uluwatu on our 2nd day in Bali. Its a well organized venue and the early evening show overlooking the sea and the sunset were highlights of our visit. I will take this opportunity to help out our guide over our stay. Pak Nyoman was our driver and guide for 4 days",
          "We only went for the temple, which is not very visually inspiring. Views are good, but we saw a lot more interesting temples on Bali. We had to miss the dance as we have young child. Was coach loads of people so not our scene",

          "We had been told that this was a premier sunset view location, but it gets crowded at sunset, so we went by day to avoid this. The place was still very busy. The view was okay, but I wouldn't say spectacular. We climbed up several steep stairs and couldn't get close to the",
          "We went for the sunset which was amazing - absolutely stunning and not too busy either. However, the monkeys are just out of control. In the space of 10 minutes we saw about 10 tourists lose their sunglasses, reading glasses and in one case their phone to the menacing monkeys.",
          "Uluwatu is rightly one of the must-see sights in Bali. It\u2019s glorious location alone makes it worthwhile, with wonderful headland views. Unfortunately, the massive carpark, commercial buildings and noisy hordes of people have somewhat moderated one\u2019s enjoyment, as is the case",

          "My 2nd trip here. Looking at the beach and the cliff, the view looks stunning as always but the place is too crowded. Be careful when you visit here with small kids due to so many steps on the way to the temple. Beware of monkeys also since they may take one of your belongings",
          "Very beautiful temple and amazing to watch the sunset from the cliffs but very busy due to the fire dance. The temple has lots of steps so it\u2019s not for everybody. Also the monkeys are so cheeky! Saw them steal a shoe, a phone and sunglasses so be careful! Worth a visit if",
          "We visited the grounds around the temple prior to the Kecak Fire dance show. The location of the temple makes it quite unique and the show was totally worth it although the theatre arena was packed with more than 1,500 people. Totally worth the wait!",

          "The dramatic cliff views on both sides of the temple and the sunset view of the temple from the west side are worth a visit. I was warned of aggressive monkeys, but strangely I didn\u2019t even see a single one during my visit. The fire dance show has some cultural significance, but",
          "The view here is very nice, one of the must visit place when in Bali. The only proble is they there are to many tourist so it\u2019s a struggle to get a decent photo shot. Kecac dance is admirable but not as what I expected. You\u2019ll be lost watching if you don\u2019t know the story so",

          "The temple itself didn't seem to bee anything spectacular, but it's absolutely worth visiting for the stunning views. When you arrive, you have to put on a purple sarong (if you are wearing shorts or a skirt that falls above the knee) and an orange sash belt - it's all provided",
          "Go there for the amazing sunset views you can make great photos. For the rest : the place is crowded, the kecak fire show is quite expensive at 100k on top of the entrance ticket, a little boring, many people leave before the end and spectators are stacked. Also be super careful",
          "Another place to visit for spectacular sunsets. I would consider this better than Tanha Lot and suspect it would be as great at sunrise too. You cannot escape the crowds though and they have a dance performance here. Lots of place to wander around. Visit is recommended.",
          "We visited the temple in the evening around 5pm. It was crowded but we were able to appreciate the beautiful setting. The temple itself is not open for tourists. We were lucky enough to avoid monkeys and didn\u2019t see any actually. We bought tickets for the traditional Ramayan",

          "The Temple is located cliffside and consists of the main temple area and a cliffside walk to some other buildings. Very scenic view of the ocean. Best part of the trip were the monkeys. The guide warned us to take off our glasses, earings, anything that could be easily removed",
          "This old and famous temple in Uluwatu,Bali is situated along side a tall cliff which has mesmerizing and a 360* views. You will be treated to monkeys along the way,so keep your sunglasses,food packets and cameras very,very safe. Try and reach here about and hour before",

          "100% worth the trip. Just make sure you book a return taxi, or arrange taxi to wait for you. We did this with a Bluebird taxi and it was no problem. The show was a bit slow to get started, a little bit boring in the beginning. But once it gets going it's fantastic, there's",
          "I went here during the early afternoon and it was busy but not too crowded. It\u2019s 30k IDR to enter.

          "My experience in Uluwatu temple was great! I was lucky as my Airbnb was very close and I just walked to reach it, after paid they let me wore a tunic in respect of the temple. The temple itself isn\u2019t that big, when I went there were not many people, I think because was early",
          "Hardly a 'temple' as doesn't seem to have any focal point. More like a monkey forest with a group of buildings with high walls, do not enter notices and locked gates. The postcard views are all of a silouette of a tower at the end of a cliff - which is about all you can see.",
          "The temple was ok, nice and big to walk around, even when there are loads of people. Fire Dance was also good, you have to bunch up with locals buying tickets by throwing money in their face and hope the person gives you the tickets. Dont arrive without booking your return taxi",
          "The temple is beautiful but offers very little difference from the other temples around the city. Parts were blocked off because they were solely for worshipers. The view of the sunset and seaside however, were stunning! Simply gorgeous.... I would visit again but only for the",
          "The drive from kuta to the temple took more than 2 hours one way in snail pace traffic. This ruined the experience for us. Google maps showed an hour but it took us 2 hours. If you are staying close to the temple, it is worth a visit. Otherwise no. And finally when we got",

          "It's the kecak dance that is really the highlight as this is probably one of the few places you can get two birds with a stone the view of a sunset over the vast ocean and the dance. If you have seen the dance else where and the sunset elsewhere too can give this a miss.",
          "The temple is built on a cliff top with a nice view of the sea, but the temple itself is not open to public. So not too much to do there. Too many cheeky monkeys snatching food, glasses, caps/hats...whatever else they can lay their hands on. Kecak dance- for the ones who know",

          "This is a pleasant place. We walked around for a while here and enjoyed the views. The cost to enter is 30K each and they have sarongs that you can borrow if you are wearing short pants. The views are quite nice from here, and it is certainly worth a visit in my opinion.",
          "It was a long drive from our Anataya to the temple especially because of the traffic jams. Reaching our destination, we felt that it was worth the trouble. Spread over a vast expanse of land on a hill top, it provides a breath taking view of the Indian Ocean. In fact, the",
          "Ulu Watu was a top 10 site when listing place to visit in Bali and it did not disappoint. We timed the visit to coincide with the famous Cecak dance, which occurs at sunset each day. The dance is performed in an open amphitheatre with Ulu Watu perched high on a cliff above you.",

          "The temple itself isn't that great compared to other Balinese temples but the sight of the ocean waves crashing into the limestone cliff is certainly worth coming out here. Upon entering the grounds, ur advised to remove anything that can catch the attention of the monkeys",
          "A very nice temple. With alot of naughty monkeys. I did not manage to view the kecek dance. But the views around the temple were amazing. The monkey took my glasses away. There alot of monkeys, which will take stuff away from you. So do watch and keep everything, especially your",

It was way different of what I had in mind, it\u2019s a huge area, you have to pay a ticket of 50.000 rp and they give you a sarong to cover yourself so dress respectful. \nAnd be particularly careful for your sunglasses or anything that looks sparkling and fun for monkey cause they love taking them!",
          "Dont forget to watch kecak dance when you here, start at 6 pm, but you have go to ticket box at least at 5 pm to got best view",
          "Beauty temple and have big monkey family",
          "One of the best temples in Bali - make sure you see the dance - get in early it sells out fast.",
          "Uluwatu temple is perched on top of a cliff with magnificent views of the Ocean beyond. There are paved walkways that leads to the temple complex and one can explore the whereabouts of the temple and various statues inside the premises \u2026",
          "A very breathtaking and scenic place. The kecak performance is great. With the sunset and high cliff as the background, it's a must to come here and experience it if you are in Bali. The place is clean, the public toilet is spotless and \u2026",
          "Nice place to visit with exotic Kecak Dance Show.",
          "Love the ocean view from the cliff walk. The monkeys were being mischievous as usual",
          "It has a great scenery, fit for you, photo hunters! If you are willing to wait until sunset, you can watch Bali traditional Kecak Dance. Of course you need to pay more to see it, but it is worth it. The dancers even interact with the audiences which makes the dance more attractive.",
          "Great place and awesome views, traditional temple and during entrance they provide traditional clothes  to use due to holy site. Full greenish area cliff and ancient temple view. This place nice to enjoy sunset. Most important don't show or carry any food items monkey will grab. Total time spending around 3hrs.",
          "Great view! Kindly wear comfortable shoes, bring your mineral water, do not bring food (there are monkeys living in the temple). Don't forget your sunglasses! If you don't like the sun too much, bring hat or umbrella. You can't go to all places in the temple. There are restricted place ie the prayer's section.",
          "Beautiful place. Not too much food to choose from but if you like local cuisine then you will be OK. For me as European it was something amazing. We arrived just on sunset and I can't even describe how beautiful it was. Shame my camera ran out of the battery.",
          "Fantastic views to the temple located on the cliff"

        "wiki": "Tanah Lot (Balinese: \u200b\u1b22\u1b26\u1b04\u1b2e\u1b40\u1b22\u1b44) is a rock formation off the Indonesian island of Bali. It is home to the ancient Hindu pilgrimage temple Pura Tanah Lot (literally \"Tanah Lot temple\"), a popular tourist and cultural icon for photography.\n\n\n== Tanah Lot Temple ==\nTanah Lot means \"Land [in the] Sea\" in the Balinese language. Located in Tabanan, about 20 kilometres (12 mi) North West of Denpasar, the temple sits on a large offshore rock which has been shaped continuously over the years by the ocean tide.\nTanah Lot is claimed to be the work of the 16th-century Dang Hyang Nirartha. During his travels along the south coast he saw the rock-island's beautiful setting and decided to rest there. Some fishermen saw him, and bought him gifts. Nirartha then spent the night on the little island. Later he spoke to the fishermen and told them to build a shrine on the rock, for he felt it to be a holy place to worship the Balinese sea gods. The main deity of the temple is Dewa Baruna or Bhatara Segara, who is the sea god or sea power and these days, Nirartha is also worshipped here.The Tanah Lot temple was built and has been a part of Balinese mythology for centuries. The temple is one of seven sea temples around the Balinese coast. Each of the sea temples was established within eyesight of the next to form a chain along the south-western coast. In addition to Balinese mythology, the temple was significantly influenced by Hinduism.\nAt the base of the rocky island, venomous sea snakes are believed to guard the temple from evil spirits and intruders. The temple is purportedly protected by a giant snake, which was created from Nirartha's selendang (a type of sash) when he established the island.\n\n\n=== Restoration ===\nIn 1980, the temple's rock face was starting to crumble and the area around and inside the temple started to become dangerous. The Japanese government then provided a loan to the Indonesian government of Rp 800 billion (approximately US$130 million) to conserve the historic temple and other significant locations around Bali. As a result, over one third of Tanah Lot's \"rock\" is actually cleverly disguised artificial rock created during the Japanese-funded and supervised renovation and stabilization program.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nEntrance tickets cost 20,000 Rupiah for Indonesian nationals (Rp 15,000 for children), but foreigners have to pay three times the price, or Rp 60,000 (Rp  30,000 for children). To reach the temple, visitors must walk through a set of Balinese market-format souvenir shops which cover each side of the path down to the sea. On the mainland clifftops, restaurants have also been provided for tourists.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThis tourist attraction is located in Beraban, Kediri, Tabanan, approximately 13 kilometers (8 miles) south of Tabanan.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndonesian architecture\nHindu temple architecture\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nPringle, Robert (2004).

          "We stayed in the temple complex so went early morning. Although we didn't get there in any rush we did still beat the majority of the tourists. Tanah Lot translates to \"Land in the Sea\" due to the temple sitting on an offshore rock and that lends to why it's considered such a",
          "We visited this temple on one of the Hindu religious day and it was really busy.The best time to go one hour before sunset. The temple is on a rock in an island which is shaped by the tides. Sound of the waves is very refreshing. The sea is absolutely clean and reflects the blue",
          "Visited this place as a day trip from Sanur. We hired a vehicle from the hotel and went there. The temple is situated at the sea. We checked the time and just reached at the time of low tide. Tourist not allowed inside the temple, one can go and see it from outside. Locals will",
          "Better to see it from the hillside above in order to get a full perceptive Not too many people due to the virus .Probably ahrd to appreciate with large crowds..",
          "This temple is one of the most recognisable indonesian landmarks. It's a beautiful spot, although very crowded, which means it's spiritual halo is long gone. But I would recommend it to anyone. It is best to book a tour because getting there is hard from Denpasar. I tried with",
          "Tanah Lot was our last stop for the day. Our tour agent had to drive fast & dodge traffic in order to reach the place before sunset. We were just in time as traffic was really bad. Tanah Lot is an ancient Hindu pilgrimage temple located in Tabanan. In the Balinese language,",
          "Whilst it\u2019s a beautiful place to see, it\u2019s not like you could \u201csee\u201d that much. You couldn\u2019t enter any temples, so it was all from afar. The shops that there were, were good. We went into the Ralph Lauren shop and were treated beautifully and the cost was less than Australia.",
          "When we visited (late January 2020) there was an important event on so it was very, very busy. Still beautiful to see and I\u2019m glad we came, it certainly didn\u2019t look like the amazing photos you see on instagram and Google images! We visited with a guide which helped to explain",

          "Now, I understand that this place is sacred to the Hindu culture and religion and I can and do respect that. It holds great value to the Balinese but as a traveller it is was one of the most underwhelming sights I went to see in a 10 hr trip to see the top 5 places. It was a 2",
          "We visited the Tanah Lot temple on March 5th and lucked out & happened to visit during their semi-annual ceremony.  It's one of 7 sea temples to worship the Balinese sea gods and dates back to the 16th century. The structure is breathtakingly beautiful as is the surrounding",

          "You may feel disappointed after traveling there for an hour or two. The issue is that you can't see the temple properly - it hidden by the trees, you can't go inside (at least during regular hours), there are too many people around. The seacoast itself is nice and the seaside",
          "Wonderful place! Although we were there during high tide, we enjoyed the beauty! We were unable to get to the temple itself, but still spent a lot of time walking there.",
          "Among the temples we visited on a daylong tour, this one was unique. Set on the beach, it is a dramatic sight. Once we walked past all the vendors and got to the ocean, it was refreshing on a hot day to be at the beach with the pounding waves. We enjoyed walking along the shore",
          "The sunset was pretty beautiful, not much to see there except for walking along the beach and the temple. I would not have came here except that my family wanted to as I thought it was slightly overrated. Our experience was also marred by a scam at a fruit juice shop in the",
          "On a recent trip to Bali we were recommended to see Tanah Lot and we werent dissappointed, stuck out in the indian ocean is this stunning temple, built on a huge rock and only accesible at low tide. Its always very busy with lots of tourists but thats not surprising, it jaw",
          "What a beautiful experience. We went on a half day trip only to Tanah Lot Temple, really helped us enjoy the experience. I rushed and not far to travel, We had the perfect amount of time to enjoy the gardens and temple before the sunset. I would highly recommend this half day",

          "We were sold on taking the 2+ hour drive from Ubud to Tanah Lot by the level of importance this sea temple has for a cultural perspective. However, it's surrounded by tatty souvenir stands, has parking lots to serve lots of tour buses and is overrun by crowds, really taking away",

          "Once you have navigated your way through the hundreds of stalls you will eventually come to the temple. The eateries above offer a great view of the temple so you can sit and unwind. Cheapest cocktails you will find. If you are lucky enough there is a spectacular sunset on",
          "Tanah Lot is a nice temple which is connected by a narrow strip of land which in high tide looks like a separate island. During low tide, you can walk-up to the island and enjoy the scenic view all around. There is a bamboo through which holy water flows out. But beware of",
          "Enjoyed a half day trip to this temple thanks to our fabulous driver/guide - Gede. Went early on his advice as gets quite crowded. Didn\u2019t take a tour, just soaked up the coastal vibe and beautiful location. The surrounding village had good craft/clothing and eating places. We",

          "One of the 7 temples located on the Bali coast. Together they form a peculiar defensive wall against evil forces coming from the ocean. during arrival, the temple is completely separated from the shore, but at low tide, you can approach it on foot. We were in the sunset.",
          "The views here are spectacular. Single entry fee with no one harassing you for extras. There is some lovely grasses areas where we sat for lunch and enjoyed the ocean breeze. Try and get your timing right with the tides to be able to walk out to the temple it self.",
          "Tanah Lot is one of the four temples protecting Bali and is quite beautiful. You can view it, and the ocean, from a short distance but don\u2019t expect to enter it. It is very picturesque and you can sit in an outdoor cafe and listen to the waves. But it can be very crowded and",
          "You can enjoy the glory of Indian ocean, enjoy breathtaking sunset at Tanah lot. The complex is really large and pretty ancient with Balinese character throughout. There are many shops and hawkers along the way, and had to cross all of them to get to the temple. Like all other",
          "Great experience with great cultural temples and sights. All thanks to DUNGKY TOURS BALI for making this a great day to learn more about the culture. Recommend to everyone to experience the Tanah Lot Temple tours and book with DUNGKY TOURS BALI. Great operator with great",
          "it didn't feel like coming to a temple, at the front you'll find a series of art shops that sells stuffs you can find everywhere in Denpasar, a sure way to immerse yourself in Bali culture and the magnificence of this temple. the temple itself is great, the entrance gate, the",

          "We visited the temple as part of a group.First of all yes the location is impressive and you can take some nice pics as well marvel at the indian ocean crashing on the high rocks on the coast.Now for the temple.Its a huge ripoff. You pay for everything..and when you stroll down",
          "Hi there if you go to bali don't forget to see the sunset at tanah lot temple there is balinese kecak dance also",
          "Beautiful place, very well kept. Wear flip flops as you may have to walk over a bit of water to get to the actual temple. The place is very pleasant and peaceful. Sure there\u2019s some hawkers, but I just saw a couple and the best part is that this is more of a local hangout",
          "It's so commercialized, it's full of shops and hawkers and as a result you are being hassled to buy something every 5 steps. I just wanted to look at the temples and take in a peaceful atmosphere. It's nothing like this at all, there's thousands of tourists and it's more like",
          "A site by the sea, comprised of 2 average hindu temple complexes, one of them turning into island at high tide. Above the entry gates I would say nothing thrilling thete. If you have few hours free, can drop by.",
          "This temple located at a beautiful scenery. Really love the beautiful surroundings. You can take a beautiful picture at this area. The actual location of the temple is near the sea. Should not miss to visit this place if you have a chance to visit Bali. It take around 1.5",

          "The Tanah Lot Park is quite big and you need to walk for a while until you arrive at the Tanah Lot Temple itself. I suggest you visit the place during low tide as you'll be able to wade through the low waters towards the foot of the temple itself and get excellent photos. But",
          "Worth a visit especially if it is part of a tour with other places. Beautiful and unique temple. Scenery and views are nice. Should go during the early morning when the crowd is less.",
          "If your in Bali this is a must do, but beware. The Temple & surrounds are beautiful but the crowds are enourmous. Like other reviews I suggest you go early in the morning as we did this time. Small crowds, plenty of space to move around & enjoy the sights & markets.",
          "I can see why so many people would flock to Tanah Lot by night to secure that insta perfect sunset photo, but I had heard that the crowds detract from this experience. I opted to visit early afternoon and had a wonderful time. The car park was near empty, I could easily walk",
          "Beautiful historical place. Will become Speechless when you hear the history while looking at the surrounding view. Magnificent",
          "Everyone was right, its great for sunset. We arrived a bit before sunset, and at low tide. It was so fun to walk the sea floor, and then just walk around and take photos of the sunset. Pretty big complex actually, Tanah Lot on the left, and the other Bedung temple on the",
          "Visit this place during sunset. Its an amazing view with sunset as the backdrop and the waves hitting the rocks. You have opportunities of capturing good photograph. It's too crowded during that time. Most of the temple is restricted and blocked going inside after certain",
          "Best visited close to sunset, this small temple on a rock is surrounded by the ocean at high tide. Come in the late afternoon to walk around the base of the temple before the tide comes in. Then watch the sunset from one of the bars or beachfront restaurants nearby. Be aware you",
          "To be honest we weren\u2019t sure what to expect on arrival here. Had seen plenty of photos and reviews which were main,y good. However the place exceeded expectations, this is a truly dramatic and inspiring place. A magical must visit place",
          "one of the most beautiful sunsets in the island can be seen here. obviously it would be crowded. honestly everywhere is bali is crowed, so you cant escape that. pick a spot to sit and enjoy one of the most beautiful sunsets of the island. the temple does not allow non-balinese",
          "The temple itself is no big beal, but the whole area is lovely. There many little stores around where locals sell their souvenirs.",
          "Experience the amazing views mother nature offer ,lot of steps to walk ,but lovely place to visit in Bali",
          "Absolutely gorgeous. Well worth a visit. Super crowded when we went (mid morning). Goodness so many tourists! I think the photos are better on a bright day than sunset.",
          "Beautiful view! Went with 2 little children. Don't take strollers as there are steps to climb. It's got beautiful sunset view. Don't miss the kechak dance (story of Ramayana). It's booked in advance or you can take ticket at venue. Arrive early to view this performance as it",
          "The temple was inaccessible to outsiders ,as in tourists,but the whole place was simply beautiful. When we reached it was drizzling and the the entire scene was right out of a painting. Just mesmerizing!!",
          "Like most of Bali, its all commercialised. The temples have no real history or significance. Just ended up going out of boredom.",
          "Very nice and Amazing place. Next time I will go there with my family. Sunset is very nice view there",
          "First went to Tanah Lot over 35 years ago and I should have kept that memory. Back then it was just the Temple and it felt special. Now, it's geared at tourists and there are shops and markets as well as accommodation. I guess if youve never seen it before it might he OK to see",
          "This is my second visit to this temple (Been there few years back, recently is bringing my in laws travelling) , still a great place with superb scenes. Be careful while walking on the rocks as it is slippery, and if you intend to standing on top of some rocks for photo",
          "Thank you so much sarah using my service,hopefully next time you can come to bali again #canggubali#privatdriver#balitrip#baliadventure#balivillas#",
          "It is a very nice temple and the view is beautiful nice gardens and lots of shops and little restaurants we ate at the one with the purple table cloths great view and good price we had a driver from legian so to get in it costs 125000 2 ppl at 60 each and 5 for parking",
          "The view is good once you reach there. However few issues with this place - 1. You can go by online taxi but you cant be picked by online taxi when you wanna go , so if you come in 70000 IDR , you have to go back by local transport taxi in 200000 IDR or 20 SGD , they will",
          "Beautiful place! A must go place to go when you are in Bali. There are Photographer around to take your pics and print it out in a nice tanah lot frame which cost 20k rupiah. So we got 2!hehehe",
          "Definitely a must see if you are in Bali. We went there around 5 and sun set was around 6. Bit of a crowd at this time as everyone wants to get the perfect photo.",
          "One of the main spots in Bali. If you are in Bali and dont visit Tanah Lot is like you are not in Bali. The place is clean and very beautiful.",
          "A temple surrounded by a beautiful view! Recommend if you can visit there for a sunset. Tanah Lot is a must visit place if you are visiting Bali.",
          "Magical temple with beautiful view, nice balinese people, very romantic and you can feel the spiritual balinese culture",
          "Temple complex is huge. Includes shops and restaurants. The temples are located at the sea shore. Beautiful. If going to furthest temple, watch the water tide. During high tide you can not cross from furthest temple to mainland. Wander easily and admire the calmness",
          "This temple right at the sea shore is simply beautiful, the complex is huge, with many places for snaps. There are food stalls, eateries and handicraft stores in the complex. The sunset view of Tanah lot is worth waiting for followed by Fire dance.",
          "Great view of the ocean and the temple, most beautiful sunset we ever had. Just awesome, will visit again for sure.",
          "Loved the traditional blessing when tide was low. It was a beautiful relaxing place. You can walk around at your pace. Most of the hawkers were nice, just refuse politely. There were shops that may add to your visit time.",
          "The spirituality is gone from the place. The \"monks\" there only want your money and you feel like a human atm. It's sad.. The view of the ocean is great though which is why it gets a two and not just one.",
          "The temple property is huge and I am glad it is able to accommodate the tourists. There are several good spots for pictures. We took the stairs near Batu Bolong to get down to the shore for some great shots and quiet/peaceful time.",

          "We loved our visit here, although it is a bit commercialized and touristy. But if you can look past that to the beautiful views and gorgeous temple it is certainly worth the visit. We had a lovely sunset and then treated ourselves to a show of a local Balinese Cekak Fire Dance",

          "Beautiful view. Good shots for photography. Lots of tourists. Great shopping at the entrance and it was the cheapest found in all of Bali compared to kuta, seminyak n sanur. So if u see something you like here do not hesitate to buy it cos its really cheaper here",

          "This is for sure a must visit place when you are in Bali. The views are breathtaking. They don't allow you to go to the temple but you can sit in a restaurant near the temple and enjoy amazing views. Very lively place. Around 45 minutes bike ride from Kuta.",
          "You must experience a SUNSET at Tanah Lot temple, its busy- however the view is amazing. Places to eat and drink with market stalls if you wish to shop. We rode in by scooter, this was easier to leave once the sunset ended due to the many buses and cars.",

          "One of the best-known places in Bali for sure. Tanah Lot temple sits on a rock overlooking the sea and is a great place to watch the sunset. Walk to the temple in low tide and do not forget to touch the holy snake and make a wish. Mind that the sea snake is venomous, but no",
          "Beautiful during flood and tide! We managed to take pictures climbing on the rocks on the other side of the temple!",
          "How often can you a visit a temple built in the sea and walk the low tide to get there? Not often. This was a very cool experience. The only downfall, all the haggling people looking to take a picture or sell you something. This did take away from my experience a bit - more so",
          "We visited in the late morning during low tide so could access the temple up close. However, the trees that have grown obscured the view of the temple so it kinda lost its appeal. I last visited maybe 15 years ago and remembered that it was prettier then.",
          "Beautiful ancient temple overlooking a great sunset! You must not miss this place out when in Bali whether solo or with friends!",
          "Temple (pura) is located off the cliff. View is splendid and crowded during sunset. Go and enjoy the view and listen to the wave hitting the shore. It is around 1-1.5 hours of drive from Kuta depending on traffic. Worth the journey.",
          "Looks great at high tide. Choose when you go to avoid the hordes of selfie taking tourists! While looking great, I guess I wasn't too keen on all the tourist stalls-dozens of them, all selling the same stuff.",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful place that is definitely worth visiting. The sunset was great. It reminds one of the majesty of nature regardless of the human race\u2019s (in)significance. We had not originally planned to go but decided on a whim to do so when we were on a grab car. Upon arrival,",
          "The temple at Tanah Lot at sunset has been featured so much that I made it a point to see it with my own eyes. Unfortunately, I could only visit it in the morning. There were plenty of tourists mostly from China. The whole view was beautiful even without the sunset. The waves",

          "you have to traipse over slippery rocks at low tide and once across you can't enter the temple, you just get to stand on a bit of rock, then clamber back again. The best bit was walking back and up the hill to see the sunset.",
          "Visited early morning to beat the crowds, which turned out to be a good idea. By the time we left, it was very busy with big tour groups. We were also early enough to wade across to the island to be blessed with holy water by the monks. This was a lovely experience and we just",
          "A temple by the sea, but much has been eroded when i saw it 5 years back. You can walk around and enjoy the stunning views of the ocean as the sun sets. Good olace to buy souviniers and gifts at reasonabke price",
          "Others had told us not to bother. We ignored the advice. Yes, it looks lovely but not worth the visit. The tide was low on our visit so we did get to walk on the rock platform. Cross it off the list of to do\u2019s. Plenty of other beautiful temples to look at on your visit to Bali.",
          "The complex consisted of 5 temples, a market complex, and a theatre area. My favorites were the Tanah Lot and Batu Bolong Temples. Tanah Lot is situated on its own island (accessible at low tide). Batu is basically a rock outcropping with hole where sea water flows through.",

          "I've heard that many people go to this temple at sunset so we decided to go at sunrise to beat the crowd and avoid the heat. Best decision although if you are going for photography purposes (as we were) please note that the sun does not rise seaward. Besides a few other people",
          "Was driven to visit one of the temple namely tanah lot temple for a sunset watch and sight-seeing. The view was amazing",
          "This place is a shrine for the local Balinese worshipers to make offerings to their deities. Its located by the sea on a piece of rock. Rituals can be seen performing daily in this area. So this place is not only a seascape wonder, it's also a cultural foot hold. Sitting low",
          "This is the iconic place in bali, this is a holy place for the bali people and they so respect to this. Best time to visit here is in the evening, then you can see the sunset. Tourists are not allowed to go inside the temple. Only the worshippers are allowed. But everyone should",

          "Very awesome temple, one of a wonderful place in bali, a must place to visit when you are in bali. highly recommended!",
          "The view is absolutely stunning. It is one of the more popular attractions so be prepared for the crowds. Unfortunately the tide was high so we couldn't go out to the temple but it was still magnificent to see from the view points.",
          "Situated on an island of rock with a spring of fresh water emanating from under it, Tanah Lot ticks all the boxes. Beautifully scenic and with Kecek dancing after sunset it is hugely popular. Best time to visit is any time other than sunset as this is when the crowds really do",
          "Worth to visit. Like at any other tourist places Tanah Lot Temple is full of with tourists, but there is a little market like place nearby, so you can have a cheap lunch and some nice photos.",
          "Went mid day and played merry as low tide allowed us to go well into the water, the temple makes for a majestic setting in mid of sea. Must visit",
          "The pictures and introductions we saw of this place is so beautiful; but it was such a disappointed when we visited it! We wanted to spend a few hours here and wait for sunset, but we ended up leaving here soon after we arrived. It was so touristy. The sign to the temple led",
          "Wasn't too busy when we were there, which was nice. We wandered around the shops and had some lunch then walked back down. The beach was now open, as the tide had dropped, so we could wander closer to the temple. Stayed for a few hours and thoroughly enjoyed the stay.",
          "Was there for the day waves was pretty ruff so was unable to walk out anywhere. I forgot to check the forecast but we still enjoyed our time at the are. Alot of shoppes and places to grab a bite to eat once your done walking around. We set in the open field for a couple hours",
          "This is one of my favorite visiting spot in Bali. The place is very sacred, peaceful and has amazing scenic beauty. The lake beside tanalot temple is a view not to be missed. Watching the sunset beside the lake was one of my most memorable experiences there.",
          "Very interesting place, walk through all the shops which work down to the entrance steps to the sea front and the temple in the sea. Unfortunately we timed it wrong and couldn't get across as the tide was in. Also very busy when we arrived.",
          "I generally don't like doing the tourist thing but this was special. You have to expect a bit of a crowd but it was manageable. The sunset views are excellent and the new restaurant is perfect and relaxed. An great place to feel the essence of years gone by in Bali.",
          "If we were staying away from Tanah Lot, I would\u2019ve visited and then been disappointed. But we were staying in the Tanah Lot region so came by to see it and well, it was whatever. Maybe I\u2019ve seen way too many temples and sunsets that were far more beautiful and memorable but this",
          "Since the temple can't be accessed during high tide, that's the main attraction. The sunset is like any other sunset at a beach. Lotsa shopping options around. But for those staying in Kuta or Ubud leave aside Nusa Dua if you don't want to spend two hours each way on the road",
          "Stopped by Tanah Lot after a long day to watch the sunset. Car park was packed and people everywhere but we still got a table overlooking the temple to watch the sunset behind it. Was nice to visit and say I\u2019ve been there but isn\u2019t a place I will be raving about to friends.",
          "Tanah Lot Temple on seashore is a great sunset view location. Visiting here and looking to the sea makes you feel calm and fresh, and you enjoy the natural beauty. We enjoyed the sunset and the sound of waves made us feel very close to the nature. Although its a good place to",

          "We arrived around sunset and the place was beautiful in the dying light. There are two temples, the smaller to the right and the larger on the other side. Both are accessible, but you need at least an hour or two to explore them, particularly if there are crowds. It is must",
          "We visited Tanah Lot as part of a tour with a driver and guide and were due to watch the sunset at Tanah Lot which we did. It is like a small village once you get through the main gates with many stalls and food outlets. The temple itself is on a rock and at high tide has sea",
          "This Hindu temple is not open for tourists unfortunately. If the tide is low you can walk to the cliffs. Otherwise, you can only take picture from the shores. I was told that you have not been to Bali yet if you have not been to this temple! So pls come visit!",

          "This was the first visit of our two week itinerary and we were not disappointed. The grounds are beautiful and the market-style stores leading to the temple help make the visit more interesting. It was beautiful weather when we visited and not to busy, which meant that we got",

          "This is a lovely temple sitting on the shores of Lake Beratan. We were lucky to witness a ceremony while we were there. The temple complex itself is not open to public. The two temples on the water look like they are floating on the lake. This is by far the most beautiful temple",
          "Pura Ulun Danu Beratan, or Pura Bratan, is a major Hindu's water temple on Bali, Indonesia. The temple complex is located on the shores of Lake Bratan in the mountains near Bedugul. The temple is located just outside of the town of Bedugul in the highlands of Bali. It takes 90",
          "One of the best temple sites ever seen! 4 Temples by the lake and so very scenic. Would visit again when in Bali!",
          "Great temple, nice park and amazing views with the Bratan lake. If i can give you an advice, you should come to Ulun Danu in the morning to avoid clouds. We came from Ubud, but you can come from Lovina it should be less expansive but the road is more complicated (mountain",

          "Our tour started with a visit to a Balinese house in Baha village - interesting discussion on how Balinese live their daily lives - followed by a stop to view the famous rice terraces and surrounding mountains. We then travelled on to the temple site, which is located on a lake",
          "Nice but expected more. This was a dream to see but was not as I expected. Over touristy and not as pretty as I thought. Nice anyway. There are shops and restaurants near by.",
          "The nicest thing about this place : All the religion of Bali has his own place of Prayer, it's quite big, loads of green space with flowers, next to the Bratan Lake. We had the chance to have a guide who explain us the meaning of the different part of the Temple.",

          "We visit the temple today, it was very windy and crowded. We couldn't take a picture without at least 10 other people in it. Maybe a line would be better to let people in so it never gets to crowded. But if you know the history behind it, you have must seen it once",
          "This beautiful Ulun Danu Bratan temple complex is located on the shores of Lake Bratan in the mountain resort area (1200 m above sea-level) near Bedugul. It is a cool and scenic place with beautiful natural scenery of a lake with mountains in the background. Very picturesque. It",

          "This is one of the beautiful temple to visit in Bali. The scenery is awesome. It is located partly on the lake. One of the temple is on the lake and its not accessible. Overall, its a fantastic place. If its raining, you cant rent umbrellas (its cheap). Don't miss out visiting",
          "This was a late addition to our trip as it was not a part of our tour. My wife found out about it on the internet and it turned out to be quite a place to visit, maybe just better than Gitgit waterfalls. The temple is inside a park kind of a place with walking area around the",
          "There are two temple in the lake but guest can go because they only put the gate for the ceremony. Be prepare for the rainy season, you can enjoy going around the lake by using the speed boat and also enjoy the garden in the front. They really take care of the place especially",

          "I personally would recommend people to visit this temple cause it offers a small boat experience to enjoy the view of the temple, lake & hill at the same time. The best thing is the small boat is moved by cycling on pedals for couple or rowing for more people. It's also better",
          "This temple is featured on a Balinese bill because it is stunning. You meander through well kept pathways of flowers and trees to the water's edge to see the temples in the lake...yes there are LOTS of people, but if you linger you have plenty of chances to take great photos and",

          "This is THE iconic temple in Bali. It's on all the postcards and the one that everyone talks about visiting. However, it's far from where you are likely staying in south Bali, but it's worth the drive up. Definitely package it with other places like a rice terrace or nearby",

          "if the weather is good you can have some great picture postcard shots. the entry fee is a bit high though (IDR 50K for an adult). A narrow flower garden borders the place only to enhance its beauty",
          "This is a beautiful area for a temple. You won\u2019t be disappointed especially if you go on a lovely sunny day. The interplay of mountains, lake and temple is breathtaking. It is a great place to walk around and take stunning photographs. If you want to take a spin around the lake,",

          "Cool setting, very picturesque over the water. I noticed the weather is way cooler than in Seminyak where I was staying. Some little shops selling souvenirs here as well and there was also a restaurant. We went here as part of our trip to the tree top climb zip line nearby.",
          "We arrived during one of the \"Ceremony Days\" and were rewarded with seeing many locals dressed in colors representing their village/town. The Temple grounds are quite striking and the location next to the lake is a refreshing break from the heat of the day. Bring a camera,",
          "We hired a taxi to visit this place from Ubud Palace. In this full day trip we clubbed Tanah lot , Ullun danu Beratan, Taman Ayun Temple , coffee plantation and one rice terrace view lunch. Thumbs up to- Lake view,Lake breeze,ample places to click photo, ample places to sit",

          "We hired a car with a driver and went there from Bali Collection and arrived shortly before lunch. There was a prayer sessions n happening near the lake and the place was so crowded. We were not sure if we were allowed to enter the lake area as local folks were not looking too",

          "It's a really nice to visit place if you're a person to enjoy lake scenery. Can spend some money on boat rides. Pretty crowded due to the tourist. Sunny and chilly over here. Probably spend 30mins to an hour will do. Can notice some luwak coffee selling on the way to the top",
          "You can\u2019t claimed that you have been Bali if you don\u2019t take a selfie in this Temple. Very crowded, but it\u2019s okay.",
          "What a wonderful place. It was just so beautiful. We stopped off here coming back from another event and I am so glad we did. The gardens were outstanding and I just was in awe of what I was seeing. You must put it on your bucket list because it is so worth visiting.",
          "Yeah, I think I was lucky when I arrived there I watch the balinese music and pray. This place offers not only the famous temple which is the icon of Bali, but offers paddle boat or power boat trip around the bratan lake. For several times visit (December to May) I get cloudy",
          "I want to give this attraction a 5-star rating however the plethora of morons running around taking selfies with their selfie sticks made me want to hurl them into the lake (the person and the selfie stick). I have visited this attraction before the invention of the selfie",
          "Very nice place beautiful and refreshing i love it. But i visit yesterday i cant see the volcano because more clound but all beautiful",
          "Temple on the edge of the lake and the view is lovely. We were there before noon and the crowd was manageable and had no problem with taking photos of the temple. We did not linger for too long and did take a quick walk cutting through the garden,",
          "All I like about this temple is it\u2019s location. Which is on the lake. The complex is quite a big one. And it\u2019s pretty famous as lot of tourist. But they charge the fees of 50000/- idr which is on much higher side. I suggest it to visit it if you are going to Bali treetop",
          "This place I'd amazing relax on the grounds of the temple,take in the views of even hire a paddle boat or go on a power boat trip around the lake then grab a feed at the restaurant",

          "Every body from all over the world was there on the day we visited so it was more like fun than mystical. You can take a ride on a paddle boat, shop at the various stalls, enjoy a picnic or just take in the beautiful scenery and building. Still it was beautiful and well worth a",
          "Beautiful sight of Bali. It's a long way, but it's worth it. We combined it with other sight seeings nearby, and it didn't feel far. As we came back, we went tasting kopi luwak's coffee. You will probably not spend too long in the area, since it's a very busy temple, but it",
          "Beautiful water temple located a couple hours drive from Central Ubud. Very peaceful and relaxing boat ride, and also a great spot to take a nice photo of the mountains and lake! It was a nice experience to see explore outside of central Ubud :)",

          "We\u2019ve visited Danau beratan on our way to Munduk and is was just a nice stop to make some pictures. We were glad though that we didn\u2019t book this as an expensive daytrip. That would definitely not be worth the money. It feels like your in some kind of attraction, with kitsch",
          "One of the top 10 favourites of mine was a visit to the Ulun Danu Temple located on the Beratan Lake. Can be very busy during the high season but great pictures if you can avoid the crowds. There is also a nice easy walk you can do if you follow the path after visiting the",
          "I am so glad that our guide brought his here. The setting is stunning and as one previous reviewer stated, \"you could believe you were in Switzerland rather than Bali\". The setting, alongside a large, vast lake is rather breathtaking in itself. It's a busy tourist stop but",
          "The temple is fine and the lake is beautiful, but it is swarming with tourists and traffic is brutal. The area itself is great and we had a great time in the more mountainous north of Bali, but this temple was really just one of the many reasons to hed north. We also hiked",
          "The Ulun Danu Temple is way up in the mountains at 1109 metres above sea level. It is at the lake and it is much cooler up there. It is a water temple and it is a good place to take families. It is a 3 hour drive from Nusa Dua",
          "Just a place to take a picture and do picnic. There is not much you can do here. You can get into a boat but you have to pay for it. But this place has a nice weather. Come here in the early morning at 8pm because it less crowded than in the afternoun.",
          "A lovely place to visit for an hour or so. The setting is stunning and you could believe you were in Switzerland rather than Bali. The temple itself is quite small and has limited. We were lucky to see a funeral ceremony and to see this followed by the ashes being taken to the",
          "We wend here as we have rented a scooter and wanted to explore the Vulcan area. We stopped here to have a look at the Tempel. There is a lot of people here. It\u2019s not that spectacular as other Tempels",
          "The temple is so beautiful! In may it is surrounded by water. We were lucky to meet Amin Bedauh. He showed us the temple via his traditional boat. Took his time. Really worth a detour! If you can: visit it by sunrise. Don't hesitate to pm me or Amin Bedauh to book your own",
          "Very beautiful place that is closer to the mountains, the temperature is lower there, so take a jacket with you, very windy, but around such beauty, you will not regret if you visit this temple.",
          "We were there on Easter Friday. We were there for less than an hour because it was packed like sardine. This iconic temple is seen in all Bali tourist brochures. Unless you are around the neighbourhood, it is not worth the travel for just that iconic building since there is",
          "When you browse a random store you will undoubtly have seen this iconic temple on a postcard. So a must-see would you say. The real truth is that its pretty overrated. They destroyed the serenity of the temple by placing plastic frogs and other statues around it. You can even",
          "Ulun Danu Bratan Temple - it's got to be done, because it is Bali's most iconic image, plastered around the tourist info in photo-shopped technicolour. But how disappointing, when you see the crappy fibreglass brightly coloured swan-shaped pedalos sailing around them, and in the",
          "Worth checking out as long as it\u2019s on the way to or from somewhere else.. Was very crowded when I went.. It\u2019s a nice walk with really nice temples to view.. The view of the lake and the mountains around it are beautiful Have a look\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

          "The temple offered a great view of the surrounding lakes and the traditional Balinese architecture was a sight to behold. Will visit again if I have the chance",
          "Ulun Danu Temple is the most photographed in Bali and it's easy to see why. Even though the day was dark and gloomy, the temple oozed atmosphere. Very photogenic and well worth an hour or so of anyone's time. Busy with tourists but a welcome lack of touts.",
          "This is a nice temple situated on the lake. The garden is still under construction and it can be a little crowded but it's worth visiting. Entry fee 50 000 rupiah.",
          "This temple located in Bedugul area about 1.5 hrs drive from Denpasar. The entrance fee is $2 per person. It is very clean environment with beautiful lake, temple, and parks. We didn\u2019t expect to find a lake scenery with cool temperature as the location is high in the hill. There",
          "Beautiful place, different from most of the other temples we visited. Unique architecture and the view on the lake is amazing. Also less strict about putting on sarongs compared to other temples",
          "Had heard about ULAN DANU BRATAN so we went on a long day trip from Ubud. Was a total letdown as the place was teeming with tourists. Even the boat rides were closed so we just clicked a few pics and left. The road from Ubud is really scary as it is steep at number of places",
          "Most amazing temple.surrounded by beautiful lake and gardens. It is a must see , my favourite place to be. Worth the trip",
          "Such a unique and beautiful temple right on lake Beratan. Lots of surrounding garden area to see and explore. Quieter in the morning and pretty busy in the afternoon. Well worth the visit when in Bali",
          "We decided to leave out hotel early and and head to this enchanted temple for the sunrise and we were glad that we did. When you think of the places surrounded by hills and a lake to be with it . It will surely make people wonder if you are in bali or not . This place is couple",
          "I went here with my friends. The view was VERY amazing. I mesmerized with all the view in this area. It's more beautiful than what I expected. It wasn't raining but it was cloudy, just in case of raining, please always bring your umbrella. the weather in Ulun Danu Bratan Temple",
          "The view is very amazing. View, culture, nature & religion in one harmony. Luckily it was no raining when i came. Local people & foreigners have different entrance fee. The signage from main road is not really good, however, google map is working good.",
          "While you can drive up and see the temple, it was well-worth it to wake up early and see the temple while it was still quiet. The lake was placid and beautiful and it was gorgeous to see the first light reflected off this \"floating\" temple. To do this kind of trip, just ask",
          "If you are visiting the UNESCO terraces, you should travel another 45 minutes to see this beautiful temple on the lake. There is not much to do or see here, but the view of the temple on the lake is quite beautiful.",
          "What used to be one of Bali\u2019s prettiest spots has become overrun and overdeveloped. Selfie sticks are everywhere and no one seems to be bothered about observing the sarong rule anymore. It\u2019s a long drive to this place and you\u2019ve got to ask yourself if it\u2019s truly worth it. I",
          "This most photographed temple is relatively small and nondescript. It\u2019s location at the edge of the lake with a backdrop of misty mountains makes it very unique. Located in the highlands the weather is cool ,there are myriad flowers in all possible colours in the garden area.",
          "This place is worth a stop for sure, but be aware there are many people visiting. The temples are amazing, don't miss the Buddhist temple in the center.",
          "Though quite a distance from Kuta still reachable by Pak from Vira Bali Hotel in Toyota Innova to this chill area with lake scene and postcard like Temple.Entrance fees needed as well many tourists are there for Education or Sighseeing even Pilgrism...Still you can find a spot",
          "Do really think if you really nead to see this temple really yourself. It's magical on postcards, it's majestic on posters, it's melancholic on your mind, it's Coney Island on the lake when you are there. Not only overcrowded, with rental boats of all designs, not at all",
          "This place is beautiful and serene - it would be more of an experience with out the masses of tourists. I recommend going very early. It seems they have made this temple into a park as well - with boats you can rent and a playground for little ones on the side. We didn\u2019t stay",
          "It was uite early when we got there,and the air was not the best, it was rainy and chilly. But the place was very beautiful anyway. Must see.",

          "It is actually one of those places which looks better on the photos. Although still used for worship - I saw a very unhappy duck being carried off with great ceremony, followed by a group of men in impressive robes. The day we visited was cold, dark and dreary the temples",
          "We continued to our second destination by Dream Cruise to Indonesia. North Bali is first time visited by large cruise ship; we have to be transferred to the smaller feeder boats in order to reach the land. It took more than 2 hours to reach Lake Buyan and Tamblingan and we have",

          "This temple is located nearly an hour or more from Ubud in the central mountain region of Bali. The air is clean and crisp and the surrounding scenery is gorgeous. Getting down to the temple you walk through some gardens and then the temple appears on the lake. It\u2019s different",
          "Upon arriving we thought the place would be very crowded because of all the cars and busses, but because the place is so big this turned out to be okay. Very pretty temple. The area around the temple is made for tourists, with lots of funny statues, gorgeous flowers and places",
          "It\u2019s a little over an hour drive from Ubud for us. Entry ticket is $3 per person if I remember correctly. I personally love this water temple.

          "The temple looks amazing and the views are one of a kind. Although they\u2019ve renovated the temple several times, I love how they have kept the same architecture as the original without adding anything new. I also don\u2019t understand why people complain about not being able to go",
          "Before traveling to Bali, I'd seen pictures of this place and was so excited to visit on our tour. Upon arriving, the temple was completely packed with tourists, and the views looked nothing like the pictures. It was quite disappointing and hard to take photos as it was",

          "Large and peaceful area. Temple is great with good environment. There are also resort (not sure if it still opens) and garden. On this site, it's cool.",
          "Lovely temple with scenic beauty all around. A must visit when going to bali. The weather remains pretty cool over the year here.",
          "Beautiful scenery, Beautiful temple and lake view. And fresh air.  But nothing much to do. Its a perfect place if you're into photoghrapy and also will look nice for your instagram ;)",
          "I love this place. I can't recall how many times I have been here. I find it peaceful. Overlooking the lake. It was a good weather when we went there. Cloudy. I love the flowers being grown on the surroundings. A place to visit when in Bali.",
          "The temple is by far not as spectacular as shown on many pictures. The water level is probably much lower than it used to be. Hence, the main towers are not really surrounded by water. The towers are also pretty small. Not worth the long trip.",
          "It was a mistake to go there and pay so much money. 75,000 Rp to see the temple is crazy. You can see a lot of them for free everywhere across the Bali. The view is not as I expected. The lake is beautiful, it\u2019s true. But I will not suggest to pay for this attraction.",
          "Amazing place. Dont miss out. You will have pics for lifetime here",
          "Great scenery and traditional architecture. Clean and neat, just like your back garden.",
          "Nice experience!\nCoincidentally i came here when a traditional ceremony was held. It was beautiful. Don't forget to try the speedboat on the lake. The view was breathtaking.",
          "Super tourist spot. Other than the iconic view of that temple there\u2019s not a whole lot to it. \n\nAlso, apparently due to a \u201cdrought\u201d here in Bali the water levels are extremely low so there\u2019s actually grass growing around the base of the temple and shrine, not an island at the moment!",
          "Beautiful temple with mountains and lake Beratan in the background. There is a possibility of boating on the lake. Clean park with lots of statues and flowers. It\u00b4s worth seeing it.",
          "Surprised by the high ratings. After paying for parking and 75k entrance, I roamed around the grounds for about 25 minutes and left feeling ripped off. It's a nice area for sure but not nearly worth the price. A few photos is all there \u2026",
          "Must visit place in bali. The weather here is just awesome to beat the heat of Bali.\nThe Temple and garden is situated near a lake, and the view is just awesome.",
          "Really nice. This pagoda on the lake is amazing.",
          "I am a not big fan of place like that but I'm sure that some people could be interested on it",
          "Beautiful temple just next to the lake, mild temperature surrounding it, very serene.... And if you're lucky you can also see a religious ceremony happening.",
          "A must see if you\u2019re all the way up in this area. We are staying by Lovina so decided to check this temple out and it didn\u2019t disappoint. Cost was about $4(US Dollars). Beautiful scenery and had water activities for purchase. The temple was \u2026",
          "Beautiful lake and tample , but when i was there so crowded .\nThis place not worth if u want do photoshoot or something like that",
          "We came to this lake in the afternoon. Many people still enjoying the calmnes and the peaceful ambience. Eventhough so many people but the silent atmosphere were strongly felt, supported with a clody afternoon.\nClean and fresh is on our \u2026",
          "It's a dessert too the eyes, an amazing place to experience the rich culture and heritage of the Balinese people.",
          "It was so beautiful when I visited there. The best Picturesque location.\nEntry fees was very high.\nThere is no veg food option.\nNo need to wear sarong to enter in it.\nLoved the atmosphere",
          "One of the most beautiful thing I saw on Bali. Definitely worth long trip to this place. 3 different culture living in a piece on one place. Everyone should visit and enjoy the beauty of what it gave.",
          "I don't feel i am in a sacred place. So crowded. Noisy.",
          "Great temple. Spectacular view. Instagram worthy. Better to visit early morning since its gets super crowded sometimes.",
          "Nice Temple with a scenic view of a large lake with mountains in the background. Access road can get really jammed in the mornings and evenings. I saw a bridge/road being built that promises to very scenic apart from decongesting the \u2026",
          "Coming here at evening like i do is amazing, you can take good pictures with the tower that they have (fun fact: the tower in the middle is actually on Indonesian money Rp 50.000) why do i recommend to come at evening? There will be less \u2026",
          "Beautifully built temple on large grounds. Lots of very unique structures to see by the lake and flowers in the gardens. Definitely lots of good photo taking opportunities!",
          "Beautiful place with mountains, lake and clouds. Good ambience and friendly atmosphere for my family vacation.",
          "Beautiful views, it was raining when we went but still managed to take some nice pictures",
          "Very beautiful temple. But as usual, no way to enter the worship area, you have to queue to take pictures of people praying, a bit disturbing... But if just walk around the temples are just magnificent, totally worth the ride",
          "Was pretty nice, very clean, very well kept. Looks beautiful on the water. Hefty entrance fee and many people there. Enjoyed the drive there from Ubud the most to be honest. Worth popping in to see the temple. I also stopped nearby at the lower bit of the hill on the river for some bakso ayam .",
          "I expected the place to be big to have some walk along the lake. Unfortunately, it is very small, many artificial unnecessary objects, garbage in the lake. Good to make a couple of photos and that\u2019s it. Entrance fee is high for such place.",
          "Mesmerizing. If you are going from Kuta expect a drop in temperature cause it is highlands. If you have a baby do take some warm clothes. Visited : September 2019",
          "Loved this place :) totally amazing, try going further inside towards the left after entry. It's less crowded there.",
          "Best lake in bali with beautiful temple scenery",
          "Temple in the middle of the lake, a very amazing view.  The best time to go there is during the rainy season because the atmosphere is more dramatic.  Lake water is also full",

          "Never knew that there was a temple for Bhishma Pitamah. Wonderful place with beautiful architecture. The scenary surrounding the temple is lush and serene. It is used as a picnic spot by many as you have boating, photo apots and other activities here.",
          "To be honest i was not impressed because the photos i was seeing i was expecting something more extreme. But the temple area is very nice, next to the lake and the views and gardens are very nice. It worth visiting the temple but you dont need too many time, we send around 40 mins there.",
          "One of the best attraction in Ubud. There is a dedicated parking available in near by. There is an entrance fee of 50000 Indonesian rupee per person. There are some nice view points for photo shoots as well. There are some shopping places at out side which provide some Indonesian products; make sure that you can bargain. \ud83d\ude01",
          "You will never regret to visit this place! Chilling weather and beautiful temple! Worth a visit!",
          "Visited this temple on the way to Sumberkima, it's very photogenic and beautiful. On a good clear day you can see the mountain/volcano and have a boat ride in the water \ud83d\ude01",
          "Nice place for a visit. Also a good place if u are into photography",
          "Far but okay. Nice ambience nice place, pretty well maintained. Spare lots of time as traffic is unpredictable and small narrow steep road all the way",
          "Did not expect such a wonderful weather and atmosphere. The temple is exceptionally beautiful. The architecture and setting was so calm and relaxing. Speechless over the entire temple. Very beautiful setting indeed. Worth the trip. So clean and worth it! Ticket: 15k for adults.",
          "Stunning views. Bit crowded in holiday season. Too much traffic due to the holiday season.",
          "The temple itself is nice, with large garden. But there are so many tourists, like nowhere else. It is not a sacred place anymore, they built two restaurants right in the temple garden, there is a children playground and other tourist-fancy \u2026",

          "Just some temples. But the Lake makes it cool in the background. I can see why it's a popular tourist attraction.",
          "Really touristic and not much to see. The temple is not really special compared to other Balinese Tempels (for me, I think it's really special to the local people). You pay 75.000 rps and I went through the whole thing in 15 minutes. To crowded.",
          "Our driver Madu recommended we stop off here to get an appreciation for the Hindu temples on our way to another one of our stops. It was a lovely place to view, so many flowers and a stunning picturesque scene all around. Very popular with \u2026",

          "Entry was IDR50,000 per person and you get to roam the grounds. Plenty of people when we got there at 12pm but everyone gave each other space to take photos at the major landmarks. Recommend coming earlier to avoid the crowd!",
          "Much better during rainy season. I saw more local tourists here than other places in Bali. Aside from modest foodstalls in the surrounding, there should be a little more decent place that will keep international visitors to stay longer, not just see-and-go.",

          "Another picture perfect destination. The climate keeps changing here and so does the view. We were lucky that it didn't rain when we visited. Here too there is a botanical garden in the campus of the temple. The temple is situated inside the lake and is opened on special occasion. Entry to visitors is not allowed.",
          "Temple has a beautiful feel to it, built on a lake, gives a floating illusion when the lake is brimming with water.. go early morning for best feel..",
          "The temple itself is small yet neat, but the territory around it is a kitsch Disney Land. Not worth the trip in opinion. Totally lacks ambiance.",
          "It is nice temple but you need to have enough water to make the water reflection.",
          "If you went from central ubud to here using private transportation it would be quite a challenge. The road is full of upward slope and you need to be quite experienced so I advise you to use tour or chauffeur your way. But when you get there, the view is many time better than the photo. So enjoy your walk and time there.",
          "Nice temple at the edge of the lake. The entrance fee is 50K per person. The temple is sorrounded with a pretty park where you can walk around, have a drink etc. All in all its a nice place but the temple is way smaller than it looks and if \u2026",
          "Beautiful beautiful lake with a temple background. Very cooling also so its quite refreshing to be walking around the lake. Once you are done taking pictures, you can go around the various shops outside to get souvenirs. But remember to negotiate the price",

          "Nice temple to visit next to lake. The views were good and the grounds neatly kept. This (in my opinion) is a \"nice to see\" and not a \"have to see\"",

          "Beautiful temple. Will definitely visit again.",
          "Great view on a day with clear sky. A bit of a drive away from all major spots, but well worth the visit. Has a very nice garden walkway leading to the temple and lots of spots for a photo. Prepare some snacks before leaving as there arnt any good places around for a nice meal.",

          "They charge random prices to tourists.\nPaid 40k per person and received no ticket. Then I realized the official price is actually lower.\nI did not find the temple special.\nNo need to wear sarong",

          "Breathtaking. This is a huge temple complex. Allow around 2 hours to walk around the whole site and it really is a unique experience. If you\u2019re lucky, you might see a group of Balinese musicians. Most visitors are in traditional dress.",

          "We arrived to this place very early (approximately at 7am) and didn\u2019t meet any people there except us. It was so amazing to walk around, to see how the fog descents down from the mountain and to shot some atmospheric pictures.\n\nThe parking is free as of now, we payed only for entrance. The price is 75k per person.",
          "The scenery, cool breeze and photo opportunities.",
          "Beautiful place, it's cooler than rest of Bali\nBreathtaking view of the temple",
          "Good looks, infrastructure not good (restaurant was closed, because of some meeting), it was rainy and i wanted to get some hot meal, but not lucky. Also seems restaurant opened only short time during day.",
          "Perfect place with peace and beautiful nature. Scenic view from top to bottom.",
          "The temple is absolutely beautiful and in a stunning location.  However so busy with tourists that it was impossible to simply sit and enjoy. With a peaceful environment I imagine the overall experience would be better.",
          "There are occasions when words fail to describe the splendour of what you see around you.  \nBeratan Temple and its surroundings will take you to a world beyond magic. The very location of the main temple surrounded by Beratan Lake will make \u2026",

          "We were on a day tour and reached Tegalalang Rice Terrace in the morning. The staff conducted a short tour in regard to the famous Luwak Coffee where you are given an option of topping up an additional amount to try the coffee. After the tour, we can walk around the rice terrace",
          "Is the rice terrace beautiful? Yes, but it was also the most inauthentic experience of our entire Bali trip. We paid a small entrance fee (10k) but no one ever took our tickets. Probably a scam. As we worked our way into the terrace, we encountered two different locals",
          "Beautiful terraces, worth seeing. You don't pay for the entrance, just leave a donation. The swing costs 200k.",
          "Beautiful place. Great hiking and walk, sunny and full of view point, attraction like swing and nest. Love it",
          "We had an amazing walk through the Tegalalang rice fields. Despite it was really hot and humid, and the fact that you need to walk a lot of stairs we had an amazing experience and in my opinion one of the most interesting things to do in Bali. I would everyone recommend visiting",
          "The region is lush green and gorgeous but the presence of commercial swing and zipline places pretty much ruins the natural beauty and the views. We went off the beaten path and into a smaller village with a small cafe, from where we got the most gorgeous and undisturbed views.",
          "I arrived at Tegallalang Rice Terrace at 5:30h and no other tourists showed up until 7:30 pm It is an amazing place to see the sunrise",
          "Beautiful views, lovely food and serene surroundings. Highly recommend visiting this area even if you only have limited time its just beautiful :)",
          "The terraces are interesting to see and walking down through them adds to the experience. The road to the terraces is extremely busy and I found it all quite commercial. Bathrooms were the dirtiest I\u2019ve ever been in anywhere There are lots of rice terraces in Bali so you will",
          "sight too see UNESCO heritage listed abosolute greenery top helpful people great eateries along the way at throw away prices one is in a dreamworld",
          "Enjoyed seeing this site as an example of traditional farming but like everywhere else I went in Bali heavily commercialised.",
          "The views over the rice terrace are stunning. It's fairly touristic, but worth a visit! Be sure to allow for some time to visit local shops and businesses.",
          "The view of the rice terrace is no doubt beautiful, but there are so many things here that are, to me, such letdowns during my first and (definitely) last visit. First: forced donations at some spots. Some of the 'locals' would yell at you to give them some donation money when",
          "It is very nice place but unfortunately we were 30 years late. Now it is swings, birds nest s and money sucking photo opportunities every 200 meters and more is in the construction.",
          "A place worth visiting. Being in Bali and not going to the rice fields is like going to New York without seeing the Statue of Liberty.",
          "Everyone here at the rice terrace was amazing . We even met one very sweet old man whom we bought coconut juice from and the as honestly the highlight of the visit besides the beautiful view and friendly staff/villages. These two reasons alone would\u2019ve allowed me to rate this a",
          "Wow this is such a beautiful place. You can\u2019t come to Bali without visiting this rice terrace. There are some really stunning views here and great for pictures, so many beautiful green colours. It does get really busy here so if you can get here early in the day or after",
          "A visit is worthwhile, but only if you get up early... around 06:00/06:30 am it's just fantastic there. Take a hotel nearby and not in Ubud so you can enjoy the Jungle feeling better.",
          "There is actually nothing much to do here except: 1. Taking the swing - which we saw, many swings were created for tourist purpose. I dont know how much, bse we didnt try it. 2. Taking pictures - you will need lots of patience to get a nice picture. A lot of tourists walking",
          "After doing a lot of research into the best rice terrace walk I was really looking forward to visiting here. Big mistake this place is like Disneyland so fake and a total tourist attraction. Yes it\u2019s pretty but purpose built not natural at all. If you want a taste of the real",
          "Very cool and beautiful area. Really great for a tourist activity, to walk around the green terraces and take pictures. There are also cool little tourist shops along the road. They may be a little overpriced, but that's part of the tourist experience I suppose. I would",
          "no doubt why became a world heritage. be aware of your stuff in parking area. make sure nothing left behind.",
          "Scenic Fields Cute Cafe's Swings And Nests Beautiful Market Very clean and Tidy Good Bargains and Deals",
          "Great scenic view as the rice paddy was agricultered in steps. Very good place to take photos and best utilisation of area for agriculture",
          "We did a little hike in the rice terraces. It was a great hike with lots of nice views. Unfortunately it is getting very commercial with expensive swings and photo spots everywhere. It takes away a bit of the flair of the region.",
          "Had a drink and some snacks in a cafe overlooking the rice Terrance. I was impressed with the rice terrace at all. It\u2019s a small scale one. Not worth the trip there.",
          "Go early to avoid the traffic and have a good wander around, plenty of swing rides are available too.",
          "Definitely worth a look. You just pay $A1 for parking in the carpark then walk across the road and 50m along to start your decent down some steps looking out over the rice terraces. I only walked a little way down for a great view and could take my photos. I stopped at a lovely",
          "Positives: You will make beautiful pictures. You can walk around for a quite while, its relaxing. There are restaurants if you are hungry or thirsty. Negatives: Bali tickets. You pay entrance fee, then you pay for crossing the bridge, then you pay for going on another part of",
          "As the topic says.. it\u2019s a nice view but very touristic. If you come by scooter they want to charge you for parking (10.000idr) (don\u2019t let them fool you!) the actual rice terraces are free. When you walk across it you can make a donation (more you have to, but how much is up to",
          "If you are in the Ubud area and will go to 1 place it should be the rice terraces! Try to go there very early in the morning and you will see what I am talking about",
          "I last visited a year ago. And it seems that in the interim, the sheer number of establishments in the area have gone up by quite a bit. Still, it remains a good intro to the famed rice terraces of Bali.",
          "The rice Terrance is wonderful! The only recommendation I have is to go early in the morning before it gets too hot! There is limited shade at the rice terrace and therefore can get very hot!",
          "If you park up, you are forced to buy a ticket, go down steps, more tickets, further again, tickets please! You're better off going up the road to a cafe, buying a coke and taking a picture from there",
          "Too many swings and targeting Instagram bloggers. There are many other rice terraces on the island that are less of a tourist trap.",
          "This place is not that great..especially the swings that are there...rice terraces are fine the view.. What's annoying is the crazy prices for the swing which isn't worth the price being quoted. Swing can be skipped.",
          "Oasis of peace and tranquility. Simply beautiful. Only spoilt when we were charged tickets in the car park (for each person) to find out the entrance was free. Someone is making a monkey out of tourists!! Why not say you need to pay the car park!!",
          "We enjoy the view and serve us free tasting coffee, we like to many for swing, it's so fun, it's recommended to visit",
          "Steep climb up and down. Some worthy photo spots. Swing , nest spots available for a cost. Elderly people can watch from the coffee cafe the view if they don\u2019t want to trek all the way down",
          "Still stunning after having seen again after many years from first visit. Traditional methods still used due to narrow terraces.",
          "I absolutely loved visiting the rice terraces here! I thought the view was breathtaking and was just beautiful! Would definitely advise walking through and up to the other side of the terrace for the best views, but wear comfortable shoes its a fair walk. There are lots of",
          "We called in to view and walk the Tegallalang Rice Terrace whilst visiting Ubud, our driver suggested this stop off as one of the main tourist stop offs. The Tegallalang Rice Terrace looks very interesting from the Terrace entrance point, however there\u2019s no information to tell",
          "These rice terraces are close to Ubud and beautiful, but the people screaming on the swings took away from the peaceful experience for me. If you are looking for a photo opportunity this is a spot where they have a zip line, swings, and nests.",
          "This was such an AWE moment! It literally takes your breath away! Worth the whiney car ride to view this unique landscape. We had lunch at a local restaurant where we could see the rice terrace while eating Nasi Goreng! Definitely a must if you visit Ubud.",
          "Very nice views, a lot of down hill and uphill walking possible, but if thats not your cup of tea there are plenty of places to have a drink and just admire the scenery while the others climb mountains.",
          "Nothing authentic Bali about this place. Tourist trap, impossible to get away from people or even take a photo without people being in it. Don't bother.",
          "Unfotuntely this has nothing more to do with traditional rice fields. Just only concentrating on swinging and not really keeping stairs in a good condition so that the trails can be walked easily. I don\u2018t really need those signs. \ud83d\ude22",
          "If you want a climable, instagrammable experience, this is great. But if you want the amazing big brother, check Ifugao in PH",
          "Beautiful views, perfect for pictures and worth the trek up and down to see the rice fields. There is a small fee to pay and donations for the upkeep of the small bridges and walkways. But it was worth visiting. Full of tourists though and photo opportunities",
          "The ticket is much cheap 20000 idr per head . Trekking is wonderful there , though it gets a lil hot so either go early morning or in evening. Has multiple swings . The cheapest one with the 50000 idr price (it's the one on the top) . The one near enterance costs 150000 ! Yeah !",
          "For me one of most cozy and beautifull rice terace. There family lands so for crosing briges ir lands you need to give a donation. I was on the swings ir looked safe and new. There is a man who ask for donation for a foto- but i liked it!",
          "If you're not from Asia, then go and visit a rice terrace, if you ever have the chance! The Tegalalang Rice Terrace is extremely beautiful and it's delivering a relaxed feeling. My tipp is to come before 8AM, so first you might get the chance to park for free and second (MOST",
          "Unless you arrive very early in the morning, don\u2019t bother. Too many people crawling all over the limited space. Go see a REAL rice paddy instead.",

          "It was interesting to see the well manicured rice terraces and walk among them. There is a small entrance fee. There are also many shops and restaurants nearby",
          "The real Tegalalang Rice Terrace is lovely - we had a nice walk through, beautiful and picturesque and saw the local farmers tend to their crop. No entrance fee if you find the right place, 10k if you don\u2019t - and a small donation here and there to the local farmers. 100%",
          "We wanted authenticity, unfortunately it was super busy and more of an Insta photo opp then a look into traditional Bali rice terraces. People queing at the photo points, pay extra for swing etc. Interesting for a quick look but no longer authentic at all more of a tourist",
          "Lovely to see, but everyone seems to be getting on the bandwagon, from bikes on wires, to Swings to photos with rice carriers.......",
          "Interesting for photographers and the not so feint of heart brave enough to swing out over the valley.",
          "The photos do not do this place justice, I literally said \u201cwow\u201d when I walked in and saw the view before me. There is a stream of fresh spring water running through the place keeping the rice wet, and having never seen rice growing before I found the whole place fascinating,",
          "I loved it there. Thought it would be too touristy, which is, bit it is so beautiful that I really enjoyed being there, very picturesque. The entrance fee is 3\u20ac, and it\u2019s definitely worth it. You\u2019re gonna have to organize the transport since there is no public transport in Bali",
          "We found this very disappointing. The rice terraces are much smaller than they appear in pictures and the whole area has become very commercial. They've built a giant swing and numerous other picture taking platforms. We weren't aware when we first arrived that they charge to",
          "This is great for hiking, photo ops or to enjoy the Bali Swing rides. There are a lot of swing rides offered along the terraces. Beware of the 'gate keepers' who ask for donations. The first one is a local lady who frowned when I gave a donation of 5k IDR. She reached into my",
          "This place was on my list to do, so I new from the start I was going to love it here. It was everything I had read about & more. So lush and green. You can walk as much as you like or just sit back and take it all in. I chose to sit back and take it all in. There is a lot of",
          "Overall seeing the rice feilds is impressive even in photos the place looks magical. Would recommend to anyone wanting a awsome photo or workout the stairs are no joke",
          "Loved our time spent there. It was quite a sight with greenery all around. We spent an hour there just to enjoy the nature",
          "This is the second time we have been here and it's just beautiful. The amount of hard labour that goes into these rice fields is amazing. You need to wear appropriate shoes to walk around the terraces as some of the walk ways are not the best. We paid 10.000 idr each to enter",
          "Very nice and interesting experience. Really unique landscapes and calm atmosphere. Do not step on the wing area without a ticket or you\u2019ll be barked at",
          "A beautiful place, be careful of the steps but once you get down plenty of opportunity for pictures. There are Swings to go out and are safe as there are handlers there to strap you in.",
          "Went here with my wife in the morning and it is a beautiful place but we were immediately struck by how commercialized everything was, even after reading all the reviews. There are hearts and signs with the terrace as a backdrop that you can pay money to take pictures in front",
          "Uncomfortable when people ask you to pay extra at all time where ever you go. Donation with minimum expectation is not call donation. I think you should ask for entrance fee one time and it is enough.",
          "And in Bali they surely will. Yes, this is a quite beautiful place, but beauty is to be had all over Bali and the Ubud area for free. Just start walking. I would like this place better without the superfluous tourist activities and constant little entry requests which are",
          "Even as a \u201ctourist attraction \u201c it\u2019s still beautiful here ! The green of the rice terraces are everywhere , wall all around and enjoy the scenery! So many photos ops too !",
          "Go early in the morning to avoid the heat. Definitely worth walking the entire path. Lots of instagrammers.",
          "We visited this terrace in the morning. Would recommend visiting it early in the morning as it starts to get crowded as the day goes along. It is beautiful and you get to walk along the rice terraces. There are also swings or hearts where you can pay a bit of money to get a",
          "I thought we would just be taking a picture from the side of the road but we walked around and through the rice terraces with signs guiding us. Beautiful scenery and experience. My wife enjoyed a ride on one of the large swings and was soaring like bird over the rice terraces",
          "Great place to stop off & enjoy a drink at one of the many terrace cafe bars overlooking the rice terraces. Its a pleasant walk through the terraces too.",
          "Stunning views, great pictures and a nice hike! It\u2019s all here at the Tegalalang Rice Terrace! You will be able to take pictures from the most beautiful places. Swing on the most epic swings. Taste coffee and feel the nature. You just have to see this for yourself.",
          "It's just a short drive from Ubud market. It's beautiful and serene with greenery all around, jungle swing and lots of photography spots. Also don't miss the shops nearby as there are some factory outlets kind off that can give you a good offer.",
          "Tegalalang rice terraces is an absolutely beautiful spot just outside of Ubud. The rice paddies are gloriously green and you can walk right through them to the other side (where you can zip line back to the other side if you wish, or even ride a bike across a tightrope). They",
          "Went here with my partner and had great times. Great food and view. Recommend going here before harvest season do you can see the beautiful green paddy. Location is very accessible and easy to find even for first-timer.",
          "The famed rice fields of Ubud are worth a visit. The place is full of locals who are charging an entry fee, which was 10k IDR per person. The area is scenic and but it take some effort in climbing up and down the stairs. The place has several swings which are a great",
          "Was a beautiful view and worth the visit however you can only spend so much time there as it is tiresome",
          "This was a really beautiful place to see. You had to pay about 10 bucks to get in. Also, the shops on the main road there were the best shopping in Bali that I saw! They had the cheapest prices I was able to get - you do need to bargain a bit but it's definitely cheaper than",
          "This is just a tourist attraction. Towards mount Agung the rice fields are far better as scenery. We managed to stay at this place for about 60 seconds and decided to move on. The place is to commercial, no relaxed feeling by viewing the fileds.",
          "Amazing place to explore. Bring good shoes as lots of steps. Be prepared to give a 'donation' at least 5-6 times whilst walking around. Our guide actually mentioned this was completely new. Normally only 1 donation of 10,000 idr per person at the entrance required, so be",
          "Good place to hang around and learn about basics of UNESCO preserved rice cultivation technique. Ride on swing is a must do activity and trust me it's not as scary as it looks rather it's a liberating experience. Siping Balinese or luwak coffee sitting in nature's lap is my kind",

          "Although we visited rice fields inside the coffee plantation area, we still decided to come here as well. And it was a good call: walking between the terraces is a true rest for the eyes and looking at rice moving on the wind is so hypnotizing. You can easily ignore all the",
          "Increadible view to rice terraces. There is a lot bars to sit , have drink and enjoy view. Also dozens of infinite swings, that costs from 150k to 250k for 5 min of swinging. I took nice panorama views with drone, but you have to be carful, as many cables go across rice",
          "Beautiful terraces. (Plenty of others are around Bali though). Kids did swing activity for fun. Drone flying about spoilt atmosphere a little. Extended family bought the luwak coffees and tried other coffees for fun. I later did research about luwak coffee and have learnt it\u2019s",

          "Very beautiful rice terrace, but very touristic and crowded. If you have the time, I would suggest going to the Jatiluwih Rice Fields more north instead. It was a lot less crowded and bigger.",
          "Incredible to see how a small stretch of rice field has been converted into a tourist attraction which attracts thousands of tourists. So the rules are as follows - There is no specific entry for Rice fields , you can enter from anywhere . Entrance fees : 50k per person -",
          "We went as part of an all day tour. Very picturesque and the main imagine of Bali (Ubud). Enjoyed walking around and taking it all in but spoilt by all the jungle swings, sky bike and zip wires!!! Didn\u2019t stay long",

          "Went to many rice terraces on my travels in Bail. For me this one stood out by far. Well maintained in lovely setting, a swing and lots of photo spots. Spent at least 2 hours here :)",
          "Words cannot describe the beauty of this place... Wow!! We got there just after 10am and did not have to queue for anything. I started off on the extreme swing which was simply an amazing experience whereafter we took a leisurely stroll through the paddy's. It's absolutely",
          "Beautiful ,peaceful monkey village with lovely views and monkeys very friendly and relaxed Would visit again",
          "We arrive there believing that this place will surprise us and it did in the bad way. Lots and lots of people! Not only for the purpose of taking a picture but for your own comfort! It is hard to enjoy the beautiful views as constantly someone is passing by. So sad, because this",
          "This is the best experience you will have visiting places in the most central part of Ubud. Come there in the morning as early as you can for a relaxed pace of the experience",
          "Nice place and very nice views. Lots of tourists and the place is very crowded morning times. There are many steps so take care you have good shoes and you are able to climb high steps. Also remember bottle of water. There is no entrance fee but you have to give a donation",
          "Upon arrival at the rice terrace we paid our entry fee (10,000k aka $1) and went on our way. Our driver had told us to turn right and right as he was waiting at the car for us. But the locals ushered us in a different way. At first it was very confusing but then it turned out to",
          "As you arrive to the ricefields it seems beatiful and at the same time very busy/turisty. However. Do pay the entrance and take a hike in the ricefields. It is absolutely stunning.",
          "We went here around 10am on a weekday and it wasn\u2019t as crowded as expected. There is always a queue for the swings. Personally I did not think it was safe enough, but I saw plenty of people enjoying them. The restrooms are old and not so clean. You pay for all the special photo",
          "Worth the visit and if time permits, really take a walk through the whole area. Some paths are a bit rough but manageable. The scenery is amazing and depending on harvest you can actually see a few of the rice terraces in the different areas of growth.",
          "We enjoyed this place, but for me, this is not the best rice terrace at Bali. It has become the most crowded, due to INSTAGRAM (incredible what a social channel can do). The views are amazing, for sure a place to enjoy, but not the best rice terrace.",
          "Absolutely beautiful place especially if you're interested in photography. Nice places to eat. Some swings and rides for the thrill seekers. Lots of steep steps so maybe not suitable for small children and the elderly.",
          "Gorgeous view and landscape. It's amazing to see the construction of the rice fields. Make your donation at the entry, and during the walk if you pass by someone asking for more donation just reply you already did it at the entrance. Or you can always give, is really up to you",
          "We didn\u2019t spend much time there only a short walk and a swing but would have liked to spend the day exploring. It was beautiful but extremely hot",
          "Beautiful place. Great coffee shops around and plenty of photo ops to capture your visit. Few swings around to take pictures",
          "Visited with my family, two young kids. As soon as we arrived we were hounded by the businesses that operate the \u2018bali swings\u2019 on the terrace, which you can pay to go on.

          "Our driver recommended this and it was so well worth it. We left Ubud at 7.30am and got there and no one else had arrived yet which was fantastic. Beautiful views fantastic scenery stunning. Lush greenery a must in your in Ubud.",
          "We went here and stopped the car, went out,then went back in again and drove on. There\u2019s a crazy amount of tourists both watching the view and walking in the fields. Much better paddies in other places in Bali, do some research.",
          "The view was very beautiful. My husband loved the swing. You can also zipline or ride a cable bike across the terraces.",
          "Breath taking views!! Activities consisting of a swing to take in the views and also the chance to ride over the views on a trapeze whilst riding a bicycle!! Also there is a zip wire. It truly is an amazing place to visit high up in the mountains of Ubud.",

          "Beautiful scenery but with some large I love Bali signs in English and Indonesian and several vendors trying to get you to go on their swings and many tourists it loses some of its Bali charm that I am sure it once had. If you have a few hours to kill in Ubud and want a nice",
          "The rice terraces are beautiful to look at. If you\u2019re brave enough go on the swing it\u2019s a great experience and worth it!",
          "Beautiful place, not too small, not too large - there is enough space to walk around for couple of hours. Most people are roaming on one side, where you can pay to use the swings and rope slides. Sadly, you can\u2019t learn much about rice (how it\u2019s grown, when and how it\u2019s",

          "I was completely amazed by this place. We were there early in the morning when there is no crowd yet and had the place almost just for ourselves. The green fields and the palm trees are just breathtaking. Entrance fee is 10.000 Rp per person. Really worth a visit.",
          "Went to visit the rice fields close to ubud. The view was decent, however a lot of trees blocking the actual fields. Lot of tourists and swings everywhere. Every view is connected to a bar, so you almost feel obliged to buy at least a drink. We have seen better views, this was",
          "Nice view actualy this is my first time in Bali and we booking for one day tour, one of the place is Tegalalang Rice Field it was amazing place.",
          "People everywhere! If you want to take a photo without anyone in the background, go there early! Sunrise is awsome!",
          "It was definitely an exercise to hike down and hike back up again to finish the trail at the rice terrace. Finished it with a good adrenaline rush for the bali swing!",
          "Visited briefly with tour guide, very beautiful scenery and history. Would definitely recommend, also a small entrance fee which is all a donation to support with the farmers.",
          "I had no idea what to expect of this place. The swing was terrifyingly amazing and the views stunning. The rice fields are kept to the highest standard and gardens are beautiful. I loved this place a must see when in Bali.",
          "Just quoting the driver! Unfortunately it's true. Better to go for a stroll behind the Royal palace if want to see some paddies without hordes of tourists, swings, heart shaped seats etc etc",
          "The view is beautiful and so interesting how the terraces are created. This spot can get very crowded though with all the tourists.",
          "We only spent 20 mins here, had a quick look over the rice terraces, very pretty to look at, then watched people on the swing..We did not do any of the activites on offer, wanted to explore the area more",
          "Lovely the scenery absolutely amazing views and so lush and green Definition worth a visit when Coming to Bali and seeing the Balinese way of life",
          "We went to this place early Sep in the evening. It is beautiful place and one get a some 14 or 16 different types of teas to taste and also the famous luva coffee at $5 . We did not like the coffee though. There is place which has a glass floor and one can see through that which",
          "worth visiting.you have to walk a lot.you can either go down the trail or see it from top.since we are old we preferred to see it from top and took some pictures",
          "This is a very scenic place around 10 minutes drive north of Ubud. Entry is free and there are many photo opportunities. Great fun on the swings (extra charge) and the guys there will take photos of you and yours. A nice cafe on the premises again with stunning views. Very",
          "So beautiful to see this wonder of nature so tranquil and peaceful. We loved this place but didn\u2019t bother with swing as the queue was quite long. Would definitely recommend this place.",
          "Best to go in the early morning before the sun gets out and bakes you. Beautiful photo spot but ruined a bit by commercialism. There is not one entrance to the rice fields but multiple because all the local shops and cafes have an opening to the rice fields that will take you",
          "A pity that there are so many touristic features in the rice terrace, such as swings and paid selfie spots. Still it\u2019s worth going there; it\u2019s really pretty. The entrance fee is 10k per person.",
          "What was 25 years ago a beautifull rice terrace is now completely overrun by tourists. The field are to small for the amount of visitors. It is still rice terrace but it functions soly as a tourist attraction. It has become more or less a tropical garden, with restaurants and",
          "It\u2019s clear that you must go if you are in Ubud. It\u2019s a cool experience. However, it\u2019s not accessible for people who reduce mobility. The way is bad.",
          "These rice fields are world renowned - a real gem to see and remember, each rice field feeds a family for 3 harvests, none of the rice is exported. Each field around 100m2 is about \u00a325,000 (locals told us) but they are to feed their families within their compounds. Must see",
          "Quite a long way to drive from Ubud. I wished we had more time to do a bit more trekking. Scenery is beautiful and you can get a sense of the slow pace of life watching people working in the fields. Felt sorry for the cows locked up on display. They could only stand and couldn't",
          "Took a taxi there and walked back to Ubud. What a magic walk through the rice paddies. Was hot though, like over 30C. Just do it!!",
          "just enjoy the view .. When we came , it looked like the harvest time just finished there is not so much green , yet the terrace view was beautiful. Walking on the terrace is worth to try...",
          "We enjoyed our time taking in the beautiful views of the Rice Terrace. Lots of photo opportunities but pictures just do not do it any justice. Worth the trip.",
          "Must have been amazing before all the tourists wrecked the place. Lots of people on small paths, people trying to make money on something you can visit for free. Lots of swings with loud music. But.. it does look stunning if you filter out all the madness.",
          "Totally overrated and inauthentic. There are plenty of rice terraces in Bali you can explore without going to this tourist trap. The rice terrace with swings, photo spots, and big, tawdry, colourful letters like \"I LOVE BALI\". If you want to see it, go to one of the warnings",
          "It\u2019s an amazing terrace, but when we arrived there it was so full of tourists, that we couldn\u2019t enjoy the terrace the way we wanted to....",
          "Tegalalang rice terrace is really worth the visit. You should go in the morning as there are less people and in the afternoon it must be too hot. I was there in the morning in August and was afraid there would be more visitors, it was not crowded actually. The place is very",
          "Some will like this place , some will not but IMHO , there\u2019s something for anyone . The rice terraces traversing along a ravine is a working rice \ud83c\udf5a field. It was more brown than green because of the season . It is still picturesque. If you are fit , you can walk down to observe",
          "It seems just like mini Grand Canyon. The farmers in Bari has been made many rice terraces on narrow balley. We should pay our respect to their long activity.",
          "A must see when you are in Bali! Great view, but also a lot of walking... were good shoes and not slippers..",
          "We went to the top of Tegalalang Rice Terraces where they have the swings. It is a little commercialised now - I was lucky enough to see this more than 20 years ago before all the shops existed and it was literally just rice terraces. Its still incredible thougyh.",
          "This has become a tourist trap where you are expected to pay a fee to get in. My advice would be to walk along the road and have a drink in one of the bars overlooking the fields; drive on and find less busy roads to see paddy fields",
          "Our driver said it was quiet day when we visited so I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like when it\u2019s busy. We came here as part of a day trip from Ubud but I wouldn\u2019t make a special effort to visit it by itself. Yes the fields are lovely, but it gets crowded and a bit pricey for what it",
          "The terraced rice paddies are all hand made and hand cultivated due to their steepness and small sizes. Water flows evenly to each terrace as it plus monitored at each level. There are tracks to walk among the terraces but allow an hour or so to have a good look at them. There",
          "A must see, most beautiful rice fields and terraces. The people working the fields and around the village are gorgeous, just so friendly, not trying to sell you anything",
          "It's a small area of rice terraces that has become a commercial tourist spot. Lots of climbing to do and the steps are quite steep, so be prepared. You have to pay separately for every type of swing, and to click a picture in the love nest.",
          "Worth a visit lovely views and good spots for photos. Interesting to learn about how rice is grown and very fertile",
          "Great place to visit with lots to do including the swings, zip lines and loads of different photo opportunitys. Each activity costs so make sure you bring money with you",
          "Soooo amazing terraces & view! I\u2019m impressed by all shades of green. Definitely a must visit place in your list. Nice glass floor terrace for taking pictures. Also you can enjoy delicious coffee in the bar on the hill. Highly recommended place!",
          "BTW there are several viewpoints for the Tegalalang Rice Terrace, but the tour guides like to bring you to the place with the swings. September is the dry season so that the rice paddy fields looked dry and not that green. There are much larger rice terraces in other parts of",
          "The view is nothing special, you will find similar rice terraces elsewhere in Southeast Asia. It's a good place to try one of those big swings you find everywhere in Bali. Here the staff will push them really hard and it's scarier than it looks.",
          "The Best Rice terrace in Bali!!it's amazing swing, you will have a wonderful panorama! Do Not lose it!",
          "I did a half day tour around Ubud and the last place on the tour were the rice terraces, something I had been wanting to visit for some time, unfortunatley I had a badly blistered foot and had already walked hundreds of steps at the previous stops so I was only able to go down a",
          "The famed rice terraces north of Ubud on the way to Kintamani. Entry fee to get into area. Lots of cafes and shops around. Best to go earlier in the day or later to avoid crowds",
          "The first time I went to Ubud, the first thing I did was to go to this place that made me curious before leaving home.",
          "We only satt by a restaurant and watch the terraces, and that eas enough for us, because the virew is amazing. If you have the energy therse pleny of options to go down and a round in the fields, Lots of tourist",
          "This place is beautiful like many photos shown all over the internet and is easy to reach by scooter or car as it is located near main walk (no need to walk far from your parking place) Many restaurant and cafe nearby, there are some fancy photo spots available. You just have",
          "Although this place took us 2hrs travel from Nusa Dua it is totally worth it. Breath taking green scapes of rice fields everywhere. Might not be suitable for family with young children due to flights of stairs with narrow paths without balustrades and handrails. The swing was",
          "This was a beautiful place to visit. We did the swing and walked the terrace afterwards. I cannot express how amazing this Rice Terrace was. It was a little busy, we went around lunchtime. I've been told to go first thing in the morning. It really picked up after we left and was",
          "This is a must see attraction. Hubby zip lined. Various swings available We took stunning pictures there. No entrance fee only a donation and 10k IR is sufficient. You can spend an hour there",
          "It\u2019s a nice place to visit. There are (paid) swings and everything you see all over Instagram. Of course it is a bit crowded with tourists.",
          "This attraction is one of Bali's recommended spot for tourist who wants an Instagram/social media-worthy photos with nature. The view itself is amazing, you can also ride the swing (individual/couple options) or take a picture on a circular nest.",
          "Certainly recommended for first time tourusts to the area. Quite beautiful and worth a couple hours exploration. Plenty of photo opportunities to include trying out the shoulder buckets used to gather the rice. Terraces seem to be owned by more than one group/family because",
          "An expanse of rice fields with subak irrigation system (unique to Bali) worth some photos and videos after you\u2019re done ooh- and aah-ing, though the landscape gets predictable after a while. You can do your own self-paced walk and the entry fee costs next to nothing. Try to avoid",
          "Spent a couple of hours here admiring the views, watching people working in the rice fields and then walking with a guide up and down the hillsides. You need a reasonable level of fitness and some of the tracks require a degree of balance. Give it a go.",
          "We had a lovely morning exploring the rice terraces. To avoid the crowds and heat, we had a 7am driver pick up from Ubud and paid 250idr return. Beautiful setting. Would have been happy to hang out here longer soaking it all up. We were home by 8.30am.",
          "My favorite memory of Bali! Green green green! Bali\u2019s colour is Green! I could walk for hours in this place. A Unique place for the world, testing different kinds of coffee and tea and watching/admiring all this wonder of nature. Balinese people should be very proud of their",
          "Stunning. Well worth a visit but go early! We got there at 9am and it was empty. By 10:00 it was rammed! A beautiful place and the swings are great!",
          "Be sure to go to this place by yourself instead of wasting money on a tour. This also enables you to get there before the crowds storm in. As most places in Bali this place is subject to a lot of tourist. I managed to get there just before and as I left I saw loads after loads",
          "It was lovely, but felt that instead of selling experiences on swings and zip wires I would have preferred to have paid a small entry fee and heard about rice farming, how it grows, why in terraces etc.",
          "Good place to have a look of rice terraces in good condition. I was too short in time to walk through but I took a drink front of them. There are lot of tourist infrastructures to receive tourists, but they have successed to keep the place enjoyable. I advice to visit this",
          "A nice place to visit. If you are a good photographer you can get some really nice pictures here! As most attraction, visit early morning.",
          "The cascading rice fields in emerald green is a UNESCO heritage site. The scenes of rice paddies involving the subak (traditional Balinese cooperative irrigation system), which according to history, was passed down by a revered holy man named Rsi Markandeya in the eighth",
          "A very touristic place but \"must have seen\". Many small restaurants and nice view points. One of the most theatrical rice fields on Bali island.",
          "We went to Bali swing and take walk to fileds. Very nice to se all shadows of green. You can also see locals who works there. Its to many steps but worth it. Swing is 150k idr.",
          "This is a must do on your trip to Bali. A walk through the gorgeous rice terraces, spanning hundreds of meters. Reccomend you access the rice terrace through a little walkway among the restaurants (better walking route, plus it takes you to a swing at the top). You do need to",
          "beautiful green landscape, you have the feeling of endless very beautiful, we went through a period where they were all in the vegetation and they were magical",
          "We didn't experience the rice terraces in the optimal way, as it was the last stop on a day long tour and was therefore somewhat rushed. However, it's a beautiful area and a fantastic spot for some really unique photographs, though like all such places is now full of tourists",
          "This was one of the highlights of our visit to Ubud. The rice terraces are beautiful, especially in the morning light. It can get very hot mid day and there is very little shade so I recommend going early. There are a couple of swings, lots of trails to walk on and vistas for",
          "This rice terrace, you are already at the top when you approach it. There are two spots to watch the rice terraces. The first spot is the more touristy one, and there are plenty of fees. This is pretty crowded. The same rice terrace can be seen from a spot a few hundred",
          "Although the place is free to visit in reality, some scammers make money out if it and seems even legit with all those tickets and everything. The \u201cfee\u201d to enter was not very big but still I hate how Indonesia just lets the scammers go wild like that everywhere. Too many",
          "The view was beautiful . Just be ready to wait in long lines and get ready to get mobbed by street vendors. Unless you want to buy from them don\u2019t talk to them because they will not leave you alone and they will remember who you are. Besides the entrance fee you have to pay",
          "If you are looking to see the most beautiful rice fields in Bali, I recommend heading to the UNESCO designated Jatiluwih... At least someone isn\u2019t constantly trying sell you an \u201cupgrade\u201d and it\u2019s a gorgeous ridge wall.",
          "This is a beautiful rice terrace, but the area along the entrance is a tourist mess. Multiple people are out charging admission and people are crowded onto the typical instagram photo spots. There are many corny signs that you can also pay to take a photo in front of. Again,",
          "My driver recommended going early and I'm so glad I did. I was there for sunrise, so it was nice and cool and I had the run of the place to take as many pics as I wanted. If your driver says 6:30 AM and you want to sleep in. Think again. If you wait you will fight a million",
          "Definitively an amazing place which worth a visit. Hills full of rice terrace. I have never been in another rice field but the way this one has been made in years (many) and the water richness of the territory helps to make this wonderful place. It tooks a couple of ours to make",
          "A scenic rice paddles. This is one of the main reasons why Bali should be visited. Try the giant swing and just bring water (lil pricey).",
          "Bad point : A lot of tourists. You have to pay for picture or swing. Good point : So beautiful. You can go in the terraces, swing above it or take really good pictures in some spots (eggs, hearts... so instagram haha)",
          "A must when around. However I recommend going there early in the morning, because later it gets very crowded. Do not miss this place, but apart from it find other less touristic terraces that are also very beautiful and more genuine.",
          "Step cultivation of paddy, called rice terrace appears like difference floors on a hill. One can walk up the hill till right on top, or just enjoy the view. There is also a swing, which is quite an attraction. The view is spellbinding, and the overall experience was awesome.",
          "Scenery fresh green and mesmerising. It really is something else and something to cross off your bucket list. This was an amazing experience to be able to see this and learn about it all",
          "Tegalalang rice terrace is one of the attractions of beautiful nature ... equipped with various types of small shops that sell local handicrafts ... you can also see farmers while planting rice in the fields ...",
          "Tremendous farming technique in terrace terrain, Luwak coffee making is a prime attraction, should experience extreme swing and other exciting activities Highly recommend with friends and couples",
          "Thought that this would be \u2019one of those tourist stops\u2019 in our day tour around Bali but was glad it was included in the itinerary. It is just rice paddies (plus the other attractions such as the swing and bike if you don\u2019t have issues with heights) but it was such a beautiful",
          "We enjoyed our trip here, but fairly busy with tourists all trying to get the same pictures. It\u2019s very much a money making place. Lots of photo opportunities and big swings which were quite expensive. As you walk around there are men that stop you from going any further unless",
          "Rice Terrace one of the great place on Bali tegalalang,lot of tourism come to this place to see the view",
          "Tegalalang was beautiful!! Fortunately on the day that my husband and I went it wasn\u2019t super sunny or hot which I think contributed to our good experience. I\u2019d recommend getting there early before the crowds come in, we arrived around 9am and were there for about and hour and",
          "This place is a must-see. It is truly stunning but be prepared for some vigorous climbing. It will be worth it. The views of the terraced hills are spectacular and really allow you to gain a new perspective. We are so small and the surrounding nature is so vast. Bring your",
          "A great spot to view the traditional rice farming techniques with a little walk, a little shopping, good food options. Zip line and chair swing activities available. Very busy place.",
          "This was the main place I wanted to visit whilst we were over in Bali and I\u2019m so glad we made the effort to. It really is a beautiful place and seeing it in person is so much better than seeing pictures . We were staying in Kuta and decided to spend 1 day sight seeing . With us",
          "We saw the rice terraces from the street but couldn't get down since my husband is on a wheelchair and the place is not accessible for him. The view is stunning looking into this wide greenery area. Good place to visit while in Bali, don't miss it.",
          "There are so many paths to take and beautiful scenery around. They have the swings if you want to do that, and lots of places to take photos",
          "Beautiful place- Overall though so amazing to trek down into such a beautiful place. Good experience",
          "Completely amazing and like nothing I have ever seen, pictures don't even do justice as to how beautiful it is. You will keep having to make donations when crossing farmers land its about 20k to get in and then I made 3 10k donations to get to the big swing so still super cheap.",
          "A bit overrated-This can be covered in the morning itself but early morning. Drive to this place , park your vehicle and pay a small donation basically a different name for the entry price to the rice terraces and enjoy peace. Prefer going when the weather is pleasant,",
          "You absolutely have to go there to enjoy the view ! but do not be afraid of meeting a lot of people as there are a lot of tourism going there + stores + coffees places",
          "Pretty terraces, but seems more like an amusement park than nature. 50k to go inside the park and more if you wanna go on one of the swings over the terraces. I saw prettier terraces that had no people by walking elsewhere in Ubud that are more stunning. Still fine, just sadly a",
          "Please go early in the morning when are less people, so that you can enjoy this beautiful Site better....",
          "As with most places around Ubud if you can get up early and go it is well worth it. I was there around 7.30am and it meant there wasn't as many people around. As I was leaving around 8.15am there were already more people arriving. Lots of swings here if you want that Instagram",
          "Lovely large rice terrace. Lots of tourists using the swing. Gardens lovely and nice place to go to. The hagglers at the entrance trying to sell Bali postcards very annoying but ignore them",
          "We stopped past on a ebike tour. Stunning views with a nice restaurant over looking it. Worth stopping by if you want an escape out of Ubud.",
          "Watch out for the people selling their clothes in the street. They are not honest. The Rice terraces are stunning, however, busy. We found a beautiful little place where we had a cocktail and looked over and absorbed the country side.",
          "We didn't enjoy it much, in our opinion it is not really worth it unless you are passing it. Maybe even then - give it a miss. We spent $20 getting here and back from central ubud and it was a waste of money. We've seen prettier Padi fields other places in Bali.",
          "Five years ago there were no shops lining the road that runs alongside the rice terrace. Not so anymore - it is completely lined with the usual stalls and eateries. Walking along the street is completely breathtaking though, and well worth it. You can also get a great view from",
          "We visited the rice terrace at 6.30am and there were hardly any people there, maybe 6 others. The rice terrace is stunning despite it having been harvested already. But come the afternoon the place is so packed I believe, I think it would take away from the peace and",
          "I arrived just before sunrise at about 0600 and I was nearly the first one there. Not even the people asking for \"donations\" were there yet. There are lots of entrances, some more visible than others. You can spend a lot of time exploring and finding the perfect photo spots.",
          "The place is wonderful and huge. If you go all around maybe we want 2 - 3 hours to see everything. there are many swings but we didn't do. The entrance is inside of cafes and bars so careful.",
          "One of my favorites places in Bali, in June it was so green! A bit crowded close to the entrance but you can walk a bit and enjoy of the beautiful landscape. Do you like swings??? I have a sercret!!!!! You can contact me on ig artemisdian7",
          "This is where tourists are taken to see the rice terraces and it\u2019s nice but not the real thing. It\u2019s become too touristic and there are swings. Explore Eastern Bali for the real ride fields.",
          "Bali is famous with its rice terraces. Tegalalang Rice Terrace is one of the largest rice terraces in Bali. It is definitely worth visiting. You can capture nice photos there. However, you may be asked to donate money. You do not need to give any money. It is up to you.",
          "A great stop when doing a tour of Bali, the views are amazing. However the chances are that you\u2019ll end up paying for every \u201cterrace\u201d you walk on. Our guide made sure we didn\u2019t have to pay but as an unknowing tourist you might end up reaching for your wallet every time.",
          "Finally visited Tegalagang on my third trip to Bali. Entrance tickets have tiny fee and then you\u2019re free to hike for as long as your heart desires. Next time I will leave half a day to quietly take it all in and not combine with any other activities. Recommended to wear",
          "If you love nature and some organized jungle vibes then this is for you. It\u2019s serenity. Great escape from everything",
          "I loved taking a trip on a motorcycle to this area .. many water falls and the rice terraces is a must see. Not too far from Ubud city center. I loved all the water falls and temples! If you don\u2019t rent your own scooter make sure to combine the fare with the moto or car driver .",
          "There are beautiful rice terraces throughout Bali and in Ubud. If you are traveling from Ubud to Lovina these are our of your way, but may be worth the travel for the photo.",
          "The view is nice, but the restaurants are not really good and the local people are very aggressive to sell goods. Not the nicest place....",
          "I am sure I screamed more on this than when I jumped out of a plane at 16,000 feet. Go to this one rather than the other one down the road that expects you to buy a package for 350,000 when all you want is one swing. And who wants to pay to take photos. 150,000 is more",
          "This place is simply magical. We enjoyed our visit here. It was really nice climbing the terraces. The shops around here though are quite expensive. So skip the shopping and enjoy trekking the terraces.",
          "Beautiful place but getting wat too popular for tourists with more than 50 bali swings, viewpoints and therefore its hard to look for a serene spot where you can still enjoy the amazing terrace views.",
          "When we visited, we thought it was average, much worse than the rice terraces in North Western Vietnam. Didn't bother with the swings as the view was only OK.",
          "It\u2019s one of the best views you will ever seen so funny and green to see the rice fields and see that and the swing was amazing makes you feel like you\u2019re the king of the world like you can fly I loved it and I had a great time there",
          "If you enjoy a little hike with a bit of easy climbing this is a good place to go. Beautiful to see all the shades of green in the different levels of terraces. If you feel so inclined you can swing over the terraces too. It was a bit touristy for my liking though. Some of",
          "The rice terraces are beautiful!! So lovely to walk round and explore them all however be careful of where you are walking as you get stopped and told to make a donation to pass by and we ended up spending a lot more than we thought (as originally it\u2019s only really really cheap",
          "Amazing place, but as in many places in Bali, there are so many dumb tourists posing in their \u00a35 H&M dress trying to get that picture for Instagram. Have some originality at least! A little tip: Don\u2019t wait for them until they are done because it will take forever. Pass",
          "We visited these rice terraces believing they were the best in Bali, however, Jatiluwih rice terraces were much better. Don't give the people donations once into the terraces, especially if you have already paid to get in. Just a simple no thank you to the kids with postcards",
          "This was a great experience! Seeing the rice fields and being able to swing over them. Beautiful area! Be aware that they want money to get in there but it\u2019s worth it!",
          "love it ND I UNDERSTOOD unesco assignment, beautiful area where spend few hours up and down to the rice fields terrace",
          "Sorry folks, go rafting or go for a drive instead; you\u2019ll have more fun and see more rice terraces. The place is built-up with restaurants, tea houses etc., not for me at all.",
          "We scootered here from Ubud center. A nice little excursion. 10,000 to park/enter. You can definitely get some nice shots of the rice paddies even though it can be quite busy with other tourist. Lots of those really annoying swings if you feel the need to take that annoying",
          "This is one of the best tourist attractions in Ubud, but I recommend you to come when the rice turns green. here we can walk around the rice fields and enjoy the beautiful scenery and the cool air there. BUT we have to pay every time we pass the small posts that are there, and",
          "We went in July so no rice at the time. I thought it was all a bit disappointing. I wasn\u2019t ready for the tourist attraction! It was packed of people, but I noticed you could have entered the fields from Other side which would have been better I think. Would I come back, not at",
          "If you have never seen rice terrace it is worth To go ... But if you travelled already in south asia then this is clearly only a touristic attraction and you may loose your time there... The market nearby is nice though",
          "Tegalalang rice terrace is awesome, the views coming in are amazing. We ventured right down into the terrace and started to ascend up the other side until disaster struck; for some reason my girlfriend thought they looked so refreshing she accidentally fell into one... two young",
          "Was very crowded. The area was absolutely stunning and I highly recommend seeing it. We trekked down the terraces and up again and I was light headed and my heart was pumping hard by the time I hit the street but was worth. The area is a 5 but the crowd (which we were a part of",
          "We stayed one night in North Berwick to enjoy Fringe on the Shore. This was a super place to stay. Easy to find, parking was so good ( outside the house). A very warm welcome from Mandy, a beautiful spacious room with all amenities. Perfect for a very short walk into the centre",
          "Your driver will drop you off where you'll pay a nominal entry fee. The usual touristy shops are on the outer area. The rice terraces have multiple entrances, so there's different angles. Just pic one and go with it. If it's raining or has recently rained, be VERY careful",
          "Get ready to go up and down on the trekking path were those rice fields are located. Best to go either early morning or late afternoon to avoid crowd and also heat. But overall prepare to be surrounded by lush nature. PS: do not litter there ;)",
          "I came here with my family and we found it really nice. We didn't have the time to do the trekking but you can go for a walk around the rice terraces. In my opinion I prefer the Jatiluwih rice terrace, but if you have time for both or Jatiluwih is too far to go, tegalalang is",
          "Beautiful, serene peaceful place , whole family really enjoyed this trip . Well organised, beautiful country and villages. Had lunch overlooking the rice terraces. Good toilet facilities, have to remember where you are , clean and well equipped. Definitely one not to miss .",
          "They are a beautiful sight to behold. Very good for some photo opportunities but not much else to see.",
          "Worth to visiT in Ubud, beautiful scenery, fun for kids to do swing, flying bike or just sitting at the restaurant looking at the rice terrace. Wonderfull experiences",
          "Stunning view and covered by nature. Sometimes farmers ask you to click pictures of them and then ask you to pay them. But overall great experience!!!",
          "It was so amazing to see the beautiful rice terrace in person it such a cool experience one that we will never forget also got to do a bali swing there as well",
          "Stop here on our way to Kintamani. Nice scenery of rice field. And we have chance to make little walk on this rice field. Nice experience.",
          "Beautiful rice fields. I'm lucky to get there when its no peak time. I enjoyed the view with windblown on my face... good place for meditation.. so peaceful",
          "This is a beautiful place but gets quite busy. Some of the paths are quite narrow and uneven so be careful where you put your feet. You can get pictures on a swing here if you like that sort of thing. It's really big and keeps going so if you like a walk you can escape the",
          "A lovely way to see the rice terraces The views were amazing They also have the Bali swing and the birds nest for photos",
          "Nice place however it is more a theme park than a rice terrace. The swings are not authentic at all and the whole place is full of attractions. However, worth the visit",
          "The Rice terraces are beautiful and there are fantastic views to be seen and you can see the men working the rice fields. On your way through you will be asked to make donations at least 2 stalls, and the local workers may show you routes through terrace and will hold out there",
          "Overall it's cool to see. The terraces are impressive but it's turned into a commercial center where they have vendors with zip lines and swings and picture baskets. You can spend probably about 30 minutes to 1 hour tops there. I heard it's best to go early in the morning to",
          "The Tegallalang Rice Terrace is probably in the top three most Instagrammed things in Bali and after looking at only a few photos, it is easy to see why. This large expanse of interlocked rice terraces (which spans a few miles) is located 20 minutes north of Ubud and is famous",
          "Long way down. Even longer way up. Nice view at the beginning but stay there - nothing exciting after that. The photo attached is the best thing you are going to see",
          "We went to this place from Ubud, located at around 25-30mins drive from Ubud Palace. This place is mostly made for commercial purposes. The entrance is nothing but a restaurant. I found the whole place to be a bit expensive, but okay when on vacation. Can spend half a day here.",
          "Of course, this IS a real rice terrace, and if it's your first, you will definitely be impressed to see it. But if you want to learn more about growing rice by this technology, you'd better visit some other place. This is much more like an attraction and a place to make a few",
          "These rice fields are pretty but small and overcrowded. Everything around is a tourist area and you get hassled to buy souvenirs. The Jatiluwih Rice terraces are significantly better.",
          "Very toeristic, but beautiful. You can swing and do all sorts of activities, which takes away a lot of the authenticity.",
          "I spent a few lovely hours in Tegalalang 5 years ago, it has deteriorated. Everywhere you get people trying to make money out of tourists in parking, entrance tickets or photo opportunities. The place is losing its charm and beauth, if you want instagram pix go there, if you",
          "Nice place to visit a rice field but I would say that the whole thing is more for just a Pic. You don't learn sth from the rice industry or the workers, the process of harvesting rice and picking it up. So I would say say it is just OK.",
          "This rice field is indeed very interesting. To create usable paddocks in such steep terrain is amazing. The walking track is quite easy to negotiate.",
          "Tegalalang Rice Terraces are gorgeous! What a view! We trekked down through the rice terraces which I wouldn\u2019t recommend with young children. Thank goodness for our guide who helped carry our 2 year old. We also saw 2 snakes! One on the path and a cobra next to the water.",
          "The views are lovely but too many steps and it was hard going. No information on the place we got there even though we had to pay go in. Tortured by kids selling postcards.",
          "We have visited the rice terraces several times over the years and returned this time with several friends on their 1st visit to Bali. The place is still very picturesque but unfortunately has been exploited by the local people who obviously rely on it for income. It\u2019s",
          "Nice to see real rice paddies but the whole area is now surrounded by really rubbish tourist stalls selling tat. Making it hard to get a decent photo. Probably more beautiful and secluded rice paddies that only the locals know about. It was a fun afternoon out, gets you out of",
          "I was at the terraces while on a tour of the island and stopped at the terraces to go on the short hike around the terraces. Its essential to take water and sun screen on the hike as despite its shortness it is all steep up and down hill and sunburn and dehydration will set in",
          "We were really excited to visit the rice terrace, and the view did not disappoint! That being said, there wasn't a whole lot to do except walk around, and take pictures - which shouldn't take any longer than 30 minutes. There is an option to go on a swing, but we opted to go",
          "Beautiful terraces for you to explore. Lots of steps down and then up and then down and then up if you can make your way through the Instagram wannabe model fanatics and silly tourists who climb over safety barriers. One fantastic tourist challenged their behaviours by saying",
          "It was a great trip to see the terraces, take bug spray and sun block as it gets hot. Also take small money as someone wants a donation everywhere you go! The terraces are lovely but you do get sick of everyone trying to sell something, still worth the trip.",
          "This is amazing place i had visited,the people i meet was friendly and greet us with the warm.i love this place.",
          "While staying at Element by Westin we enjoyed a half-day trip up the Tegallalang Valley with a lovely lunch at the Kampung Caf\u00e9. The caf\u00e9 has a great location overlooking the valley although it has limited views of the rice terraces. To get good views you need to go a bit",
          "We went during dry season and it was really nice, but it's not paved in any way down there. You have to walk through mud etc and it smells in part. At the top by the shop area, they are all trying to sell you seats so you can take pictures for your instagram. If that's your",
          "The rice terraces make for a splendid view though a few things to be cautious about are: - There is a lot of trekking (climbing up and down the terrace hills) to be done - You need to be in a decent physical state to do it - It gets confusing once you're started as to how do",
          "Bali is famous for their rice terrace and great landscape offered here. This one is slightly smaller one and green only during season.",
          "The 1st one that we saw during our stay in Bali. Just amazing! Enjoy your walk between the rice and eat just near the rice plantation",
          "We felt this was a con. The whole area was dry as a bone with not a sight of rice growing anywhere. The paths throughout are very steep and not secure. We just wanted to see terraced green fields being farmed. We don\u2019t recommend this if you can get to the real thing.",
          "This is a scenic place and I'm sure that there are many more like it across beautiful Bali.. Can get a bit crowded but there are lots of places to get great photos from... You do get carried away by the beauty of the place while descending. It can be a bit strenuous for some",
          "This is a must visit when in Bali, and you wont regret it. The traffic in Bali is like in most asian countrys but even though well worth the trouble.",
          "Was expecting a stunning rice terrace and was let down by no rice. Just water. Will give it another chance next time.",
          "This is awesome....natural beauty... a bit muddy somewhere so walk slowly and properly... This a a tourist place, there are some many people asking for donation from you, basically that has t be shared with local farmers so this can be maintained well.",
          "My friend and I heard that the rice terraces was best during sunrise. So we got there early before any tourists (and there were a lot later on in the day). Even though the terraces were not fully grown during the month we visited, it was still an amazing sight to see. Especially",
          "The rice fields are amazing. It is incredible to see how the farmers mudpack the rows by hand. Bali is a beautiful country.",
          "Have to pick the correct timing to visit the paddy fields. I went there when it is almost empty - either the harvest was complete or they are still preparing to start planting. However, the terraces are beautiful itself. The weather was good on the day we went. We walked around",
          "Maybe it\u2019s this time of year, but it was muddier than I expected. I was hoping it\u2019d be more lush and would look better in pictures. We got here early to avoid crowds, but it quickly started to have more people.. Some areas are really narrow so it can be hard to get around",
          "Though in my visit ,the fields were harvested and it gave a deserted look, but the new crops were also looking good. If you climb the fields,then you can take the swing and the bird nest .bUt well you have to be a bit fit to climb.",
          "Definitely worth visiting... though I personally think the rice terraces around Taman Tirtangangga are more pretty.",
          "Small entry fee and a few people asking for donations on the way. Try to get there early morning or late afternoon. It\u2019s better for photos and it was really hot in the middle of the day walking down and up again.",
          "Great experience and not as crowded as I expected. Lots of places to eat as well. We didn\u2019t walk down the terraces but people were all over the area. Food was average at the restaurant we went to so take some time as there are plenty around.",
          "Don't buy the pass to enter. Just take a photo before the entrance with the paddies in the background. Walking amongst the paddies is a waste of time unless you're trying to get your steps in for the day.",
          "Wasn't impressed. Though nice view and did not take too much of my time. Being a member of farmer family, it failed to impress me.",
          "Traveled here with my girlfriend in July. It felt like a scam. The up front cost is not a lot, a couple bucks. But as you walk through the terrace, people keep asking for more money. I'd rather pay 5 bucks and just get to enjoy it than keep pulling out my wallet. One of the",
          "It\u2019s must see, but it\u2019s better when it\u2019s green and the rice is still planted. It was not the case for us so we didn\u2019t stay that long A lot of vendors around and bali swings cheaper than the most popular one too",
          "Just outside Ubud you find this magnificent rice fields. The Tegalalang Rice Fields are definitely one of the best rice fields on Bali. The way these rice fields climb up to the mountain is breathtaking. It is perfect for a quick stop as you can not really walk through the",
          "We weren\u2019t expecting the paddies to be so beautiful it was a real surprise to us both definitely worth a visit. The coffee plantation is nearby which is highly worth the visit too!",
          "My kids commented how nice it was away from all the traffic in a very special spot where the way of life is much slower. The views around the Rice Terraces are spectacular with walking and riding paths in many places. Recommend the bike tour with Bali by Pedals as a nice half",
          "It's a beautiful place but very touristic. You can see other rice fields that are less crowded if you rent a motorbike and roam around the island.",
          "I would definitely visit this atleast once in your life. We came back for a second visit and unfortunately it wasn't as green as when we visited 10 years ago. Bali is more built up in general with a lot more traffic on the road anyway than when we first visited. A sight worth",
          "This is my first time come to Ubud.. And is such an amazing views, the rice terrace is beautiful. The fields it is well worth it. I enjoyed it",
          "Must visit in Bali! Take your mosquito spray with you and beware the black & white mosquitos, which could bring you the dengui fever.",
          "These rice terraces are fantastic possibly even better than Jatiluwih. We decided not to do the walk through after reading some of the reviews instead choosing to have a coffee and something to eat in one of the cafes and take in the surroundings where we were able to see people",
          "The view from the top is worth seeing and you can walk down and through the rice fields. A lovely outlook in the small cafe and some Bali swings to try out if you are game!!",
          "I was expecting the rice terrace to be more green like in some of photos from my friend took before, but it wasn\u2019t. However, it was nice to see the big rice terrace, there are some big swing."

          "Great views and lush landscape. Only issue is there are 6+ places claiming to be the actual entrance to the terraces. Some do lead to the right place and others don't, it's quite frustrating. Overall a great time though, worth a visit.",
          "Very unique place and visiting it will definitely be worthy. We arrived late in the evening, when it was slowly getting dark and this place had no tourist whatsoever. We got to enjoy the view, make pictures with no excessive crowd on it and the coolest part was that the bali swing (there\u2019s ton of those there) were all to ourselves.",
          "Great photo op and point of interest.\nBEWARE- This is a tourist trap.  Though inexpensive, you\u2019ll be expected to pay or \u201cdonate\u201d to the locals to pose in the Instagram worthy facades.\nStill pretty great.",
          "Absolutely amazing location! The tour about coffee was brilliant and the staff speak great english. It was 200k which included 15 pushed on the super extreme swing and entrance to the rice field. Will definitely return.",
          "Breathtaking place in bali. One of the beautiful and biggest rice terrace in bali.\n\nThere is no entrance fee. During visit you can walk through coffee plantation and coffee preparation process. Free coffee samples also served to taste \u2026",
          "When I arrived I actually didn't think too much of if, but we ended up having so much fun walking up and down and taking quirky pictures!\nIt's incredibly green... Might seem a bit obvious, but it's actually a tonality I had never seen before! \nAbsolutely beautiful",
          "Very nice but so hot!! Swing cost 100 000 per person. So much fun. But when walking around we were asked several times for donations.",
          "Although it has some nice views to offer, be prepared and have some small banknotes ready as you have to pay a \"donation\" on every corner.\n\nWe made the mistake and paid 50k naively at the first checkpoint. I felt it was enough just to walk \u2026",
          "I normally stay away from advertised tourist attractions however, our friends were in town and really wanted to go.\n\nWe hired a driver near our hotel who took us out for a half-day tour which covered the rice terraces, the water temple, a \u2026",
          "Get there early and you can get some really good photos. There is no sign for it but when you see a group of restaurants at the top you'll know you have made it. Easy hike up and down and a place to sit and have a water when you get to the other side of the terrace.",
          "An amazing sight, and beautiful views from the top of the terrace. A real working rice paddy, so there are locals here who will ask you for money. If you give them some, the chances are it won't be \"enough\" and will ask you for more. Great place to take some photos, decent food places nearby too.",
          "Very interesting place to visit for sure. Although i prefer the smaller and simpler rice fields all around. Quieter = better",
          "Fun experience to see the steep rice terraces. Plenty of tourists and cheap restaurants. If you want to swing or zip line look no further. For views on authentic rice terraces you might want to arrive early or go somewhere else.",
          "A disappointing tourist trap. Not real rice fields but an amusement park. Just another \"Bali swing\" that's almost everywhere. The terraces themselves are quite picturesque but don't expect an authentic experience here. If you want to see true rice fields with farmers doing their daily activities go elsewhere.",
          "Probably the best place for a swing experience over the rice fields. You can walk into the rice fields but I think there are other areas that are similar in terms of views and connection to the nature. \nThe price for the swing was 150K and \u2026",
          "I visited quite a few rice terraces in the Ubud area and the Tegallalang Rice Terrace was definitely my favorite!  If you want to ride on the swing try and arrive as early as possible, get your swing in, and then explore the terraces!\n\nEven \u2026",
          "Beautiful views of the terraces with countless activities for tourists. It's possible to just walk around there. But due to the huge amount of people it does not feel so original anymore.",
          "This is of course one of the very top things people come to Bali for. There are TONS of great photo ops and it is absolutely beautiful. Be prepared to really hike though. It\u2019s strenuous especially in the Bali humid heat. You will need lots \u2026",
          "This is the place to go to if you want to check out rice plantation in Bali. It gets very crowded so try to go as early aa possible. A lot of walking uphill/downhill so be prepared. About $5 entry feel and if you want to take enjoy and take pictures on Bali Swing it\u2019s extra.",
          "The view to the rice terrace is really amazing. Although you have to pay for the swings,photos and mostly for the entrance aswell.\nOn the way there are lots of small places to take a coffee, tea or anything like that. \nIt\u2019s really worth to see this green color of the nature!!!",
          "Beautiful place for a walk and pictures. I recommend this place than Bali swing. Coz u pay so less compared to swing, and they have cheaper swings and photo spots at the terrace. So many cute cafes here. Loved it",
          "Interesting place to visit, best time to go early morning.  Be very careful on any board walks, as I walked on one and it gave way, no first aid close by. Went back the next day and tried again. Worth a look, just be very very careful where you stand",
          "Perfect exactly like the photos!! Thought it was free.. Didn't expect to make donations though... Our taxi driver took us to the aort were you make only two donations 25k then another 15k. However he said further down is more touristy and \u2026",
          "Beautiful. Peaceful. Good food available at the many restaurants atop the rice fields.",
          "The rice terrace is a place you must see. Very green and beautiful. There is nice trekking track. There are from these famous Bali Swing, you can go for cheap.",
          "Very cool place to visit and to take some photos. Those are small terraces and everything is done by hand. As our guide said those as done more for tourists than not but nevertheless are definitely worth visiting.",
          "The place it\u2019s woww ! I suggest to go early in the morning for a better experience , less people , lower temperature . The paths are narrow this is why you want to go in the morning , to avoid the crowed . Around 6 or 7 should be fine . \u2026",
          "The best Rice field in bali!\u270c\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udf34",
          "Really nice area! Like anywhere go early to avoid peak tourist time. They have swings all over the area which results in a lot of excited shouting. This might ruin the atmosphere for soom.",
          "Very touristy.... there are lots of other free rice terraces if you have a motor bike. Otherwise it is worth a look",
          "Amazing experience walking down, around and up the rice fields. Epic view.\nMake sure to have small change to give as a donation when passing the gates or it can be awkward when your unable to pay.\nWould recommend the cycling over zip line. \u2026",
          "Very beautiful rice terraces.  We did not send money for the entrance.  There are many swings where you can make a great photo.(100K IDR)",
          "The penultimate place to witness step rice farms. The green covered mountains are mesmerizing. Many strategic photo points are with artistic, grass covered seats, a cafe with views. Most popular are high swings that swing to make you feel \u2026",
          "Beautiful place! Cool 15m long swings . Make sure you wear proper walking shoes because there is a fair bit of distance to cover. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too overrun by tourists yet, but probably within a few years so get here soon!",
          "Beautiful rice terrace with amazing view. Really nice to walk along the terrace and to discover hidden corners and unexpected views, but prepare for a long, winding and undulating trail from one end to the other. Too many commercial set-up \u2026",
          "Picturesque location. Be there in the morning with dark dresses to get your perfect pic",
          "Lovely place. Very nice views. This place is very beautiful and you can spend hours here watching and marvelling the scenery. If you want, go to nearby restaurants and have a nice lunch overlooking these fields.",
          "Must visit place in Bali, must tried rice wine, how that do farming, take a romantic walk there. Nice places to get an experience of bali swing in cheep rate. Amazing view in morning and specially in rain.",
          "Great place to visit with family and kids. The views and very good and very relaxing. The walk is very good and soothing. \nThere are food options and place to take good pics. Parking is easy to find.",
          "Very pretty, it is worth it! \n\nYoull arrive in an area with a lot of people, very touristic, with swings and lots of hearts and all to take picture (fee expected) so it kind of kills the experience. But we made our way down and up again, \u2026",
          "Don't pay the official man who tells you you need to pay to take photos... ridiculous.  Just enter the resturants and enjoy the view.",
          "Very beautiful place. Recommend wearing shoes as the place may get very muddy during wet season. Also expect lots of hiking up and down the rice fields.",
          "Very nice walk. Trekking at midday is difficult. We were asked 10000 to enter for both of us. Pretty sure it's a local scam, but the price was so low, we didn't mind. A lot of swings, at competitive prices. Shop around instead of jumping on a first one you see. Overall nice. A lot of commercial stuff, but easily can be avoided.",
          "Just disappointing... \nLooks like they don't grow rice here anymore, going up and down the hill is a tedious job, and you'd rather make tourist do that and force them to pay for it.\nViews are way better from up the hill. Random guys at the \u2026",
          "Lovely views. Lots of tourists but if you block out it's a lovely experience. You can hike through the fields at your own pace, just need to give a small donation. Wear sunblock and a hat because the sun beats down on you. Lots of paddy hats for sale too.",
          "A walk through lush green rice fields. It's not the only rice field in that area. The coffee plantation and rice fields are closely located. Can spend time at one this place and enjoy both rather than going to both places. They do have Bali swings available here.",
          "Beautiful rice terrace, easy to reach. We reached the location in before 6:30 am. It was beautiful and very few people there. The sunrise is incredible there to click pictures. Very well maintained by locals.",
          "Nice quick food and wonderful views. Don't feed the stray cat IF he appears because there's a dog that'll also magically appear, they'll have a fight over the food and it's just a bit scary! Aside from that the light breeze is very welcome \u2026",
          "Amazing paddy fields. It's huge terrace. We have to walk a lot to see the entire place. Recommend to go early morning as a morning walk. We can have Bali swing over there at affordable cost. It will take 1.5 hrs to walk to the entire terrace. You can find restaurants in between. Those who love nature will love this place.",
          "A lovely and peaceful place to watch sunrise. Helps you enjoy the place for yourself. The entrance was shut, however we manually unlocked it. While we are there an operator passed by us and collected the fees (10,000 per person). You can \u2026",
          "These rice terraces were absolutely gorgeous with dazzling lush green carpets beautifying the place. Met some really friendly locals here as well and picked up a number of souvenirs. There were a couple of impressive swings that provided a \u2026",
          "A great place with a nice view of paddy field.  Uniquely experience with just IDR20000 entry ticket. Recommended.",
          "Very nice terraces with rice, good spot for photos. Entrance fee is 10.000 IDR. There are also swings, that you have to pay separately. Very nice views, the problem as always is that there are a lot of people. But it was worth!",
          "Spectacular rice terraces close to Ubud. We spent a couple of hours walking around and seeing the locals take care of the rice. Good place for pictures. You will see a lot of swings here: our driver told us not to pay to use these swings \u2026",
          "a recommended this place to come with family or someone or up to you !\nin here u got free tester coffee and the coffee taste good!\nfriendly staff, international tourist  came here too!\ni love the view and so many instagramable spot",
          "\ud83e\udd29 wow amazing get there early and you can wander around with no one to bother you. Stunning morning light!",
          "Yes it's extremely touristic. And yes it can be very annoying that there are a lot of fellow tourist walking around, posing and taking pictures. But that is only logical, because, my god, this is one of the most beautiful and picturesque \u2026",
          "The views of this place are spectacular and worth seeing, however the biggest frustration in visiting the Tegallalang rice terrace was that not only do you have to pay to enter the terrace, but there are people along the path collecting \u2026",
          "I don\u2019t think this was worth it. I guess we were unlucky as it must have been after harvesting so the terraces were dry, but even if they weren\u2019t, people will try to rip you off on every corner. Just to go on the swing will cost you 150k IDR. I think if you want to see rice terraces in Bali it\u2019s better to go elsewhere.",
          "Beautiful rice terraces, but there are a lot of stairs up and down and it's very humid this time of year. So be prepared to come out of it drenched in sweat. Stairs are made of a variety of materials so be aware when climbing.\n\n There are also a lot of swings if you want a picture on one.",
          "The views are beautiful, however, unfortunately, a big business is being made out of tourism here. Zip lines everywhere and you hear people screaming all the time which is very much in contrast to the beauty of nature. Would have expected more tranquility from a UNESCO site.",
          "Wonderful rice terrace. You will find the Bali swing there. There are single swings, couple swings and few other swings which are worth the money.",
          "Fall short of expectation - perhaps it was the hot weather, perhaps it was the empty muddy terrace instead of rice plants. Fine paying for entrance fee but as we hiked, we noticed the terrace was messy and it didn\u2019t look empty because of \u2026",
          "So picturesque, it is a must go to. I didn't do a swing or a hike which they offer a lot of adventures there but I just liked observing and taking pictures. Really is truly as beautiful as it looks.",
          "We arrived very early at 6.30 am and there was only few others at the spot. It was fairly hard to take photos as every spot you had to pay a farmer to get entrance to his part of the rice field and some of them we couldn\u2019t find the farmer. \u2026",
          "really great photogenic rice terrace. be forewarned that you will be asked to pay another donation midway through because the land is owned by two people. \n\nperfect place for drone flying as well.",
          "Amazing landscape to watch.  Rice field maintained on the slope of the mountain. Properly layered on the land. It becomes very scenic after the rainy season. \n\nAnother thing to enjoy here is the Bali Giant Swing. It is the most famous instagramable place among youth. Take a swing on the beautiful view of the rice fields.",
          "It's beautiful. There's some very nice restaurants and places to have a snack or a drink, as well as many shops, all with a view on the rice terrace. There are also some swings, very fun place overall",
          "This place was amazing to see. I am so happy I went there and was able to witness the landscape and take pictures in this beauty",
          "A beautiful place! You can easily spend up to 2h there walking well maintained paths. Try to reserve at least an hour going around the area. My recommendation is to arrive as early as you can get in if you want to see/photograph the \u2026",
          "The rice terraces were peaceful and interesting and the views were beautiful, but this place is a bit packed with tourists. There are cafes all along the street where you enter the rice terraces that have seating overlooking the terraces, \u2026",
          "Stunning views. Good food. Great place to stop for lunch. Cash only.",
          "You will never see anything like this until you experience it. What a truly beautiful place to see. Highly recommend going.",
          "As beautiful as this was. With lots places to eat around it. We didn\u2019t like the fact that we already paid an entry free but each bridge we crossed they wanted more money. That\u2019s a rip off.",
          "Free entrance which is very great so you make nothing wrong to go there. View is nice but do not expect to much! :)",
          "Very tourist place. If come early (7-8AM) no need pay for entrance. Or use entrance closes to parking. Swing 100k, but you can so it for 50. In morning. Beautiful. Take water and caps)",
          "Absolutely stunning! There is a reason this is a UNESCO world heritage site. The fields are lush, green and make spectacular scenery. We arrived early morning around 7:00AM to beat the tourist crowd and capture the early morning sunlight. I \u2026",
          "Nice rice terraces but so so commercialised. So many tourists, it's no longer nature. It's an attraction centre. Entrance fee and then they want donations all the time during your walk through and the last guy we encountered we had only \u2026",
          "The terrace is so nice and wonderful. If you\u2019ve never seen something like this before \u2013 you will definitely love it. \nBut I was here 3 times. And I think the place going to lose the soul because of annoying people. You need to pay for the \u2026",
          "Go early to beat the heat and the crowds. I got there around 8:50am on Tuesday and it was very good. Not so many tourists and I was able to comfortably spend 45-60min there. Lovely setting.",
          "Absolutely stunning! There is a reason this is a UNESCO world heritage site. The fields are lush, green and make spectacular scenery. We arrived early morning around 7:00AM to beat the tourist crowd and capture the early morning sunlight. I \u2026",
          "One of the affordable places to do the Bali swing & nest experience. Do not fall for the expensive package traps elsewhere. The experience here includes the dress, access to the swing (with a good 10-15 swing pushes), access to two cozy nests, plus unlimited access to the rice terraces.",
          "Beautiful, but far away",
          "One of the top tourist destinations in Bali. However, there were too many cable wires of many kinds of swing. I can\u2019t take any shot without one.",
          "Beautiful, must see gem! The history about this place is so interesting! \nBe advised, quite moderate level of fitness required to do the walk/hike in-between.",
          "So beautiful view of rice fields and swing was nice BUT EXTREMELY high prices and very crowded. You have to pay donations in everywhere but it is not actually optional so it`s a fee. Prepare to lose a lot of money. You might find something less crowded with a fair price in somewhere else in Ubud or more north.",
          "Nice view and good place for shopping, Don't forget to bargain. Bargain up to 30 ot 40 percentage what they offered initially. A very good place for lovely photographs. Not so advised for foods.",
          "The young girl at the start of the track, selling key rings, was amazing. She doubled as a tour guide, taking us around, organising the swing and taking photos. Worth every dollar, 10/10. Also, if you take a photo with the local farmer, slip him a few bucks",
          "It's Ok. Looks great in pictures and selfies. If one has never seen a rice field they would love it. But for others it's a normal mountains rice field. Some other activities are also present like Swings, Picture spots and good restaurants. Overall a Ok spot.",
          "It is an artificial village created for tourists. It does not give a real feeling of paddy fields or farmers' lifestyle. One has to walk down and climb up a lot. There is an entry fee and charges for using the swings. The shops outside has a variety of handicraft items, worth visiting, though bargaining is necessary.",
          "Awesome view and very photo friendly. Must enjoy the bali swing and coffee. The climb down is easy but while climbing back up you need to be careful and conserve energy.",
          "Refreshing view from the busy streets of Bali. Taking photos from the swing is a bit pricey though.",
          "Nice walk to the rice fields, good time at the evening and early morning, every time you step inside the rice fields you will need to pay donation and the entrance tickets is only IDR 10K.",
          "Amazing green scenery and big swings. This entrance has it\u2019s own carpark so don\u2019t mix it up with the other places which only give the view. If you have a local private driver then you\u2019ll be safe. Donation if 9k for two was recommended by \u2026",
          "A tourist spot with views of rice field in the form of terraces. Near the highway there's many restaurants along the edge of the upper side of rice fields. Entrance ticket for domestic tourists is 10K. It's just that to get to the rice \u2026",
          "Really pretty, a must visit when in bali. Tip = make sure you visit when theres lots of rain or about to harvest so everything is green and full of colour rather than dry and brown. There are also 2 nice spots for photos, the main one and a minute drive further down is a quieter one with also a beautiful view",
          "Wow, that couple swing was damn good! Park photos worth it\u2019s money. Lots of places to make good photos (entry to park included with couple swing)",
          "Great views! Amazing atmosphere. You can pay to go on a giant swing, which is about 200,000 rp or if you just want a photo on one, it's 50,000. They charged us 10,000 for entrance to the fields, though we thought it was free, but it's such \u2026",
          "Not too much to do but walk around and take in the great view. Could do with clearer signage for finding the exit as I felt I had gone off track and become lost trying to get to the end of the trail",
          "Beautiful place to visit 10k IDR entry and if you want to walk up the other side of the terraces it's a donation as it is owned by a different farmer. There is a cafe on both sides of the terraces and a little girl selling terrace postcards \u2026",
          "Aside from the picturesque view and the opportunity for a good hike, the rice fields will fall a little short of other Ubud destinations. Instead of viewing it as a must-see, visit this place as a great view for your sunrise or sunset meal. \u2026",
          "Honestly pretty, but disappointing. It\u2019s a tourist trap. You can\u2019t find a definitive entrance.. and you will pay to enter... and pay the whole way through for people asking you to give \u201cdonations.\u201d But \u201cdonations\u201d are generally voluntary, \u2026",
          "Quite unusual sight of the ladder style rice terrace. Lots of photo opportunities and high swins for some thrill. In the noon it gets very hot so better visit in the morning. Similar field can be found in the smaller islands of Bali. So if you visited Penida for example, you won\u2019t be surprised by this view.",
          "Beautiful, but very touristy. I'd rather drive thur countryside and see beautiful natural rice terraces without all the \"touristy feel\". It was very popular.",
          "Absolutely stunning place! The trek isn't difficult, but there are parts that are slippery and unstable, so wear comfortable shoes.",
          "Worth visiting if you are staying in Ubud or the surrounding area, drove scooter up here there is street parking. Access is free it\u2019s almost like a small valley of rice terraces, many locals trying to sell swing rides or pictures but they are friendly. Many restaurants and small cafes to stop and enjoy the view.",
          "Place was beautiful but wow they want money for EVERYTHING.  They want money for you to park or even stop at the side road. Then there are people asking for money when you just wana walk around the rice fields. It's crazy how greedy locals have become when they see tourist..",
          "Located in Bali Indonesia. Sideway scenery. Beautiful but not very special.",
          "Gorgeous rice terraces! Not sure if anyone is actually doing real farming here, it appears to be a tourist attraction only. There is also a zip line and a few swings you can pay to take photos on. Can be very crowded but it's still a lovely place to visit and walk around. Make sure to pay the donation when you visit.",
          "Rice terrace view is breathtaking. We Just went few steps in and flew drone to take aerial pics. Felt a bit touristy already. No entrance fee. Just donation as you like.",
          "Very beautiful - we went during the rainy season so could use the swings, but was so nice to see anyway",
          "beautiful place, really really amazing. admission is free, but getting drinks and food is quite expensive. need to pay and queue for the swings as well. we didn't do any so we when in for free and it was so worth it. but it's really crowded \u2026",
          "Oh this was such a good experience to walk through theese rice walls. A lot of tourist groups and a lot of blogers. If you want to walk calmly and take a beautiful picture please go in the early morning, because this is the very requested place. Also put a lot of sunscreen and wear a hat, because there are hotter than on the street.",
          "Such a beautiful and unique place! We went with a guide and spent about an hour meandering through the terraces. I recommend going in the morning when it\u2019s less hot and wear good walking shoes! Definitely not doable for disabled people or \u2026",
          "Fake rice terrace with fake workers, almost everyone is asking for donation, there is no rice anymore, it's just cascades for nice pictures. Sling service sellers are yelling to attract tourists. Tourists and their easy money killed the \u2026",
          "Visuell a beautiful place but it's also a big commercial place. Many relatively aggressive seller, also children!! For the view they force you to pay! Of course, the terraces is an eye catcher but is it still real?? I don't think so.",
          "Tegalalang rice terrace is a series of rice paddies located noth side of Ubud, in the centre of Bali, famous for its terraced layout. This is a traditional Balinese irrigation system known as \u2018subak\u2019.\nThe Tegalalang rice terraces offer \u2026",
          "One of the most popular rice terraces in Bali. The popularity has led to significant commercialization . There are opportunities to sit on a swing ($), take a photo in front of a heart ($), or walk beyond the halfway point ($, because the \u2026",
          "Cool everyones after money to click some photos on a swing what about those who just want to hang out peacefully.",
          "Don't miss this when you're in Ubud. I loves walking around here amongst the rice paddies. You can do swings and sit in different cute typical Bali nests.",
          "Lovely spot with swings, flying fox and nests. Drinks and ice-cream are available. Lots of people Instagramming themselves. Some tour guides took visitors down through the fields, which looked nice, but our small children wouldnt have made the walk.",
          "Great views, but nothing to do much, same views as the Bali swing, so if you've been there there's no need to visit the rice fields",
          "It\u2019s a pretty scene for sure. A tad tourist as the employees really push for donations and for you to buy things. It was a bit too much as I wanted to just enjoy the scenery.  Also the prices a bit high for the rest of ubud. But do try the luwak coffee. It\u2019s worth the experience.Nonetheless. Very pretty without a doubt.",
          "Beautiful photo opportunities here. Just know that you will have to walk up and down steep, homemade steps to get to where you want to be!",
          "Good, short work and free entry! Not the best rice fields I have seen, more of a tourist attraction with swings for pictures etc if you want to pay!",
          "Would be five stars if there weren't tourists swarming the place and people asking for all your money, but hey, that's what you get for ease of access! Still very neat",
          "Nice view, but it is better on pictures. It is a tourist trap. Everyone is selling something and we got aggresevly \u201easked\u201c for donations. After the first two donations we decided to not pay another one and tried to turn around but the \u2026",
          "Gorgeous place! Although, be aware that there are 2 spots where they as for a \"donation\" for fixing the paths around, but if you don't give anything, they do not pass you through. We paid in one spot and on the 2nd one we simply didn't have \u2026",
          "It was on an extremely hot and humid day that I visited this rice terrace. It was nice to look at from an elevated point. But I couldn't muster the energy to walk into the rice fields themselves. \n\nIt gets two stars only because there were \u2026",
          "Super touristy. Also Luwaks kept in cage at coffee place was very sad. The treatment of these animals is appalling just for coffee.\nIf you walk toward the northern end of the rice terraces it was more quiet and less of the stupid swings everywhere.",
          "Glad we visited here to learn about the Kopi luwak coffee and the Asian palm civet. Our tour guide was very informative with a great personality. He took awesome pics. And the rice swing guys were fun as well. We always like to learn about the local cultures as we travel, so this was perfect.",
          "Beautiful rice field, and lots to do here. We try the big string, it was real fun\uff01",
          "Love the unique rice fields, didnt like how they charge extra halfway through  once you've paid to enter.",
          "Will be a nice place to see the rice fields when it is time to harvest the rice. I was here in January and there were nothing but muddy plot of lands when the farmers were trying to grow the next batch of rice crops.\n\nThere are 2 \"bali swings\" here which are quite pathetic. They are quite small.",
          "Nice steep rice terraces interesting to see once but still just rice terraces . Entry for a donation.",
          "Manage your expectation before going there! We went there around 10am in the morning. The landscape was indeed so beautiful, however, we got asked several times to pay, first time was for tickets at the entrance which was normal, then every \u2026",
          "Actually it is now pure touristic attraction. You can find more generous authentic rice fields. And no need to pay entry fee;))",
          "Very beautiful place. Beautiful landscaping. Our from bali. Twice to have a to a guy will cost you around 500 indonesian 8 hours.",
          "You will need a degree of fitness to walk up and down the very uneven steps but, if you can manage it, it's worth it although, you can see terraced rice fields from many locations in Bali without the risk to your knees.  Entry is free but \u2026",
          "One of the best places that I visited in Ubud!",
          "Nice place. They invite you for free coffee and tea tasting. Friendly. Also by swings they invite you, but no stress.",
          "Wonderful scenery at the rice terrace. Toilets are clean and well maintained. The famous bali swing (start from 200k), bird nest (start from 10k), zip line (start from 300k), sky bike (start from 300k) are all available here. A must do four \u2026",
          "Fun place and interesting place as an tourist attraction. The swing is a must try if you visit there. Side note: if you afraid of heights, goodluck and have fun\ud83e\udd23",
          "We went to a lovely eatery with this beautiful view. The servers were absolutely delightful.",
          "Superb place must visit if you are in Ubud, just go for a rice terrace track with best view, awesome experience also there are lots of swings and photo points they charge for that but it is worth.",
          "Get some small bills with you so you can donate to the local farmers from how you get your rice  and if your lucky you can use their hat and basket for a pic\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0a",
          "a great rice terrace.. BUT u need to pay not only entry fee but on top if u walk further a bit. The swing is charged on top. Be prepared to pay there. But despite this the place is truly beautiful",
          "So green, so peaceful and also you can try three different swings to spice it up;) there is a long path where you can go all way around. Be ready its too hot and a bit of quite a bit of walking. Have fun guys!",
          "Too many scams people around.. Some will offer you for a picture with farming attires and then after you took the pic they will asking you for money. Especially one old lady there with pity look.. And there  are 2 check points which force \u2026",
          "It was a nice experience. It's very beautiful to see the paddy fields from top. we can do bali swing  here with affordable rates. we need to walk the whole terrace from one end to another. We become exhausted after the walk. Early morning is the best time to see & take photos.",
          "Amazing for photos and drone videos. Must see. I would also recommend visiting a cafe not far from the terrace.",
          "The place is nice and beautiful.  Have a nice view to take photos.  The location is close to the main road.  There are also plenty of places to rest and eat.",
          "You can find more beautiful rice field roaming Ubud area. There are to many people here, you can't enjoy the view, many of them scream around being on swing. I know that this place is a bit overrated but famous. Everyone knows about it, but there are better rice terraces around it that nobody knows about.",
          "Hard find \"main entrance\" (entrance is free). Not sure about Tegalalang. Maybe if u have not enough time, you can visit this place. Its better than nothing. Here you will see small cascading fields and a lot of cafe near road. But if u have \u2026",
          "Beautiful place. Awesome for pictures. You can swing in the air for 10$.  If you decide to walk through the rice plants like I did, wear something convenient for mud. There's restaurants and other terraces nearby.",
          "Nice peaceful nature to get a light treks & seeing the beautiful terraces with local people. You also can do some swings here as a nice sport as well. I some locals farmers I met on the way. Just only shouldn't have there is some guides \u2026",
          "Very Nice natural place. Friendly People all around. Check out the swings and flying bike",
          "A bit tricky track but the view was nice. Dont forget to bring enough water because the weather was quite hot at that time.",
          "Gorgeous setting. It is disappointing how every turn you take someone is selling something or asking for money. It has sadly become a heavy tourist trap - nonetheless it is a gorgeous location.",
          "Spent time chilling at the terrace sipping cool local concoction and watching other tourists.",
          "Good yet touristic rice terrace. Worth a short visit. Tea tasting was also nice.",
          "Awesome place with amazing view and fun swing. We went around mid day and it was a bit hot. But with all the greenery and trees it was manageable. The walk is a good hike and you can easily spend couple of hours. The swing is also good and \u2026",
          "Always wanted to go to this place and I didn't get disappointed!! It is really beautiful here! You will sweat from walking up and down the terraces but see it as the sporty part of the day \ud83d\ude05",
          "Tegallalang Rice Terrace may not attracted well for domestic visitor, but it worth visiting if u want to try \"BALI SWING\". Its cost u 200k/person and yes, its quite expensive tho.\n\nOr U can enjoy the view and maybe take a brunch here coz \u2026",
          "Very gorgeous views but didn\u2019t realise how built up this is and how much of a tourist attraction it is. Would recommend but make sure to bring water and go to the more fancy entrance to the rice paddies.",
          "A good walk through the rice paddy fields, getting a bit touristy though.",
          "Great walk, just be sure to wear some sunscreen if you're prone to burning. \ud83d\ude1b",
          "I mean it's great or whatever but I've seen enough rice paddies in my life so it was just an Okay experience",
          "Very amazing to see the fields, and walk/hike through them. Unfortunately very much a tourist attraction so there can be a crowd and walking behind groups is not always fun. The experience was just nice.",
          "Very scenic place, showcasing a typical indonesian sight. Best to view from top at one of the caf\u00e9s. No need to klimb down. Did not get a better impression from there. Location is very commercialized, though.",
          "Gorgeous place. Breathtaking scenary of the green fields is a must see. The swing is also different from what i expected. It was better! One of my favourite places in Bali!",
          "Nice View. Had to wait at least 30 min to get in the swing!! If you are afraid of height than try this swing and later you can try main Bali Swing!!! \ud83e\ude82",
          "Had a fun ride on the swing. 200k RP for forwards and backwards. A pretty place for photos. No entrance fees.",
          "The Iconic Tegallalang Rice Terrace. If you\u2019re looking to juice up your instagram feed then you have to go here. About an hour ride from Ubud by motorcycle.",
          "This was an awesome spot to just sit in the shade and look at the stunning scenery. It was exceptionally humid so the icy cold drinks were very welcome and the food was amazing. The portions were a good size and beautifully presented in \u2026",
          "Get here early for the best experience. Better weather and fewer people. A fun place to visit!",
          "For local worth for IDR 10k/person, don't forget to ask the ticket. You can experience the swing here, they have several swing with nice view. I chill out in one of cafe here, ordered cold young coconut @35k . Nice ambience and weather.",
          "Place turn to tourist chaos. Locals insist to pay \u201dDonation\u201d for each path walk, pic and etc. which hot obligatory. Come at 7am.",
          "Depends on the time you go. Do not buy tickets before looking over to see if there is actually a toce patty. Bought tickets as soon as we got out of car to see that there was just water on the terraces. Wasnt worth it. But ticket prices are good.",
          "The place may have been beautiful a few years ago. Unfortunately the will of the local people to earn money is stronger than their traditions. Now it is full of swings, big picture frames, which look very cheap and zip lines, which means \u2026",
          "Be careful not to be led astray by street vendors and the \u201cswing picture\u201d groups. We walked down a long flight of stairs  after being told where the \u201centrance\u201d was and found ourselves at the bottom with another couple wondering if we had \u2026",
          "The Tegallalang Rice Terrace with nice view and comfortable hiking, however, here became too commercial, and full of restaurant and swings.\nIf you only want to take photos of rice terrace, you need to pick the correct season to here, as the \u2026",
          "Very beautiful. The only problem is the rude gate keepers. They ask for compulsory donation at various points in the rice fields which ruins the experience. This is apart from the one-time fee that was already paid. \n\nOverall nice to get some drinks and watch the fields for some time.",
          "Amazing place. If you are in Bali you must visit. Nice walk in rice terrace.",
          "The rice terrace is well worth a visit. The place has some beautiful views and there's some great photo opportunities. The swings, zip lines and bikes aren't cheap so if you want to do them all you'll need to take around 2million IDR (at \u2026",
          "Nice place to look at the rice terraces, though there is no clear ticket system so prepare some small change as they have lots of points where they ask for donation for the road, bridge etc. Also for 50-200k you can get a swing ride and photos in a nice long red dress ))",
          "Wonderful view & fun swings ,,, great photo shoot location on sunny days",
          "Lovely place to recharge my soul",
          "Too touristy, it's basically a rice field where on every inch on the gate is located on difference restaurant (you'll see big signage \"tegallalang gate here\" on every inch of the road) so it really doesn't matter which door you coming in. \u2026",
          "Great spot to visit for it's amazing view! But find the correct entrance so that you won't end up spending 30min in jungle trekking to find a good view. Was asked to donate compulsory for the view with any amount.",
          "Very nice rice terraces. Come in the beginning of the day. Otherwise there are a lot of tourists.  Great walk between the fields. Also some swings over there for nice pictures.",
          "Absolutely stunning scenery! Recommendable for everyone who\u2018s fine with walking lots of stairs and not afraid of heights.\nIt\u2018s touristic for sure but therefore it\u2018s accessible to anyone through solid paths including warungs for \u2026",
          "Probably good if you are fit enough to walk all around.  We imagined we would be in the countryside but there is massive tourism everywhere and constant people wanting to sell you things, including posing in a swing to have your picture \u2026",
          "My girlfriend and I love the swing and the nest. We took good pictures together. The place is very relaxing and fresh. The people who are manning the swing are friendly and they can speak some filipino language. We had a great experience in Tegallalang.",
          "We had fun. Went first thing in the morning and it was very quiet. Head over to the less built up side and take a swing. Paid a third of the price of the other side. Didn't have to pay any entrance fee except for the 10k at the parking \u2026",
          "Really very nice rice terraces, but it was little bit crowded with lot of restaurants and tourists. But anyway if you are already nearby, for sure go there to see it.",
          "Even though there are many bad reviews because of entrance fees and extra fees if you want to get instagramable photos, this is the number one spot to visit when you are in Ubud. The entrance feels like a theme park with all the sellers are \u2026",
          "Such a beautiful and peaceful place. The farmers take 'donations' to let you walk on their fields and make photos. Swings are cool and about 50k if you negotiate ;-)",
          "The place is, though I expected more. Even at 7.40 there are few people taking pictures already. Can't even imagine how it is crowded day time",
          "One of the best rice terrace in ubud. Awesome view of the terrace from road.",
          "A must visit for people who are in Ubud for the first time. Nice 30-50 minutes roundtrip hike. \n\nFirst parking lot on the right is free of charge.\n\nBut do carry 1k, 2k, 5k or 10k notes with you so as to give it in the 2-5 donation \u2026",
          "Such an amazing experience! Would recommend for everyone, staff so friendly and  listen when you tell them not to push too hard on the swings when u are afraid! Loved it!",
          "This place is a must if you head to Bali. What a beautiful scenery with all the rice terraces and the coconut trees. You do have the option to get on a swing that it's unbelievably cool. I have to say that there is a few donations and they \u2026",
          "Real farmers have opened the terraces to the public to the small amount of 75cents. This money is then distributed to the farmers. Remember to bring small bills as there are kinds asking fir school money.",
          "I love it! I love the terraces, i love the jungle swing. It is a hair raising experience and i get to shout a lot to release tension when they swing us up. What more can i ask for. It is beyond my comfort zone. I have a fear of heights.b",
          "nice view, and better if be there in the morning with a cup of coffee or tea",
          "Nice but nothing much to do other than swing and having a cuppa.",
          "If you ever see bali in movies or postcards, it's likely that they feature this padi fields.",
          "Beautiful place. You can feel the nature in itself in this place. The trek to the top of the mountain and step rice farming is marvellous.",
          "Pretty scenery view. The only thing I dislike is there are some local tents set in the middle of the way blocking you and you have to pay a little \"donation fee\" if you want to continue your trip despite paying entrance fee already.",
          "No rise over there. Only view is fine... Pricey all. Touristic place.",
          "Spectacular scenery and good foods with good price. The staff were helpful and friendly. The place was neat but the access road quite dangerous you have to carefully drive if you want to go here with cara, 35-40 degrees slope and sandy road \u2026",
          "A simple view point made big tourist attraction. Didnot find it to be very great",
          "On our way back, we visited Rice terrace. Here we did Bali Swing and sunce it was very late we could not do anything else. Otherwise, with the entry ticket we had options to trek entire rice terrace. Small caves visit and few other small activities. Bali swing was an amazing experience. Clean washrooms available inside.",
          "The whole landscape is amazing! This rice terrace is cool to check out. Quite crowded though",
          "Very beautiful but get there early because it gets really crowded real quick",
          "I liked the terrace and the view in the early morning. We arrived at 6am here and were the only people there.\n\nThe entrance was free as no one stopped us to ask for donations (it was too early, haha)",
          "There was no rice, just empty paddies. 6 swings, they keep telling you to come and swing... very pushy. Too crowded. There are better ones!",
          "Nice rice terrace to visit in ubud. You have to climb down and walk around. Try the swings and take some pictures. The car parking is little bit far from the entrance and you have to pay 10 K for entry.",
          "Very picturesque. It's a popular destination, but the place is very big, so it's easy to get around without getting in each other's way. Stop over at the cafe for a cold drink on a hot day.",
          "Beautiful place, not too touristic, feels authentic!",
          "Tegallalang should be in your Bali trip to-do list.\n\nOne of the most popular attractions in Ubud area, Tegallalang is widely visited on a daily basis by hundreds of tourists. Here\u2019s what you can expect:\n\n- It\u2019s not a very large space, \u2026",
          "Good. But one of the waitress was really not nice.",
          "Great views, also opportunity to do the swing's from the tree's and to enjoy local drinks.",
          "Beautiful view, very suggestive. It's wonderful to walk there, too bad for all the shops that try to get money from you and make difficult to reach the fields. Expect fees for entering",
          "Great to take pictures. Too busy, but that's the blues. make sure to get there early to avoid mass tourism.",
          "Tourist trap. Do research and you can find better ones that arnt full of scammers and people taking selfies.",
          "Beautiful place- heartbreaking to see all the trash everywhere- could be much cleaner. Weird to have to pay to take a photo in certain spots.  Overall though so amazing to trek down into such a beautiful place. Grateful I had the experience.",
          "Nice location for photos. You may try a small trekk through Rice gardens. You may find people offering swings and some picture spots at few locations.",
          "Beautiful spot, but filled with tourists! Entire experience felt like a big tourist trap. Probably best to go really early in the morning",
          "Beautiful place. Was able to take a cooking class that allowed us to take and cook from the land. Awesome experience!",
          "Stunning views!!! Come very early to experience it without other tourists. Wouldn't recommend taking small kids ( <7 y.o)",
          "It's 20 mint drive from ubud beautiful views best time morning and evening day time have to hot",
          "I wanted to love this place, but just like everything else in Bali, it's a mediocre tourist trap with way too much foot traffic to feel authentic in anyway. Bali felt like a run down under funded SE Asian theme park with bad customer \u2026",
          "Nice place for dron! But everywhere want local guys payment. For everything.",
          "The place looks amazing, but can't really relax and enjoy it. You pay 10 000 rupiah at the entrance. Along the route there are locals which claim \"donations\". You have to be determined not to give them and they will let you pass. But this ruins the whole experience a bit...",
          "Really enjoyed the big swing. Interesting to learn about the rice and history of the rice terrace and how the community works together to look after the terrace",
          "Beautiful views of the rice terraced fields, plenty of places to stop and have a refreshing drink after being in the sun getting here. Plenty of Coffee plantations also around the area and the local business serve fresh coffees or teas. \u2026",
          "Great view and great atmosphere. Watch out for the tourist traps where they ask high prices for things you can find for much cheaper elsewhere.",
          "Beautiful place where you can have a very very nice photos. Personally I didn't take the swing or photo package as It is not interesting for me !! The entrance coast 20 000 IDR. So not expensive at all  for the European !\nYou can pay for the sewing if interested after the entrance and it is cheaper that the package it self !",
          "Enjoyable experience. Beautifully, scenic rice paddies. Lots of tourists trekking around to get their perfect social post photos (but so were we), so no complaints here. Staff were friendly enough. Felt a bit overcrowded for the narrow paths, so be warned!",
          "Good place for relaxing, hangout and selfies.. maybe wedding photos",
          "Beautiful but people go around and ask for \"donations\". I would have gladly paid at one place but if you walk the wrong path you pay four times.",
          "Nice view. But full of cafes and ppl trying to sell you stuff. Not much of a nature left",
          "Entry is donation based. \n\nSwings were overpriced at 200k for 30s. \n\nEach rice field is owned separately, so you will need to donate each time you go through. \n\nScenery was decent, but just take from the entry point and you pretty much get everything you need.",
          "This is the place where everyone goes for a perfect getaway and actually have nice photographs about the nature! Haha. The rice terrace was soooo beautiful. You can see it's really neat and local people are treating the place very well. \u2026"

        "wiki": "Ubud is a town on the Indonesian island of Bali in Ubud District, located amongst rice paddies and steep ravines in the central foothills of the Gianyar regency. Promoted as an arts and culture centre, it has developed a large tourism industry.Ubud's population of about 112,490 people is dwarfed by the more than 3 million foreign tourists who visit every year. The area surrounding the town is made up of small farms, rice paddies, agroforestry plantations, and tourist accommodations. As of 2018, more tourists visited Ubud than Denpasar in southern Bali.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nEighth-century legend tells of a Javanese priest, Rsi Markendya, who meditated at the confluence of two rivers (an auspicious site for Hindus) at the Ubud locality of Campuhan. Here he founded the Gunung Lebah Temple on the valley floor, the site of which remains a pilgrim destination.The town was originally important as a source of medicinal herbs and plants; Ubud gets its name from the Balinese word ubad (medicine).In the late nineteenth century, Ubud became the seat of feudal lords who owed their allegiance to the king of Gianyar, at one time the most powerful of Bali's southern states. The lords were members of the Balinese Kshatriya caste of Suk, and were significant supporters of the village's increasingly renowned arts scene.Tourism on the island developed after the arrival of Walter Spies, an ethnic German born in Russia who taught painting and music, and dabbled in dance. Spies and foreign painters Willem Hofker and Rudolf Bonnet entertained celebrities including Charlie Chaplin, No\u00ebl Coward, Barbara Hutton, H.G. Wells and Vicki Baum. They brought in some of the greatest artists from all over Bali to teach and train the Balinese in arts, helping Ubud become the cultural centre of Bali.\nAnother foreign artist Han Snel was a dutch soldier who discovered Ubud after his military service building a studio with his new wife Siti, his painting captured the imagination of both foreigners and Balinese alike with his invigorating synthesis of both cultures.Antonio Blanco a Spanish/American artist lived in Ubud from 1952 till his death in 1999.A new burst of creative energy came in the 1960s after the arrival of Dutch painter Arie Smit (b. 1916) and the development of the Young Artists Movement.\nThe Bali tourist boom since the late 1960s has seen much development in the town; however, it remains a centre of artistic pursuit.In 2002, terrorist bombings caused a decline in tourism throughout Bali including Ubud. In response to this a writer's festival was created, Ubud Writers and Readers Festival to help revive tourism, the island's main economic lifeline.\n\n\n== Streets ==\nThe main street is Jalan Raya Ubud (Jalan Raya means main road), which runs east\u2013west through the center of town. Two long roads, Jalan Monkey Forest and Jalan Hanoman, extend south from Jalan Raya Ubud.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\nPuri Saren Agung is a large palace located at the intersection of Monkey Forest and Raya Ubud roads. The residence of Tjokorda Gede Agung Sukawati (1910\u20131978), the last ruling monarch of Ubud, it is still owned by the royal family. Dance performances and ceremonies are held in its courtyard. The palace was also one of Ubud's first hotels, opening its doors back in the 1930s.\nA number of Hindu temples exist, such as Pura Desa Ubud, which is the main temple, Pura Taman Saraswati, and Pura Dalem Agung Padangtegal, the temple of death. The Gunung Kawi temple is the site of the royal tombs. Goa Gajah, also known as the Elephant Cave, is located in a steep valley just outside Ubud near the town of Bedulu.\nThe Moon of Pejeng, in nearby Pejeng, is the largest single-cast bronze kettle drum in the world, dating from circa 300BC. It is a popular destination for tourists interested in local culture.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nLike other towns popular with tourists in Bali, it is not permitted to order a metered taxi or ride-sharing service for pickup within Ubud. Instead, a taxi and price must be negotiated with a member of the local taxi cooperative. This protectionist system ensures the driver is from the local area, and also keeps the fares inflated to up to 10 times the rates available elsewhere.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe economy of Ubud is highly reliant on tourism which focuses on shopping, resorts, museums, yoga, and zoos. There is a strong focus on sustainable economy in regard to the retail industry in Ubud, with many Bali-grown brands favoring materials and ingredients that would not cause much waste to the environment. From home and living amenities to tropical clothing brands, Ubud has quite a unique array of retail selections that have proven attractive to tourists from around the world.   \nOne of the initiatives that have boosted Ubud as another popular tourist destination in recent years is Ubud Food Festival (UFF). Happening in less than a week in every April, this festival brings fellow restaurateurs and restaurants in Ubud together to create either special menus or particular promotions that may not be available in other months.   \nIn contrast to the tourist area in southern Bali, the Ubud area is less densely populated by locals. However, tourists far outnumber locals, with the Gianyar regency seeing 3,842,663 tourist arrivals in 2017 - 1.3 million alone visiting Ubud's Monkey Forest.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe town and area has a number of art museums, such as the Blanco Renaissance Museum, the Puri Lukisan Museum, Neka Art Museum, and the Agung Rai Museum of Art. The Museum Rudana in Peliatan is nearby. Galleries promoting local and overseas crafts are abound, too, in Ubud. Some often hold exhibitions focused on stimulating a dialogue between both local and international artists, and less about selling artworks. One of the primary examples is BIASA ArtSpace, founded by art enthusiast and fashion designer Susanna Perini.\nThe Tek Tok is a traditional Balinese dance that is accompanied by musical sound of mouth 'Tek Tok' altogether with various combinations of body movement and other sounds. \nThe story Draupadi Parwa told in the Tek Tok Dance tells a moral message, when a woman who embodies the values of patience, sacrifice, compassion, devotion, and holy sincerity is disrespected, then disasters and calamities will befall a kingdom or state. This story also conveys the message that truth, virtue, devotion and genuine compassion will always be protected by God. The Tek Tok dance performance is held regularly at the Bali Culture Center (BCC) in Ubud four times a week. Ubud Writers and Readers Festival (UWRF) is held every year, which is participated by writers and readers from all over the world.\nMany Balinese dances are performed around Ubud including the Legong by the Peliatan Dance Group, the first troupe to travel abroad.\n\n\n== Nature ==\nThe Mandala Suci Wenara Wana is known to westerners as the Ubud Monkey Forest. The grounds contain an active temple and are located near the southern end of Monkey Forest Street. This protected area houses the Pura Dalem Agung Padangtegal, and as of June 2017, approximately 750 crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis) monkeys live there.The Campuhan ridge walk is a hill in nearby Campuhan, from where one can see two rivers, Tukad Yeh Wos Kiwa and Tukad Yeh Wos Tengen, merge. A one meter wide paved-block track runs about two kilometers to the top of the hill which is a popular spot to watch the sunset.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nPicard, Kunang Helmi (1995) Artifacts and Early Foreign Influences.

          "Any faults in this lovely Palace are more due to the carnival atmosphere and busy location. Everything here is clean and bright, maybe too much so, as some of the empty, older not-so-kept-up places that abound in and around Ubud. No point in complaining about the hordes of",

          "Though this place is centrally located but there is nothing much inside. There is no entry fee because there is nothing. We heard that there is some dance performance happening in the palace but ewe didn't opt for it Even if you are in Ubud Central, you can avoid this",

          "It's a beautiful palace but there really isn't any information about what we are looking at, it would be nice to have a brochure or some plaques up telling us about the different parts of the palace. The publicly accessible part is only quite small and you cant get near",
          "Beautiful temple in the middle of Ubud. We went during the day and then back for the dancing at night. We loved it",
          "Tuesday 16th September and we were out exploring and sightseeing in Ubud Town where this amazing Palace is located in the centre of the Town. The Palace is known as Puri Saren Palace and this historic building was the official residence of the royal family of Ubud. We walked",
          "This is one of the few free attractions in Bali. In the busiest area of Ubud near the Ubud Market, it attracted tons of tourists including tour groups. It was a fairly small place, and the architecture of the 'palace' is fairly typical meaning you can see something similar",
          "Finally a free visit in Indonesia! The visit does not take long but is nice, the architecture is very typical.",
          "Worth a visit and in the centre of the town, lovely decorations, interesting too. Market is nearby which is fascinating",
          "Go here only if you Stay in surroundings of Ubud. Not recommended to travel from Canggu, Seminyak or places below it. Not worth your travel time.",
          "This complex is a little tired and overrun with tourists. Some aspects were interesting and it is right next door to Saraswati Temple which is really beautiful.",
          "The Ubud palace was quite a disappointment with nothing much to offer. The monkey Forest and Goa gajah caves are much better. Ubud palace is avoidable!",
          "Located at the center of Ubud itself, it is small, thus we were able to cover it in 10 mins. The intricate layout of the palace is like a private garden, and is worth taking a look only if you are in Ubud. Else, skip it altogether and go elsewhere. Note: Free entry. Walking",

          "The foreigner will feel not complete before make trip to Ubud, especialy the the Ubud Palace and traditional market, because both of these tourist destinations are the soul and identity of Ubud Village itself",

          "Should not waste even 10mins to visit the place. The substitutes are as follows: For Balinese structure and culture: Go to saraswati temple just 5 mins walk from here. For balinese dance & ramayan depiction: Go to uluwatu temple at south bali.",

          "This is the place to be if anyone is interested in sight seeing in Ubud. It's kind-of the cultural hub of the cultural and spiritual Bali. The best part of the palace is that its free of charge and you get to not only appreciate the Balinese royalty but also enjoy seeing their",

          "A good place to check out if you're in the area but not necessarily a must-see. Only a small portion of the palace is accessible to the public since the Ubud royal family still lives there.",
          "If u love art architectural, this place gonna stuck in ur mind. Balinese signature art is everywhere, this palace quite big with some sections. It also provide u with balinese dances every start from 6 PM. Need improve with the information board or flyer.",
          "we were coming back the next night to see the Balinese dancing but disappointed that it was rained out, however they had the show across the street which turned out great, we really enjoyed the dancing, but in some part of the show the man was doing a lot of talking that we",
          "Nice place but couldn't enter Palace. It was hot also. Coming back in the evening for the Ramayana Ballet... Keep the rains away.. God..",
          "The Palace is of great historical value I'm sure but there isn't enough information board or guides around to keep it interesting. Architecture is the same as you would have already noticed. Again, that is probably due to no information available to point out the interesting",

          "Nothing great, just average place. People visit due to its location next to Ubud palace. Lots of activities like dance happen every night. We visited while it was raining and it looked dirty. Can have a look while visiting Ubud palace and surrounding area.",
          "The palace is on the corner of a busy street-and unfortunately the mass of people just make the whole experience unpleasant. Inside the palace offers more - lost yourself in the details, check the small corners and close your eyes to get rid of the crowd and smell the air - you",
          "The palace located in the center of Ubud. The garden opened to public but you couldnt enter the main palace. there werent any entrance fee of any kind. but expect to be crowded on the weekend. the parking area is available on the side of the road near the palace",
          "The structures of the palace are beautiful. But what you get to see is very little. I wish one was able to explore the palace further or pay extra to get up close or to go in some of the structures. To learn more about the buildings, decoration and more.",

          "This \"palace\" is nothing special. In fact my hostel looked more like a palace. Entry is free (if it wasn't no one would go) so worth a quick look perhaps combined with a visit to the nearby market.",
          "Just away from the buzy street you wiil find this little oasis of peace. The pond is lovely with the lotus flowers and the temple is also worth a visit. Entrance is at the left side. If the doors are closed, just push them open. Sarongs are inside for you to use.",
          "This palace is in the middle of Ubud, just opposite the Art Market. If you happen to be in Ubud (you stay there or you've just visited the Sacred Monkey Forest) then it's ok to stop by and spend 15, 20 minutes to view these pretty small palace grounds. But don't add it to your",

          "We passed by on a morning run around 7:45am and since it was already open (admission free) we went in. There were only two other turist so it was very nice and calm. We also went there in the afternoon but it was so busy, so I really recommend going there early. A big part of",
          "This is a free entry tourist attraction in the ubud center, on the north-eastern corner of the crossroads. Actually the palace consitst of 9 parts but only 2 parts are open for public. The foremost courtyard called bencingah serves as the venue for dance at night (19.30-21.00)",

          "You can't go wrong with this as a quick stop off. As the title says it's right in the centre, and free and just off the Main Street. The Lotus Cafe is right next to it and you can sit and have a drink or something to eat and take in the lovely setting. We couldn't go inside but",
          "The palace is very small. It's worth a stop by visit if you are in the area. The entrance is for free. We walked around about 10min and made some photos. That was it. Nothing super special but ok if you are in ubud you go to the palace. Like everyone.",
          "This is worth the visit due to its history, no huge crowds and you are not hassled and again good photo opportunities",
          "If you want to have a lovely look at this wonderfully built Palace you'll be glad to know that you don't have to pay for it! The scene around the palace is beautiful and the fish in the water are stunning! If you're feeling thirsty there's a wonderful Starbucks near by with",
          "We went here last night for the dance show. It was a good experience. To discover traditional balinese music and dancing with differents styles and universes Interesting to do. Maybe not suitable for kids because the show is one hour long",
          "This is lovely. Located right by the Starbucks. Very serene and pretty. I heard a local guy trying to scam two gals into paying him to get \"permission\" to walk up the walk to the temple steps. Not needed. YOu can just walk in. It is very lovely.",
          "In 30 minutes you have seen it, it's free entry and in the center of Ubud, so you should be daft to not just walk in.",
          "Good news is it free but keep it in mind that Ubud Palace have not much to see. You will find a lot of tourists, really crowded.",
          "You could see the whole of the publicly accessible parts within about two minutes. Lots of tourists. Not a lot to see. The stone work / grounds are poorly maintained - lots of moss. Worth seeing if you are in Ubud, but don't go out of your way to visit.",
          "Since this is right at the center of Ubud, it gets hordes of tourists. The place is mostly closed to public and you only get to see the buildings/temple from the outside and take a few photos.",

          "The palace itself has limited public entrance as the family live in courtyard 3 and courtyard 2 is for officials only. It's in courtyard 1 that the dance performance occurs at 1930 daily in season but less frequently out of season. Go early for a good seat. The buildings make an",
          "I think it was the most beautiful thing I saw in Bali. We took plenty of photos Of the lily pond & the orange, outer walls of the temple (we couldn't enter the temple)The real fun was going back to see the Balinese dancing later at 1930 that was about 90 minutes long. The",

          "There is nothing going on here, and I guess it's actually still in use so a lot of it is private. But it's worth a look around at the different buildings, especially the doorways.",
          "It's really not much to see here. After 10 minutes you are done. But why not? Better then the average boring Palaces, you have to spend hours and hours and in the end you saw only bricks.",

          "Not all that astounding in itself but the traditional Balinese dance performance that is held there each night is worth seeing \u2013 so long as you get a good seat (can\u2019t stress this enough).

          "If you want to see a Balinese architecture especially located in one of the palace when you go to Ubud the our suggestion is the Puri Saren. In the day people can take pictures, normally many local and international tourists and in the night can be seen the traditional dances",

          "It is a simple historical palace with a few small courtyards. There is nothing much there to see cause most of the areas are restricted and closed for public as closed signs all over the place. Performance in the evening i.e. Traditional Balinese dance performance can be the",

          "Nice attraction, close to the main road, free of charge, good place for taking pictures if there are no crowds. An alternative would be to sit in one of the nearby cafes and admire it.",
          "I visited in the late afternoon and it was very quiet. The gamelan was all under wraps in their pavilions. I'm sure it comes alive at night.",
          "It is located in central of Ubud city you can walk to this place by any of central hotel or homestay. very smal palace which only take you like 10mins to see whole Palace",
          "As others have said, this is essentially a couple of small courtyards with some intricately carved religious monuments. It's undeniably pretty but unless you have a particular fascination with Hinduism, most visitors will find little to hold their attention for very long.",
          "A very good place to see the Legong Dance performance. The show start from 18:30 but better to take your seat from 17:30 since even after 17:45 all the best seats will be taken. Prepare your camera, take many photos as you want but better to mind the flash! Entrance IDR 80.000",
          "Simple Palace architectural. There is traditional dance at certain hours that is free for all to view.",
          "Initially visited it in the evening for a dance performance. A must see on your itinerary. Walk the grounds during the day. It is more about the exterior building and halls which are very ornate.",

          "From a city landmark and the taxi cab drop off just outside its a very valuable space. The accessible areas inside can be walked fully at a slow pace in less than two minutes. I enjoyed taking pictures of the multiple \"stop\" and \"do not enter\" signs all over the place, but",
          "Very seductive as it centrally located and always open. But if you attend one of Ubud's dance performances here, your money is lining the pockets of an already wealthy family, but if you attend a dance at a temple or community center, the income is shared by the community.",
          "My spouse and I walked here from our hotel during a free day while touring Indonesia. It is disappointing and underwheming since one can only visit the front garden. Other areas we tried to explore were dead ends or areas closed to tourists. There really is no need to visit this",

          "I expected something great and amazing and was very disappointed. There is nothing great or majestic to see as you would expect from a \"royal palace\". I would completely avoid this place...or go there with low expectations and spend about 10 minutes maximum. The entrance is",
          "I gave it an average rating as there was very little to see, so put it on your itinerary together with shopping at the Ubud Market since it's nearby. Guests can only access the front garden of the actual palace which was probably why the visit turned out to be slightly",

          "Some parts of the palace are not open to the public so the places/courtyard area that we're allowed to roam around is just 2 small areas. Nothing much to see but we came here for to watch the Legong Dance performance. Tickets can be bought by the entrance of the palace or anyone",
          "If you were expecting something big, this is not the case. A very beautiful place to take some shots during morning, and see Barong and Legong Dance show in the night. This place has its magic.",
          "A quiet and nice place, beautiful if you are interested in Bali culture and spirituality. I thought it was a little boring though, maybe because there was no spiritual activities going on when I was there. My daughter, 23 years old, found it ok but a little boring too.",
          "Not a big temple, a nice short walk around. But not much is missed if not going. If you are in Ubud, wander down before or after lunch",
          "We visited this temple today. Beautiful, but nothing really special.There hundreds of similar temples in Bali. Atmosphere is very positive like in all the rest of the temples.",
          "We went early and basically had the place to ourselves...it can get quite crowded later in the day. The combination of water, greenery and of course the beautiful temple makes for a serene and peaceful experience. Loved it",
          "Beautiful water palace. Tip: bring a change of clothes if you plan on going in the water for a \"blessing\" . People travel from all over for this ritual. Neat experience.",
          "Smack in the center of Ubud, this beautiful temple would be the ultimate photo opportunity if you can only snap a photograph without someone else in it.",
          "I enjoyed the water temple experience very much. A unique temple with holy springs . The people and even tourists go into the spring water. It has a festive air and prayerful spirit. Even if you don't enter the water, you can bless yourself three times on the face and three",
          "We visited during the day in December when it was very hot and humid. The water palace was a lovely cool retreat in the middle of Ubud. It was a nice reprieve for a short visit.",
          "It's a small nice palace, that is worth the visit, however my suggestion would be to see it close to sunset because by 7:30 there's a traditional Balinese dancing show which was great, the costumes and the music were intriguing.",
          "This is a beautiful place and definitely warrants a visit. its nice to see the lotus, the ponds and the amazing architecture",
          "The temple is located in the middle of Ubud and right behind Starbucks. Hence it's easy to find. You'll find a nice little temple with plenty of lotus flowers.",
          "This is a beautiful place to wander around and take in the sounds of nature. The water features add to the overall feel of the place and are soothing and relaxing. Well worth visiting.",
          "Book the VIP table instead of a regular table to have dinner to watch the show with the \"kings\" view... You need to spend the equivalent to us$100 and you'll get the royal treatment!",
          "Ubud be different appeal, the air is cool, rustic atmosphere makes the tourists who visit increasingly, one of which houses the king's castle Ubud/ better known as the Ubud palace , giving typical Balinese art architecture",
          "We decided to visit this palace because of the good reviews for Balinese dance show. And it was worth of it! Palace itself is quite small but not overcrowded and with its own atmosphere. There is a stage on the opposite site of the Palace where we saw the Balinese dance show.",
          "On our first day in Ubud, Bill and I stopped into Ubud Palace. After chatting for a while with one of the guides, we were invited into an inner sanctum where visitors are not normally allowed. There, we were fortunate enough to view the true opulence of the royal family's",
          "Since it is used by the royal family, some buildings are not accessible. Overall it is a nice gardens dotted with typical Balinese constructions",
          "We visited twice. One evening just before sunset and one early morning. Its a nice place for pictures and photography. If its quiet, its a nice place to spend some time to take a break. There's a Balinese dance show on weekends...we didn't watch due to bad weather - but should",
          "Try to visit the palace after it has rained. The water droplets stick to the lotus flower leaves in the most beautiful way. Fantastic architecture and the best Starbucks on earth.",

          "As all the Temple we went to so far on Bali, ou can't visit this one ( except of you respect the religion rules, obviouly ). What you can see isn't that big from the outside but you have to walk between nice ponds with lotus flowers everywhere. We took a picture by night and",
          "Right in the centre of Ubud this is a very small palace but interesting none the less. Still used by Balinese royalty, some of the areas are off limits but the archtitecture of the rest is worth a look.",
          "Gr8 architecture, clean but only the front lawn and another location open, most of it was closed for tourists , max can spend an hr here , decent photo location, near saraswathi temple so join them together and plan",
          "Go early to avoid the crowds , however if you have seen Palaces in Europe forget about this there is no comparison . These little Princes did little for their people except Tax them .",
          "This place was although quaint and tucked away with little to explore past the initial wow factor of the architecture and lilly pond, quite nice. Like every other palace in Ubud as a tourist you only get to really see the front of the building, but at least this one is lovely to",
          "As a 40+ solo female traveller, I set out from Ubud on my scooter and headed off with my map up the mountain to Tampa Siring and the Water Palace. It was a long way but an absolute highlight of my trip. I went on a Sunday and there a couple of thousand Balinese (and me) in",
          "The night performance is worth the ticket, visit this palace during the day to enjoy the reliefs of the wall",
          "Ubud Palace belongs to one of the royal families of Bali. Parts of the palace are now open to the public and can be seen. The palace is well decorated with ornate doors, statues and carvings and has been well preserved. The palace also holds traditional dance performances.",
          "Sit in the Lotus Cafe and relax away from the bustle of the main drag . Take photos of the Pond whilst enjoying the food in this well established Italian place .",
          "It\u00b4s worth checking this place out as you can get real close to the structures and intricate architecture - that\u00b4s not something you can do in every palace or temple.",
          "Its just a complex where you can take pictures, not worth anything, you cant go inside as the royal family still lives there. Nothing much to say about this place.",
          "We enjoyed the beauty of the Water palace and temple. Very picturesque. Having lunch at the cafe adjacent to it was very relaxing. Worth visiting, it's very close to the bargain shopping in central Ubud.",
          "Very fun, relaxing and near some other great attractions of Ubud. definitely go if it's not raining too heavily (I feel that would spoil it!)",
          "I visited this place in just 15 mins as the Ubud market is just opposite. Pay a visit here if you are going to the Ubud market.",
          "We stopped here on our way to the art museum and were pleasantly surprised! Beautiful lotus pond and quiet scenery. It was nice to just stop and reflect for a few minutes. The temple is intricate and beautiful as well. Not much to see, but worth a stop.",
          "I was traveling solo and wanted to see a dance performance a short walk from hotel. The first 30 minutes were great. You hear the music and the first dancers appear. The jerky movement make them look like dolls or marionettes- it's pretty impressive. Definately a tourist",
          "Nice place to take good photos. We could see the local balinese dance classes. It was drawing lot of crowd. My 1.5 year old had good time here, playing in open space and dancing. It is just opposite Ubud market.",
          "The Water Palace is peaceful, calming and full stop amazing, the atmosphere that you get from the intricate carvings is amazing!",
          "The Water Palace is located near the centre of Ubud. The pools of lilies in front of the temple are amazing. Worth a walk around just to soak up the beauty of the place. Good place for photos and entry is free.",
          "a very small pace in the heart of ubud. The royal family members still resides here, so accessibility to all the part of palace is limited. No entrance fee and don\u2019t take much time to visit. there are dance/cultural program in the evenings (fees).",
          "This is a water palace with a temple behind it. It was nice and pretty, but pretty much the same as other temples in Bali. It was one of the better things to see in Ubud. It's right by a restaurant called Cafe Lotus, which was really good. So I would recommend eating lunch",
          "We visited mid Aug 2014 during the day , and apart from the grounds and the statues, architecture etc, there was nothing really to see. Did I miss something. I know they have dances there in the evenings, but we were told (by the man selling the tickets) that the fire dance",
          "THE NIGHT SHOW Too much people You need to reserve in advance and coming soon 1/2h hour before The valley of monkeys is great",

          "The small but perfectly formed remains of the once royal palace in Ubud, just a few steps away from bustling Jln Raya Ubud, are a great escape from the tourist throng as they are not normally crowded despite their location. Entry is free and they are worth spending 20 minutes",
          "Was here on 11 July 2014. The question is, skip this or stop over to see it? In my opinion, allowing visitors to visit just a small compound of the entire palace will not do justice for this historical palace. Tourists who had been to other countries to see other types of",
          "small temple complex in center of ubud. If you can find the starbucks (its just wrong!) you are looking in the right place. If you are in ubud it is certainly worth a look.",
          "Lovely place that you can visit most times of the day. beautiful setting. Doesn't take a long time to visit. Must do a photo in front of the gold door",
          "The royal family used to (until recently) reside here. This courtyard is host to some fairly impressive performances (fee). Does not take a long time to visit. Unclear if access to inner courtyard is available. Lovely, ornate carvings/doors/gates, etc.",
          "Good dancing very night with a Great Balinese gamelan. Preferred Pura Dalem though further down the hill.",
          "So this palace is a cool place to take photos, but it's definitely small. Just one courtyard. Don't make a special trip, but if you are near the market, then check it out. But it's kinda more of the same.",
          "i was staying nearby and enjoy my visit here one morning very much. no one els was there and when the air is fresh and cool it seems and feels so much more relaxing. you enter through the passage between lotus cafe and starbucks in jl raya ubud.",
          "Possibly this is most of the smallest palaces in the world. To my surprise, I didn't find anything royal inside, maybe I am not familiar with the local cultures. Because the similar buildings can be found in the entire Bali island, I didn't find much particular about it. But it",
          "Not much to see, if you like starbucks they have a nice spot to sit and enjoy the view. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It is only 5 minute view.",
          "Our guide suggested we stop there, the palace is lovely some amazing carvings the spiritual spring pool was packed with tourists Nice place to see was very noisy so if you wanted to actually sit and absorb the feel on the place it couldn't happen. Have to run the gauntlet of",

          "We went to the Ubud Water Palace at night to see the dance performance by Chandra Wati Ladies Orcestra and Dance Troupe. We were surprised that the performance took place at such a beautiful location. The dance performance was a unique experience brought by a motivated dance",
          "Walking around the palace grounds, at a leisurely stroll, can't possibly take more than 15 minutes. Only a tiny part of the palace is open to public viewing. We wandered in almost by accident, and as there was no paid entrance, looked around, took some pictures, and left. By no",
          "Entrance to the area behind gold doors are not permitted therefore not much to see let alone take photos if there is no evening dance show or ceremony. There was no signboard with explanation or short story of the Palace which would have been appreciated. We were there last",
          "Our Guide, Made, take us to this place even actually I've been go to other water palace such as tirta gangga, but this place is not too bad but not better than Tirta Gangga.",
          "Great place to sip on a coffee and enjoy the ambiance of the lily pads and the garden. Best time to visit is in the morning when the skies are clear and there aren't the throngs of people.",
          "A palace turned into an art center. The location is astounding as there are many places to visit around the Puri Saren Palace like the temple on top of the cliff where you can also get a great view. There is the traditional art market in front of the palace. There is a",
          "Was there in the afternoon and there is really a bus load of maybe 2 of tourist. Again no explanations, no idea what you are seeing. Small area, walked one round and that is it. There are evening dances in the area but that is chargeable.",
          "Not much if there is no evening dance show. Looked rather dull. If you are in Ubud and you are on Monkey first road then you might as well check it out. There is absolutely no point driving just for this. No fee for entering but there is for the dance show.",
          "Every time I come to Ubud,will go to this place,i may just take photos(though many photos taken already),or attend dance performance in the evening,or just watch local kids practicing traditional dance or gamelan.puri saren palace a landmark of Ubud,a must for first time",
          "Located across from Ubud market, Puri Saren Agung is part of the Ubud royal family's historic palace. There is no entrance charge and visitors are free to wander around the outer courtyards where evening dance performances are held almost daily. We did not watch the performance",

          "Puri Saren is at everybody's way while touring Ubud: in the very heart of the city. So, please enter and enjoy this beautiful palace built in the traditional Balinese style. Lovely stone carved sculptures, ponds and as many lotus flowers as one can hardly imagine. As an",
          "Nothing much to see here - it takes less than 10 minutes to walk through. Tons of tourists with cameras and guidebooks looking somewhat puzzled as they don't quite know what to look at. Unless you are a history buff, I don't think it's even worth a visit. It's also very poorly",
          "Right downtown with the Tourist info and hotel pick up and delivery. Small space open to public but wonderful remnants of the past. Stone carvings, doors, traditional styling and a quiet place to rest if there are nor new buses arriving or leaving. Annoying \"I was there\"",

          "Stayed just for 1 night. The rooms are very large, simple and basic. The bathroom could do with a little bit of a face lift, but still. The surrounding gardens are out of this world, loads of statues, impressive decor and architecture, the private houses are just stunning, very",
          "I didn't get to see the inside area of the Palace as I only visited this place to watch the dance performance. Different dance for different day, so you might want to check the dance schedule. For me, I got the Legong Dance and I quite enjoyed it. The instrumental music itself",

There are many vehicles nearby and there are no zebra crossings, so pay attention to traffic safety.Sometimes there are performances in the evening, there is a fee, it seems pretty good, it is worth visiting.",
          "Free entrance. Central location. Very pretty temple. It was a very nice walk through this palace. It is well kept and cleAn and right in the center of everything. Great for photo opportunity. I only wish there was more of a historical explanation so you can really enjoy what you\u2019re looking at. Nonetheless. Worth the visit",

          "It was a 100k a person for the dance. We really enjoyed it. If you want to see a original Balinese dance performance that's a good place to go too. \n\nIf you get there about 45min before it starts You should be able to snatch a good spot to follow the performance.",
          "I attended the Sunday night epic (live music and dance) at the palace and was completely enamored. Beautiful costumes, incredible dancers, lively music. I'd recommend arriving early and sitting facing the stage (the instruments are on \u2026",

          "Free of charge, u can dress as u wish. Nice place",
          "Very cool spot. There are nightly shows to attend and visit as well. It is open to the public during the day for people to take photos of the grounds. At night, shows cost around 100,000 IDR. It may be worth showing up early for a show as seats are first come first serve and it can be difficult to view if you're in a back row seat",

          "Very interesting place, definitely recommended to at least glance inside. We visited during an off season, end of November and there were still few people, but didn't stay for the performance. I can only imagine how crazy busy it gets in peak months.",
          "It is pretty but unfortunately you can visit only a very small part of the palace.",
          "A small town but packed with tourists. Services such as Uber and grab are banned here by the local transport service provider so you will need to engage them to get around, especially popular tourist spot. Traffic could be a nightmare so plan your journey ahead.",

          "We really enjoyed the evening prayer with local bali dance. It was a wonderful experience. You people have kept this place very neat and clean.",
          "Temple right in Central Ubud. It doesn\u2019t take much time at all to check it out quickly. It is a tourist hotspot given how central it is but it\u2019s beautifully maintained, free to enter and worth visiting. You can grab a meal right before or after and continue exploring Ubud.",
          "The Ubud Place is symbol for Hindu culture. It's beautiful, unique but touries can't come some areas.",
          "It was an wonderful place. The day I was there was the day of festival and it was cool to watch the kids doing their traditional dances and it was lovely.

          "A very nice palace but mostly blocked for visitors. You only get to see about 10% of the entire palace. If you visit on a Sunday morning you can see the kids performing dance. Good thing is the entrance ticket is free.",
          "On our last day we finally stopped by to see what all the fuss was about. Throughout our stay in Ubud we saw lots of people in and around the palace. It was nice to be able to walk in, see some of the architecture up close and take some \u2026",

          "Very pleasent lovely service ,room,food and my favaroite the monkeys",
          "Very nice temple in Ubud. Nicely located, even if the surrounding area is busy. Temples are all over the city, but this one stands out by its size and quality of the statues and colors.

          "We went to one of the dance. If you don't come early, you won't get a proper view and we ended up sitting down in front. The dance itself was boring. We went to Legong dance. If it's your first time, then you can try it. But I don't recommend it.",
          "Way too hot and crowded.",
          "Wonderful to watch the Legong and Ramayana Dance here, which shows every night. Relaxing little hub in the daytime, a place to sit for free. Magical at night time. Bring mosquito repellent, and watch the show sitting on carpets in the frontmost row, with a bottle of beer. Absolutely satisfying.",

        "wiki": "Goa Gajah, or Elephant Cave, is located on the island of Bali near Ubud, in Indonesia. Built in the 9th century, it served as a sanctuary.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlthough the exact origins of the cave are uncertain, it is believed to have been built as place for spiritual meditation. One folklore relates that it was created by the fingernail of the legendary giant Kebo Iwa. However, examining its style, the sanctuary was probably dated from the 11th century Bali Kingdom. The complex contains both Hindu and Buddhist imagery, as the cave contains lingam and yoni, symbol of Shiva, and the image of Ganesha, while by the river there are carved images of stupas and chattra, imagery of Buddhism.  \nThe cave was rediscovered by Dutch archaeologists in 1923, but the fountains and bathing pool were not discovered until 1954.\n\n\n== Site description ==\nThe temple is characterised by menacing faces that are carved into the stone \u2013 whose purpose is assumed to be the warding off of evil spirits. The primary figure was once thought to be an elephant, hence the nickname Elephant Cave. Other sources state that it is named after the stone statue of the Hindu God Ganesh (characterised by having the head of an elephant) located inside of the temple. The site is mentioned in the Javanese poem Desawarnana written in 1365. An extensive bathing place on the site was not excavated until the 1950s.  The entrance of the cave is accessed only by walking down a long flight of stairs. The inside of the temple is small and usually has trails of white smoke from the incense burning. Visitors wearing shorts will be issued a sarong to tie around the waist before entering the courtyard. The complex also contains 7 statues of women (out of which 1 has been destroyed due to an earthquake) holding water pitchers that depicts seven holy rivers of India: the Ganga River, Sarasvati River, Yamuna River, Godavari River, Sindhu River, Kaveri River, and Narmada River.\n\n\n== World Heritage Status ==\nThis site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on October 19, 1995, in the Cultural category, but was pulled out along with 11 other sites on 2015.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Central Bali travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\n\n== References ==\nElephant Cave - UNESCO World Heritage Centre Accessed 2009-03-06.\nPringle, Robert (2004).

          "The Elephant Cave is on every list of \"must sees\" in Ubud. For us, a complete let down. Your 50 IRB entry fee will come with a sarong, which must be worn by both men and women at Balinese Hindu temples. We approached the cave and admired the truly wonderful and intricately",
          "Actually two temples. Hindu and Buddhist. Very interesting conversation with a person who checked tickets about God, bielievs, history of place, excavations and meditation. Very mystic place worth to visit when it's getting dark for it's atmosphere.",
          "The temple complex is huge with gardens to explore. However, the cave is tiny inside with the presence of both Hindu and Buddhist elements. Mainly, it seems to be dedicated to Hindu Lord Ganesha. As Lord Ganesha represents elephants, hence the name of the temple is justified.",
          "This was the first 'tourist trap' I encountered that was blatantly obvious. You purchase a ticket to walk down stairs, you see a holy water spring/font (very lovely), but the cave itself is an incense smoke filled room with an elephant relic. There Is a waterfall, great for",
          "see all of the carvings enter the cave, this temple has cleansing fountains to partake in a cleansing ritual, no one was partaking while we were there",
          "Maybe we were lucky, but when we visited the Goa Gajah there was a lot of offering going on. We couldn't barely see the hands in front of our eyes. There is not much ventilation, but a lot on inscence \u2013 still a must see for Ubud and just around the corner. Quite a good half day",
          "A very old temple that's been partially demolished by earthquakes. There is also a Buddhist temple nearby, so if you are already there, make sure you see both. Some steps to walk up and down, but its purely with good environment. There is also a large portion of shops outside of",
          "Though the temple is good, it's small and not very well maintained. They also have a small waterfall. You can skip it for the price they are charging.",
          "A great stop from DPS to Ubud trip. It contains both Hindu and Buddhist sculptures, lingam & yoni,symbol of Shiva, and image of Ganesha, while by the river there are carved images of stupas and chattra imagery of Buddhism. Rediscovered by Dutch archaeologists in 1923, but",
          "While it has an interesting history, this temple is definitely the one to miss, very small and guides will follow you until you accept and will continue to ask you for money. Would highly recommend other temples in Bali, this one appears to be a tourist trap.",
          "We enjoyed all the statues which Bali is flush with. Wear a hat. There\u2019s a small restaurant there only cash that was good for lunch. You must wear a sarong o matter what you have on, no exceptions. Not even you \ud83d\ude02",
          "Also know as the elephant cave, this place was built as a spiritual sanctuary many centuries ago. There is a place to bathe before entering as many Hindus do before praying here. There are locals wandering around requesting to be your guide but you do not need a guide unless you",
          "Nice place but so much litter in the river and around the property. I wouldn\u2019t go back- unkept. Sad because it does have potential",
          "Interesting place! Some water fountains, a sculpted rock at the entrance of the cave( nothing special). Nice view going from up to down.",
          "This place it is part of Bali's culture and we always try to get to know more about the places we visit, the people who live there and their culture,religion and day to day life.",
          "I was taken here by a local friend and there were small ceremonies going on at both the a Hindu (ancient Elephant Cave) and Buddhist sections of the area. However, we spent more time enjoyed our walk to the back of the temple area down the various paths through the trees,",
          "Beautiful temple. Previous reviews sum it up. We usually are happy to pay a guide because we love history and culture. The guide asked for 20$dollars. We settled on 10$. He spent ten minutes with us and then asked for more money. It was not worth five dollars. I hate leaving",
          "This was biggest hypothetical temple in Bali. Entrance fee is Rp50k for adults and 25k for children (under 12). They charge more because there is a Hindu and Buddhist temple within same complex. The Elephant temple is just a whole is a rock. Which can bare fit 10 people. Its",
          "Had a lovely time visiting a very old historic place. To see how it was built in those times was quite mind blowing",
          "There are 1000s of temples throughout Bali. This one being the oldest excited us to visit, but there was nothing archaelogically or fascinating to see. Market sellers line up until you hit the 100 + steps going down and then locals trying to sell you guides. Took longer to get",
          "There are hundreds if not thousands of temples in Bali, this one is a little original, close to Ubud and worth the visit.",
          "A must visit site. One can't enter many temples. This is a possibility for tourists to enter this sacred place and look around.",
          "Pretty temple site a bike ride from Ubud. Apart from the people trying to scam you into buying a sarong this is a nice place to see if you can spare some time. There is a waterfall in he forest surrounding the temple.",
          "There are so many wonderful temples to visit in Bali that I would suggest skipping this one. The cave is a little creepy for this westerner. An it is a moderately difficult climb down to get to the cave.",
          "It was amazing place in bali. Especially in ubud and the staff is friendly and charming. Highly recommend",
          "The stone work at the cave is good, but not amazing, you can walk around and see some ponds and that's it.There is other places way better than this as the Taman Ayun Temple.",
          "We had some guests visiting Elephant Cave on our fullday Ubud Tour. They are really exciting, walking around the area and observed all the ancient culture of the building of the temple and the big tree which was hundrends years old that found in this area. A lot of nive picture",
          "It is better to see in the morning Nice view for the photos It is actually a walking area with a temple , one hour is enough to see it .",
          "Very calm and serene while we were there with lots to explore. A sarong is required (and provided free with entrance) if wearing shorts. There is a beautiful forest and waterfall surrounding the temple. A bit of a drive but easily accessible by bike or taxi (100k or 10$can",
          "The place itself is much less impressive than in the pics. Considering the high entrance fee that you need to pay, not sure that it's worth it.",
          "Nicer temples around the corner from most hotels. In fairness im not that into temples but i must say i didnt really find this one very beautiful. Def get a tour if you end up going other wise a total waste of 50000 that could have bought you a nice large bingtan somewhere",
          "We were super excited to visit the elephant cave but were sad to see it cost 50K to get it. Nevertheless we went for it and was left feeling ripped off. Beautiful sculpture but a TINY cave and a small walk around jungle. I recommend going early in the morning - 8am or even",
          "The place is open 24 hours and tickets will be sold till 18:00. An hour and half is enough to look around . By coming in the early eve you avoid tons of tourist and have a place to yourself to explore and enjoy.",
          "Went here and got called in by a store owner who claimed i needed a Sarong for the visit. Bought one of her but at the entrance you can just lend them.. :-) The cave itself is not worth visiting if you compare it to other things in Bali / Ubud. The gardens around it however are",
          "A small cave in which locals pray. Very stuffy. beautiful portal at the entrance. but you won't spend there more than 5 minutes. It is such a place only for a short stop.",
          "The most interesting thing about the Elephant Cave is the entrance - a good spot for photos or Instagram shots. The cave itself is quite small, dark and has a small altar at each end. Through the temple gates there is a pathway to the ruins of a Buddhist temple which was",
          "Went to this as saw it advertised on lots of the ubud tour sites. It\u2019s interesting to see the Hindu side and Buddhist side. That\u2019s cool. Also inside the elephant cave is also worth a quick stop. The pond is beautiful though so it\u2019s worth a visit for the grounds. Be weary",
          "The cave itself isn\u2019t very impressive, the demonic carving is interesting but that\u2019s about it. However, if you enjoy peaceful gardens then I\u2019d still advise you go if you\u2019re staying in Ubud because it\u2019s not very far, the entry fee isn\u2019t too bad and you could easily spend an hour",
          "The cave itself is not interesting at all. The garden around it may compensate a little the general feeling, but generally it is not worth the money and over-estimated. Not a must-see at all.",
          "the place was good but the guide in the cave did not have any knowledge about Hinduism or the Hindu gods he was just babbling and when we interjected to correct him he did not like it. if you are visiting the place do not hire a local guide as they do not anything about the",
          "The greenery of the suroundings is fantastic. The cave is small and we missed information in English as well as a defined path to follow from the start to the end. Tge price for the adults is 50,000 IDR (app. 3,20), if you want you can agree with a guide for a private tour after",
          "Caves were interesting to see. Didn't take long to walk around. If you don't have much time in Ubud I would skip it though.",
          "From parking to grotto, you will see many shops. Vendors were nice. Descend stairs to grotto. Several areas, including fountain of youth. Walk into small cave. Not too small, no problem with clausrophobia. Enjoy treasures displayed in alcoves. Wander around area to",
          "Small cave, warm and about 15m deep. Low season. Not too crowded. A lot of sellers. Entrance 100.000rp.",
          "The temple is very big and its the only temple you actually go inside and are allowed to take pics and videos inside. However, the inside has only 2 small statues. Its not crowded as other temples.",
          "Entrance fee is IDR 50k per person (=\u00a32.77 not \u00a31as GBJ-Cookies wrote) and includes use of sarong. Opens at 8am. If you are coming individually, we recommend you time your visit depending on whether you like all souvenir and drink/food stalls to be open (then come after 10am)",
          "Most overrated attraction in Ubud. You can skip this and take it off your list. Just ignore the sellers outside trying to sell you sarong. Your entrance fee does include a loaner for you to use. The cave itself is quite small and just takes 5 minutes to visit. The real draw is",
          "Located just a 10 minute drive from Ubud this 1000 year old religious site is worth a quick visit. The entrance fee is less than \u00a31 and everyone that visits must show respect by covering up. Sarongs are readily available to rent or purchase in one of the several souvenir shops",
          "We had read that this was basically just a cool carving in a stone wall so we kept our expectations low...but when we went, they had \"decorated\" it with lots of tacky yellow cloth so you couldn't even see it!!! We went as soon as it opened to avoid the people and still couldn't",
          "Sarong ( veshti ) which needed for entering temple is provided when you purchase tickets at all temples in Bali. No need to buy at the shops near by. Balinese Hindu temple with few steps up and down. Attraction is the cave . Typical to spend 30-40 mts",
          "Very historic place with a long history and a nice walk through the garden. But don\u2018t look behind the scene as there is a lot of rubbish and plastic all around.",
          "Decades ago the Balinese started grumbling that foreigners wanted to horn in on every ritual, private compound and sacred site in their search for the ancient and the sacred. At the same time they were happy to take the tourist money. And so it goes. This place is pretty",
          "Fascinating complex of ancient and relatively modern temple styles. Not the typical style of Temple in Bali. Beautiful valley surrounds...steep steps for access.",
          "This is one of the many centuries old temple in Ubud,bali. If one doesnot have enough time to visit temples such old or older than this,then this one you can easily visit within 20mins drive from ub8d market. Goa gajah as it is also called, this one takes you back to 11th",
          "This is not a bad place but I would not call it as a tourist attraction. There is a small cave anda temple which you can see after wearing a sarong. There are better temples in Bali choose those over this place. If you are on a long vacation you may include this place in your",
          "this was included in our tour. personally there wasn't much to see here only a cave. a good photo opportunity, however. you must wear a sarong before entering I must say that you do not have to buy these they will give you one at the entrance.",
          "I'm gonna keep this short and sweet only because there's not much to say. We visited this place as it was recommended. Only I should have done my homework before going. We went expecting to see live elephants only to find out it's the cave name. A word of warning - women who",
          "we arrived late and enjoyed putting on our sarongs before entering. The Elephant Cave area is impressive and we liked to wander around the compound and into the cave (which is dark and the incense in there is heavy). Too many small shops just before the place. Worth a visit, if",
          "Stopped here on the way back to town, I found the cave to be majestic. I enjoyed looking around and enjoyed my brief stop to the religious site.",
          "Worth visiting, a few steps to climb but it\u2019s worth it. We arrived there around 9:30am and it was quiet which was great. Don\u2019t forget to bring a sarong but you can also rent one there.",
          "Nice photo OP and another site to cross off when your staying over in ubud good your doing a whole bunch in a tour a good add to the list .",
          "Lovely setting but isn\u2019t huge so is doable with young kids. There are steps to get down so I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend taking a pushchair. As you walk in from the car park, you encounter many street stalls selling trinkets and fabrics. You purchase your tickets near the",
          "We visited the Elephant Cave temple with friends and some teenage daughters. The elephant cave itself is remarkable on the outside - the carved stone head of Ganesh - but there is not much to see inside. It is pretty dark. Sarongs need to be worn but don\u2019t get caught as we did",
          "For me this place is a beautiful cave temple. Even though there is not much to see it is good to go and have a look because it has a unique structure.",
          "The cave is not really a cave. The carved rock you see is it ...you walk through to a black room and that\u2019s it. There are nice gardens and a waterfall and statues around but there are many many steps to get down to see these attractions. It\u2019s ok as an addition to an itinerary",
          "Probably one of the least well maintained Temples we visited. I wouldn't consider it a must see at all nor would I Visit again. 2 stars purely because it's a sacred place however it didn't feel sacred at all with the rubbish possibly left by tourist and the cave itself was not",
          "The mouth of this cave is pretty cool, you should see it for yourself. There are pools there as well for blessings and very interesting to see.",
          "It seems this sacred site has been taken over by bus loads of tourists and market stalls. Unfortunately the energy of the site couldn't be fully realised with hoards of tourists climbing over ancient tree roots and sacred buildings to take selfies. There are many beautiful",
          "Sunday 8th September and we visited here, it was one of the stops on our \"Bali Great Introduction Tour\" which we booked through the Tui Representative at our Hotel. Goa Gajah also know as Elephants Cave is situated on the outskirts of Bedulu Village, and about 6 kilometres from",
          "Visited today and loved the place. There is a temple to Ganesh and one to Buddha. There are quite a few steps to negotiate to get to all the temples. Also the staff will fit you out with an appropriate sarong. It still feels very spiritual for a tourist hotspot",
          "Like many places on Bali this is a very busy spot to visit, but it\u2019s one of those must see things. Inside the small cave you will find small altar. Very hot and humid inside.",
          "I couldn\u2019t appreciate why it\u2019s so popular. In fact when I was inside I had to run outside I felt sick with the strong smell, hot and dark. I don\u2019t recommend to go in it",
          "I asked my driver to stop here on my transit from Ubud to Seminyak. I don\u2019t regret it. I found this to be a really pretty setting walking down through the trees & gardens. The cave itself is really cool, but I enjoyed the water statues, waterfall & cool trees too. It\u2019s worth the",
          "If a local claiming to work at this temple starts taking to you and guiding you through the site for free, be warned they will ask for a donation at the end and guilt trip you into it. Just avoid this interaction all together. He gave a good history lesson, but if we had known",
          "This is a nice temple. Quiet compared to others nearby. Still very touristy. It\u2019s interesting but likely you will not be sad if you miss it.",
          "There is many interesting spots, for example very old sculpture, mysterious buildings and big fall! You can enjoy them as you like.",
          "We added this onto our tour as the pictures looked great, we were a little disappointed but at least we have seen it.",
          "Beautiful cave temple. We took the services of the guide present there which was really helpful. The 100 year old fig tree below the cave is extremely beautiful. The story behind the broken remains of the temple was fascinating. The entrance to the cave is stunning. If one",
          "Nice to visit. So many tourists - if you can go early would suggest Cave itself is atmospheric but not big. The rest of the complex is pretty and old. The most amazing thing is how it was lost then rediscovered - I wonder how much more is hiding away somewhere and what",
          "Very disapointed after visiting Goa Gaja. We walked for nearly an hour to get there and it was just a small cave with nothing inside. It was very expensive to visit and we wish we hadn't bothered",
          "Our trip was planned in advance & this place was in our list to see but I was expecting something more impressive. If this cave is on your way - drop there to have a look but definitely you can skip it, you won\u2019t loose anything.",
          "This was the first stop on a day trip from Ubud due to how close it was to our hotel. We had agreed with our driver to leave half an hour earlier than normal and this meant we arrived at the Elephant Temple before anyone else and before all the souvenir stalls had opened. This",
          "Not what I expected at all. The temple gardens were nice and beautiful, it's worth it if you are interested in the Hindu religion. Be prepared to be hassled buy upsellers on every corner. It doesn't stop there, once inside people will still hassle you for money in order to learn",
          "It's very nice and quit over there. A lot of history. If you have a good tour guide, he can tell you a lot of the place",
          "Jatiluwih is a natural tourist destination that has a very good view ... and there are also plenty of photo spots so you can take good photos ... there are also many restaurants while enjoying the rice field views ...",
          "A Cultural, religious, artistic and natural place for all the people. Get your camera once again, you will shoot temples, gardens and the popular elephant cave. GREEN GREEN GREEN once again! Get ready to admire this place too!",
          "If your in ubud why not visit. Entrance I guess was 30k idr. The place is quite huge and prepare to walk and climb. There is a water fall inside or deep in the woods. If you like to have a coffee I guess there is a coffee shop over looking the cave near the exit.",
          "Visit this cave close to Ubud before the tourist buses arrive. It is a special atmosphere to walk around this temple areal. Really recommended.",
          "Great day in Ubud exploring the Elephant Cave learnt the history behind them along with many interesting facts",
          "The temple and surrounds were beautiful, the market maze we were forced to exit through was not good. It was like being a Ikea without the shortcut to the exit.",
          "Nice to see an old structure like this in Bali. Gave us a glimpse of what it was like back before tourism came and changed much of Bali",
          "I have visited here twice and it always feels like it helps my soul and inner peace. I recommend hiring a guide and you will find them near the bottom of the stairs. They are usually one of the caretakers wearing white. Make sure you haggle with them on price but in saying that",
          "A must see when you visit in Bali! This was beyond my expectations. And I will/want to see this again when I am back in Bali!",
          "Outside is full of touts, they have a nest and swings inside aswell as temple. Surroundings look nice, swing isn't bad but 300k for 2 people for one swing is ridiculous and nest infested with ants. They do not advertise this price anywhere so be wary, put off visiting the",
          "Its really a very nice ancient construction maintained neat and clean. Nice big trees. Good shopping arena in the surroundings. Worth a visit",
          "I would reccomend tourists to go visit this temple. Although the elephant cave itself is not much, the gardens surrounding the temple are incredibly scenic and beautiful. Remember sunscreen and a hat! What was a pitfall to my hubby and I was that we were pressured into buying 2",
          "The temple itself is small and although the carvings outside are good there isn't much to see inside. The big tree in the grounds is quite spectacular and the rest is very nice going down the steps to the lotus pond.",
          "It\u2019s unique and beautiful with an old history. There is a small waterfall but cannot swim. A lot of green and trees. If you have breath problems careful with the cave. Inside the cave there is a lot of humidity and the sticks is a problem. Goa Gajah is definitely a must.",
          "You should go there like 1h30 before closing or just after the opening. Otherwise, too much visitors. It\u2019s beautiful, so you might wanna really enjoy it. Embraced by the beautiful green Balinese forests, this place is particular, among but above all things, by its (Hi)story.",
          "Interesting place to visit but mainly for no longer than an hour. Great insta pics opportunity and history of the place.",
          "Very calm full place should visit.be careful the ladies in the parking they will compel to buy you traditional dress to go inside temple for money or rent it is free after the ticket counter .",
          "We were lucky to get here early when there were just a few other people here. It\u2019s a marvellous place but once the bus loads arrived difficult to see anything.",
          "The cave was in a small temple. The temple was interesting and you needed to wear a sarong. A little taste of Balinese culture. It was a small cave used for worship.",
          "Visited this cave as part of a tour. The cave was beautiful but thought there would be more to it, not much to do as you walk around so we ended up stopping off for a coffee while we waited. Temple is nice and you have to wear a sarong (which they will provide free). We paid",
          "A nide small cave inside a temple! Not something special but we paid a quick visit yesterday! You shouldn't spend more than half an hour!",
          "Goa Gajah is an artificial cave that functions like a place of worship. This cave is located in Bedulu Village, Blahbatu District, Gianyar Regency, Bali. Located approximately 27 km from Denpasar. UNESCO noted this cave as a world heritage in the tentative list on 19 October",
          "This is nice temple towards Ubud. Many steps to go down from parking area. Have one cave and also buddha temple.",
          "Visited early morning and enjoyed a walk around the nice gardens. The Elephant Cave itself is rather underwhelming and the temple area surrounding it is a bit of a mess. Outside there is the usual array of little shops selling the same cheap stuff. When you are parking the shop",
          "It is a lovely temple to have a look aroundandsmall cave.it was 50000ruppee per person entrance and they give you free sarong to enter with. cave small but ornate entrance",
          "We were quickly ambushed by two sarong-vendors on alighting at the entrance. We were told and later realised that we must wear sarong before entering the premises as it is a temple. In our haste to save time, we bought the sarongs. Had we known earlier, we could have something",
          "The place has beautiful carvings, a wonderful green area, a small waterfall and a tiny tea stall... We had kept this place on hold, but I'm glad we visited it!",
          "We hired a lovely driver who took us here. Such a fascinating and interesting place to visit and learn the history. Definitely recommend!",
          "Good to know the history. Enter the cave and feel so scary. But interesting experience. Good place. Not expensive",
          "I don't really think it was worth paying to see, but it was beautiful scenery and a nice walk in the forest. Not particularly interesting though. Somewhat disappointed.",
          "We are glad we went but we would not pay 50,000idr in hindsight. The cave is very small and hard to take pictures of since people continually walk in and out of the cave. However, the grounds that the cave sits on are quite large and beautiful.",
          "Honestly I felt a bit disappointed. You pay to get in and park and there\u2019s nothing much to see. The cave itself takes 30 seconds. Would not recommend",
          "Nice temple and walk down. I liked the trees with remarkable roots. Lots of steps down and up again.",
          "This is a ganesha temple inside a cave at ubed Bali. Ganesha , brahma, Shiva statues are there though brahma statue is not very visible. Indonesian currency of 50000 is charged. Seeing or not seeing depends upon a person belief.",
          "You shouldn't miss this. It is a very interesting historical site. Please note: there are a lot of steps.",
          "Nice temple outside the main tourist hubbub of Ubud. Really interesting to see the whole temple complex including the natural rivers and caves. Free sarongs provided on entry so no need to carry your own. The whole visit took less than an hour but was very pleasant.",
          "It's worth a look. Ancient buildings, waterfalls, quite scenic. You will get hit up to buy a sarong the minute you step out of the car. You don't need to they have them at the gate. For the unwary. 100000 to get in 200000 for 2 sarongs 150000 for tour guide. $45-50",
          "The temple is very small and not as impressive as some of the others we\u2019ve seen but the garden makes it worth going! So pretty!",
          "this was part of a day-tour which was less demanding physically. Very pretty but no live elephants just the cave.",
          "The Elephant Cave in Ubud, is an amazing place to learn about the Balinese beliefs, as 86% of the population in Bali are Hindu. If you\u2019re lucky enough, your local tour guide or driver will tell you all you need to know and what you want to know. Very good pictures can be taken",
          "These are ancient ruins and albeit interesting to see, there wasn't much spiritual energy since there are too many tourists and not enough quiet places to contemplate and retreat. The vistas are pretty and there was an amazing Banyan tree. But we could have skipped this one and",
          "We visited the Elephant Cave and honestly, I would rather have skipped it and just made a donation. There is nothing to see if you are traveling with kids. Steep stairs in and out, no clear signage forces you to pay a random guide. Too many flies from neighbouring trash site. We",
          "Really different kind of temple, you can enter into the mouth and look inside. Also walk down further to see the fallen ruins and the amazing tree. Only takes 30 mins to look around. Entrance fee was $50k ($5nzd)",
          "We liked Goa Gajah a lot and recommend a visit when in the area. Not too crowded when we visited at about 10:00. The high spot for us was the Ganesh inside the cave with mice running around eating the offerings around the stone carving: if you know anything about Ganesh you\u2019ll",
          "Beautifil temple in ubud, it is not only about those famos pictured stones, it also has a really nice peace of forest there. You pay 50k for the entrance, which I found a bit expensive, but totally worth it. You also get a free saron so don't buy it or rent it in front of the",
          "This visit will have more meaning to you if you understand the history of the cave. Would recommend you doing some preliminary research before you go here, otherwise it is a quick walk in and a quick walk out. When you arrive you will be greeted by women trying to sell",
          "Nice and beautiful to see and experience. I enjoyed the nature and to see the temples around it. It was a great day here",
          "When we entered we were approached by a temple guide. The price was 'from the heart'. We had been informed about the guides and decided that their knowledge would enhance the visit. Without the guide we would not have understood the history or the meaning of the temple. The holy",
          "A lovely place to visit. But beware. Once you enter the temple you will be offered for someone to tell you all about the temple. They then request payment from you at an addition fee from your entry. We didn\u2019t accept and just wondered around ourselves. It\u2019s very pretty but",
          "Had our driver guide us he was very informative and it was a beautiful temple with interesting history, but the sellers on the steps as you enter car park are very aggressive with trying to make you buy there goods and it\u2019s very off putting to want to return again with family",
          "This is little temple where you can go to inside the temple which is not allowed most of the temple in Bali,",
          "Beautiful place with old history. Small, but really nice. You can feel the antiguity of the place. Among beautiful nature as well. A must see",
          "The Hindu cave temple is nice, but small. There was 2 huge rats hiding at one of the altars. The Buddhist temple ruins is the type of temple that you see in adventure movies. That was really interesting. Everything is covered with moss, the rain forest is very live. It looks",
          "Pro: Free use of sarong. Con: A bit expensive relative to other attractions. Tip : A visit late in the afternoon makes you feel gloomy. Try to visit in the the morning.",
          "The Goa Gajah or elephant temple is just a old ruins of a temple. Not even maintained properly and worth only the one photo seen everywhere on the internet! Waste your time if you need proof of visit to Bali and this temple!",
          "In Ubud, feels very private and peaceful. The excavated site gives you a chill. The greenery is just stunning. The silence disturbed only by chirping birds and the wind trying to make its way through the trees - leaves you calm and serene. My recommendation is to spend some time",
          "This was interesting, though not very large. Cave was interesting but very small. Grounds were nice but LOTS of stairs to navigate. Nice small waterfall.",
          "We didn't spend a lot of time here but found it well worth the trip. The entry fee is low and there are a few stalls but we were not hassled to buy.The carvings around the cave mouth are fascinating and entering the cave is a must.",
          "A special place for locals and one can appreciate the history of the site when a local guide explains how it was discovered and the effort to get the area ready for visitors",
          "Not worth the effort nor the time. Not much to see, a little cave and stairs down in the forest. Big disappointment",
          "The elephant cave looks nice but it is not th\u00e1t special. The piece of nature, however, is wonderful. We enjoyed if very much. If you do a tour, definitely go here.",
          "If u wanna see an old temple, then see this. Very nice with the nature and waterfall. But the elephant cave itself was really a disappointing!",
          "We seen this attraction in the middle of our day trip and the amount of shade were very welcoming against the heat. Well kept/looked after grand. Had to purchase a sarong by the entrance which was a bit overpriced...",
          "The temple is really interesting. Balinese Hindus & Buddhist share the cave spot. You can see both worshipers interacting in a very peaceful natural place. Just try to go during lunch time or really early because it gets really crowded with tourists",
          "Visited the temple with my 2 children. There was a local guide and we had to pay about RP50,000 per person. Felt it was a bit expensive as they can just charge per trip instead of per person as the guide is only taking one round to guide all of us.",
          "We engaged the services of local guide who worked within the grounds he was very knowledgable and made our visit much more enjoyable. Beautifully kept gardens",
          "Entry cost is 50k per adult and sarongs ae available at NO cost at the ticket collection point. Worth the visit if you are in the area. With a bit of stair trekking you can climb down from the main temple area into the valley below - very picturesque. We did have a temple",
          "Absolutely amazing and stunning. Take walking trainers and shoes. Not accessible for those with mobility issues as did not see any visible lifts etc.. Went to the resturant after which had a lovely view.",
          "This was a second stop for us on a day tour to ubud. Sarongs are provided on entry for women if required. Before you enter you must walk past the many market stalls with people hassling you to buy however this is very typical of tourist hot spots in Bali. The temple itself is",
          "Our driver encouraged us to visit here and we are glad we did. The cave and temple are really interesting and if you drop down to the jungle/Gardens you are in for a treat. Waterfalls and ponds and a lovely view. There is a market on the way out (exit through the gift shop) but",
          "Gardens are lovely, but many many stairs. An excavated temple with no more repairs, being left as is and new temples built on grounds guide explained history then got pushy for 'donation' of 150000, not mobility impaired friendly nor for small children.",
          "We visited this place several times years ago. Revisited again after an absence of more than 15 years. Amenities are much improved to accommodate the hoards of tourists. It was a pleasant place to walk around.",
          "It was very good. Just be careful of people wanting to show you around and then sting you with a large fee. They are not up front at the beginning. We thought it was included in the cost of entry.",
          "Must visit area when you come to Ubud, beautiful place with lots of history and culture in it. Right to the centre of Ubud, dont miss this area!",
          "Nothing interesting or nice. Ticket price is 50 k idr, but it is not worth to pay. Not worth to go there.",
          "This was a lovely place to end our day out! Our driver went with us & explained the history of the temple. Beautiful gardens & a small waterfall.... We filled our water bottles with holy water",
          "Peacefiull location in a valley waterfall where the remains of a nudist temple and an very old Hindu cave temple can be explored.",
          "The cave itself is just ok, honestly. There are pushy \"guides\" right at the entrance and that almost made me want to leave. The whole experience, however, was nice, spiritual and peaceful.",
          "Perhaps we would have benefited from some kind of explanation about the place. The elephant cave is a meditation cave. You go inside, there are offerings... but I didn\u2019t actually find it that big, so didn\u2019t understand the name. The place is pleasant and lush like many of the",
          "Truly an amazing area steeped in history. Very sacred and has great presence. Try and find a local to explain this area to you.",
          "The cave iwas very tiny and i found the outside more interesting, very hot and full of incense inside",
          "I really wanted to visit an old temple. This one looked interesting. The grounds were beautiful. But I wish there were signs explaining the history or free guides. We paid 50,000 rupiah to enter but then a guide wanted an extra $10-$20 to walk us around explaining things. Still",
          "This temple is much smaller than of of the others in Bali and it requires you to go down a bit of steps to get to it but it was very nice. Theres a rock garden and holy fountains immediately upon entering then you'll the the elephant temple. I was able to get pictures both",
          "If you want some peace and quiet to meditate, this is the perfect place. Pictures don't do justice to this beautiful place. One could spend couple of hours just admiring the old tall trees and the forest like appearance. Would gladly go again.",
          "Goa Gajah or elephant cave temple is a very spiritual place with some excellent architectural features dating back between 700 to 1000 yrs",
          "This is a great temple complex if you have a family and do not want to travel far from Ubud. The parking is easy and the inevitable market is not too annoying and you can easily skip it. Be prepared for a lot of steps but then the complex opens up below you.",
          "The temple has beautiful stone carvings, however not much to see here. The entrance fee is 50k/pax. However, DO NOT say yes to the tour guides inside unless you're willing to pay 150-250k. When they approached us, they did not mention a fee at all, however I noticed a donation",
          "Lovely place to visit. Peaceful surroundings and very interesting buildings and ruins. My daughter and I were on a seven day tour and this was a place visited on our last day with Lucky.",
          "The cave entrance is good. inside there are idols of Ganesha and Shiva. Not a big cave. This is surrounded by a park. There is a small tank near by.",
          "Albeit small, this temple is worth a watch. The temple in itself is not big, its a very small temple with few installations. the surroundings and the greenery around make it worth the visit. The temple is surrounded nice and serene garden which calms people down.",
          "The elephant cave itself was rather small and a 2 minute visit, but theres is lots to see on the grounds it is set upon, like water falls and a holy spring. There is also a priestess that offers blessings for a donation. This property is rather beautiful and we thoroughly",
          "I really enjoyed the Elephant Cave & temple complex. Whilst the cave itself is relatively unremarkable (although the entrance is quite spectacular), the water gardens are worth the walk. It can get hot, so take plenty of water.",
          "We paid the entrance fee and walked down to the cave. It is small inside but was worth the stop. There are nice gardens surrounding the park.",
          "The Goa Gajah or the Elephant cave temple in the gianiyar regency (ubud) is a must visit in Bali. The once lost temple was discovered by the Dutch and the linga statues were marvellous. The artistic entrance and the bathing point were a thing of joy. The temple is serene and the",
          "We got there by 10 and it wasn't too busy....take a long sarong. Pre entrance you will be told that your skirt isn't long enough! Any thing to sell you a sarong.",

          "Very interesting cave. It looks to be an active temple so either bring a sarong or borrow one. There was the sweetest little lady offering blessings at the Buddhist temple, give it a try!",
          "The energy here is powerful! Don\u2019t fall into trap of outside shopkeepers. Women could wear long skirts or dresses, and if not your entrance fee covers a sarong. So don\u2019t buy any!",
          "We visited this temple during our trip to Bali in May. Very nice market on the way out bet don't get cheated as you can get a good price with your bargain skills.",
          "before entering the temple, there are a lot of shops with good quality items. The prices are good just dont forget the bargain for it. The temple is small but the cave and the place is well kept and nice to walk around, though it is not elderly friendly",
          "Very close to town is one of the most beautiful temple within which is situated an ancient cave and really nice walk through the park that lies beneath. I really enjoyed it.",
          "One of the second places we visited in our first week in Bali. It was part of a wider tour and I have reviewed some of the other places as well. The Elephant Cave was a bit disappointing, the carving on the entrance impressive but the actual cave was small and dark and whilst I",
          "Nice place to be in. Be aware of the stairs quite a few to climb. Also bring Sarong it's mandatory. In this one I can't remember if woman with period can go in but most of temples the ladies can't (sorry). Was 60.000 IDR for 2 persons. It's nice to go there you have beautiful",
          "We didn't spend much time here as there wasn't much to see. Just fyi the cave had mice in there but it's beautiful and historic. Don't buy the Suron(cloth you have to around your waist) there will be locals outside bombarding you with them. You will get it for free after you",
          "Fascinating place to walk around and look at the amazing stone carvings, just make sure you read up about it before you go and don't expect any elephants!",
          "Very aggressive sellers at the entrance. The \"guide\" was really hard to shake. Not nearly as interesting as many other temples in the area. They'll lend you a sarong at the entrance, but since we were seeing several temples that day, we brought our own that we found in downtown",
          "Ok, so we had a bit of a bad experience. Right of the bat these two ladies 'attack' us at the parking lot about how we need a sarong to go to the cave, so we bought it for too much money - they will lend it to you at the entrance!! So dont get tricked in to buying! Than the",
          "We spent maybe and hour or a little more here. Best part was the Elephant cave and the sunken garden & waterfall and that's pretty much it. Not overly spectacular.",

          "Goa Gojah is very close to downtown Ubud, making it an easy stop. The temple has stunning carvings and beautiful grounds, and it is well worth taking 20 minutes out of your day for.",
          "The cave was very small and misty and not worth a visit but the park is very beautiful and so we didn't regret the visit.",
          "The cave face is what it\u2019s all about here! It\u2019s 50,000 per person to get in. Take a sarong or wear trousers. There\u2019s a little garden and waterfall in the grounds too which was quite cute.",
          "The minute your driver parks, sarong sellers will descend upon you like vultures. DO NOT BUY A SARONG (unless you really want one and you can get a good deal on it!). They offer sarongs at the entrance to the temple and you can borrow one for the duration of your tour. Be",
          "Nice large temple area, which the cave itself is a part of. You need to go down some stairs to enter the area. The cave is small and is T shaped. The sculpture with the looking man around the entrance is also smaller than we got an impression of looking at pictures. Entrance fee",

          "One of the most beautiful spots in Bali. The cave itself is nothing special but the walk in the area is breathtaking. The stairway to view the vegetation is incredibly beautiful. It is a peaceful retreat with eye candy wherever you look.",
          "One of the \"must see\" places in Ubud. We stopped here after trekking through the rice fields and the water temple. This temple is very unique, but in my opinion, not as impressive as others. Still very interesting to check out. The grounds are beautiful. Lots of stairs!",
          "This place is lovely! It has 3 levels, so make sure you walk around a see everything. It has a really lovely lake and lily pond, very peaceful and tranquil - perfect place to meditate!",
          "Today\u2019s visit to Goa Gajah was outstanding. Words cannot describe it properly. It is a mix of two religions in one spot. Hindu & Buddhism. For the culture buffs, you\u2019ll love it. Also great for photography buffs. One thing I will say though, if you\u2019re coming from the Seminyak,",
          "The most beautiful part of this is the stunning grounds and gardens. The cave was great but the surroundings are a must-see! At the entrance people will try to sell you a sarong saying you need it to go into the temple. Don't be fooled - you get one with your admission. Have fun!",
          "To reach the temple precints one has to walk down flight of steps and even further to reach the lily pond. Very pretty. The cave has nothing but a small ganesh statue. You can walk around and spends sometime.",
          "Very pretty lily pond here. Nice to see from above. Peaceful and quiet. One downside is that there are a bunch of scammers in the parking lot trying to sell you a sarong, but it is not needed. I was wearing long pants and she tried to tell me I still needed it, so I just laughed",
          "It's a worthwhile visit because it's very different from other temples, but it won't take you more than 5 minutes to get the idea, unless you want all the background (guides available by the cave).",
          "While it undoubtedly holds a lot of history there is very little to see in the cave itself. The lush greenery below is far more spectacular.I don't think I would have gone had I known what I know now.",
          "Very interesting place to know more about Hindu gods and their beliefs. The place is quite huge and with many stairs so prepare yourself for a cardio.",
          "I enjoyed this temple. I would recommend that you get a guide to learn about the site. Would have been a lot better i think. You need a sarong, but they have them there to use. Enjoyed the tea and coffee tasting after and relaxed in the space. Very peaceful and beautiful",
          "Very somber. Very peaceful. A beautiful temple. We guided ourselves around, just looking. You can purchase a tour guide, someone local that can share information with you. The layers of the landscape are amazing. You do not need to purchase a sarong! They have them for you,",
          "Great front entrance architecture. Inside you can see Ganesha idle and three lingams. I was told by guide cum driver that these lingams each represents Brahma, Vishnu,shiva and inturn correspons to Air, Water and fire. Nearby you will find one Budha shrine also in a very scenic",
          "One of the temples that must be visited in Bali for sure. There is a lot to see here along with the elephant cave",
          "This was part of an organised trip we took part in as a couple. So one driver and one guide. It's to introduce you to the various cultures of Bali. It included a local dance group, a visit to jewel makers, batik work, furniture and wood calving, plus the rice terrace, volcano",
          "There is a hint of Tivoli in the ponds, steps and gardens, but the temples and Elephant Cave are underwhelming. Nice waterfall, and natural beauty, but you are not missing much.",
          "During my trip to Bali, Elephant Cave or Goa Gajah as it is termed in local dialect came across as a magical place to me what with it's ancient architecture on one hand and plush nature at abundance on the other. This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on",
          "Goa Gojah is one of many temples in Ubud. This one is interesting for its cave and walk around small waterfall and pond. If you are into sacral buildings, do it.",
          "Really interesting temple complex set into beautiful nature with springs and waterfalls running through it. 50k foreigner entry; 30k domestic entry. They provide a sarong for you as part of the ticket price, at the entrance. Very interesting falling large carved rocks. We",
          "Its just another temple as Bali has thousands of it. Only difference is the cave and the icon of elephant",
          "Nice temple, you do need a sarong, if you don't take one with you, they will be waiting for you as soon as you get out of the car, it's a scared temple and very nice to witness, pretty gardens down some stairs/",
          "Goa Gajah Cave is hardly 10-minute drive away from central Ubud. Since this is a religious place, one has to enter it respectfully and sarongs must be used to cover oneself according to traditions. Sarongs are available at the ticket checking point for free (should be returned",

          "The cave itself is cool but the real appeal for us was exploring the grounds around the place, especially the steps that led all the way down to a little waterfall. Lovely. Would have been slightly underwhelmed by the cave alone but the temple as a whole made it more than",
          "The actual elephant cave is no big deal, but the surrounding gardens are fabulous and well worth the stairs. Going down is always easy but the climb up was a work out.",

          "If you're budgeting your time, then don't include this in your itinerary. Nothing much to do here. For me it's a waste of time and sweat since there are uphill walks. You cant enter here if you're wearing shorts (both male and female). But in case you have no choice, there are",
          "It\u2019s a fairly large complex but not so much to see. Lots of steps but that\u2019s usual in ubud! I think an hour is long enough to see the caves some temples and water features.",
          "I have been visited about 6 places in Bali, in my opinion Elephant Cave was just wasting time and money. It was not expensive, about 4$ but nothing interesting you could find there. No special views, the cave inside is so small. The area is also very small.",
          "We really liked the Goa Gajah, it\u2019s not pricey and actually really beautiful. Inside the cave there\u2019s smoke, but the park around them is really good to shoot some awesome photo. Be careful with the locals inside the cave, they are really pushy.",
          "When a friend accompanying us asked to see a temple we expected to be taken to one we had done many times before, this was a very pleasant surprise! You are dropped in the car park by your drivers who generally aren\u2019t allowed down with you. Do not purchase a sarong from the",
          "Cool to visit, beautiful area. We took up an offer for a tour guide waiting by entrance which was quickly regretted and realized a lot he told us wasn\u2019t true. But the actual place is quite interesting !",
          "Too many people go to Ubud for serenity you won't find it there. Overcrowded with man buns neck tattoos and deadlocked women very sad... DON'T GO you might as well stay in Amsterdam",

          "I was nice to see the temple and the cave, but it's really an add on to a day trip and not really destination. We spent no more than an hour there and saw everything there was to see.",
          "It's awesome if it's a stop along the way, or a filler but definitely not worth a far drive. Very small cave, about big enough for 10 people. It's a cool sight but I would rather have spent more time at other sites",
          "well worth a visit, 50 k to get in which is pretty standard everywhere here for the bigger temples. don't worry about legs showing as they all have sarongs you can wear on entrance.",
          "The place is itself beautiful. The cultural fragrance of the site create awesome surrounding. Bad thing is you have to take ticket to visit as it is required at every place in Bali. But yes, if you want to spend day in Ubud then Must visit this temple.",
          "The temple and surrounds were nice but having to walk through a market place to enter and then being ripped off by a local guide was pretty disappointing. When he took us around the back when it came time to pay left me feeling uneasy. The commercialisation of a sacred temple",
          "This is a place with two temples; one Hindu and the other Buddhist. It\u2019s beautiful, surrounded by nature, it\u2019s a must seen in Bali. Entrance is cheap, it\u2019s an outdoors activity, you are going to love it! just don\u2019t forget to cover all your legs",
          "Impressive ancient temple area accessed via a small clean commercial strip offering tourist bric a brac, clothing, t shirts etc and some eateries. Found the temple area intriguing however there was next to no explanatory material or signage detectable. Very inexpensive though",

          "It\u2019s a beautiful sacred place which you should definitely see while in Ubud. There are guides inside offering their service and I do recommend spending a little extra as it\u2019s very interesting to hear about the place, its history and the religious aspects. Our guide also took",
          "Worth the drive and the walk. Many beautiful sites and artifacts you can look at while your there. Make sure that you inside the cave and look at the statue of ganesha.",
          "For a 50k per person entrance fee the place has little to offer. Loads of people trying to sell you stuff, especially Sarong-cloths, which you can actually just borrow at the entrance gate. But wait, it doesn't end there. In the temple grounds, there are more people selling",
          "Nice place to visit . The entrance is amazing... not much to see ma be hire a guide.... but get a bargain in the price",
          "My friend and I arrived on our moped before we had chance to even get off the local ladies on the markets surrounded us insisting we buy sarongs otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be allowed in the temple. This is not true if you have your legs covered you can go in and if not they give you",
          "Over rated a disappointment after visiting Historical location We only stayed 30 minutes A hot journey",
          "Very informative tour not far from Ubud, lots of history, beauty and more interesting when you have a great private guide",
          "This temple area was once buried - and rediscovered/dug up. An enjoyable walk with meandering tracks down to the waterfall and river and through the gardens.",
          "This is a nice old temple that is worth having a look at. There is not a lot to do there and only took me around 1 hour to check out but was worth the visit.",
          "The sanctuary was probably dated from the 11th century Bali Kingdom.The cave was rediscovered by Dutch archaeologists in 1923, but the fountains and bathing pool were not discovered until 1954.The site is mentioned in the Javanese poem Desawarnana written in 1365.The complex",
          "A guide is needed to explain the significance of the many statues but negotiate a lower price than what they are asking. Or do your research ahead of time. They will loan you a sarong for free before you enter. Go out the way you came in or you will run the gauntlet of all the",
          "This place was in my bucket list. I feel so grateful I got to see it. The place is calm and relaxing. The cave in honor of Lord Ganesha is stunning but also the surroundings. There are lots of steps down so be ready to walk.",
          "A place full of statues. The entrance of the cave was amazing. Balinese culture is unique... You must see it.",
          "This place had a beautiful garden round the back and the tree there is absolutely amazing! We went back in 2017! I'd suggest don't listen to all the people outside the place trying to sell you sarong's saying \"You can't go in there without a sarong, buy here!\" NO NO NO! The",
          "Enjoyed my visit to Goa Gajah elephant cave. The cave itself wasn\u2019t much but we loved walking around the garden area and the markets also.",
          "Explored the grounds and checked out the cave. The cave is okay but the view from the gardens is the most interesting part of it. Lots of stairs so not ideal if you can\u2019t move around well. They include the sarong in the price of admission so no need to buy one in the parking",
          "Entry to this temple is 50K, if you've seen temples in other places like Thailand then this is very similar and nothing that you won't have seen before. However if you've not seen a temple before then I would recommend it, it has some lovely rock formations and a cave. The",
          "Not sure why it's called the Elephant Cave - to attract tourists? It's actually a Ganesha Temple on one side and the other side had the Trimurti, Brahma, Vishnu & Shiva in a Linga roopa.",
          "Looking a bit tired since 20 years ago and pestery 'need guide' was irritating until we told them this was our 3rd visit (i.e. \"go away\"). First time in Bali? A \"yes\" (BUT TAKE YOUR OWN SARONG or get 'borrowed' one near where u pay).",
          "YOU DO NOT NEED A SARONG!!!!! As long as you're wearing long pants. We were approached in the parking lot and told we had to buy their sarongs to enter. LIES!!! We didn't buy one....I said I'll rent one because their prices were a joke and BANG no need. If I bought one they",
          "It is hard to imagine the hours it took to carve this out of the mountain and the number of people that have walked on the stone walks which show great wear. If you climb down into the waterfall and look at the back of the fallen stone you can see another carving that broke off",
          "the location is very easy to reach from sat-nav, parking is spacious, entrance fee is cheap, the only problem is lots of steps to get to the venue and i do not see any disabled access. overall visit is pleasant but i think it would be boring for kids.",
          "The caves are beautiful, however the grounds are even more so. give yourself some extra time to explore the grounds.",
          "It was a nice experience but not what was expected. The photographs online are misleading slightly and make it seem more than it is. But maybe our expectations were too high? Also, it was quite expensive for what it was, and although we had a nice time, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily",
          "We had a long day of site seeing around Ubud but we were all pleasantly surprised and glad that we stopped here! Lovely scenery, waterfalls, gardens and architecture! Also there was a lovely coffee shop and restaurant there. I wish that we had time to go to the restaurant but",
          "OK it is not to the expectation. We needs to buy the tickets before entering the elephant cave. If we wants to go inside the cave we needs to wear the sarong not only in this place all temples in ubud. It is better to get our own sarong bcos the sarong they offer to us was very",
          "Go early. Don\u2019t be fooled into buying sarongs by the hawkers in the parking lot. Sarongs are included in the entry fee of 50000IDR. Hire a local guide to truly understand the experience. Make sure you visit the agrotourism tea tasting and coffee tasting in the same grounds.",
          "If you like going to heritage places, do not miss out this cave temple in Ubud. It has a small waterfall and well manicured garden apart from the cave where you need to climb down a few steps",
          "Very nice place with many interesting buildings , the scenery is very beautiful and the place is very calm and relaxing .",
          "Yet another place to visit that needs to be done first thing in the morning. It can become very congested. If your are hunting for the elusive photo shots of the actual temple rather than yourself visit when the temple opens. Otherwise join the long and of people taking selfies",
          "It\u2019s was kind of expensive comparing of what had to offer, it\u2019s just a cave that it\u2019s interesting because of the shape, but it\u2019s pretty small and that\u2019s all you have It\u2019s a bit unclean",
          "One of the most beautiful temple's we saw. The elephant cave itself is not very special but the rest of the buildings are amazing. The nature surrounding the temple is stunning!",
          "The elephant cave is in honour of the elephant-god, Ganesha. the cave was used to meditate and is unimpressive. However, the temple and the grounds are worth seeing and exploring. There are lots of steps down, but if you're willing to walk, you'll be transported to a",
          ". Nice setting but rather unimpressive cave Lots of steps also. Avoid if you have a problem with stairs",
          "A nice pit stop for lunch and they serve delicious local noodles. Everything on the menu is awesome and the right price.",
          "Goa Gajah, the ruins of a temple dedicated to the god Ganesha is well worth the trek down. As many of the temples in Bali, be prepare for a hike down to it, although the pathway is well maintained, not advisable for those with mobility needs. There are guides to help you with",
          "While there are many steps to get down and surrounded by people trying to sell you things, definitely come to this magical local temple. Go inside the cave (which has lights now). The incense is strong but you can see the three areas of offerings to the left right and center.",

          "Very small, indifferently kept grounds, not what I would call enchanting. Ignore any entreaties on entry from an official looking 'guide'. We did not, and after about 8 to 10 minutes of leading us around he became very interested when I opened my wallet. However, he became",
          "Interesting architecture and carvings, a tad run down, needs some maintenance and a bit of a clean up. Be careful of 'helpful' old men in supposed uniforms, they will start talking to you, follow you round and then demand a fee. They get quite stroppy if they think the tip",
          "We visited the Elephant Cave Ubud. The locals will sell you a traditional indonesian robe which must be worn before entering",
          "Short ride from Ubud. Reasonable price 50k per person. Good local guide and well maintained. Worth a visit !",
          "It costs 50k to essentially spend less than 30 minutes at this site. The carved exterior of the cave is impressive, but the inside is relatively bare. The smallish complex is unimpressive if you've been to the other major sites on Bali.",
          "I visited this place with a bunch of friends as it was a part of an organised tour. Had I planned this day myself, I would\u2019ve probably skipped going here. A tip - you\u2019ll need to cover your legs in case they are bare and visible (eg if you\u2019re wearing shorts or a skirt)",
          "Accessible steps down slope to the temple compound itself. Ticket is slightly pricier. The compound consist of a small cave and multiple small shrines of worship and guides would approach you if you are interested to know more about the history of the temple. They are not pushy",

          "We visited this during the off season and were lucky enough to get a few minutes without anyone else around! The site isn't extensive by any means (you could visit in 15 minutes) but the art on the outside is so detailed it's worth it! Go as part of a day tour and expect a quick",
          "Goa Gajah was significant archeological site, this in itself is worth going to see. But the tourist traps surrounding the whole thing makes it not that attractive. You have to walk through tonnes of shops trying to sell souvenirs. As soon as we came off the taxi the sarong",

          "We thoroughly enjoyed our stop off here. Beautiful gardens, caves, spring waters and waterfalls. Entrance fee is 50,000idr with free sarong if needed. Lost of tourist stalls selling batik prints. Plenty of restrooms and a great little cafe. Extremely peaceful and serene.",
          "I went to this cave and temple with my guide. The grounds were beautiful and the cave was used in the past for meditation by students and royal family members.",
          "Studying this online and in history books was more interesting. Always take friends here, but disappointing it is now 50.000 entry for so little. Annoying sellers and guides.",
          "Driving into the car park, you will be greeted by many smiling women selling total fake junk in the car park, they will even try to guide you in to a space, just to try to sell you something, even telling you that you need a sarong and sash to enter temple, but thats total lies,",
          "Was 15k now 50k not much to see, no info available instead tour guide charge for info not worth the hike",
          "Reading previous TA comments, I'm surprised that people who whinge at paying a couple of bucks for learning about another religion and culture. Our driver was Hindu so was able to explain about the different roles and gods. There is also a Buddhist temple near by. My only gripe",
          "There are so many temples in and around ubud, don\u2019t waste your money on this one. It\u2019s a cave and a kind of pool set into the ground. The gardens around it are ok, but 45 minutes will do it. We were much more impressed with the lotus gardens and temple in central ubud, no",
          "This temple provides much more to see than many of the other temples we visited in Bali. The elephant cave is very unique, and there is even the ruins of an old Buddhist temple to see. There is very good energy at this temple",
          "We saw so many pictures of that place and it was one of our priorities but honestly it did not something really special..the ticket was 50.000 rp just to see a cave with a temple inside but really we were not impressed at all as we have seen much more amazing places in Bali .",
          "Nice experience visiting the Goa Gaya temple. The temple is located in a small cave and its a beautiful enriching experience to walk along the grounds of the temple. One must wear a sarong while entering the temple. It is provided free of charge just at the entrance, do not buy",
          "It's a great and short visit to learn about the cave, culture and history of it. If you can make time, you should visit. It really only takes less than one hour to do the whole thing. The cave itself is small. There would be a tour guide that explains everything about the cave.",
          "Great waterfalls, few crowds, great spots for photographs. Don\u2019t buy a sarong outside, they lend them to you at the gate",
          "I believe that was one of the wrong destinations in Bali. With all respect of having g this temple since 11 century there is nothing to see inside and it is left unattended by any staff to guid you or help you! Even I couldn\u2019t find a garbage \ud83d\uddd1 to through the used bottle of",
          "Part of a tour we took. It\u2019s ok for a visit if you have someone explaining the history if not, you are just walking around aimlessly.",
          "Pointless, dirty and quite boring. It's an empty cave with no explanation and a nice entrance where everyone stops for a picture. Next to it is a putrid pool with some fish. That's it. Definitely not worth the trip.",
          "Elephant Cave is a tourist place in Ubud area. From the city center only 15 to 20 minutes. Many can be seen in the elephant cave place. In addition there are historical relics, holy water and historical sculptures that can still be seen. The elephant cave is very famous in Bali.",
          "The elephant cave or the Goa Gajah is a temple cave. You are required to wear a sarong to visit this temple. The main deities inside the cave are Ganesha and Trilinga. The story is also quite interesting. Do avoid climbing down to the ponds within the complex as the stairs are",
          "This temple has some green space and trees. By far the highlight of our visit was seeing some really huge spiders that we managed to get brilliant photos of as they were in webs right beside the path. We also saw a snake moving through the bushes and across the path so we were",
          "You pay 50k as entrance but there\u2019s nothing to visit. Just a cave with the elephant statue and lots of greenish view a, a lot to walk. It\u2019s like you are in the forest. Not recommended",
          "Too expensive. We have not entered because the abusive prices for tourists do nothing but increase: 50,000 IDR. There were many more tourists who turned around without entering. You will also find sarong vendors at the entrance who will try to sell them for a price 5 times more",
          "We were a group of 7 adults visiting this ~15th century temple. It cost 15000 rupiah to enter - which includes the loan sarong required to enter the temple. DO NOT purchase a sarong before from the numerous sellers unless you want one - but they will try to convince you you",
          "You meet the past, because the temple is very old. It is a mixture of Hinduism and Buddhism. The cave is very small and the interior is interesting. You can see where the monks were sitting. The nature is beautiful and the garden is very nice. You must wear the sarong, which you",
          "Nice place to visit but only if you have time to spend or if you are in the way to or from Pura Tirta Empul. I was quite lucky that there was a local celebrating in those days.",
          "The pictures look 100x better than it does in real life. Not much do see, and also a little out of the way from anything else of interest. As usual, they try peddling sarongs before you go into the temple trying to tell you you need it or you can\u2019t go in (temples in Indonesia",
          "The place itself is beautiful and it\u2019s worth a visit but you will definitely need a guide to show you around they have absolutely no signs or information on site so you have no idea what you\u2019re looking at (no historical context given). Definitely GET YOUR OWN GUIDE!! A man",
          "Three options for this venue, super quick, 30minutes, leisurely. Super quick arrive take a few photos and leave. 30minutes. Listen to a guide as they explain the history, including their own families story and beliefs. Leisurely. Make the most of the extensive site and also",
          "Inside the temple there is not much to see but the exterior is very pleasant to look at and surrounding garden is nicer to visit.",
          "Nothing to see, very small place, we left after 5-10mins. Not worth going to see it. Entry fee $50,000",
          "There is nothing worth to see there, I want my 50.000 rupiah back. Please dont waste your time with here.",
          "We did not design to visit temples, but with our local guide used this as an opportunity to understand the Hindu religion a little more and the reason behind the different parts of the building and displays. Lovely setting, especially below the main temple area near the water",
          "Quite interesting if you like the historical side of Bali. The gardens are beautiful. You will get a guide hassling you to take you around but we opted out and just walked ourselves. The stonework is typical of the area ,there\u2019s a small waterfall at the bottom, entry fee is 50k",
          "Firstly, it's worth pointing out that I am a tourist, with absolutely no religious or spiritual beliefs, but truly appreciate places of history, beauty and culture. So it's safe to say, I was pretty excited about visiting here... however; This wasn't a great hour spent in Ubud.",
          "We visited the elephant cave during our day trip in Ubud, but I must say, it wasn't that impressive..",
          "very interesting and beautiful things to look at cave only small but good to see. must weat a saronv when visiting the cave.",
          "We were so disappointed with this experience. 50k entrance fee per person, endless harassment by locals selling things, tour guides following you around trying to get your money, and a 2k parking exit fee on top. A sacred temple that peddles Bintang and plastic souvenirs? Give",
          "The main attraction of this temple is the cave. There are also small green areas where you can have a nice walk but nothing spectacular. Be aware that a saroung will be given to you at the entrance for free, you do not need to buy one from the sellers. This is a touristic place,",
          "This beautiful and spiritual place with you have to visit if you are in Bali! They borrow you sarong if you have not, you sont have to buy some - we did buy bcz they told as we have to :)))",
          "This was an experience we are glad we had on a day trip to Ubud. From the top entrance we had no idea such a beautiful valley awaited. The Caves were interesting, but it was the overall site with it's ceremonial ponds and range of temples that impressed. All set deep down in",
          "While the Cave is okay the ponds and the site down the stairs were quite interesting. You can enjoy drinking young coconut while sitting on a warung at the elevated surface and looking down to the Lilly ponds and waterfalls beneath you.",
          "Visited here last week with friends. Entrance ticket is IDR 15.000 (today is around USD 1) but I\u2019m not sure if the price is same for foreigner. View from top was so wonderful. There\u2019s a photo spot just near the ticket checking station. Go down through stairs and you will get to",
          "I didn\u2019t find this particularly interesting and definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend it. The gardens below are nice, but that\u2019s about it.",
          "well don't get confused with the name.there's a very small cave inside which nothing to see.but the surroundings of the temple is picturesque. you can keep it in your list if u've much time. otherwise you can skip it without any hesitation.",
          "Not much activities inside but worth the picture of some ancient structures. Need to wear a sarong when going in. Got entrance fee. Maximize your time posing at the cave entrance as tourist can go in and out of the cave.",
          "The cave itself is very small and doesn't have much to see inside but the garden is beautiful. There's a small waterfall, a lot of old and tall trees, it's very nice. Do not recommend to go there by foot because it's a one-hour-walk from Ubud center, the traffic is heavy and",
          "We went during a ceremony set up, the cave is very beautiful as is the waterfall. They have sarongs for you to use.",
          "Just sleep and skip on it , one of worst things in Bali! It s just a waste of money and time. Nothing interesting",
          "A nice place by itself but it suffere the comparison with other temples that we visited that were less crowded, as beautiful and felt less touristic. It is a nice thing to do but not a must do",
          "Nothing much to see. But it was cheap to enter. 15000 rupiah. Very hot with no shelter. Quite a number of shops in the complex. By a busy road. The cave has three alters inside. There's a mini water fall too.",
          "Super Zen spot for a peaceful moment. You can combine the trip with a nice visit to the rice field and a coffee farm. The temples reflect the traditional Balinese worship culture surrounded of incredible ferns and vegetation.",
          "Not much to see!with the same amount of money you can choose to do something better. Not much of a history,just a smal cave which I think it\u2019s man made (new) and nothing alse to See :/",
          "Goa Gajah is best known for its ancient caves that have a carved stone that are distinctively recognizable as being elephant shaped, located in west side of Bedulu countryside, BlahBatuh Sub district and Gianyar Regency. It is about 27 km from Denpasar town. This cave is built",
          "We visited this place as part of a tour we had in ubud but in all honesty it\u2019s not the most memorable place. Not an awful lot to see or do. Go if it\u2019s part of a tour but don\u2019t make a special trip to go",
          "A few stairs. Get the blessing. Everyone must wear a sarong to cover legs. Go early to beat the heat and the crowds.",
          "The place is nothing special, very dirty and seems abandoned. I couldn't stay for too long, very bad energy!",
          "This cave it wasnt a cave like you imagine... But this more looked like a temple that people pray here... The atmosphere is nice with a nature sounds.. If you looking for adventure cave this is not a good place for you... But if looking for spiritual temple this is a good place",
          "It's nice to see, but nothing special. A lot of turist and very dirty. But it is a lot of Balu history there.",
          "Temple is allright. There are many nicer places. Never buy the sarong at the parking lot from the crazy women\u2019s approaching you. We saw many tourist believing those women that you have to rent it from them, but it is some sort of scam, you will get a sarong at the entrance with",
          "We saw a lot of temples during our trip to Bali, and this one was not very exciting. It was pretty dirty overall and there wasn\u2019t much to look at. There are so many other temples worth visiting.",
          "The gardens are really stunning ,beautiful , the cave it's just fine the artwork though is impressive ,must wear saron like any other sacred place and also there is entrance and parking fee",
          "This cave is really just a small cave that you walk into for 1 minute and turn around to exit. It's also very humid/hot inside. The surrounding area might be better at different times but when we went, it looked like they were setting up for an event or taking down an event.",
          "Unfortunately this was our last temple visited on a big day out so it had a lot to compete with. The elephant cave itself was slightly underwhelming but the waterfall and gardens at the Buddah temple were lovely and uncrowded. If you are on limited time then skip this in favour",
          "We missed a big special celebration event by a few days but still a lot of incredible devotional artwork remaining on display. It's worth a visit at anytime.",
          "We had high expectations for the place, but impressions went to the river and waterfall in Buda Temple part and also to coffee place on the way out. Though, entrance to the Elephant temple itself and few surrounding buildings is impressive. Expect heavy pressure to buy Sarong",
          "We visited here on one of our tour trips around Ubud! We had a few friends that said we could just go here ourselves however with the tour guide it made the whole experience much more worth while! They had just finished the 30year celebration which meant there was a lot of",
          "Crowded tiny cave. Fortunately its not even the most interesting part of the temple. I liked the Buddhist gardens even more.",
          "We just left the goa Gajah. Amazing temple. We were told that the Ganesh statue is believed to be the first Holy statue in Bali. It\u2019s over 4000 years old. And the broken Buddha statue after the earthquake in the river is remarkable. The tourists lining up to be blessed just to",
          "Aside from the interesting temple entrance carved on the side of the mountain, everything else was very underwhelming. The actual cave was small and smelled bad. The temple grounds are very generic too. Not really worth your time.",
          "ita not worthed at all to go here. there's nothing inside this cave. i really dont recommend this place",
          "We were the first in thankfully. The main cave is pretty cool. I think the rest of it would be more interest with a guide or if something is going on. We got blessed and fleeced by a Buddhist who pocketed our offering when he thought we had gone. But for 50c ani didn\u2019t really",
          "Our guide took us to several temples and we found this one the least beautiful one. The cave itself is not that big as we thought.",
          "Little temple complex. The carved stone entrance to the cave is quite interesting but inside it\u2019s just a regular cave. There is a water fountains near by. You have to take stairs down there. There are some old trees, more than 100 years old. It is a very calm place. Did not",
          "We had a nice walk around the area and got some good photos. There is lots of greenery and some interesting buildings. The cave itself is very small and you will only spend a few minutes there. We went when they were creating lots of offerings, the meant lots of rotting meat",

          "The elephant cave is highly recommended by any tour guide but the truth is that the whole experience is underwhelming. Whilst the gardens are beautiful and should be explored, the cave itself is tiny and not worth all the trouble.",
          "Wasn't that impressed with this temple. This is the fourth we have visited and the others have been much more impressive. The cave is small and full of incense which made it difficult to breathe. We walked around to the back of the temple where there was a lot of rubbish which",
          "Small sanctuary with not so much to see. I really expected more when I arrived. Nevertheless, if you are in the area, spend some 10 minutes to check it! You do not need more time than that, I believe.",

          "Another nice and quiet temple not far from Ubud. We went early and the temple was not too crowded, although I imagine that it may get crazy judging by the sheer number of stalls selling souvenirs.",
          "With a ceremony is it more interesting. You can see nice handmade spiritual decoration and learn about the Indonesian history. Take a guide for good information. There is a wonderful old tree with big roots at the outside.",

          "The cave temple itself is very unusual from the inside and interesting to see. It\u2019s very small though. From the outside, it\u2019s hard to see its full sight due to stall sellers either side. The rest of the grounds are pretty with ponds and waterfalls.",

          "The first temple I went to because it is close to Ubud and one of the more famous ones. A good start to a trip visiting very many Hindu temples. Distinct for its cave. While not much remains inside, it is still used by locals for worship and hence, good for a visit.",
          "We went to see this on a ceremony day so it was very busy and everything had been dressed up and there were lots of offerings everywhere so we didn't see the place in its entirety but it was lovely. Lots of history and well worth the visit. Go and see the holy water while you",
          "Its like a scenery from indiana jones movie a temple outside ubud town. We were lucky enough to be there in the middle of a ceremony. A lot of offerings and ppl with traditional clothing. We took our sarongs outside the temple. One of the best temples in Bali",
          "The entrance price is over the top for such a small cave and temple area which offers not much. I reckon other temples will be more worth the visit. We spend 30 min here. Also the cooking of (offering) food creates a bag smell, park does not get cleaned as plastic rubbish is",

Festivities were occuring when we went which was cool. One hour was a perfect amount of time. Pro tip. Don\u2019t get",

Some lovey temples and glad we saw it, but if I\u2019m honest If you don\u2019t go, then you won\u2019t really be the end of ur world!",

          "Boring small cave, more like a place for locals and not tourists. Skip it as there is really nothing interesting. If you have to, be sure to dress up appropriately, otherwise you need to wrap yourself in one of their sarongs which they prob did not wash for weeks.",

          "Good to see but not essential. Caves boring but the walk down to the waterfall etc is very nice. Go to the hidden temple for a blessing!",

          "I still don't understand why we stopped there to visit. Looks okay but have seen hundreds of temples in Bali that are nicer and more interesting. The location looks alright but the bottom of the waterfall was full of plastic and dirt...surprise surprise. Not worth the trip",

          "If you are tight for time, I suggest skip this one. Though it's near Ubud town itself, the place is not worth visiting unless you have nothing better to do. The place has so many shops (inside and out) that it kinda ruins the whole spiritual feeling of the place. You want a",
          "Elephant cave was smaller than we thought, but still interesting. We had an ad hoc tour guide by one of the grounds keeper who led us around the area and in the cave. By the end of it, he put out his hand for a donation which we happily gave ($5) and then proceeded to ask \"is",

It is beautiful and you can get awesome pictures out of here but if you\u2019re traveling solo and not into taking pictures, might want to rethink this. Cave was small and I was expecting more but I didn\u2019t read much before I came. I",
          "Just another temple. The carving in the rock was cool and the place had a nice vibe but really there\u2019s not much going on here. A tiny cave you can pop into, a small pond you can pose next to. Average.",
          "Visiting so many temples in Bali one may get confused which one is which. But this one is different - the elephant which does not look like elephant at all is caved in the rock. You get inside into the small claustrophobic room where monks were deditating.",
          "Lots of people selling sarong outside the temple but sarong is included in the entrance fees. Pay the parking fees when you exit the temple. Make sure you walk around the temple after you entering the cave. There's something else!",

          "It's a nice and peaceful place. I am a Hindu so I can relate to the temple religiously as well. But it's a calm and serene environment with waterfalls and greens to enrich your experience. The ticket cost includes the sarong which they will provide at the entrance so don't",

          "If you are visiting Bali, you will soon realize that although most temples are very nice, they are very alike. The Elephant Cave is, however, very different. The cave itself is short. There is not a lot of detail inside the cave, but there is an amazing sculpture surrounding",
          "As carved caves go, this one is a tremendous let down. The surroundings are full of street shops and small eateries which is typical of any tourist spot. The exterior of the cave is decorative but quite newly done, so does not appear charming. The inside has one idol of",
          "The many stalls out the front of the cave insist you need a sarong which is true, but they do provide one for free. This is a beautiful little collection of temples pools and caves. Worth a visit if you\u2019ve time to spare.",

          "Goa Gajah or Elephant Cave. The cave and the temple is very pleasant. The excavated sites gives you a chill. The greenery is just stunning. The silence disturbed only by chirping birds and the wind tring to make its way through the trees - \u2026",
          "Not much to see. It could be nice if not all the garbage and kiosks. Nice pool with flowers, cave itself is very small and uninteresting.",
          "I understand this place has huge religious significance, but if you're just here for the photos, it's, O.K. the cave itself is very small and there's not much to explore. Keep that in mind before you go.",
          "A beautiful temple with stone carvings of the Hindu gods surrounded by thick green lush trees ..Goa gajah meaning the elephant cave ..",
          "Definitely worth seeing and snapping some memorably pictures. A few tips, don\u2019t buy the sarongs the lady will try to force you to buy in the parking lot as you are getting dropped off, or outside of there temples. Also, there are locals that will pretend to be giving you free information and then expect money, so just a heads up.",
          "Beautiful location, however very small place to visit. Locals will float around and try to give you information then demand money for service. \nWould be such a beautiful place if you could enjoy without harassment",
          "Worth visiting, nice garden. Don\u2019t talk to women offering you sarong at the parking. They will offer to rent it while you can get free ones with the ticket.",
          "A historical place for Hinduism and Buddhist. When you come here, there will be a lot of people offering you sarongs to buy at the parking area. Actually, you dont need it, since they provide it inside for free. Entrance ticket is 30.000 rupiahs for domestic and 50.000 for foreign tourist. Come and feel the sensation \ud83d\ude0a",
          "I thought this place was pretty neat with all the historical things like the cave, temples and more. It\u2019s worth the stop if you appreciate history.",
          "Actually two temples. Hindu and Buddhist. Very interesting conversation with a person who checked tickets about God, bielievs, history of place, excavations and meditation. Very mystic place worth to visit when it's getting dark for it's atmosphere.",
          "This is a very spiritual place for the local people and therefore you have to wear a sarong before entering. It is a good experience and well worth the visit if you have come to bali for a sightseeing holiday! Especially interesting if you \u2026",
          "I love the wild nature along the path to buddha temple. Manicured landscape is fine but this place has such atmosphere. I could live here.",
          "When you go down stairs you see this statues pouring water so you can get good picture .. then on your left you see these big face where you enter  a small cave throughout the mouth of statue.\nThen after you finish its very small inside .. \u2026",
          "Aggressive sellers with very sneaky ways of selling which totally ruins the atmosphere of what can be a really nice temple/garden. Avoid sellers, parking, and \u2019friendly\u2019 guides unless you want a guide and you might enjoy. These things will eventually ruin Bali's good reputation, what a pity.",
          "The place is nice, beautiful piece on nature. The cave itself is quite small. Entrance is full of shops and the sellers are like flies trying to bite a bit of you. They force you to buy a scarf, which is provided free at the entrance. All of them sell the same cheap looking stuff and wonder why we are not excited :)",
          "I Looooooove it...... >w<\nu have to have great stamina.. soo many stairs.. there r hindu n budha (gotta go aaall d way down there hehe) in one place.. niiice...\nOverall i like it, will luv to go back there again ^^",
          "A bit expensive, but it's a really quiet place where you can find a waterfall, a Buddhist temple and an Hindu temple.\n\nSarong rental is included in the ticket.\n\nA lot of guide near the entrance will try to explain the place to you (paid \u2026",
          "Not really impressed with this place. Before you even park the scooter you have people heckling you. The whole entrance way people trying to get you to buy sarongs (they are given to you to borrow for free with the entrance ticket). People \u2026",
          "Mind blowing tourist spot",
          "Must visit place to take some nice pictures. Temples here are beautiful. There is a Shiva temple in the cave.",
          "It was alright, the temple inside the cave was way smaller then we expected. There was not really anything to do. The waterfall was a nice sight, they should clean it from plastic rubbish though.",
          "Nice but very touristy. Probably best in low season, people were waiting to take photographs at various spots. Very pleasant walk from the main cave to a Buddhist temple.",
          "Remarkable cave which was apparently discovered and excavated in the 1920s, with the fountains being found later in the 1950s. The inside of the cave itself is small and might disappoint newcomers. The entrance fee here is quite expensive as compared to other temples.",
          "It was a beautiful place surrounded by nature... Sound of water flowing takes you to a meditated state... Good place to sit and relax...  Nothing marvelous just nature...",
          "Amazing! If you want to know more about Goa Gajah, accept assistance from a guide in the temple, ours was Wayan. Very knowledgeable, he told us a lot about the history of the place and showed us around. It's a special kind of place, we enjoyed visiting it.",
          "Small place with good tourist attraction, though very small area to roam around. Clean and calm. It's just an optional place if you are on a day tour in Bali.",
          "A small temple complex with a shrine inside a little cave. Presumably, the shrine is devoted to Ganesh. \n\nThe campus extends at the back into a quiet, cool area with a stream, a little bridge and a lotus pond.",
          "Beautiful and peaceful place to just sit and enjoy \ud83d\ude4f",
          "Was interesting  but not a lot to see.  Vendors in this area are great for haggling  and the variety  if what they sale.  Also caution as there are alot of stairs",
          "A wonderful Historical place. Would definitely suggest to hire a local guide, so that you get to know the century old history of the temples. I hired one, and got to know how thousands years ago, Buddhism and Hinduism came to the island, \u2026",
          "Its rare that you know ,deep down, that the place you're visiting will be the worst thing you do on whilst on your extended travels...\n\nThis experience was!\n\nAt one stage i felt I would have been better off looking for the cameras of the \u2026",
          "You will spend around 60 minutes. Steps down and up are not demanding. There a sense of peace to the location, a lot of positive vibes. Ancient cave with a story, why is it called the Elephant cave. If you walk all the way down, you will reach the river side.",
          "Can spend some time here but after visiting the Monkey Forest doesn't seem very appealing. Overpriced (50k per person) for the experience they offer.",
          "Nice place to visit, quite interesting history dating back 1000years ago! Rather quick to do though. Got offered a guided tour by the son of one of the seller in the temple for 30K Rp. Did a good job on the explanation with a good English, gave him 50K Rp. \nNot a must do but fairly close to Ubud",
          "I visited Goa Gajah 3 years ago and visited it one more time early of this year. But i forgot about the women on period are prohibited to enter.\nFortunately, Goa Gajah now offers Goa Gajah Swing and it's worth to try. It has jungle view and \u2026",
          "This place resides in the pristine and beautiful Bali. Goa Gajah is a place where mainly Ganesha is worshiped. The scenic beauty of this place behold every tourists eyes.",
          "This area is a must stop for a tourist. there are local tour guides to provide history and etiquette for the this temple.  Very beautiful and worthwhile.  You do need to cover your lower body, so a sarong is provided, but you can negotiate some good deals on some nice items on the way in. Start at 50% of asking price.",
          "Great experience, we went with a guide who was very knowledgeable which made the experience much better. Make sure you go to the Buddhist side of the temple area as well as the main one with the cave and purification springs.",
          "Historic cave of bali",
          "It's a nice place for a quick stop. But they try to get money out if you in every corner. Bring your own scarf to cover your legs otherwise you have to pay 200.000IDR. and don't answer the guys that want to tell you some stuff about the \u2026",
          "The only thing u can find here is \"elephent cave\", nothing more. U even need to give donation and its quite expensive. I think u need a guide if u want to visit here so at least u will know history behind the cave.",
          "beautiful, but crowded with tourists. long stair to walk up and down for a couple opportune photos",
          "Interesting and picturesque temple between nature and loud city. But area small and doesn't cost 50k for entrance.",
          "This was just a stop on part of a tour. Only thing cool about it is the cave which is super stuffy with candles and incense. Not worth the admission fee. You'll be in and out in 5 minutes.",
          "I like the place BUT be careful. Some traders tried to sell us sarong. And after we refused they rented for 30 kRp per 2 sarongs. You can rent for free inside the temple. \n\nTemple entrance fee is 50 for adults foreigners, and 30 for locals. \u2026",
          "Nice place for temple visit. They have Hindu temple and Buddha temple togather. Nice cool place and very peaceful.",
          "Historical place of Goa Gajah, dated back from 11th century. I have been here many time with our clients. Love this place so much",
          "Lovely place without too many other tourists. Peaceful surroundings and the cave itself is impressive. Really enjoyed it but we were with our own guide / driver so super easy.",
          "Cool energy here. Lovely scenery.  There was a lovely old lady doing rice blessings at the top. \nThe market here was a bit grabby but worth a look. If you don't have a temple sarong,  you can buy one at the market on the way in.\nThe cave was quite smokey with incense when we went, but that added to the ambiance.",
          "It was fair. Not a huge cave at all. Close to town so worth a quick visit.",
          "Beautiful place to visit. Be sure to go down the stairs after the cave, so many waterfalls to see.",
          "Starting from a parking place,  you can spot an elephant statue nearby. Walking down the path after purchasing the ticket fee, you need to wear sarong provided to cover ankles.  Then a walking down the stairs,  you get to see a moldy green \u2026",
          "If it s on your way, why not to stop and go, but you can find a lot of more beautiful and interesting places in Bali. Entry fee is 50000 for foreigner and 30000 for local. Use your money for better places.",
          "The inside of the temple is small and usually has trails of white smoke from the incense burning. Visitors wearing shorts will be issued a sarong to tie around the waist before entering the courtyard. The complex also contains 7 statues of women (out of which 1 has been destroyed due to an earthquake)",
          "Wonderful opportunity to see some beautiful architecture and wear a Sarong. Beautiful locations and walk.",
          "Good temple place to visit where shiva and Ganesh exists. As it is Hindu temple. It\u2019s close to Ubud, you can plan it in vicinity of your time left.",
          "Beautiful and peaceful place on the outskirts of ubud.  The actual cave is fairly small but worth a visit for the greenery and for the beauty",
          "A nice little place to visit. Approx. 30 minutes. Nice scenary and settings",
          "Good place, clean, but not much to see or explore and the place not really big. Menstruation woman is not allowed to enter",
          "The Goa Gajah with lot of history, but it's not much education other than the cave.\nThe cave itself is very dark and short, not much to see inside and only spent you few minutes.  But the garden here is great and beautiful, and I like here with a pavilion right inside the pool, and it give you comfortable feeling, good place to rest",
          "So peacefull. Love having a coffee in the little cafe above.",
          "Most of the temples I visited were just tourist traps and contained no sacred energy. However this cave was different. The lingams inside still contained energy. If you want to experience divinity go to nature, the temples are dead.",
          "Outside area is more special than the inside of the cave. Worth visiting. Don't get scammed by people offering you to be your guide for free as they are not for free",
          "Goa Gajah is a beautiful temple in Ubud. Please make sure your legs are covered. You do get free sarongs at the entrance so you don\u2019t need to buy one. There is an entry fee for the temple you can look it up. You have to climb down a lot of \u2026",
          "This deceivingly good location offers the draw card small cave, yet plenty of other things to see including the temple and fallen buddha statue near the flowing creek below.",
          "The architecture and the art also seems quite spartan compared to religious sights elsewhere in the world. There are some nice spots down below to take pictures. Avoidable even if you are in Ubud.",
          "Not that good. All statues is missing. Be careful with local people's  on the temple they will not say the rate until the end its better not to talk to them as 1st.",
          "If you have extra spare time, yeah you can go for it as this temple is not too far from Ubud center. It is one of a few temples in Bali which allows you to come and see what is inside the temple despite being non- religious. Ticket is 50k each but I must admit there is not much to see though.",
          "Beautiful place with the spirit. We enjoyed the most nature around - old trees, flowers and roads between rocks. Dont forget visit Buddha restaurant there. Good prices and tasty food.",
          "Amazing temple with such deep history. We had a guided tour (50k) which really added to the experience. A wonder of the world and an interesting piece in the puzzle of Hinduism in Bali",
          "Was recommended by our local taxi driver. So went inside to visit. Tickets cost 50,000 IDR to go inside.\n\nThe cave inside is very small. But very remarkable seeing the level of detail outside. There is also a garden which you can walk down \u2026",
          "The place looks okay and historical. However the first impression was like a left out old palace with zero attention. Did not feel like (may be it is) it is no longer used for any actual religious place. May be authorities will bring it up live. Nature once you enter walking trails was majestic. Very beautiful!",
          "Nice place, the water fall below is beautiful but be ready to climb lots of stairs. Basic facilities good shopping options",
          "This place situated in Ubud. I was bit disappointed after visiting this place as this place has only one cave to offer. There are so many other places around which deserves your time than this. You need to climb down more than 100 steps to reach here just to see this one cave.",
          "Nice history to the place. Age old statues and caves. Nice location to click pictures!",
          "Yup 50K rupiah charge for sarong use. There really isn't much to see here. The outside of the \"Elephant Cave\" is the biggest attraction, nothing really to see inside where you find a few places for offerings. The walkway from the parking \u2026",
          "Good old temple with Ganesha diety. There is a small water fall. Shopping places at the entrance. Holy shrine. Relaxing place.",
          "If you like religious cultural sites, this place is for you. As described, it is an ancient hindu site dating back to the 9th century and there are lovely temples and even a holy bath, but the pesky \u201cindependent\u201d tour guides here made me \u2026",
          "Having been a few times, this was the first time I discovered you can get a free one at the start of the stairs down into the actual temple.\n\nWith the saving, put towards a guide and you will get a much better understanding of the history \u2026",
          "50k is too much for the poor experience, definitely not wordy. Probably for 20k",
          "Good place...and swing staff is very good and cooperative",
          "Too many step lead8ng down to temple , but very nice",
          "Happy I went for the photos of the cave because it looks like it\u2019s out of Aladdin but not my favourite activity. It\u2019s quite small and can get very crowded.",
          "Nice Temple must see....don't buy sarries at the gate...they are for free like dit every Temple at the entrance",
          "Nice place, but yet again filled with tourists and nothing much to see. The Cave gives a better picture background. As Indonesians are very strict about their temple and culture none of the worshiping places allow tourists to enter. So \u2026",
          "There are pond and waterfall. You need to walk towards right hand side. Its quiet downhill. If you don't get a guide for IDR200,000 then no one will let you know about this.",
          "A good place to try kopi luvak. The also provide various flavours of coffee and tea. Its a good place to buy coffe packets as souvenir or gifts to take back home. The place also has a small sky swing. Good place to make a stop if you are travelling to Ubud.",
          "For Indians this place is ok ok only because we get so many temples in India itself and we keep visiting such places very frequently. There are 70-80 steps to get down.",
          "It is interesting and has its notable elements but it is another tourist trap. On top of the entry fee are \u201cguides\u201d who are rather earnest in their pitch to earn your money. Given that Bali\u2019s main economic engine is tourism, this is \u2026",
          "Quite beautiful, but small. Can be visited in 20 minutes. If you manage to avoid large groups of tourists, it's peaceful but otherwise slightly crowded.",
          "The place was all right, not sure why they charge 5$ to enter.\nthere is a secret pathway at the end of the buddist temple that will take you to a place they call \"panorama\". we went with a guide, possible to go on your own but i wouldn't suggest it.",
          "If you visit this place, you will not only got to see the small cave but also parks, pond and small temple. \nPrepare yourself to go down and climb many stairs. There's Buddha temple too. \nWhen I got there, a woman dressed in Balinese Kebaya guide me to pray in front of the Buddha and give me blessing. \nNice experience.",
          "Nice temple and little hike by the river to the Buddhist temple. You will also find little waterfall and snacks sellers. Note: don\u2019t buy saru on the way to temple - they will try to fool you, but you are getting it for free in the temple.",
          "Mesmerised with its natural habitat..Goa Gajah is a blissful, cultural place with Ganesha idols and caves. Take holy bath in small pond.",
          "The temple is very scenic. History about it is very fascinating but unfortunately lots of people want sell everything even inside the temple and this is very annoying.",
          "More information needs to be provided about the history of the place and proper directions.",
          "Holy place with amazing sculptures.\n\nMake sure you take pictures and read about that place before you go to avoid getting scammed by people who are trying to sell you information for money.\n\nIt\u2019s a holy place with amazing nature.\n\nBuddha tree was beautiful to witness the details on the roots.\n\nEnjoy fellas.",
          "Good place for an hour visit. After that, u'll get bored. This is basically a temple",
          "Really nice place to visit. Great history, photos and views. The entrance was perfect and we did not wait long to get in. Highly recommended when in Bali",
          "The monuments were beautiful but the price for entrance was a bid expensive, and it feels as if the saron was not really needed, they said you MUST wear one, but when we went into the the temples halfe of the tourist did not wear one and \u2026",
          "A really nice place to visit during your trip to Bali",
          "Nice Temple, you can go inside.",
          "Beautiful temple, come earlier in the morning to really enjoy the quiet atmosphere",
          "Great temple with very nice gardens!",
          "Historical & nice place",
          "Cave is quite stuffy and misty but the real treat is its surroundings. We loved our visit here to see all the old architecture as well as the natural surroundings. It was popular but not too many people when we visited. We especially liked \u2026",
          "The Temple is nice and has a rich history. The Elephant cave and some parts of the temple is great for pictures and the morning light makes everything so serene. We arrived first thing in the morning, so we were the only ones around. Too \u2026",
          "Definitely a nice spot to visit! The cave itself is not very special but the surroundings are beautiful! Loads of big old trees and little waterways. It wasn't very busy when we were there so it's a nice walk around. Do not buy a sarong at one of the stalls, they will provide you with one at the entrance.",
          "Nothing really much to see except the elephant art in the stuffy cave. If your itinerary is packed I would give it a miss",
          "Great place to see for tourism.\nMissing some documentation to understand the signification of this place.\nIt's very abour hindouist religion.\nPrice is not expensive.",
          "Pura Goa Gajah or elephant temple, best historical temple located in ubud, bali, built in 9th century.\n\nOn entrance there are plenty of stairs that need to be climbed to reached down.\n\nThe entrance fees is 50,000 Indonesian currency. The temple open at 8:00 am and close at 6:00 pm.\n\nInside temple you find refreshments shops also.",
          "One of the oldest temple in Bali.\nThis temple is having Shiva Pind inside.\nWonderful Forest surrounded.",
          "Awesome place. Must visit",
          "Not worth the ticket price. Also people outside sell saron saying it's mandatory inside while truth is that you get one on rent at ticket checking counter at no extra cost.",
          "There is nothing much inside the cave actually. Just 3 altars. Costs 50k rupiah per person to enter. Yet the place is quite rundown and well littered. People there also try to hardsell their wares and drinks. They'll bring it up to you and \u2026",
          "It is ok. Not very impressive. There is literally just one cave and it's pretty small. Some areas are also very dirty but the gardens are nice and you have some nice views. However there are too many locals trying to sell you different \u2026",
          "Fun place to explore. Feels like a playground for adults. Be respectful though",
          "Verry historic and lovely place a must  visit",
          "It is good as a short stop during the trip. The temple is not very big. Many local shops in front of it.",
          "Goa Gajah(elephant cave) temple is the simplest temple among the others that we saw. There are many stairs to climb down and up. You have to wear Sarong and it is provided with ticket and you dont need to buy one more. Here, all temples entrance fee is 50k rupiah per one person.",
          "Interesting place to go to in Ubud. Guides are available for a small fee, but the place was very well kept. Don't bother buying the cloth covering outside, it comes with the admission fee.",
          "This place is perfect for jalan jalan!!",
          "Place is very cool. Good place to take photos.there is a Buddha temple is also good.",
          "Cave is dark and inside we can find Ganesha statue.many of the statues are in broken state. There is a pond opposite to the temple without much water. Once we come outside there is a path leading to park which is well maintained with a small waterfall.",
          "Nice place, but yet again filled with tourists and nothing much to see. The Cave gives a better picture background. As Indonesians are very strict about their temple and culture none of the worshiping places allow tourists to enter. So \u2026",
          "Wonderful place, little crowded.",
          "It's was cool",
          "Goa Gajah is well worth visiting.  Cost is 50,000 for forigners, 30,000 for locals.  Watch out for the people on the way in.  They'll try to tell you to buy a sarong,  but sarongs are free for loan with the ticket.  Make sure you explore \u2026",
          "It\u2019s a nice place to go but lots of crowd.. they give you the sarong to wear so no need to carry until you want a designer one... ticket prices are high as other places...",
          "I liked it ...it is Ganesh temple ,",
          "Decent place for a visit. The only interesting thing is the small temple with Ganesha and Brahma-Vishnu-Maheshwara inside it. They have shown way for a waterfall but it is not what you imagine it to be. Very small one. Buddha templed seemed to be in ruins (demolished). I am not sure why they are charging 60,000 IDR for the place.",
          "Amazing temple, ancient stones",
          "From ubud taxi is available grab around 20k and local around 50k.while comming luck.we walked all the way less than 5km.ticket entry is around 50k.And around 400m steps..good quite place",
          "cool place, and beware of scammers, do not buy the cloth (like shall) to cover your leg from the outside ladies, they will force you to buy this, but at the entrance, you will get it free.",
          "Well, I just look around for bodhi temple, and what I found is not same like my mine, lol, but its perfect for summertime",
          "A good temple for a quick visit. Be careful with interaction with any local people, as they may request money for services.",
          "Such a beautiful place",
          "Lots to see, reasonably priced",
          "This is not a bad place but I would not call it as a tourist attraction. There is a small cave anda temple which you can see after wearing a sarong. There are better temples in Bali choose those over this place. If you are on a long vacation you may include this place in your itinerary",
          "Waste of money and time. There isn\u2019t much to appreciate. Sorry.... \nYou can borrow sarongs for free before entering but they smell amazingly terrible. You would get headache from the smell.",
          "First impression may be disappointing but give this temple a chance and keep going. The greenery and the little spring is so beautiful. When you reach the Buddha Temple, try the little path behind it and there is 300metres of pure greenery, \u2026",
          "Nice place. Must visit",
          "One of the important tourist attraction in Ubud. Actually, it is a Hindu temple and we have seen a lot devotees there. There is a dedicated parking facility for this place. Ticket is around 50000 Indonesian rupee per person, they also \u2026",
          "Beautiful area, not as impressive as places like gunung kawi but a nice visit nonetheless. The cave itself is small and only a minor feature of the place as a whole",
          "The surrounding of the temple was amazing. The trees and the little pond inside were beautiful. The most impressive temple we have seen in Bali.",
          "One of the coolest in ubud.",
          "Temple tourist attraction. You need to cover your knees at all temple's and at this one you could borrow one at the entrance. Entrance fee is 50k IDR for adults. A large parking is available just outside. There is a parking fee. A lot of \u2026",
          "Interesting place and the surroundings are very nice, definitely worth the visit. They give you a sarong at the entrance so don't get fooled into buying one if you don't need it.",
          "Awesome spot. You'll only need 30 minutes to explore.",
          "We visited the so called \"elephant caves\" during a full day sight seeing trip on Bali. It was quite interesting, I think we paid around 3 EUR entrance fee. I would say it was worth a visit but definitely not as nice as Kawi if you compare it, but on the other hand less people trying to sell stuff.",
          "The architecture of the cave entrance looks quite bizarre and can be set for some.nice photographs. Definitely not a must see when in Ubud, but if you have time it's really close.",
          "a very very small place with nothing much to do, and touts are around so they will come and ask if you are here the first time, so they can bring you around and ask for tips later. \n\nvendors outside selling sarong, no need to buy as the temple provide free to borrow when you are going in.",
          "A really cool place to check out when you zre in the neighborhood. You are obligated to cover your legs. So either wear long pants \ud83d\udc56 or borrow a longi at the entrance (free of charge).",
          "One of the more diverse temples around. The cave is simple but there are also waterfalls around",
          "Nice temple, with several area to visit. The entry price per person for non-indonesians is set at 50,000 and includes everything you need to wear to enter the temple respectfully, so basically you can come with regular clothing like shorts \u2026",
          "It\u2019s a very interesting place. It\u2019s not that big and better to visit in the early hours of the day. \nPS: if you climb the stairs up to the Buddha Tempel u can follow a very narrow path to the right and keep walking through the bush for \u2026",
          "The Cave and the temple was fine but the sorounding garden is more impressive.",
          "If you are planning to visit any temple in Bali, then be cautious about a scam where shopkeeper outside temples tell you that you need to tie a cloth around your waist to enter the temple. For a tourist who has traveled so long to admire \u2026",
          "Interesting historical place where Hindu and Buddha temples are at the same location.",
          "Beautiful historic place. We came across a lovely waterfall within the premises, but even the guide had not told us about it. Needs better on site information, and better markings for direction.",
          "The entrance fee of 50,000 per person seems a little expensive for the size of the actual place. We stopped here as we had a driver for the day but I wouldn't make a special trip out just to see this.",
          "Nice tourism destination\nNice place\nNice cave\nElephant Cave only on Bali",
          "The place is beautiful, no doubt. But I think it's also the touristic place where I felt the most like I was a prey to shops/taxis/guides/pple who want to help you taking pictures/ with very agressive selling techniques.",
          "It's cave with ancient statues of hindu gods,  small natural waterfall can be enjoyed here",
          "The place is cold, because of the hilly area and not too far from Ubud.\nThere are stairs down that must be traversed on foot which is quite energy-consuming.\nBut it's worth it once when it arrives below.\nThe cave is dark, must use a \u2026",
          "So peaceful and sacred place to visit.",
          "It is temple of Hindugod.  There is cave, waterfall, huge greenery. They give you blessings by sprinkling water on the face, placing flower on the back of the ear and doing tilka. The interiors are so so beautiful. A picture perfect place.",
          "Nice place but small, lovely lotus pond and ruins of the buddhist temple. Careful of the horrible so called local guides they will try to rip you off your money for a very simple explanation of the place and if you refuse to pay the \u2026",
          "Another temple in Bali. Seems very old. It is a shame that there is no readily available information displayed on these temples for ready reference. Very nice atmosphere. You can be bothered by the local guides in temple who will keep \u2026",
          "The infamous elephant cave! Come to say hello to everyone's favourite deity. The cave or beautiful and ornately adorned with beautiful carvings, a real treause. Advise to come early in the morning to avoid the tourist wave. The cave is very \u2026",
          "I couldn\u2019t appreciate why it\u2019s so popular. In fact when I was inside I had to run outside I felt sick with the strong smell, hot and dark. I don\u2019t recommend to go in it",
          "This is very interesting, definetely a must visit one!",
          "Nice and clean temple.",
          "Nice place. Must visit. Good photography place. \nYou have to wear sarong around the waist before you enter.\nYou can buy one there or use the one they give at the entrance gate.",
          "Best place. Perfect\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",
          "Nice temple and its surrounding. Beware  street vendor that tried to sell sarong. Sarong is available to lent for free in the temple.",
          "A unique site with beautiful fountains and incredible, giant trees. The beauty of this place is that it\u2019s also not as popular as a lot of the other sites in the area so you can have a leisurely walk around without bumping shoulders with thousands of other people",
          "While the main attraction (the temple cave) was certainly unique, it wasn\u2019t anything spectacular and it is quite small. The rest of the area was nothing new and nothing special. The back area had a lot of unfinished construction left lying around making it look very untidy and unkept. It was not worth the entrance fee of IDR50k.",
          "Beautiful site, many tourists (myself not excluded). Admission is 50000rupiah, and only 2000 to park. Lots of good photo ops, lots of people taking them. Even more history, would have liked more information on all of it. Really worth the visit regardless.",
          "Awesome place. Full of history. Beautiful surrounds. Peaceful.",
          "Nice place to visit. :D",
          "This place must have some big religious inheritance but architecture / sculpture is not so great as you find it in nearby places like Saraswati Temple and Palace. There is just one cave inside which Gods are worshipped. You can go inside. \u2026",
          "Entrance fee is too big for this place. It is overrated. Poorly maintained. Very small cave. Nothing much to see. Garbage everywhere, wc closed. Best to see is pond and big rocks. Would be nice place if they took care of it.",
          "Although it is at present a Hindu temple, it was formerly a Buddhist temple, and the large broken statue of the Buddha on the grounds is evidence of that fact.",
          "Memorable place with good antiques..",
          "Beautiful ancient cave with Ganesha idol",
          "Goa Gajah is thought to date back to the 11th century, although relics predating this time were found within proximity of the site. The first mention of Goa Gajah and the Elephant Cave was in the Javanese poem Desawarnana written in 1365. \u2026",
          "A great stop from DPS to Ubud trip. It contains both Hindu and Buddhist sculptures, lingam & yoni,symbol of Shiva, and image of Ganesha, while by the river there are carved images of stupas and chattra imagery of Buddhism. Rediscovered by \u2026",
          "Nice people.\nBeautiful garden",
          "There isn't a whole lot to see here but the historical part of it is really interesting.  So basically it is a nice stop if you are interested in Bali culture and history but the cave itself is underwhelming.",
          "Very impressive door, althought there only is a tiny temple inside. However, there is a lot too see outside with the gardens, the small waterfall, and the stairs. Beautiful panorama for only 50k/pers",
          "Very scenic place. The cave design itself says a lot. There are other things to explore, such as dense gardens, and a waterfall as well.",
          "Do not buy a sarong from the many people selling them! They are provided when they check your ticket. Overall a nice way to spend an hour or 2 and imagine life when it was a temple. The walks are nice and there are plenty of waterfalls.",
          "funny face...good if you're in the area",
          "Small place with little to offer. No worth paying RP5000.",
          "It is a place to see... However, it didn't worth the price they ask at the entrance!\nIf you are short budget, don't bother!",
          "Another treasure of Bali. Only 40 mins from Ubud, a must see. Yes there are tourist's and yes there are Balinese bothering you (would not expect otherwise) , but I definitely highly recommend this stunning location. The Elephant cave itself \u2026",
          "My wife can't go inside because she got period.  Oh no.",
          "A rich bit of history and a decent place to visit.",
          "Lovely surroundings but a little underwhelming once you get in there. Make sure you don\u2019t get ripped off by people selling sarongs to cover up with outside - you\u2019re provided with one for free once you\u2019ve bought your ticket!",
          "Nice but not a must",
          "Elephant Cave was a bit underwhelming and very smoky but the gardens were lovely and worth seeing once",
          "Best experience with local guide",
          "A small entree fee, worth it. You can get a sarong at the entree for rent, no costs.",
          "Wonderful place to enjoy nature. Just go!",
          "Temple was beautiful to see. We had luck to visit during preparations for celebration that happens once every five years.",
          "IMO, this cave is not so special. Altho it still got nice scenery.",
          "Beautiful temple, probably only place where you can see god's idols  as a tourist.",
          "Very historic place , can be a bit crowded at times but well worth a visit , it is very close to Ubud town",
          "A very beautiful place.",
          "Nice hindu temple with cave having statute of Lord Ganesha, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. It also has a waterfall and buddha temple as well. Outside the temple there are good local vendors and if you bargain one can easily get a 80% discount. Also the money changer offered a good rate.",
          "We hired a guide to know the importance of the place and it was worth it.",
          "This place is very very overated. it is just a small cave but charging expensive entry fees. CAUTION : there are pity face old man there pretending to \"help\" you taking photo and do some explanation which later on will ask lot of money for thier 10 minutes service.",
          "Mystical and magical place. A Temple having both Hindu and Buddhist deities. The magical part is join of two Rivers inside the temple. Best time to visit is a bright n sunny day.",
          "Must see. Ideally with a guide that can provide context about the importance of this place!",
          "There was a cave with some carvings inside and a couple of structures around, otherwise nothing else interesting to see. We didn't see many elephant related structures either so not sure how the name came about..",
          "Very cool place, but also very touristic which almost ruined the experience. Dont buy the skirts before entry, you cam borrow one for free!",
          "Great experience. Not so much the cave itself (which was a bit disappointing) but the temple around, ponds, small waterfalls and path in the \"jungle\" are definitely a \"must do\"",
          "Cool little temple with both Hindu and Buddhist worship",
          "If you come to Bali you have to visit this place. Amazing temple and land!!! Go to little stores to get some local staff with very good price.",
          "The Hindu people are very respectful of other religions",
          "Beautiful place. Need to add on your list if you're nearby Ubud. Have to pay for entrance ticket once. Quite touristy thou so need to find better shots without too much people in it.",
          "Beautiful temple, very big, take time and hire a guide to get to know about the history of this temple. I highly recommend doing the Bali swing here outside the temple. Worth it. My wife really enjoyed the swing.",
          "Pro tip: Do not buy a sorong from the seller's before you enter it because it is included in the tickets cost. \n\nI've been here two times in my travels to Indonesia and both times I thought the same thing... Overpriced and overrated. Sure, they have a good location next to Ubud but I feel like that is about it.",
          "A glimpse of history, u get to wash up in a Kings pool!!!\n\nOverall, a good reminder and show of thru bali else culture. Be respectful please",
          "Carving of cave into rock is impressive and surrounding buildings are beautiful",
          "Upon arrival we were stormed by women trying to sell the traditional \"skirts\" needed to enter this place. After walking around the garden which is nice but not very interesting, we entered the cave. The cave was much smaller than expected. A bit of a disappointment really. Ps. Note that women on their period are not allowed in here.",
          "Another temple that leaves you calm. \nBoth Hindu and Buddhist temples here and a nice walk through the jungle to small waterfall and pond. Very nice and very peaceful. Worth the stop!",
          "Ancient Hindu and Buddhist temple complex with a small cave used for meditation. Awesome place to walk around for an hour. Many souvenir shops and local restaurants nearby. Visitors are required to wear modest clothing. No short pants or short skirts allowed. Place is still used for worship.",
          "Way better than expectation as I only saw the famous \u2018mouth cave\u2019 pictures prior to the visit. Upon arriving, the place is so much bigger and has multiple interesting spots. There\u2019s a very nice tropical garden downstairs & apparently \u2026",
          "Pretty decent, 50k to enter, and 2k to park. Super cheap. Pretty sure they lend you sarongs at the entrance if you don\u2019t get hustled already by the women in the car park (you must be covered to enter the temple).",
          "Beautiful cave, but a lot of annoying \u2018guides\u2019 that are really pushy. The history is nice though. You could walk all the way down to beautiful landscapes on the right side of the temple.",
          "I like this place caves and a good walk towards fountain",
          "I love the temple and the landscape. The rituals, the sculptures, architecture, wearing a sarong all the stuff. Unique experience.",
          "Nice place to visit if you have time, you only need an hour really as there is only the elephant cave, and then as others have mentioned a small waterfall and temple on the grounds also, accessible by steps leading down. Free sarong rental included in the price. Its also not too busy as we went at around 3pm and was fairly empty.",
          "Wonderful memories with nature.",
          "was nice, but not alot to see tbh",
          "Beautiful temples and a peaceful shrine. Don't forget to visit the Buddhist temple in the back part of the site. Good to know: Sarongs are free to lend in the temple so no need to buy one outside the site (if you don't really want to). \u2026",
          "Elephant cave as it's called in sanskrit. Almost surreal straight out of Indiana Jones.",
          "It was nice trip, nice nature here but so hot Weather. At parking pay attention, some dog jump to our motorbike and want to go with us haha.",
          "Its a Ganesh temple. Very nice place, I loved it. It was raining but this place is very safe. Beautiful scenery. Must visit in our lifetime.",
          "Very spiritual. Go in day light.",
          "It is ok to stop by but not a must. You get a nice picture and the entrance is picturesque but it does not create a wow feeling. The walk to the river is nice and the waterfall a good add on.",
          "Nice to see \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Interesting place and the grounds are still being developed but no instructional signage which would have been helpful for the independent traveller. Nice waterfall but lots of rubbish at the bottom of the canyon. Great photo opps of water \u2026",
          "A very good Guide, explaining the history. Warning...a lot of steps for Tourists who have difficulty with knees or walking.",
          "Nice structures, good place to visit.",
          "Nice ancient architecture. It's basically a Shiva temple inside a cave. You must visit this place.",
          "I liked it.\nPlease hit the Thumbs Up, if this review helps you decide if this venue is a good choice.",
          "old and beautiful temple",
          "Good temple. A little bit expensive for the entrance, though. It includes a couple of small waterfalls.\n\nWhen you arrive, people will try to sell Sarun to you. Do not buy, they will say its required for entry. Thats true, however you can borrow Sarun with your ticket already no need to buy/rent from third party people.",
          "Not so much there to see if you're an Indian.. just a local heritage temple place",
          "It's a beauty. You can spend a whole day here and it won't be enough. It has caves and Goa gajah temple. It closes at 6 pm. Next to it is the Swing center. The Bali swings are worth doing at lease once. This is a magnificent place. Better to wear long gowns. If not they provide a sarong.",
          "The temple is quite simple. It's one of the closest temples to visit near Ubud.",
          "The cave is literally just one wall in a large, very rundown temple. Lots of it appeared to be treated as a rubbish dump. However, when you walk around the grounds they are beautiful.\nWhen you park, you will get approached to buy a sarong \u2026",
          "Pretty average. Dave is literally a hole behind a stunning carved entrance. Fyi you can get a free lend sarong at the entrance. No need to buy one.",
          "From 11 th century archeological site , very good to visit",
          "Interested place to see one of  traditional pura at Bali",
          "Ours Goa Gajah is one of the beautiful place in Bali..",
          "Wear a long skirt or long pants and a proper top or kimono over your singlet. It's beautiful here! The statues are cool, but the forest with all the paths and lily ponds are just spectacular. You can buy cold drinks or small snacks too. There is a nice cafe for lunch.",
          "Nice quiet open place",
          "It's good place to visit  but very small then expected. Should go if it's on the way but don't waste time specially going to see this place",
          "Do not waste your time",
          "Nice place to visit near Ubud. This is an ancient cave temple . They give free sarong to go inside temple.",
          "I really enjoyed visiting this temple.  The main attraction to me was the stone carvings around the main statues inside.  The intricate carvings are really impressive and amazing to look at.  That said, I'm not sure it's worth making the trek just for this place as we only ended up spending about 30 minutes inside.",
          "Thought it would be bigger and better inside",
          "It was okay. Try the Buddha cafe adjacent to this place and must try pumpkin soup.",
          "A beautiful and spiritual place. 2nd time here. The only thing that I was a bit shocked with was the \"tour guide\" price gouging. Last year the \"tour guide\" ask for a donation of $100K IDR, no problem. It's stated as a donation. This time \u2026",
          "Entry to Goa Gajah costs 50000idr. Don't forget your sarung! Show up early to enjoy the garden as well as the garden by yourself and of course the entry of the elephant cave! Getting inside is possible - you'll get to see some spots where the king uses to meditate as well as representation of Ganesh and his father.",
          "It\u2019s a good temple with less crowd",
          "Decided to head here as a last minute stop. Free sarongs are included in the ticket, tho it was pretty steep compared to other tourist attractions and the place was very very small. Would love to know more about the history but no signs were put up to explain anything. \n\nDid take some nice shots here tho~",
          "Well I would say it's fairly nice, IDR 50k for foreigners.\n\nIt's worth the visit if you're nearby \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Its an ok Temple, nothing much to see, really. Except the dungeon that is just a hole in the wall. \n\n50k entrance fee\ud83d\udcb2\nCrowded even in low season\ud83d\ude2a\n\nIf this review helped you, please consider giving it a like \ud83d\udc4d Thank you.",
          "i like this place have many history and the place is really excelent",
          "Extremely hot and humid and not much to see. There was also a false sign that led me to am angry massive dirty dog that chased me around growling. It must have been a joke or something, because the sign saying Buddah temple literally led to nowhere!",
          "Not bad, but wouldn't rate it rate against other temples in the area. Elephant cave though is cute and spiritually ominous...plus you get the added bonus of smelling like an incense stick when you come out of it's smokey confines! \ud83e\udd23",
          "Bali is full of surprises. This ancient site is worth a visit.",
          "You will get a Sarong at the entrance (as an item on loan) and it is not that crowded as other tourist attractions.",
          "A must see when going to Bali. Entering the cave is an awesome experience, but further down the pond and Buddhist area is stunning.",
          "Nice old temple",
          "Nice place to visit and capture the memories with photograph. You have to wear sarong ( traditional wear) to enter to the temple.Its given near the entrance of the temple. Most of the places in bali are dated very old.",
          "Best Divine and Holly Hindu Temple",
          "Beautiful area, very touristic though",
          "This place was really nice, I think if you wanted to you could get in the water and receive some kind of blessings or something, our guide left us to it so we didn't really understand what was happening. It was quite eerie visiting this one I thinking. It was really incredible though. Worth going to see it for sure.",
          "Simply stunning carved temple/cave.  Well worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful place to visit",
          "Nice cave to visit if you have extra time in Bali. There are simply more impressing ones in Bali though (Gunung and Besakih are my fav and quite different from each other).",
          "Decent place to start explore in Ubud",
          "Easy to get to. Heaps of parking. Very touristy. 50k was a bit expensive though. Overall ok. Nothing extra ordinary...",
          "Better than I have expected. The pool is interesting.",
          "Small cave with holes like for dead bodyes on the walls, hard to breath, nothing special, not worth. Not nice atmospher inside. Outside big park, valley with beautiful waterfall and pond.",
          "If you have more time then this is one of the temples you can visit. Not a must visit place in Ubud. The temple is located in a huge complex with some shops for local shopping and eating present too.",
          "God place. 20 min maximum spending time.",
          "The goa gajah was not worth paying 100000rupaih for each person but the restaurant beside it was pretty nice and had lunch there",
          "A lot of sellers that try to get you to buy sarongs etc. You don't need to get one, you can borrow sarongs from there. Ticket cost 50k for an adult. Not really much to see in my opinion. The nature was nice, but lots of trash. Many stairs also and a lot of walking. You can hire a guide also if you like, but we didn't find it necessary.",
          "A calm and peaceful place with history behind it. Build in the 9th century, it served as a sanctuary and a place of meditation. For ladies,  wear a long skirt/maxi dresses so you cover your legs as a mark of respect. If you have the chance, \u2026",
          "Suggetive and relaxing walk in this temple!",
          "Nice temple, worth visiting. A bit worn out, could maybe use a little renorvation.",
          "Nice and peaceful place to visit. A walk inside the cave is possible and for free but it is not big nor impressive, however the outside is great but I would not recommend for people with wheelchair or baby car as no accessibility. Be aware while climbing some places",
          "Its a small cave temple basically with decent greeneries around. Not so big but a visit with family will be a good time pass.",
          "Goa Gajah is locally known as Elephant Cave because of its proximity to the Elephant River. A mysterious cave, relics, and ancient bathing pools set amid green rice paddies and garden. Such an overrated, busy tourist attraction, this one \u2026",
          "UNESCO'S world heritage site, mesmerising experience",
          "A serene place and far from Ubud. Lovely surrounding and beautiful carvings and temple.",
          "Good place, beautifully maintained. Guides charge a lot, so better Google the history beforehand. \nKeep a good cam handy",
          "amazing and spectacular surroundings. Was a sight to behold and really enjoyed it as a day out. Note that long trousers should be worn or they will give you something to cover yourself.\nVery friendly people there and they pretty much leave you to explore on your own.",
          "You can visit Ganesha and budha temple inside.\nThere is a waterfall too.",
          "Traditional temple. When buying entry ticket to temple, they will also give sarong to wear to temple. No need to rent/buy sarong. Must visit temple and experience the sarong.",
          "Especially nice for the surrounding nature",
          "Loved the history if the place, took a guide when arrived who charged something very small, but was knowledgeable and spoke decent English.",

          "I came twice to this place..\nBeautiful place..",
          "a great place, for true Bali culture and culture, the elephant cave is a cultural preservation protected by the world. admission ticket 50k / person",
          "A little underwhelming in terms of size, but a beautiful historical site. Amazing walk into forest further in. Beware very pushy locals hanging around trying to take you for a tour in exchange for money.",
          "Beautiful spot to visit..caves, Hindu relics, a beautiful garden area & some green eye catching waterfalls as well.",
          "Built in 9th century. Also known as Elephant cave.",
          "When you come with short..don't worry..the gate keeper will provide 'kain' and 'selendang'. The entrance ticket is IDR 30,000/person",
          "Extremely interesting place which looks to predate the local Hindu population. The carving looks polynesian and the interior very early man. Looks like a site adopted by the Hindus. Sadly hindu Temples are very disappointing so very glad this was there, it made my day",
          "Eshwara linga inside the cave... So happy to see our Indian god here..",
          "A good taste of a Bali temple - looks historic. Entry ticket is about $4 and you need to get a piece of clothing to cover you knees down if they are not already covered - included in the ticket fee. Recommended!",
          "It explains the hindu religion",
          "Very good and beautiful place",
          "Good place. Liked those extra large coconuts here. And the sceneric  view was fantastic. Best place for photography",
          "Another g9od temple in Ubud Bali to visit. We went in evening not much crowded that time and it was beautiful",
          "Nice walks, the goa itself wasnt that impressive for me.",
          "Must visit temple. They let you enter the worship place unlike Uluwatu temple.",

          "Loved it the wife and I came here for her 40th birthday it was magical",
          "It was the 1st place I visited once arrived to Bali,\nSo you have no idea the level of excitement I felt to see that temple inside the jungle with all other nature environments...\n\nI loved it as much and enjoyed every single moment\n\nWe had lunch at it's caffee BUDA GARDEN as well, was lovely food despite a little pricey",
          "Beautiful Temple. Probably the Best one i saw on Bali :)",
          "Go down from stairs in right, the whole place is ruins on beautiful temple now engulfed in beautiful forest",
          "Don't go there when the sunlight is gone... Not worth it. The cave is alright... I preferred the area around it. Nice rainforest and temples. You need a sarong, but they lend you one for free ...",
          "It is a must see in Ubud! Beautiful garden... the temple seems not well maintained... recommend the cafe/restaurant next to the entrance... \n\nImportant tip: entrance ticket gives you the right to use the temple sarong! There are some people selling sarongs in the parking area... no need to buy sarongs just to enter the temple!",
          "A beautiful cave with excellent carvings.  An old temple of Ganesha & Shiva linga.  An active temple with place to meditate.  Surrounded with large trees.",
          "A truly special evening after the full moon. It featured a womans Gamelan and the Kecak/Fire Dance along with the traditional neighborhood's blessings by the Priest after prayers.",

          "Very good place to visit, just follow those tips \n1- Don't rent a sarong (for ppl with short clothes) from people outside because you'll get it for free inside\n2- Try to avoid guides over there or fix the price from the beginning and make \u2026",
          "Great temple with beautiful statues, elephant cave was quite cool but was impressed with other fountains etc.",
          "In Bedulu, just southeast of Ubud, stands the Goa Gadja. From the parking lot you have to descend a good number of stairs to visit the Goa Gadja. This Cave of the Elephant was only discovered in 1923, the two basins for the cave were not \u2026",
          "Not a spectacular temple by any means but worth a trip. Quite peaceful in the temple complex and a bit to see around. Probably take an hour max with time for pictures!",

          "It's a temple. Lord Ganesha Temple. Ok place to visit. It's inside a cave. No need to buy traditional Sarong before entering temple. You can get it at the entrance of the temple.",

          "Very beautiful place.",
          "I think, i saw better places than this.",
          "A place to see, if you are in Ubud, but not something that will blow your mind.",

          "Just a tourist trap , 3 star",
          "This place could be a bit bigger but it\u2019s still beautiful, don\u2019t miss the way to the Buddha Temple!",
          "Beautiful place with nice tample and spring, waterfall, park area with a lotus pond... but it's  very small... overall it's worth a visit.",
          "Goa Gajah is a holy place for locals. Make sure to wear long skirt or pants and proper top to respect a local culture. The place is historic and green. A good place to escape busy streets of Ubud.",
          "Good place to visit. Entry frees are applicable. Also, you need to wear a saroong to enter the temple - it is available free of charge near the entrance to the temple.\nLots of different sites are there. There is handicraft store inside the \u2026",
          "Sacred ancient place. A place to experience the spiritual journey in one of old Bali's temples. But need more improvement in managing the place (like the seller outside the temple) so that it's more comfortable for visitors to visit the site.",
          "There\u2019s absolutely nothing to see inside the cave. It is very small. There is a small waterfall in the back and some other scenery you can take photos of like a lily pond. I saw a large lizard on a rock by the waterfall as well. Wouldn\u2019t really recommend this place but if you go, make sure to go beyond the silly alcove of a cave.",
          "Goa Gajah is a unique experience. One of the must-sees of Bali. Small location packed with history and local workers willing to guide you through the site.",
          "Easy to find and must visit historical site",
          "The original complex is still to be rediscovered. This is just a small sample of something much larger and much older",
          "Okies place. Nothing much to see. \nSome old trees and so called waterfall. \nTemple is very small with small cave.",
          "Not so amazing place for me. Maybe same for yours!",
          "Another heaven on earth Bali",
          "The elephant cave's entrance is amazing. The surroundings too. You have to wear a sarong around ur waist and u have to pay to enter.\nThey charge you for parking, if you go by motorbike, i recomend to PARK OUTSIDE the place.",
          "Managed professionally, clean environment. i'm having a good time here.",
          "It's a tourist attraction. Apart from the cave u can go down the steps to see the old ruins and a small waterfall",
          "Bali is an enchanted place overall, and the Goa Gajah was no less. The place is great, but I got to experience the honesty and simple philosophy of these beautiful people at this place. My wife forgot her iPhone at a store there. After \u2026",
          "This is a really interesting temple with some ancient stone carvings to boot.  Inside the widely photographed carved cave you will find examples of historic Shiva Linga and Ganesha carvings.  The site is unique and as you trek down the \u2026",
          "The cave isnt what we expected. Its a small one with hot clima and bad air. The gardens and the waterfall are cool but as well nothing special. A typical tourism hotspot where a lot of People just want to make money. In my opinion 50000 idr are too much for what is been offered.",
          "That's amazing..",
          "Quite touristy, but still beautiful and nice to see! Definitely recommend going if you get a chance, and taking your time just walking all around the area.",
          "This temple with a very small cave was lovely to see you need to wear a sar8ng but you do not have to buy them.like they tell you. you are given one before you go in\n However you need to wear a sarong for all the temples so you are as well off having your own if you are planning to go to a few.",
          "Good place if you like historical places. Not maintained that well and entrance fee also on higher side",
          "Temple is very nice",
          "Nothing intresting... And on top of that.. Tiring",
          "Very peaceful, take a sarong, women on their monthly are not permitted in temple .",
          "Very good temple",
          "Not a bad place to visit. Unsure why they want to charge $20aud to give you a site tour to try and teach about their religion. I would of thought they would want to do it for free.",
          "Beautiful \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb how it is made \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",
          "The cave is located in a large campus/area. It is nice to walk around and enjoy a coconut. The cave is quite narrow though. And they burn incents inside the cave, which makes it tough to breathe. Still worth a visit.",
          "YOU DO NOT NEED A SARONG!!!!!  As long as you're wearing long pants. We were approached in the parking lot and told we had to buy their sarongs to enter.  LIES!!!  We didn't buy one....I said I'll rent one because their prices were a joke \u2026",
          "Beautiful place, give it a try but be careful buying anything there. Prices are much higher than in the Ubud Market and sellers are really annoying.",
          "Good for who like see temples",
          "A lovely temple complex.",
          "Short ride from Ubud. Some nice nature, cave and temple",
          "Carved stone cave temple from the 9th century. Requires a sarong to enter, which you can borrow from the ticket booth for free. Beautiful and intriguing!",
          "An entrance ticket, nothing much in the cave it's artificial. You can always go for clicking a picture at the mouth of cave",
          "Great place.",
          "No activity .. just temple .. ticket expensive",
          "My best visit of a temple in Bali, the guide was sooo nice and knowledgeable really sharing his experience of of the place along with the unexpected history.\n\nIf you don't have the explanation you really will miss out this amazing place.",
          "We liked Goa Gajah a lot and recommend a visit when in the area.  Not too crowded when we visited at about 10:00.  The high spot for us was the Ganesh inside the cave with mice running around eating the offerings around the stone carving: \u2026",
          "Wasnt expecting much, but 50k entrance wasnt worth it. Sarong is included in the price.  The cave was small. Nothing much to see and in my opinion its a skip.",
          "The elephant cave was ok. The temple was pretty badly maintained and the buddha temple was a long downhill walk, on a hot day in a long skirt or wrapped in a sarong.the climb back up was exhausting. The buddha statue was actually broken! \u2026",
          "Cool place, You can find a shivlinga inside the temple. must try the huge tender coconuts",
          "Nice. The best thing about this place is the cotton tree.",
          "Beautiful gardens to walk around.",
          "Beautiful landscape.",
          "Goa Gajah Temple might be one of those recommended Tourist Spots but I didn't find so many touristy-worthy spots here during my visit. They have fewer temples and limited Temple area. Though they have cool rock formation and some eye-catching masterpieces displayed in key areas.",

          "The park is beautifully designed, with its lush greens. The slides are well placed. The whole park is well maintained. The staff are super helpful and friendly. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Great day. I visited with my 3 kids (6,7 &17). 6 year old wasn\u2019t quite 125cm so he was disappointed he couldn\u2019t go on all the slides like the older two. He still had plenty to go on though just the same. I felt like I was on a roller coaster after the first slide and by the 3rd",
          "With Dec not the height of the season, my son and I were able to do all of the rides in about 60-90 minutes! We booked on line, turned up just before opening, took our passes and towels, charged some money onto the band (makes it very easy to pay for stuff) and within a few",
          "Only complaint would be the smoking at pool we found annoying the pool area was well supervised very clean everywhere couldn\u2019t believe how clean toilets & shower area so lovely",

          "Best day out for a family! Our children, age 3, 5 and 14 had a fantastic day and still rave about it. In fact we will be returning next trip to bali. Did the VIP pass x5 and well worth the money. Quick to get in, with towl hire, photo bands gave me over 400 free photos at the",
          "Great place for all Just need more information about how the wrist band photo system works top idea but just need to know to get the best benefits of photo memories. Only small thing Rest of the park amazing friendly, helpful staff and clean.",
          "We loved it. We where here in low Season, no lines and we tried everything multiple times. I could imagine being here in high season would result in long lines. Lots of shade in here and meal around 100.000 and 20.000 for drinks",
          "Despite that we were in a rainy day we enjoy the park and the slides, there are a lot of slides for everyone in the family. The maintenance of installations is excellent, there is variety of food and the people is friendly. If you are visiting Bali, Waterbom is a place to visit.",

          "We booked a private Gazebo for 12 people near the main pool. It was a great idea and when we wanted lunch which was included they brought all the food and drinks to the Gazebo. It was very clean and well located. There are quite a few rides to choose from and they were all well",

          "when we went there it was not too crowded. what surprised me the most is professionalism and politeness of the staff. everywhere you go you will see someone cleaning the waters, or the bathrooms, instructing you how to ride, helping you to learn to surf, assisting you while you",
          "Good location in Kuta area, close to shopping center and hotels. Great staff services and do not allow brong F&B from outside. Great adventure for family and safety regulation. Enjoy your time",

          "Our third trip to bali and our third trip to waterbom, and we loved every minute of it again. The price for entry is a little expensive when kids are over 11, but the facilities are great and the cost of food and drinks inside the park are reasonable. Highly recommend.",
          "Although the day we went to this amazing water park was rainy, it didnt affect on our good moments in here.",
          "It was ok in my opinion, but it's not really recommended if you visiting Bali. This is nice if you visit with young age of childs.",
          "Our family of 5 visited in February. We hired a cabana near to the kids section as our littlest was too small for most of the rides. He loved the kids zone which has 3 slides and is well staffed. We absolutely loved all the rides and didn't have to wait too long. You can bring",
          "We have much fun here this is our first time visit the waterpark it was great day to try all the facilities here!!!",
          "We happened to walk by this place not even knowing how good it was! We saw the ticket prices when you walk up, and they were crazy expensive to us. But after some researching online we got two tickets for less that $80. The park is clean, family friendly, entertaining, and",

          "We went here with some friends, we were all excited as water parks are really fun for everyone. Now, this park was not designed for the western society and larger guys, we\u2019re big boys. At no point upon entry was there warning signs about weight restrictions nor was this",
          "We went because we saw it from the street. Prices were okay and they have decent slides. It got boring after an hour so we left.",
          "We absolutely loved this water park. We have been to few waterparks but this will be our best experience as the park was clean, tidy, well marked included little kids area and we could go out for lunch and then come back in again. We went on a very hot day and was impressed as",
          "We really enjoyed our time at the waterboom in bali. Unfortunately I got badly bruised from one of the slides. I left the waterboom very sore on my lower back but didn't realise the extent of my injury until the next morning",

          "We've visited Bali several times, but never done the WaterBom. Whilst initially reluctant, I really enjoyed the visit. The staff were all excellent - happy, enthusiastic, welcoming and the rides were fun and safe. The organisation with online ticketing, cashless wristband",
          "There should be different categories of entrance fee. People just using lazy river, kids area, etc. Costs are prohibitive.",
          "I went every weeekend and I love it ,access is very easy near the restaurant aswell.I got special experience with some people there",
          "Fantastic day out in stunning surroundings. A must when you visit Bali with kids and reasonably priced.",
          "We enjoyed a full day at the park... our kids aged 15 & 12 loved all the rides. My husband and I took it easy cooling down regularly on lazy river and drinks at the swim up bar",
          "Fantastic day out! The staff were super friendly and encouraging and we went on a weekday and the queues were really reasonable. A great variety of rides and although we didn\u2019t eat there the prices all looked pretty reasonable. The wrist band idea is also really good and easy to",
          "Can never get enough of Waterbom. We went on a stormy rainy day and due to the humidity it was no problems at all. We were not cold at all. All the rides are great fun for all ages. Photos that are taken by staff and available for purchase are very expensive though so out of 30",
          "We are so happy. It is the cleanest and best water park that I have ever visited. A super applause for the staff members who are very nice, professional, and super helpful to the visitors. Will definitely visit this again!!!",
          "We took our 2 kids aged 12 and 10 and they loved this place. Lots of different slides and a great pool to relax by as well. Food is good also, you can't take in other options but it's not too expensive. It gets very hot by the middle of the day so I would recommend going",
          "Went there with total 3 Adults, 1 teenager and 2 children (age 9 & 7). All of us were able to enjoy the parks to our own like because it has many different options for rides. The park\u2019s environment is very clean, staffs are friendly and helpful. A lot of food choice however a",
          "Great pleasure we had together with our family during the school holiday. We spent from morning until afternoon. We tried nearly all the facilities. Love the water slides. Wow it's great fun. The food from their restaurant was also so good. Best place to spend the day with the",
          "Great family day out! Highly recommended! Make sure you don\u2019t have buttons on your shorts or zippers on the rear of swimsuits or rashies as they won\u2019t let you down the slides.",
          "We went in Jan, and the weather was perfect. Awesome rides for adults :) Do take note that most rides requires a height limit of 100cm to 110cm (for extreme rides).",
          "Get there early and you won\u2019t need to spend money on a private spot. Two teenage kids in toe, they had a ball, free to walk to the park go from ride to ride, use of lockers are great, food good if you want to buy it , plenty of choice.",
          "Reduced the number of rides young children can go on. Sometimes young children enjoy the smaller rides more",
          "Great day out for the family! Good value for money. Worth getting a cabana for shade and somewhere to leave valuables in the safe.",
          "Waterbom is a brilliant water park. It's very well run. The staff are super friendly and courteous. The rides felt safe and were heaps of fun. Most of the park is in the shade with plenty of plants and trees and covers over the stairs. We were there on a Thursday in",
          "We hired the 12 person gazebo even though there was only 8 of us. Well worth the money, it has a ceiling fan and a fenced off area that was cool and shaded with lots of privacy. The kids had a ball on all the slides and we loved the lazy river. The ticket with towel and lunch",
          "We had fun at Waterbom. Our driver recommended that we pre purchase our tickets on the way to avoid the queues. It was low season so not necessary and in fact we could have saved 15% by booking on line. We purchased a gazebo which was totally a waste of money as we only used it",
          "Fun and value for money. Different options to eat, able to store things in a locker for the day. A good day out with friends - plenty of variations of rides.",
          "This is a great place for families or even individuals. The slides were amazing and on the day we went we were lucky that the waiting queues were small so we got to enjoy it even better. The lazy river is so relaxing and beautiful and if you\u2019re lucky enough you get to see some",
          "We had a ball. Be prepared to spend lots on food and drinks. We got there early and didn't have to line up for rides until around 1.00 when the masses started arriving. Check Groupon type sites for deals before you book - we bought online through Waterbom and saved 10% but then",
          "Waterbom park was amazing! All of the staff were so friendly! My friends and I had the best time ever. Definitely would recommend going to waterbom park for anyone who is coming to Bali!",
          "Don\u2019t plan on doing anything else as you will spend the whole day there. A few lines but worth the wait, we purchased day passes with food and towels, food was good towels not needed.",
          "Great value for money, we purchased the \"super saver\" which made it very affordable as we didn't have to worry about what we were having for lunch. Kids, young and old, all had a great day",
          "We visited the water park on out first visit to Bali. The kids wanted to return again as my youngest at the time was too little for some of the slides. We got there early and truth be told the kids were done by the afternoon. This was similar to our first visit. An enjoyable",
          "Daughter is 8 , was very excited to return to waterbom but as soon as we arrived discovered that she could not go on the fun splash kids zone. They have imposed a height restriction of 125cm and will only accommodate for 3 cm. Unfortunately she is 130cm. They refused to let her",
          "We had a super day at Waterbom! We were pleasantly surprised by the availability and cleanliness of all the facilities around the park, including bathrooms, changing rooms, pathways, and rides themselves. The staff were encouraging and helpful and available to assist at the",
          "Good day out with the family. Food slightly expensive but good quality. Lots of staff around. Great medical centre equipped with 2 doctors and everything that is possibly needed. Photo package worth it for families. Bought a USB stick for 500,000IDR with about 44 photos on it.",
          "Great fun day, highly recommend for young families and teenagers! Everyone is catered for throughout the park, Friendly helpful staff.",
          "Waterbom was great, the teens took off on the slides and us adults floated around the lagoon or stayed in the pool with the pool bar, great day out",

          "We all went the 9 of us, hired a Gazebo best idea ever with locker there and towels and lunch in our deal, great food loved the burger. Large towels. We enjoyed the day and facilities, safety a 100% for children. Staff all helpful and friendly. The Park in Magnificient beautiful",
          "Overall fantastic experience. Most of the staff members were nice and supportive, but not everybody. Exiting",
          "For the activities provided the cost was over excessive! Would not recommend ever again for families with young children",
          "This water park is amazing. It 's a great day out for the whole family with so many things to do - lots of different waterslides for all abilities including a small children's area so they don't miss out either. THey have a cashless wrist band that you wear which is really easy",
          "However, it was worth the money. Lines werent too long and there were activities to cater for everyone.",
          "Waterbom was difficult to navigate with the wristband system initially but makes alot of sense. They keep it cashless and saves you returning to the locker constantly. Our first visit we hired a gazebo that has a safe and some beds and shade but it wasn't too busy so when we did",
          "This is a must on your to do list! The kids will have an amazing day out! Cabanas are well worth the expense! Food, drinks and extra activities are all worth it. Highly recommended! Waterbom never disappoints even after our 5th time!",
          "Had a great time at Waterbom the other day and going back today. The park is very clean, water is crystal clear and the gardens are very well looked after. The slides are fantastic, I would suggest going to Bali in their off-season and when the deals are the best. If you do",
          "Visited with the family. Waterbom never disappoints. All staff super friendly and efficient. Grounds are clean, food tastes great. Hired a gazebo as a base which worked out a treat. 4th visit over the years and will definitely come again. Prices have increased but not a",
          "I haven't been to Waterbom in years, and I was pleasantly surprised with the development and improvements they have made. A huge variety of slides and attractions, plenty of chairs to chill out, lots of dining and drinking options (amazing frozen margaritas!). Next time I",
          "This was our family's second visit and well worth it once again. It caters for both you and old with great facilities for all to enjoy. We came as a large group with young and teen kids and had a blast. If you wish to book a cabana I would suggest booking your tickets online",
          "We went to Waterbom with our 5 & 3 year olds and have such a great day. The staff were great, the rides were awesome and it was just a fun day out. Will definitely go back again. I highly recommend booking a gazebo too.",
          "Our ages ranged from 71 down to 9 and Waterbom was great for us all. The two oldies went on various slides and had a ball. Two children just loved it. Staff were great. We booked the VIP package which made it easy. The only thing I think that should be included in the VIP",
          "We spent the day at Waterbom Park (Kuta) and we all loved it. Purchase your tickets online before you go and you can save 10-15%. We booked a \u201cslide central\u201d gazebo for 6 which was great to have a point to rest and meet up during the day. These have a safe, matresses and",

          "We took our 2 kids (9 & 7) for the day and we had a blast. Food and drink is reasonably priced, recommend hiring a gazebo for convenience (and if you want to give your kids freedom with a place to meet) and the staff are all helpful and happy. We loved our visit and highly",
          "This is my first waterpark as I've never gone to wet n wild and it's deemed best in asia, yeah well it'd be the 27th best in Australia. Me and my partner only did the couple rides and did them within like 20 minutes. For 100 dollars for 20 minutes of satisfactory fun isn't",
          "I liked the place The games is sutible for both kids and adults Is has a good variety of games Hint : the have one of best fries in their restaurant",

          "Ages ranging from 7 to 72 and everyone of us had an amazing time. There was something for everyone. The kids' area was great for the littles, this oldie loved the Lazy River and most experienced their near death waterslide experience. A gazebo is a must but prebook days in",
          "Waterbom park was epic! From a custom kids pool with slides to heart dropping water slides, waterbom has it al! I wasn\u2019t keen initially as I don\u2019t do water slides but I tried pretty much everything except for the ones where the floor drops out haha Definitely worth putting",
          "Our visit to Bali Waterbom was a great full-day family experience. A lot of rides from mild tube flumes to scary vertical drops all in warm water and warm weather. The queues are small and everything is very well maintained and safe. It is all very well organized too. For",
          "This is a family friendly water park that caters for all ages. They have thought of everything, plenty of lockers in deferent places they have towels so you don\u2019t need to bring any with you. The toilet and all facilities are very clean, and they have great restaurants there too",
          "This was a fantastic day out for 3 adults and two kids (9 and 13). We had a ball on all the slides, the atmosphere was fun and safe and all the staff were friendly. The facilities were excellent and the food options (Thaitalian) were so much better than what there would be in",
          "Best family day out. Recommend you check height restrictions before going if travelling with children.",
          "There\u2019s so much to say about why Waterbom is so good, but I think the staff is 1 of them! They were all so helpful and friendly, and really enthusiastic about the park. They made the experience so perfect. It\u2019s also insanely clean - which a lot of water parks struggle with as",
          "Family of 7 (2 adults + 16, 14, 12, 10 and 9 hrs) we all had a great time. We picked the total package. It was convenient knowing everything was included, however there is no fast queue. Luckily this wasn\u2019t an issue as the queues moved reasonably fast. We got a large gazebo by",
          "It was a fun day but it was expensive and honestly there wasn't that many rides. If you have a day to kill in Bali then it's fun but if you really want a good water park experience then go to Wet N Wild on the Gold Coast, AU.",
          "This place is brilliant!!! 42 & 31 yo couple on honeymoon felt a bit weird booking to go to a waterpark but weren\u2019t disappointed. So many thrilling rides in one jam packed park. I was too scared to go on all of them!! The staff are so friendly and enthusiastic, high fives,",
          "While prices are the same as Aussie theme parks, it is still a great family day out. Our children were 8 and 14 and able to go on all the slides so we got the most use out of the park. Younger families are a bit more restricted with options though. Definitely try book a Cabana",
          "What a fantastic water park...reasonable and we'll manager...lines weren't too long either...tried all the rides one time then repeated many multiple times...reached the park after breakfast at around 12 noon and stayed till it closed. The photograph package at 550k was very",
          "Waterbomb is always a great day out! The kids and the \u201cbig kids\u201d (adults) always have so much fun the slide of the day went to the climax! Food is good and bintang is super cold. Having a gazebo for a base was great too!",
          "We all had a blast! Loved the lazy river, left the kids and floated around with the husband until the kids found us. Great system with arm bands, no need to worry about your stuff or buying food, tap your wrist band and done!",
          "Expensive for what you get and what your allowed to do varies per ride. Everything costs money and you cannot take your own food or drink. towels also cost money and no cut off shorts allowed.",
          "Nothing really to do for children aged 8-10. They are too bigger for the small slides etc. But the big slides can be overwhelming leaving nothing for them. Big waste of money, unless kids are confident in being left alone.",

          "Was unsure of what this would be like, but was blown away by the quality of the rides and the general presentation of the park. Safety was excellent (unlike the taxi ride there), and staff were friendly to the extreme. Rides varied from sedate to hari raising, so something for",
          "Visited Waterbom with 15yr old and 11 yr old, just the right size for nobody to get too lost, and soon its easy to find your way around. The rides were great (nothing as daring as Atlantis Dubai) but the staff are the friendliest and most helpful we\u2019ve ever come across, nothing",
          "Waterbom Bali is ridiculously expensive and not so great in comparison to Australian (e.g. Adventure World) and other international water parks. There aren't many rides and the water quality is poor. To get any shade you must arrive early or be prepared to be the in the sun for",

          "We had a family of 4 (2 boys ages 11 and 14) and we all found something here that we enjoyed, from the big slides, to learn to surf, and pedicure/manicure for mum. We had a cabana which really was worth the extra $'s just to have somewhere quiet to chill between rides. We also",

          "Amazing park with plenty to do. Amazingly clean and food choices that put Australian parka to shame!",

          "Everything was first class but the price for the value was amazing. I would absolutely recommend this to any family traveling to Bali on vacation.",
          "Bought the tickets off KLOOK and went two days later. We had a good time, the lines weren't too long and the staff were all chatty and hospitable. The food was decent too. It rained quite heavily while we were there and the park has great measures to sweep away water. There are",
          "10 of us visited the Waterbom park on our trip to Bali, it was fantastic. The 4 kids in our group weren't seen all day, until they got hungry and there was plenty of food options for everyone. Event he adults went on multiple slides. It was Fun for all, definitely worth a visit",
          "We went to Waterbom with a toddler, tween and teenager and everyone had heaps of rides to go on and had a great day.

          "Yup..went with my 2 youngs kids (9 & 7yo) for the 3rd time and once again they thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it from the thrilling rides to good food in an extremely fun, safe and clean environment! Kudos to Waterbom and continue to keep up the high standard.",
          "Waterbom is very well organised. There are lots of staff in every corner to make sure we are well taken care of. Even the changing area has shower foam and shampoo for bathing. The area is very clean too. Little details are put into thought in Waterbom. That makes it a",
          "Really funny but overpriced, limited slides compared to price . We have enjoyed it , staff really friendly",
          "The place is nice but too expensive for what it is. My son wasn't allowed on any of the slides because he was either too big or too small. The guy (employee) who was at the kids pool between 10am-11am on 07/12/19 didn't let him on the slide because he was \"too big\" (he is 138cm)",
          "I hadn't been to bali for a long time and had not so good stories about waterbom park. Boy was i suprised it was great, all rides and surrounding areas looked new. Plenty of food and drink spots all round great place with super friendly staff. Love it.",
          "Sweltering unseasonal heat in Bali this December. Took two kids to Water Bom Park. Cost around $135 to get in. They charge you a bond and a hire fee for towels and food is not cheap. Luckily went early and avoided the crowd. Weight Min of 45 kts for some rides and 140 kgs at top",
          "Great day there. Rides were fantastic fun. My son had an absolute ball there. Got really sick of seeing employees continually taking photos of us. Photos were quite nice but ridiculously expensive. Will go again next time we are there but you need to budget western rates",
          "Spent the day, doing slide after slide after slide with my teens and 20something eldest. They loved it. You need some energy getting up the stairs that many times, tires you out by the end of the day. The enclosed slides get quite hot and hard to breathe inside as they heat up,",
          "This is my third visit to Waterbom Park, the rides are great, park is clean, service is excellent, however the footpaths are burning hot and burn your feet, also very slippery, maybe they need to put matting down. That night I broke out in a shocking rash all over my body and",
          "My children had lots of fun. I like the convenient of the sitting area that are located everywhere. The Food is good. Clean. well maintained facilities, staff always smiling. It is just the price for big family was a bit expensive. But overall was excellent.",
          "I am very impress with everything at Waterbom Bali. From the service provided, to the amenities provided, to the food served as well as the staff there. It is really worth visiting. The staff really took effort in providing excellent service to visitors.",
          "Loved all the rides ,especially enjoyed the lazy river. Food n drinks were a bit pricey. Would definitely come back again!!",

          "We had a blast on my birthday. It was so much fun. Good variety of food. Only negative would be all the stairs you have to climb.",
          "We always make a trip down to water bomb when visiting bali. Great for kids and adults .. but can be crowded during the peak season",
          "Waterbom never make us disappointed. Otherwise they should probably do some renovations and add something new. The service was good as always and food was good too but maybe a little bit overpriced",
          "If you have a day to play in Bali, Waterbom is a great option. Areas for the super adventurous to the smallest kids. The technology used throughout the park ensured you didn't need to keep dipping into your wallet and all you had to do was choose your activity. A great day out",
          "We took two our children (age 8 and 10) and they had a great time, they didn't want to leave! They were able to go on every slide as they were over 122cm each except one with a 45kg weight minimum (to do a 360 loop!) and they did so. The facilities are very clean and staff",
          "by far the best park we have been. clean and tidy. well managed and friendly staffs. hopefully they expand to have even more water slides and activities",
          "The place was organized and the staff were friendly and helpful. The activities were fun and amazing. An adventure you wish to repeat, the entry price is very acceptable. I didn\u2019t try the restaurants but it looked clean and tidy. Security and safety means were available",
          "Very fun waterpark. The only trouble I had was with the Boomerang ride. There\u2019s a corrugated filter system right after a steep descend that caused huge bruises in my bottom so be careful not to let your bum stick out the bottom of the float as the staff won\u2019t warn you against",
          "Our family had a great day out on all the water slides, with my 7 year old girl riding all the extreme slides bar one due to not being heavy enough to push through the slide, the smile on her face was awesome. Gazebo is the only way to enjoy this experience which we did, the",

          "Went to Waterbom Bali for the second time since the last two years. Seen improvements. More food vendors but no new rides. Definitely will recommend my friends to visit Waterbom Bali. It would be nice if they expand and build new thrilling waterslides / rides.",
          "Water on definitely did not disappoint as we went as a couple and had lots of fun. Has a good range of slides and activities ranging for child friendly to moderate or exhilarating for adults! Must go for adrenaline junkies as some rides are intense",
          "What an awesome day! I went with my daughter in November 2019 and we just had the best time. It has been a long time since we have both laughed that hard. It was such a great day to just 'be a kid again' and it was also a great workout for the legs and butt with all those",
          "Really friendly staff, slides that accommodate everyone and an overall really good day out. We managed to get on all the slides at least twice and had some food and a milkshake too. Definitely recommend going here.",
          "A really enjoyable waterpark with fun and exciting slides catering for all ages. Every single member staff was so friendly and genuine, making the enviroment and the whole experience a joy to be a part of! Also the toilets were so clean, I could walk in there without shoes and",
          "Buy online tickets to make your entry as smooth as possible. The cashless system here is a great idea, easy to load up and easy to get your funds back at the end of the day. Locker hire was reasonable and hassle free. There is certainly enough and variety of slides to please",
          "Had a great day out at waterbom - great staff and great water slides! Will visit again next time in Bali.",
          "A great place for those who loves water theme park. Slides were fun and thrilling. The vibes around the park were good. Staff friendliness will just make your day better.",
          "Great family fun day out . Variety of slides though maybe missing an extreme thrill ride. Facilities great and very clean. Staff friendly and helpful",

          "I am not a waterslide kind of person but my boys convinced me we needed to try it. It was fantastic. all the slides were so much fun. safety always came first with all the staff. the Gazebo was a lovely place to base ourselves and get away from the crowds. and the food",
          "Prefect for introducing your young one(s) to the world of water adventure. We were very sceptical to get our 4yrs old, however it turned out to be the best thing. We were very happy that there were to major slides that he could do, the Viper and Python which was really",

          "is it very good place to visit to have fun time , but if you afraid from water activities don't go there you won't be able to do anything , also I tried to have a drink there (coconut) but its taste is water with lemon so its over priced .",
          "We initially weren't going to come along. Our last time attending waterbom as adults and reading the reviews was off putting for small families. My 7 and 8 year old enjoyed it so much. Lazy river got a work out! But the kids play area was amazing and the kids slides were",
          "Make sure you buy online for best deal, We did the entrance towel and lunch deal. If you get the all inclusive option you have a seperate gate to go through which skips the initial line which could be worth it in busier times",
          "Don't miss it! Our day was wonderful. The staff is exceptional. The food, the safety, the slides, everything was just perfect!",
          "It was absolutely fantastic. Went with my 3.5yrs old he was little too young but he loved the lazy river, we most of the time there. It\u2019s great to hire the gazebo to relax there. Will definitely go again when my son is it older. Staffs were ver amazing and friendly",
          "My friends and I loved Waterbom. Its a beautiful park with lots of trees and shading. We hired a cabana which was amazing as a spot to rest between rides. They come with a safe for locking up your valuables and when you buy food or drinks they will deliver it to your cabana!",
          "We had children from 3 yo to 14 yo. It is a fantastic day with rides from relaxing to exhilarating. Fun for the whole family.",
          "At no point did i feel the park was crowded even though there were probably thousands of people there, the wait for rides was usually only a few minutes if any at all. Getting the gazebo was a great option as it gave us a spot to put our stuff in a safe and have a break. All the",
          "Absolutely loved waterbom Park! Great for all ages and levels of adventure! Staff were amazing especially the people up on the slides who were more than helpful and genuinely looked like they were having fun. We will definetly be back!",
          "Enjoyed the day at Waterbom, nice way to beat the heat. Staff were very friendly. Only negative was the over inflated food prices, which is not unusual for theme parks",
          "Most of the time I\u2019ve spend on slides and this is the best park of this park! The best and the most funny smash down definitely recommend everyone because it\u2019s just looks scary. We had great time:)",
          "We had a fabulous day at Waterbom. There was something fun for all of us to do as well as being able to relax by the pool. The food was great and well priced too.",
          "Had an amazing time. Great water park clean extremely professional and friendly staff. Cannot wait to visit again.",

          "This was such a great experience. I was ready to spend the whole day with my husband and we did. We got there quite early after 9am and that was the best decision as we got to go on slides without waiting time. Later in the day waiting time got longer upto 15minutes but was",
          "We made the effort of extra travel and accepted the cost because the reviews for this place were so fabulous - and it was even better than we expected. Hire a cabana - it's a fabulous spot for retreat AND as we discovered, a safe home-base if you accidentally get separated. The",
          "We had the BEST day...Our second visit to Waterbom, this time decided to book a gazebo by the Lazy River - Perfect! The park wasn\u2019t as busy as our previous visit which was great - No long queues \ud83d\ude03 Would like a little shout out to the young cleaner at the toilets - absolutely",
          "This was one of the funnest days in Bali, I went during the \"quiet\" period so accessing the rides and facilities was easy, if you take away only one thing from this review it has to be this; rent a private hut/villa/gazebo! this will set you back approximately $40AUD and will",
          "Waterboom bali offers you everything you need for family recreation. Especially for children. We have a wonderful time in here",
          "Amazing!!! The climax slide was absolutely one of my favourite along with pipeline! They also had a ride called flow rider which is like surf boarding but of course not on a ocean, so great fun for people who don\u2019t know how to surf but want to know the feel. For the ride flow",
          "Had a great time at Waterbom. We found it convenient to pre book a gazebo at the kids pool area. It was relaxing and it came with its own safe.",
          "Certainly value for money. A full day of entertainment and fun. Reasonably priced refreshments and shelter",

          "Waterbom was one of the most iconic places i've ever visited. (Its safe) Very friendly and helpful staff. I really enjoyed my time as there were many slides suits my taste, usually when i visit aquapark i found 2 max high and thrill slides but in waterbom i found minimum 6, i",
          "Long long lines. For every slide. Spend most of the time in a line. Is lots of fun but borderline not worth doing as the lines are long. Takes away from the experience in my opinion",
          "Our visit was a lot of fun, but we stuffed up and took the scariest ride first (smash down or something). Scared the poo out of me. Other than that it was a great time.",
          "the price was expensive as once in there were rides you had to pay extra for , and and a standard price for all no spectator discounts if your not swimming",
          "Our 4yr old had a great time, would be better if he was a little taller and could go on more of the big slides, next time he should be tall enough.",
          "Despite being a childless couple in our early 30's my wife and I thought this would make a great day activity on a recent trip to Seminyak. Here are a few of my thoughts * This is a very well set up, safe and hygienic waterpark located in Kuta. It's standards seem similar to",
          "Had a blast!! Alot to do and great restaurants around the park, friendly staff, couldnt of asked for more",
          "We went in Nov, lines short so no wait times we were there 12-6pm. Staff very friendly, kids loved it we took our 4 and 7 year old boys who went on all the slides they were tall enough for 110cm and 125cm. Only issue was the floor around the place is very sloppy even when",
          "We have 2 teenagers and were lucky enough to go on a quiet day so there was no waiting around for rides. The kids (and adults) really enjoyed their day and would highly recommend this.",
          "Everything we could have imagined and then some. Slides were so much fun with next to no line up time at all. The park was impecibly clean and so well run. Can't wait to go back",
          "Park is fun but water not treated my 8 year got bali belly after a day at waterbom so be prepared for sick kids",
          "I wasn\u2019t a water slide person until we went here! I went on every slide multiple times because of how much heart stopping fun I was having. Recommend this place for all ages!! Staff are amazing and amenities fantastic. Cannot fault the place. Thanks for having us!",
          "A relatively peaceful day out in the busy streets of Bali. Grab your swimmers, towel and sunscreen and just go and have fun......",
          "What a perfect family day! Went twice. Very well organized. Food and drink however very expensive. FUN!",
          "We visited Waterbom Park this week and it was fantastic! I have already been a lot of times but I have never hired a cabana before, this is something that I would highly reccommend! It was so easy and convenient for the family! There was a safe, it was shaded, we didn't have to",
          "We enjoyed all the rides there. But the place is not big, we managed to complete all the rides around 1pm. The food is good and all the staff there are friendly.",
          "The kids had a blast! They took advantage of all of the rides they possibly could! The food was on point as well! Highly recommend! Worth every cent!",
          "The park is very clean and the staff are excellent. Wait times during our visit on a Wednesday 6th November were less than 5 minutes and often there was no wait. A big surprise was how amazing the park food was. We ate at the Italian place which actually serves a wide range of",
          "Great customer service, excellent facilities. Love the cashless transactions, and choices of food inside. Hope to have more lounges available around pool area",
          "Good price with lots of amenities. Dont get towels till the end as you wont need them till you want to leave. Lots of food and drink options to suit anyone and lockers to put your stuff away. They give you a wrist band when you arrive and you load that up with cash for food,",
          "Had a great time hanging with the friends, the staff were very friendly & it was a great atmosphere. Hired one of the large Gazebos which was awesome, plenty of space & the extra towels came in handy. We will visit again when back in Bali next.",

          "I\u2019ve visited the water bomb park a few times now and make an effort to visit every time I\u2019m in Bali - which is almost yearly. The park is well run, clean and you don\u2019t spend hours in a line waiting for a ride. There\u2019s rides that suit all ages, lots of food places and you put",
          "My wife & I were one day in waterboom bali and we enjoyed very much with all activities there. It is very beautiful although simple design. You can have very peacefull enivroment with your family there and also have a little exciting moments.",
          "All workers were extremely polite and caring. Great day out, felt very safe. 9yo and 6yo could go on every slide and they loved it!",
          "This was our second visit to Waterbom in three years. We were just as impressed second time round with the facilities, staff and value for money. It\u2019s clean, well maintained and modern. The cashless system is efficient and waterparks in Australia should look to Waterbom as an",
          "Super friendly staff and clean facilities. There\u2019s something for all ages and my daughters (5 & 8) loved it! We enjoyed it so much we went back for a second time. Would highly recommend",
          "Overpriced for what it is. Around 45 AUD entry. Then more for hire of locker towels etc. The slides are good but I cannot believe this is Asia\u2019s number one water park. There is only a couple of big slides Compared to QLD water parks it is average but unlike water parks in",
          "A great day for all, we travelled with 2 families of 5 and there was something for everyone Entry was a little steep on the price side and the package included food but neither the booking site or staff at entry told us it was from a set menu. Food was good but was surprised",
          "A great day, value for money!!!!! So many wonderful slides, the kids had a ball. We booked a gazebo. Would highly recommend, as it gave us a \u201chome base\u201d when everyone did different activities.",
          "Not much is needed as I am sure you can see from many reviews that this place is amazing! Very clean, well run and organized. Lots of staff on hand to help out. Food options are good, easy to access and a great time is had by children and adults alike!",
          "It's a really cool and fun place and full of excitement and safe as well but the only thing that got us was the locker u need to go to lockers desk and book one that was not clear for us but overall it's a great place",
          "Was a fantastic day out for all. 12,10,8,6,4&1 year olds all ball. Best pad Thai I\u2019ve ever had in my life at their Thai restaurant \ud83e\udd24 Everything was so clean & all the staff were extremely friendly. My husband & sister in law kept up with the bigger kids while my brother in law",

          "Visited as a couple. Booked the total package and a private bungalow, $210AUD total. Package included entry at special gate where we were welcomed with cold towels and drinks. Escorted to our bungalow. Package also included lunch and 1 drink, towel hire, ALL photos made",

          "It was a great family fun day and there was plenty of options that you could stick to what you felt comfortable with or be like my dare devil husband and do them all! We took our 9 year old and she was quite scared at first so it was good there were rides we could do in pairs",

          "Waterbom is pretty expensive in Bali terms so I recommend booking online for the discount if you can. Food and drink is up there price wise too. We arrived mid morning so unfortunately only found 2 sunlounges next to each other when we were a party of 5. Went on a few rides but",
          "Staff were extremely helpful even when I over booked tickets and lost items. Overall the park was safe and fun. We will be back next year.",
          "Well spread out with heaps of rides, the food was good and the line ups were reasonable, a great place to spend a day and the cashless system, load up on your wristband works well.",
          "Me and my Fiance had a Wonderful day at Waterbom. We purchased the VIP Entry which included lunch (We could choose from anywhere), it included my 60 minute massage which was the best i had while in Bali. My Partner got hair braiding done - looked great. we felt very welcome -",
          "We spent a full day here as a family - 2 adults and 2 children, aged 9 & 7. They cater for all ages, and plenty of lovely grassy areas to sit. The cashless system they use is so easy, and full refunds are offered for unused credit.",
          "Took the kids to Waterbom and had a great time...why?, because it was good to be at a public facility that actually had a high degree of risk involved, (excepting of course that infamous US backed Gold Coast venue). As myself my wife 8 yo and 11 yo trotted around through the",

We weren\u2019t sure whether it would be mostly small children or not (it wasn\u2019t) and were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the slides and the amazing",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you come to Bali. Some fantastic rides and attractions, and very well laid out park and detail. Our favourite was the boomerang ride. Park also got quieter after 4pm which was ideal for shorter queue times. Our only gripe for Asia\u2019s number 1 water",
          "We visited with our 2 teenage boys and overall had a good day. There were plenty of things to do, and the park was well maintained and kept clean. We paidfor a gazebo, which we probably didn't need, but it meant we had guaranteed shade, which was worth it for us. We had booked",
          "We\u2019re a couple in our 30\u2019s and had the best day at Waterbom! The slides are awesome, lots of options and being off season, we didn\u2019t have to wait too long in line. It\u2019s pretty pricey (approx $55AUD) for entry plus food, drinks, locker hire etc but well worth it if you\u2019re",
          "Waterbom Park was fantastic. Clean, great rides, good variety of food, can get hair braided, massage, swim up bar, play water volley ball or just lay and sunbake or read a book playing tag with the rest of the group to keep an eye on the children. Be aware there is a height",

          "Was really fun and a great experience, we have been to other water parks in SE Asia and this was really a great one. There are a large amount of rides and the queues were nice and short. The park is spotless and run very well and everything is super convenient.",

          "Great water park, lots of rides suitable for different ages. If you can get a gazebo gives you a bit of privacy, somewhere to leave your stuff and a meeting point for everyone as the park is pretty big. Entry is quite cheap but drinks and food your paying Aussie prices.",

          "An awesome place to spend a day in. Waiting time for famous and big slides is max. 15 mins. Extreme slides have less waiting time if not even Zero. Spotless clean, from A to Z.",
          "One of the best waterparks I have been to.\nWe had a small incident on a ride and were taken immediately to a really friendly first aid team (been twice before with no incident, and was riding again after), a wide variety of rides and amazing scenary.\n\nBest lazy river I have been on.",
          "Nice waterpark. Too many people allowed to enter and therefor long waiting for slides. Staff generally nice however also ready to rip you off. For everything they 'give' you, you pay a deposit...that you should get back after returning the \u2026",
          "Great fun! Slides for all confidence levels. Fun day!",
          "This was very cool,\nThe only thing that I didnt like was the system of money on the card, to use for tje locker, food. Was very expensive !",

          "Loads of fun - spent 2 whole days there this trip.  best slides!",
          "A place to play in Bali. They have lots of choices, and they always making sure the safety of their guest.",
          "The best Waterpark I've ever been to. Everything was so clean and beautiful, the staff was amazing, lines were acceptable even though there was a lot people. Worth hiring a gazebo. You can order your food there and enjoy the day in peace. \u2026",
          "Very good, beats the Gold coast for number of top rides. Good value for money turned up at 8am and kids were still going at 4pm. Would definitely be one of the best parks we've ever been to.",
          "This park is awesome. Came in October, minimal crowds, reasonably price food, tidy, little bit of balineese flavour and the staff are awesome and super friendly. For us, compared to the parks on the GC, this was much better. We had a great day here. Family of five.",
          "Had the best experience in here!! But unfortunately for me the ticket is too expensive",
          "Who says you can't bring your 3yr old here and still have fun! Their kids area is amazing. Reasonable priced food. Good rides. Best water park in Bali!",

          "I would like to come again. This place very recomended for family",
          "Great day out. Lots of fun waterslides. Would highly recommend.",
          "Best waterpark ever!! Staff cannot do enough for you. Need to get there 30min before opening time to book a gazebo. Is a good workout day so be prepared to walk stairs if you love fast rides, if not just cruise in the lazy river. The best rides for the whole family and thrill seekers",

          "Brilliant attraction. \n\nPricing is questionable, however, with a local rate and a foreigner rate.\n\nSome shops nearby that will sell discounted tickets. Alternatively, entering with Indonesian or Balinese speakers is sufficient to get the local rate.",
          "The best waterboom in Bali and maybe Indonesia and also SE Asia. Nice people, nice wahana and nice food. Cheap and also very best place for cozy and relaxing too.",
          "on main attractions, the joints on the slides are really hurting your back even if you keep your back arch how they advising you to do...the rest is ok",
          "If you need a place to have fun with a group of friends, this will be a perfect option. The slides are mostly body slide which were a lot of fun and thrilling. My suggestion is go for the easiest one with tire floatation: constrictor, before heading to other more thrilling one such as boomerang then go for the body slide ones.",
          "Absolutely fantastic. More on the costly side, but with it. Staff are fantastic and attentive, slides are great, and can easily spend a full day there. Highly recommend.",

          "Excellent fun. All different types of slides and pools suitable for all ages. Some of the best water slides I've ever been on. Smash Down 2.0 would have to be the most thrilling.

          "The best Waterpark I've been to in my life! Amazing scenery, extremely clean and well organized, and most importantly tons of water slides ranging from beginner to extreme. Top notch systems with cashless tags and lockers. Lines moved fairly quickly. Food not too expensive. Great value overall. Would definitely visit again.",
          "Best waterpark I\u2019ve ever been to and that\u2019s a strong statement as waterparks are my wheelhouse and I\u2019ve been to plenty in my time. Cheap entry fee, great location, minimal wait for slides plus the food is awesome. No wonder it\u2019s rated one of the best in the Southern Hemisphere, I agree!",
          "Great fun for kids; excellent rides. Staff are attentive and very friendly. Food selection is decent for an amusement park.\nCon: a bit pricey.",

          "Lots of fun. The glides are quite thrilling. It was quite quiet during our visit. Almost no waiting time. Half a day is enough to do our favorite glides several times. Food is good but of course a little more expensive than outside the \u2026",

          "Never had a bad visit.  Well maintained and managed.  Great work",

          "Very fun place to visit. I totally enjoy my time playing water here",
          "It's so great, hire a gazebo which has a safe and take own towels to reduce price.  Last time we couldn't take water in but this time was ok. Be prepared to be exhausted after a full day of fun!!",
          "Kids and big kids loved it although the big bucket that tips water out on top of kids area is a bit hectic for the little ones. Also the children's water slides should be available to the children who find the big water slides too scary.",
          "Great family day out. 3rd time in Bali and 3rd time at Waterbom. Getting a gazebo for the day is definitely worth it.",
          "Very clean and nice for children and amazing staff",
          "Fantastic waterpark! Honestly, we liked it even better than the famous Atlantis i  the Bahamas. No long lines for slides (April). Decent food options. Friendly staff. Loved the \"cashless\" set up - not having to carry wallet around.",

          "For Bali standards that was expensive but definitely quite a lot of fun. The staff with a great working attitude is there to assist you at all slides and there are many different levels of speed and thrill.\n\nYou can claim some great action \u2026",
          "This is the best place. Plan to spend all day, get a day bed - amazing for kids.",
          "Small in comparison with water parks in Europe/Australasia but still had the wow factor and big rides. Lacked a wave pool",
          "This place did not let us down. The park is well run, extremely clean and has attractions for all ages and bravery levels. On first look it's expensive for Indonesia but compared to a western attraction it is cheap and well worth the dosh. \u2026",
          "Best waterpark ever! Fun for the whole family.  Young and Old",
          "Very well organized, in fact the best organized water park I've ever been to. Locker, payment and photo identification via bracelet. Food was well above average for a fun park. \n\nThere are slides for every taste, moderate waiting times.\n\nWill definitely come back next time around.",

          "You will have an amazing time all day",
          "I used to rate it five stars, but many things are 2-3 times more expensive than 18 months ago. Still very clean and the best water park I have been to and great day, but just not the old bali value. It was also the busiest I have seen it \u2026",
          "So much fun!! Very clean, well run facility. Staff ensured safety always! Lots of options for food and drink inside however I just played. Make sure you do walk around and get the most out of the park as it is spread out and lota of \u2026",
          "The friendly staff and lush pathways really bring this place to life. While it can be a little hard to get where you want to go, the park isn't too big that you won't find another route to the slides or features you're looking for. \u2026",
          "It was very fun! Great waterpark, great experience, clean facilities",
          "This is a beautiful park just as the other reviews all state. I think it is fairly large so I don't agree with some of the complaints that it is small. It's as large as the well known water parks in my home state of Florida. Here I get \u2026",
          "A great place to spend a day (and a lot of $$$!) With really exhilarating slides for the whole family. I got to try the Flowrider I always wanted and loved it (IDR125,000 extra for 30mins). We missed out on hiring a gazebo but just got a \u2026",

          "Amazing! It was so fun. If u in bali, u must try",
          "Absolutely loved it and would go every weekend of I could ( for a women in late 30s says a lot). Waterslides were awesome, good variation of excitement and fear levels! You have to walk so many steps to get to the top each time but so worth \u2026",
          "Very good aqua park you will have fun",
          "Situated in the heart of Kuta across from the Discovery Mall, Waterbom park is a huge tourist attraction. Not only because of the numerous amount of water slides or the tranquil lazy river, it\u2019s also because of the amazing staff  who do \u2026",
          "Fabulous day out. Make sure you get there at opening time, that way you get a few slides in without waiting in line. The park is SUPER clean all the facilities are cleaned pretty much after every use (toilets). Staff are all very kind and \u2026",
          "Many great water activities! We had a lot of fun and a great time. The prices were just way too high. You couldn't buy anything there because it was just so expensive. Especially average Indonesians can not just go there because of the prices.",
          "Around 12 adult rides which were quite good. \nNice children area to swim with slides and splash zone..loads of food option and free towels (deposit needs to be paid ).everything in the park works with a wristband where you load cash to it to spend as no cash is allowed",

          "Fun waterpark and the use of a band system ,(to save carrying money around) is great. Would fully recommend going here",

          "Spent a day there. Very pleasing and very joyful. The place is nice. Very clean. Services are really good. Utilities and attire is very complete. We had a nice time while we were there. Very recommended",
          "Good slide but nothing special for people who dont like it just one swimming pool and very very slow river. If you want to chill in jazzuzi or swimming pool its definately not place for you",

          "So, so good! So glad I made the journey to this place. I actually tried to book my tickets on their website and get the 15% discount but it wouldn't work for some reason. That was absolutely fine because I went to the their customer service \u2026",
          "Too many rules. Some places u can not visit/test in pants with zip",
          "Very clean. Happy customer service. Great rides. All safe. Good waterpark!",
          "How a water park should be!\n\nThis is a great water park with plenty of rides for those looking for adventure.  Definitely less on offer if you're looking for slower pace, which is probably the only minor disappointment - although we did at \u2026",

          "Overall, it is a very nice place, it has a lot of rides and you can easily spend the whole day in the park. The ticket's price I feel it is a bit expensive. The bracelet system is good and \"impressive\" but I feel it needs some improvements, \u2026",
          "It\u2019s the Best waterpark i been in my life. Not that big but all the styles of slide can think of is there. They take care of small details like they provide in the shower area two types of water part for just cold water and the other has hot and cold water also both provided with shampoo and body soap!",

          "It's definetly a place you have to see once. The down side is the price 170 odd AUD for a family of 4 and they charge you extra for a couple of rides inside. Cafe had good food that was reasonably priced. Kids loved the fun park.",

          "This place is awesome, everything from thrill rides to just lazily drifting around a stream. I went on all but the Smash Down 2.0. I admit it, I am a grown man but I was a little scaredie-cat when it came to that one. I went on the \u2026",

          "Beautiful waterpark. The place has a lot of attractions and for a mid summer Thursday it was not busy at all. The food was OK but also for an OK price. If you are visiting Bali and have time (and money) I would definitely recommend the place.",

          "Awesome day out with friends with kids of all ages. Also great for the parents who like being kids again!",
          "Amazing, very clean too. A huge amount of slides and water activities to have. I would suggest that if you like that sort of thing that 1 day is probably not quite enough.",
          "A really great place to take the whole family, excellent and friendly staff, great facilities, reasonable prices. You can't geta free water refill, so have to buy drinking water which is a shame. Food court has many different options at \u2026",
          "Brilliant day out for the family. There's enough to keep even the youngest and smallest children happy. Most bigger rides have a strict height restrictment which annoyed our 5 year old who is under 110cm.\nThe onsite Thai restaurant is \u2026",

        "wiki": "Bali () is a province of Indonesia and the westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. Located east of Java and west of Lombok, the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan. The provincial capital, Denpasar, is the most populous city in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia. Bali is the only Hindu-majority province in Indonesia, with 83.5% of the population adhering to Balinese Hinduism.Bali is Indonesia's main tourist destination, with a significant rise in tourism since the 1980s. Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its economy. It is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. The Indonesian International Film Festival is held every year in Bali. Other international events held in Bali include the Miss World 2013 and 2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. In March 2017, TripAdvisor named Bali as the world's top destination in its Traveller's Choice award.Bali is part of the Coral Triangle, the area with the highest biodiversity of marine species especially fish and turtles. In this area alone, over 500 reef-building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about seven times as many as in the entire Caribbean. Bali is the home of the Subak irrigation system, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is also home to a unified confederation of kingdoms composed of 10 traditional royal Balinese houses, each house ruling a specific geographic area. The confederation is the successor of the Bali Kingdom. The royal houses are not recognised by the government of Indonesia; however, they originated before Dutch colonisation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient ===\nBali was inhabited around 2000 BCE by Austronesian people who migrated originally from the island of Taiwan to Southeast Asia and Oceania through Maritime Southeast Asia. Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are closely related to the people of the Indonesian archipelago, Malaysia, the Philippines and Oceania. Stone tools dating from this time have been found near the village of Cekik in the island's west.In ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, namely Pasupata, Bhairawa, Siwa Shidanta, Vaishnava, Bodha, Brahma, Resi, Sora and Ganapatya. Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal Godhead.Inscriptions from 896 and 911 do not mention a king, until 914, when Sri Kesarivarma is mentioned. They also reveal an independent Bali, with a distinct dialect, where Buddhism and Sivaism were practised simultaneously. Mpu Sindok's great-granddaughter, Mahendradatta (Gunapriyadharmapatni), married the Bali king Udayana Warmadewa (Dharmodayanavarmadeva) around 989, giving birth to Airlangga around 1001. This marriage also brought more Hinduism and Javanese culture to Bali. Princess Sakalendukirana appeared in 1098. Suradhipa reigned from 1115 to 1119, and Jayasakti from 1146 until 1150. Jayapangus appears on inscriptions between 1178 and 1181, while Adikuntiketana and his son Paramesvara in 1204.\n\nBalinese culture was strongly influenced by Indian, Chinese, and particularly Hindu culture, beginning around the 1st century AD. The name Bali dwipa (\"Bali island\") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by Sri Kesari Warmadewa in 914 AD and mentioning Walidwipa. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system subak to grow rice in wet-field cultivation. Some religious and cultural traditions still practised today can be traced to this period.\nThe Hindu Majapahit Empire (1293\u20131520 AD) on eastern Java founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of Hayam Wuruk is mentioned in the charters of 1384\u201386. Mass Javanese immigration to Bali occurred in the next century when the Majapahit Empire fell in 1520. Bali's government then became an independent collection of Hindu kingdoms which led to a Balinese national identity and major enhancements in culture, arts, and economy. The nation with various kingdoms became independent for up to 386 years until 1906, when the Dutch subjugated and repulsed the natives for economic control and took it over.\n\n\n=== Portuguese contacts ===\nThe first known European contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1512, when a Portuguese expedition led by Antonio Abreu and Francisco Serr\u00e3o sighted its northern shores. It was the first expedition of a series of bi-annual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century usually travelled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands. Bali was also mapped in 1512, in the chart of Francisco Rodrigues, aboard the expedition. In 1585, a ship foundered off the Bukit Peninsula and left a few Portuguese in the service of Dewa Agung.\n\n\n=== Dutch East Indies ===\n\nIn 1597, the Dutch explorer Cornelis de Houtman arrived at Bali, and the Dutch East India Company was established in 1602. The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century (see Dutch East Indies). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various competing for Balinese realms against each other. In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.\nIn June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at Buleleng on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his Wallace Line theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and Lombok. It is a boundary between species. In his travel memoir The Malay Archipelago, Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, of which has a strong mention of the unique Balinese irrigation methods:\n\nI was both astonished and delighted; for as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly undulating plain extends from the seacoast about ten or twelve miles (16 or 19 kilometres) inland, where it is bounded by a fine range of wooded and cultivated hills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of coconut palms, tamarind and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every direction; while between them extend luxurious rice-grounds, watered by an elaborate system of irrigation that would be the pride of the best-cultivated parts of Europe. \nThe Dutch mounted large naval and ground assaults at the Sanur region in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who rather than yield to the superior Dutch force committed ritual suicide (puputan) to avoid the humiliation of surrender. Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 200 Balinese killed themselves rather than surrender. In the Dutch intervention in Bali, a similar mass suicide occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in Klungkung. Afterwards, the Dutch governours exercised administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and Maluku.\nIn the 1930s, anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, artists Miguel Covarrubias and Walter Spies, and musicologist Colin McPhee all spent time here. Their accounts of the island and its peoples created a western image of Bali as \"an enchanted land of aesthetes at peace with themselves and nature\". Western tourists began to visit the island. The sensuous image of Bali was enhanced in the West by a quasi-pornographic 1932 documentary Virgins of Bali about a day in the lives of two teenage Balinese girls whom the film's narrator Deane Dickason notes in the first scene \"bathe their shamelessly nude bronze bodies\". Under the looser version of the Hays code that existed up to 1934, nudity involving \"civilised\" (i.e. white) women was banned, but permitted with \"uncivilised\" (i.e. all non-white women), a loophole that was exploited by the producers of Virgins of Bali. The film, which mostly consisted of scenes of topless Balinese women was a great success in 1932, and almost single-handedly made Bali into a popular spot for tourists.\n\nImperial Japan occupied Bali during World War II. It was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on Borneo were inoperative due to heavy rains, the Imperial Japanese Army decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps Prajoda (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942, the Japanese forces landed near the town of Sanoer [Sanur]. The island was quickly captured.During the Japanese occupation, a Balinese military officer, Gusti Ngurah Rai, formed a Balinese 'freedom army'. The harshness of Japanese occupation forces made them more resented than the Dutch colonial rulers.\n\n\n=== Independence from the Dutch ===\nIn 1945, Bali was liberated by the British and Indian 5th infantry Division under the command of Major-General Robert Mansergh who took the Japanese surrender. Once the Japanese forces had been repatriated the island was handed over to the Dutch the following year.\nIn 1946, the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed State of East Indonesia, a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia, which was proclaimed and headed by Sukarno and Hatta. Bali was included in the \"Republic of the United States of Indonesia\" when the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence on 29 December 1949. The first governor of Bali, Anak Agung Bagus Suteja, was appointed by President Sukarno in 1958, when Bali became a province.\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\nThe 1963 eruption of Mount Agung killed thousands, created economic havoc and forced many displaced Balinese to be transmigrated to other parts of Indonesia. Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional caste system, and those rejecting this system. Politically, the opposition was represented by supporters of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further increased by the PKI's land reform programs. An attempted coup in Jakarta was put down by forces led by General Suharto.\nThe army became the dominant power as it instigated a violent anti-communist purge, in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup. Most estimates suggest that at least 500,000 people were killed across Indonesia, with an estimated 80,000 killed in Bali, equivalent to 5% of the island's population. With no Islamic forces involved as in Java and Sumatra, upper-caste PNI landlords led the extermination of PKI members.As a result of the 1965\u201366 upheavals, Suharto was able to manoeuvre Sukarno out of the presidency. His \"New Order\" government reestablished relations with western countries. The pre-War Bali as \"paradise\" was revived in a modern form. The resulting large growth in tourism has led to a dramatic increase in Balinese standards of living and significant foreign exchange earned for the country. A bombing in 2002 by militant Islamists in the tourist area of Kuta killed 202 people, mostly foreigners. This attack, and another in 2005, severely reduced tourism, producing much economic hardship to the island.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe island of Bali lies 3.2 km (2.0 mi) east of Java, and is approximately 8 degrees south of the equator. Bali and Java are separated by the Bali Strait. East to west, the island is approximately 153 km (95 mi) wide and spans approximately 112 km (70 mi) north to south; administratively it covers 5,780 km2 (2,230 sq mi), or 5,577 km2 (2,153 sq mi) without Nusa Penida District; its population density is roughly 750 people/km2 (1,900 people/sq mi).\nBali's central mountains include several peaks over 2,000 metres (6,600 feet) in elevation and active volcanoes such as Mount Batur. The highest is Mount Agung (3,031 m, 9,944 ft), known as the \"mother mountain\", which is an active volcano rated as one of the world's most likely sites for a massive eruption within the next 100 years. In late 2017 Mount Agung started erupting and large numbers of people were evacuated, temporarily closing the island's airport. Mountains range from centre to the eastern side, with Mount Agung the easternmost peak. Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector. South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee-producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle. The longest river, Ayung River, flows approximately 75 km (47 mi) (see List of rivers of Bali).\nThe island is surrounded by coral reefs. Beaches in the south tend to have white sand while those in the north and west have black sand. Bali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small sampan boats. Black sand beaches between Pasut and Klatingdukuh are being developed for tourism, but apart from the seaside temple of Tanah Lot, they are not yet used for significant tourism.\nThe largest city is the provincial capital, Denpasar, near the southern coast. Its population is around 491,500 (2002). Bali's second-largest city is the old colonial capital, Singaraja, which is located on the north coast and is home to around 100,000 people. Other important cities include the beach resort, Kuta, which is practically part of Denpasar's urban area, and Ubud, situated at the north of Denpasar, is the island's cultural centre.Three small islands lie to the immediate south-east and all are administratively part of the Klungkung regency of Bali: Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan. These islands are separated from Bali by the Badung Strait.\nTo the east, the Lombok Strait separates Bali from Lombok and marks the biogeographical division between the fauna of the Indomalayan realm and the distinctly different fauna of Australasia. The transition is known as the Wallace Line, named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who first proposed a transition zone between these two major biomes. When sea levels dropped during the Pleistocene ice age, Bali was connected to Java and Sumatra and to the mainland of Asia and shared the Asian fauna, but the deep water of the Lombok Strait continued to keep Lombok Island and the Lesser Sunda archipelago isolated.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBeing just 8 degrees south of the equator, Bali has a fairly even climate all year round. Average year-round temperature stands at around 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) with a humidity level of about 85%.Day time temperatures at low elevations vary between 20 to 33 \u00b0C (68 to 91 \u00b0F), but the temperatures decrease significantly with increasing elevation.\nThe west monsoon is in place from approximately October to April, and this can bring significant rain, particularly from December to March. During the rainy season, there are comparatively fewer tourists seen in Bali. During the Easter and Christmas holidays, the weather is very unpredictable. Outside of the monsoon period, humidity is relatively low and any rain is unlikely in lowland areas.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nBali lies just to the west of the Wallace Line, and thus has a fauna that is Asian in character, with very little Australasian influence, and has more in common with Java than with Lombok. An exception is the yellow-crested cockatoo, a member of a primarily Australasian family. There are around 280 species of birds, including the critically endangered Bali myna, which is endemic. Others include barn swallow, black-naped oriole, black racket-tailed treepie, crested serpent-eagle, crested treeswift, dollarbird, Java sparrow, lesser adjutant, long-tailed shrike, milky stork, Pacific swallow, red-rumped swallow, sacred kingfisher, sea eagle, woodswallow, savanna nightjar, stork-billed kingfisher, yellow-vented bulbul and great egret.\nUntil the early 20th century, Bali was home to several large mammals: the wild banteng, leopard and the endemic Bali tiger. The banteng still occurs in its domestic form, whereas leopards are found only in neighbouring Java, and the Bali tiger is extinct. The last definite record of a tiger on Bali dates from 1937, when one was shot, though the subspecies may have survived until the 1940s or 1950s.\n\nSquirrels are quite commonly encountered, less often is the Asian palm civet, which is also kept in coffee farms to produce kopi luwak. Bats are well represented, perhaps the most famous place to encounter them remaining is the Goa Lawah (Temple of the Bats) where they are worshipped by the locals and also constitute a tourist attraction. They also occur in other cave temples, for instance at Gangga Beach. Two species of monkey occur. The crab-eating macaque, known locally as \"kera\", is quite common around human settlements and temples, where it becomes accustomed to being fed by humans, particularly in any of the three \"monkey forest\" temples, such as the popular one in the Ubud area. They are also quite often kept as pets by locals. The second monkey, endemic to Java and some surrounding islands such as Bali, is far rarer and more elusive and is the Javan langur, locally known as \"lutung\". They occur in a few places apart from the West Bali National Park. They are born an orange colour, though by their first year they would have already changed to a more blackish colouration. In Java, however, there is more of a tendency for this species to retain its juvenile orange colour into adulthood, and a mixture of black and orange monkeys can be seen together as a family. Other rarer mammals include the leopard cat, Sunda pangolin and black giant squirrel.\nSnakes include the king cobra and reticulated python. The water monitor can grow to at least 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in length and 50 kg (110 lb) and can move quickly.\nThe rich coral reefs around the coast, particularly around popular diving spots such as Tulamben, Amed, Menjangan or neighbouring Nusa Penida, host a wide range of marine life, for instance hawksbill turtle, giant sunfish, giant manta ray, giant moray eel, bumphead parrotfish, hammerhead shark, reef shark, barracuda, and sea snakes. Dolphins are commonly encountered on the north coast near Singaraja and Lovina.A team of scientists conducted a survey from 29 April 2011 to 11 May 2011 at 33 sea sites around Bali. They discovered 952 species of reef fish of which 8 were new discoveries at Pemuteran, Gilimanuk, Nusa Dua, Tulamben and Candidasa, and 393 coral species, including two new ones at Padangbai and between Padangbai and Amed. The average coverage level of healthy coral was 36% (better than in Raja Ampat and Halmahera by 29% or in Fakfak and Kaimana by 25%) with the highest coverage found in Gili Selang and Gili Mimpang in Candidasa, Karangasem regency.Among the larger trees the most common are: banyan trees, jackfruit, coconuts, bamboo species, acacia trees and also endless rows of coconuts and banana species. Numerous flowers can be seen: hibiscus, frangipani, bougainvillea, poinsettia, oleander, jasmine, water lily, lotus, roses, begonias, orchids and hydrangeas exist. On higher grounds that receive more moisture, for instance around Kintamani, certain species of fern trees, mushrooms and even pine trees thrive well. Rice comes in many varieties. Other plants with agricultural value include: salak, mangosteen, corn, kintamani orange, coffee and water spinach.\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\nOver-exploitation by the tourist industry has led to 200 out of 400 rivers on the island dry up. Research suggests that the southern part of Bali would face a water shortage. To ease the shortage, the central government plans to build a water catchment and processing facility at Petanu River in Gianyar. The 300 litres capacity of water per second will be channelled to Denpasar, Badung and Gianyar in 2013.A 2010 Environment Ministry report on its environmental quality index gave Bali a score of 99.65, which was the highest score of Indonesia's 33 provinces. The score considers the level of total suspended solids, dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand in water.Erosion at Lebih Beach has seen seven metres (23 feet) of land lost every year. Decades ago, this beach was used for holy pilgrimages with more than 10,000 people, but they have now moved to Masceti Beach.In 2017, a year when Bali received nearly 5.7 million tourists, government officials declared a \u201cgarbage emergency\u201d in response to the covering of 3.6 mile stretch of coastline in plastic waste brought in by the tide, amid concerns that the pollution could dissuade visitors from returning. Indonesia is one of the world's worst plastic polluters, with some estimates suggesting the country is the source of around 10 per cent of the world's plastic waste. Indonesia's capital city Jakarta features several large rubbish dumps and it is common to see swaths of plastics bobbing on the city's few waterways.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe province is divided into eight regencies (kabupaten) and one city (kota). These are, with their areas and populations:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nIn 1970s, the Balinese economy was largely agriculture-based in terms of both output and employment. Tourism is now the largest single industry in terms of income, and as a result, Bali is one of Indonesia's wealthiest regions. In 2003, around 80% of Bali's economy was tourism related. By end of June 2011, the rate of non-performing loans of all banks in Bali were 2.23%, lower than the average of Indonesian banking industry non-performing loan rates (about 5%). The economy, however, suffered significantly as a result of the Islamists' terrorist bombings in 2002 and 2005. The tourism industry has since recovered from these events.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nAlthough tourism produces the GDP's largest output, agriculture is still the island's biggest employer. Fishing also provides a significant number of jobs. Bali is also famous for its artisans who produce a vast array of handicrafts, including batik and ikat cloth and clothing, wooden carvings, stone carvings, painted art and silverware. Notably, individual villages typically adopt a single product, such as wind chimes or wooden furniture.\nThe Arabica coffee production region is the highland region of Kintamani near Mount Batur. Generally, Balinese coffee is processed using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency. Typical flavours include lemon and other citrus notes. Many coffee farmers in Kintamani are members of a traditional farming system called Subak Abian, which is based on the Hindu philosophy of \"Tri Hita Karana\". According to this philosophy, the three causes of happiness are good relations with God, other people, and the environment. The Subak Abian system is ideally suited to the production of fair trade and organic coffee production. Arabica coffee from Kintamani is the first product in Indonesia to request a geographical indication.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nIn 1963 the Bali Beach Hotel in Sanur was built by Sukarno and boosted tourism in Bali. Before the construction of the Bali Beach Hotel, there were only three significant tourist-class hotels on the island. Construction of hotels and restaurants began to spread throughout Bali. Tourism further increased on Bali after the Ngurah Rai International Airport opened in 1970. The Buleleng regency government encouraged the tourism sector as one of the mainstays for economic progress and social welfare.\nThe tourism industry is primarily focused in the south, while also significant in the other parts of the island. The main tourist locations are the town of Kuta (with its beach), and its outer suburbs of Legian and Seminyak (which were once independent townships), the east coast town of Sanur (once the only tourist hub), Ubud towards the centre of the island, to the south of the Ngurah Rai International Airport, Jimbaran and the newer developments of Nusa Dua and Pecatu.\nThe United States government lifted its travel warnings in 2008. The Australian government issued an advisory on Friday, 4 May 2012, with the overall level of this advisory lowered to 'Exercise a high degree of caution'. The Swedish government issued a new warning on Sunday, 10 June 2012 because of one tourist who died from methanol poisoning. Australia last issued an advisory on Monday, 5 January 2015 due to new terrorist threats.\n\nAn offshoot of tourism is the growing real estate industry. Bali's real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5-star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the south side of the island. Expensive villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic, many Jakarta individuals and companies are fairly active, investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.\nIn the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors improved value for their currencies.\nBali's tourism economy survived the Islamists terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has slowly recovered and surpassed its pre terrorist bombing levels; the longterm trend has been a steady increase of visitor arrivals. In 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists, which surpassed the target of 2.0\u20132.3 million tourists. The average occupancy of starred hotels achieved 65%, so the island still should be able to accommodate tourists for some years without any addition of new rooms/hotels, although at the peak season some of them are fully booked.\nBali received the Best Island award from Travel and Leisure in 2010. Bali won because of its attractive surroundings (both mountain and coastal areas), diverse tourist attractions, excellent international and local restaurants, and the friendliness of the local people. The Balinese culture and its religion are also considered as the main factor of the award. One of the most prestigious events that symbolize a strong relationship between a god and its followers is Kecak dance. According to BBC Travel released in 2011, Bali is one of the World's Best Islands, ranking second after Santorini, Greece.In 2006, Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir Eat, Pray, Love was published, and in August 2010 it was adapted into the film Eat Pray Love. It took place at Ubud and Padang-Padang Beach at Bali. Both the book and the film fuelled a boom in tourism in Ubud, the hill town and cultural and tourist centre that was the focus of Gilbert's quest for balance and love through traditional spirituality and healing.In January 2016, after musician David Bowie died, it was revealed that in his will, Bowie asked for his ashes to be scattered in Bali, conforming to Buddhist rituals. He had visited and performed in several Southeast Asian cities early in his career, including Bangkok and Singapore.Since 2011, China has displaced Japan as the second-largest supplier of tourists to Bali, while Australia still tops the list while India has also emerged as a greater supply of tourists. \nChinese tourists increased by 17% from last year due to the impact of ACFTA and new direct flights to Bali.\nIn January 2012, Chinese tourists increased by 222.18% compared to January 2011, while Japanese tourists declined by 23.54% year on year.Bali authorities reported the island had 2.88 million foreign tourists and 5 million domestic tourists in 2012, marginally surpassing the expectations of 2.8 million foreign tourists.Based on a Bank Indonesia survey in May 2013, 34.39 per cent of tourists are upper-middle class, spending between $1,286 to $5,592, and are dominated by Australia, India, France, China, Germany and the UK. Some Chinese tourists have increased their levels of spending from previous years. 30.26 percent of tourists are middle class, spending between $662 to $1,285. In 2017 it was expected that Chinese tourists would outnumber Australian tourists.\nIn January 2020, 10,000 Chinese tourists canceled trips to Bali due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe Ngurah Rai International Airport is located near Jimbaran, on the isthmus at the southernmost part of the island. Lt. Col. Wisnu Airfield is on the north-west Bali.\nA coastal road circles the island, and three major two-lane arteries cross the central mountains at passes reaching to 1,750 m in height (at Penelokan). The Ngurah Rai Bypass is a four-lane expressway that partly encircles Denpasar. Bali has no railway lines.\nIn December 2010 the Government of Indonesia invited investors to build a new Tanah Ampo Cruise Terminal at Karangasem, Bali with a projected worth of $30 million. On 17 July 2011 the first cruise ship (Sun Princess) anchored about 400 metres (1,300 feet) away from the wharf of Tanah Ampo harbour. The current pier is only 154 metres (505 feet) but will eventually be extended to 300 to 350 metres (980\u20131,150 feet) to accommodate international cruise ships. The harbour is safer than the existing facility at Benoa and has a scenic backdrop of east Bali mountains and green rice fields. The tender for improvement was subject to delays, and as of July 2013 the situation was unclear with cruise line operators complaining and even refusing to use the existing facility at Tanah Ampo.\n\nA Memorandum of Understanding has been signed by two ministers, Bali's Governor and Indonesian Train Company to build 565 kilometres (351 miles) of railway along the coast around the island. As of July 2015, no details of this proposed railways have been released. In 2019 it was reported in Gapura Bali that Wayan Koster, governor of Bali, \"is keen to improve Bali's transportation infrastructure and is considering plans to build an electric rail network across the island\".On 16 March 2011 (Tanjung) Benoa port received the \"Best Port Welcome 2010\" award from London's \"Dream World Cruise Destination\" magazine. Government plans to expand the role of Benoa port as export-import port to boost Bali's trade and industry sector. In 2013, The Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry advised that 306 cruise liners were scheduled visit Indonesia, an increase of 43 per cent compared to the previous year.In May 2011, an integrated Aerial Traffic Control System (ATCS) was implemented to reduce traffic jams at four crossing points: Ngurah Rai statue, Dewa Ruci Kuta crossing, Jimbaran crossing and Sanur crossing. ATCS is an integrated system connecting all traffic lights, CCTVs and other traffic signals with a monitoring office at the police headquarters. It has successfully been implemented in other ASEAN countries and will be implemented at other crossings in Bali.On 21 December 2011 construction started on the Nusa Dua-Benoa-Ngurah Rai International Airport toll road which will also provide a special lane for motorcycles. This has been done by seven state-owned enterprises led by PT Jasa Marga with 60% of shares. PT Jasa Marga Bali Tol will construct the 9.91-kilometre-long (6.16-mile) toll road (totally 12.7 kilometres (7.89 miles) with access road). The construction is estimated to cost Rp.2.49 trillion ($273.9 million). The project goes through 2 kilometres (1 mile) of mangrove forest and through 2.3 kilometres (1.4 miles) of beach, both within 5.4 hectares (13 acres) area. The elevated toll road is built over the mangrove forest on 18,000 concrete pillars which occupied 2 hectares of mangroves forest. This was compensated by the planting of 300,000 mangrove trees along the road. On 21 December 2011 the Dewa Ruci 450-metre (1,480-foot) underpass has also started on the busy Dewa Ruci junction near Bali Kuta Galeria with an estimated cost of Rp136 billion ($14.9 million) from the state budget. On 23 September 2013, the Bali Mandara Toll Road was opened, with the Dewa Ruci Junction (Simpang Siur) underpass being opened previously.To solve chronic traffic problems, the province will also build a toll road connecting Serangan with Tohpati, a toll road connecting Kuta, Denpasar and Tohpati and a flyover connecting Kuta and Ngurah Rai Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Bali was 3,890,757 as of the 2010 Census, and 4,148,588 at the 2015 Intermediate Census; the latest estimate (for mid 2019) is 4,362,000. There are an estimated 30,000 expatriates living in Bali.\n\n\n=== Ethnic origins ===\nA DNA study in 2005 by Karafet et al. found that 12% of Balinese Y-chromosomes are of likely Indian origin, while 84% are of likely Austronesian origin, and 2% of likely Melanesian origin.\n\n\n=== Caste system ===\n\nPre-modern Bali had four castes, as Jeff Lewis and Belinda Lewis state, but with a \"very strong tradition of communal decision-making and interdependence\". The four castes have been classified as Soedra (Shudra), Wesia (Vaishyas), Satrias (Kshatriyas) and Brahmana (Brahmin).The 19th-century scholars such as Crawfurd and Friederich suggested that the Balinese caste system had Indian origins, but Helen Creese states that scholars such as Brumund who had visited and stayed on the island of Bali suggested that his field observations conflicted with the \"received understandings concerning its Indian origins\". In Bali, the Shudra (locally spelt Soedra) have typically been the temple priests, though depending on the demographics, a temple priest may also be from the other three castes. In most regions, it has been the Shudra who typically make offerings to the gods on behalf of the Hindu devotees, chant prayers, recite meweda (Vedas), and set the course of Balinese temple festivals.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nUnlike most of Muslim-majority Indonesia, about 83.5% of Bali's population adheres to Balinese Hinduism, formed as a combination of existing local beliefs and Hindu influences from mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia. Minority religions include Islam (13.37%), Christianity (2.47%), and Buddhism (0.5%).The general beliefs and practices of Agama Hindu Dharma mix ancient traditions and contemporary pressures placed by Indonesian laws that permit only monotheist belief under the national ideology of panca sila. Traditionally, Hinduism in Indonesia had a pantheon of deities and that tradition of belief continues in practice; further, Hinduism in Indonesia granted freedom and flexibility to Hindus as to when, how and where to pray. However, officially, Indonesian government considers and advertises Indonesian Hinduism as a monotheistic religion with certain officially recognised beliefs that comply with its national ideology. Indonesian school text books describe Hinduism as having one supreme being, Hindus offering three daily mandatory prayers, and Hinduism as having certain common beliefs that in part parallel those of Islam. Scholars contest whether these Indonesian government recognised and assigned beliefs reflect the traditional beliefs and practices of Hindus in Indonesia before Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule.\nBalinese Hinduism has roots in Indian Hinduism and Buddhism, that arrived through Java. Hindu influences reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as the first century. Historical evidence is unclear about the diffusion process of cultural and spiritual ideas from India. Java legends refer to Saka-era, traced to 78 AD. Stories from the Mahabharata Epic have been traced in Indonesian islands to the 1st century; however, the versions mirror those found in southeast Indian peninsular region (now Tamil Nadu and southern Karnataka Andhra Pradesh).The Bali tradition adopted the pre-existing animistic traditions of the indigenous people. This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.Apart from the majority of Balinese Hindus, there also exist Chinese immigrants whose traditions have melded with that of the locals. As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism but also find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's odalan. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese. Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nBalinese and Indonesian are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of Balinese people are bilingual or trilingual. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from Java, Lombok, Sumatra, and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the Balinese caste system and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. Kawi and Sanskrit are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.\nEnglish and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the tourism industry, as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as Japanese, Korean, French, Russian or German are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. Balinese cuisine is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as gamelan, is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the Ramayana but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous Balinese dances include pendet, legong, baris, topeng, barong, gong keybar, and kecak (the monkey dance). Bali boasts one of the most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world, with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private ceremonies, or public shows.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThroughout the year, there are a number of festivals celebrated locally or island-wide according to the traditional calendars.The Hindu New Year, Nyepi, is celebrated in the spring by a day of silence. On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of Ogoh-ogoh monsters are paraded and burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese pawukon calendrical system.\nCelebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), cremation or odalan (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of d\u00e9sa kala patra, which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context. Many of the ceremonial art forms such as wayang kulit and topeng are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation. Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ram\u00e9, is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more gamelan ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ram\u00e9.\n\nKaja and kelod are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to one's orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (kaja), and the sea (kelod). In addition to spatial orientation, kaja and kelod have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.Most temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest kaja. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as wali, the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where bebali ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called bali-balihan. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.Tourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of tourism is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the barong dance have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a barong mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.Balinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied. Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as customary law sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including \"kasepekang\", or shunning) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.Other than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents Bali Arts Festival to showcase Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have. It is held once a year, from the second week of June until the end of July. Southeast Asia's biggest annual festival of words and ideas Ubud Writers and Readers Festival is held at Ubud in October, which is participated by the world's most celebrated writers, artists, thinkers and performers.\n\n\n=== Beauty pageant ===\nBali was the host of Miss World 2013 (63rd edition of the Miss World pageant). It was the first time Indonesia hosted an international beauty pageant.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nBali is a major world surfing destination with popular breaks dotted across the southern coastline and around the offshore island of Nusa Lembongan.As part of the Coral Triangle, Bali, including Nusa Penida, offers a wide range of dive sites with varying types of reefs, and tropical aquatic life.\nBali was the host of 2008 Asian Beach Games. It was the second time Indonesia hosted an Asia-level multi-sport event, after Jakarta held the 1962 Asian Games.\nIn football, Bali is home to Bali United football club, which plays in Liga 1.\nThe team was relocated from Samarinda, East Kalimantan to Gianyar, Bali. Harbiansyah Hanafiah, the main commissioner of Bali United explained that he changed the name and moved the home base because there was no representative from Bali in the highest football tier in Indonesia. Another reason was due to local fans in Samarinda preferring to support Pusamania Borneo F.C. rather than Persisam.\n\n\n== Heritage sites ==\nIn June 2012, Subak, the irrigation system for paddy fields in Jatiluwih, central Bali was enlisted as a Natural UNESCO world heritage site.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBalinese Hinduism\nBalinese people\nCulture of Indonesia\nTourism in Indonesia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHaer, Debbie Guthrie; Morillot, Juliette & Toh, Irene (2001).

          "Such a nice place to visit.. u can drink ur tea near by lion.. b.fast with orangutans is an epic adventure",
          "Nice zoo. It was under construction to add exhibits while we were there that's why 4 stars. January 2020",
          "Best zoo ever it has lots of animals and birds",
          "Overpriced but nice quality zoo. A lot of added extras and poor treatment of animals. Elephant rides are never humane or nice and their elephants just walked around in circles all day giving rides to tourists",
          "Absolutely amazing,  words cannot describe how awesome this place is!! Breakfast with the orangutans was unforgettable! Mery was so beautiful,  couldn't do enough for us. Definitely go again. Animals are free to roam,  every zoo should be like this",
          "Lots of great fun to be had, my daughter had an absolute ball. The animals look well cared for and the services were great. Prices are cheaper then Australia but high for bali, but the zoo is world class so it's understandable. Will go back \u2026",
          "Washed and fed the elephants and had breakfast with the orangutans. Amazing. Definitely worth going",
          "You can free stroll in here. The best is you can interact with some of the animals.",
          "The Zoo was great for a day trip. We spent 3 hours here. There were a lot of renovations going on. It would be great to return in 2020 to see the new attractions. The animals seemed well looked after and happy. However I noticed a tiger and \u2026",
          "I love the ambiance! Not so big zoo but it is still fun. You can directly touch and feed dears and birds. Best place for family with kids!",
          "We did the Elephant Mud Fun and can't express enough how wonderful our guide Dana was, he made it so much fun and had us all engaging so well with Molly the Elephant. Thank you so much Dana you are awesome.",
          "Well looked after animals. I was very impressed. The staff were wonderful.",
          "The location near Ubud is perfect.\nI came with my family. My daughter love the experience. To see and interact with exotic tropical animals.\n\nBest to come in the morning. So you can enjoy to the fullest.",
          "Did breakfast with Orangutans which was absolutely superb. The experiences in the Zoo went further to provide interaction with elephants as well. The nice thing about it was all about the animals and the keepers appeared quite considerate. Highly recommended.",
          "Great zoo. We did the \u201cElephant mud fun\u201d and could not recommend it more. The mud fun guide was great and all customer service was excellent.",
          "Very cool that you can ride an elephant.  We enjoyed our time walking around but make sure you take a raincoat or umbrella if it's raining.",
          "A wonderful place to visit, it contains a lot of animals. I enjoyed visiting this zoo.",
          "Damm good place.. Cleaning at its best and elephant  ride is memorable",
          "Did the night safari option and it was great, I love zoos so having an elephant come right up to the \"bus\" and send it's trunk in was awesome. The fire dance performance at end of the night was great as well.",
          "The park is beautiful, but there are a lot of animals that are not there. I didn't feel thrilled when visiting",
          "A good place to spend holiday with your kids, but if you want to buy the entrance ticket, it\u2019s better to do it online because it\u2019s cheaper.",
          "I have been to Bali several times but this was the most amazing experience I\u2019ve had in Bali, beautiful animals and amazing surroundings, poople very friendly and always willing to help out. Very friendly atmosphere and the animals seemed to \u2026",
          "Overall for me this place is good for having a family time but the price is not too good especially for me, i prefer Bali Safari and Marine Park for the better choice to visiting animals \ud83d\ude4f",
          "The place is neat. There is one thing to improve the place, add more animals in it. The tiger's track is cool.",
          "Awesome place, huge collection of animals, and a lot of new animals coming in April 2020.\nStaff is super friendly! \nPrice update dec. 2019: 400k for adults",
          "Good experience lots to see and enjoy. Decent food stalls and good waterpark for kids free of charge. If your first timer and want to see bali bird park, don\u2019t go there, visit the zoo for a better experience",
          "Please don't waste your money.. there is nothing in the zoo. Simply some reptails and some bird and some pet animals.. and the main lot of boards saying.\" We are building better zoo and sorry for inconvenient\" 800k simply waste ... Please be honest to your customer's..",
          "Amazing place to visit! Must to go in Bali\nSpecially mud fan with Elephants\nPurnata was our guide and was amazing! The elephants love him! We\u2019kk miss Adele and Terry \ud83d\udc18\ud83d\udc18",
          "Good to be here. A lot of parking space, good ambience. \nFood was good.\nNeed to be more focus to take care of the animals.",
          "It is indeed a great place to bring your family and kids, they have many animals and it is not bad at all. Why three starts? Well it is just the fact that now that I am here with my wife they are working on improving the zoo and there is no \u2026",
          "A wonderful zoo where you can easily spend half a day. Some of the animals run around freely on the grounds.",
          "We went to breakfast with the orangutans and it was absolutely worth it. Beautiful breakfast and enjoyed being able to interact with the animals",
          "If you're visiting Bali with kids, I would recommend visiting the zoo. Right when you enter you can already interact with the animals (deer and some wallabies in this case), and they also have a small waterpark for kiddos.",
          "Love this zoo as I can walk comfortably because the path is shaded by trees. It is also very walkable that my 3 year old walked all throughout. The zoo is well kept and had no dirty smell except for maybe just one area. There are small food carts scattered within . The crowd was not too much.",
          "Under construction but its it's ok hope will better next",
          "The Bali Zoo is a nice place with plenty of animals. It's very beautiful; I just wish there were more seating options.",
          "Fantastic day! Breakfast with the Orangutans is a must and definitely worth it.",
          "Worst zoo ever... high cost entrance for nothing... (400k rp per person) every 2nd place \u201cunder maintenance\u201d, not so many animals, zoo is really small, recieved food coupons at the entrance but they didn\u2019t made us food anywhere in the area \u2026",
          "This place is much, much better than Marine Safari Park. More organized, more clean although they were doing some new constructions for their brand of the hotel. The Place is still loveable.",
          "Very much better version of Bali zoo after a major renovation. Beautiful landscaping and we cannot wait for the Savannah section to be completed.",
          "Great interactive experience if you do the Orangutan Breakfast, you get a huge range of breakfast food along with being close up to a variety of animals.\nGreat family outing.",
          "I researched the zoo and turns out they offer elephant rides and immediately lost interest. No respectable zoo does this. In order to be ridden, they are broken down cruelly. Please do not support the abuse of these beautiful animals.",
          "Good fun place for kids.   Although certai  areas under renovation.  The zoo has amazing animals and birds for viewing.   The elephant ride through the water and feeding it is spectacular.",
          "Came to Bali Zoo around mid August best memorable experience at the Zoo. Animals were so happy to come up greet you was brilliant. I had the pleasure of buffet breakfast with orangutans amazing food and more animals than expected. I'm blown \u2026",
          "The animals seems healthy and cute.. however they are still under constructions, not many variety of animals.... but very eager to come here after expansion",
          "The zoo is quite a nice place to walk around and kids will love it.. Unfortunately there was a large area under construction when i was there (dec 2019)",
          "Extremely overpriced for what you get. Half of the zoo is under construction and there are very few animals to see. As expected, food and drinks inside the zoo are also overpriced and the quality is nothing special. Perhaps once they finish \u2026",
          "Breakie with orangutans (and other animals) was amazing ! We loved this zoo.",
          "Very cool zoo. Beautiful place and the animals seem very well taken care of! Some of them walk around freely and are very sociable (at least by night). Loved the experience.",
          "Do not book the night zoo experience! We booked on a Thursday night with pick up from our hotel. We received a call saying the traffic was too bad and they couldn't pick us up. We then arranged to be picked up 30 minutes earlier the next \u2026",
          "Really nice zoo with great enclosures for the animals. In the stage of adding a savanna area.",
          "The elephant mud bath was amazing Dana our elephant keep was fantastic. Thanks so much Dana.",
          "Unbelievable!!! Animal encounters and feeding is best experience we ever had in any zoo. Friendly stuff and decent breakfast",
          "Loved loved loved the breakfast with the orangutans!!!  Got to see the  elephants up close as well as other animals and birds too.  Awesome",
          "Don't visit the park. These animals are suffering. How do you think they know tricks and why they listen so good to humans. It's because the people will hurt them if they do not listen. Please don't visit the park!",
          "The Night Safari was awesome. Great guides and interaction with the animals. The buffet dinner was spectacular as was the firedancers at the end. Well worth the cost.",
          "nice place for family time, lot of animal collection",
          "Decent Zoo. Some displays not open. Breakfast with the orangutans a highlight.",
          "Still renovating the Savannah Area while i was there. Other area was okay.",
          "One of the best Zoo I have visited! I would totally recommend for anyone interested on going.",
          "Do not waste money coming here. We just wasted 8000000 IDR coming here. No animals to watch, The Zoo is under maintenance so you end up wasting money and time.",
          "It's one time visit place. It would be more interesting if we had giraffe, hippo and rhyno.\n\nI personally felt the animals were not in best of their health. Tigers i felt were a bit lean maybe not fed well or something. \n\nBut for small kids \u2026",
          "The first impression was really nice. We were welcome by some friendly deers and kangaroo. We can feed and touch them too.",
          "It was unbelievable and more then I expected loved every minute of it grate day out",
          "We have traveled all the way from WALES \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc77\udb40\udc6c\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc7f UK for this experience.\nWe had breakfast with the Orangutans, they were so cute, the breakfast was excellent,\nWe had the best experience of our lives up close and personal with the \u2026",
          "The space is quite big but many areas are still under renovation. Despite that, staff are all so friendly and helpful! Also, it is a very fun place to interact with animals! You get to touch and play with them! We even experienced a deer giving birth!",
          "Lovely zoo, kids will have a very good time!! But not a lot of variety of animals!!",
          "Amazing experience to have a breakfast with orangutan and elephants, you can see them so close and feed them, take a pictures and see lot of other animals",
          "A great experience.  Will be back next time am in Bali to check out the savanna section which is soon to be built.",
          "Well maintained zoo and kids will like the place a lot",
          "Great place to visit. Animals are well looked after. Breakfast with the Orangutans & Elephant Mud Fun are a must do!",
          "I love this zoo, so clean but im not lucky the savana still renovation...",
          "Was a good'n. Paid extra for the elephant experience which was cool. Tigers were asleep but lions and other animals awake. All in all, a good day \ud83e\udd73",
          "Great place to visit, not only for children. Try breakfast with orangutans - wonderful experience.",
          "This is one of the best zoo i ever visited. If you want to enjoy then you must try elephant ride.",
          "One of the best zoo I\u2019ve visited in my entire life. Everything is well maintained and clean. Very organized and great jungle ambiance here. As soon as you enter the zoo, there are few friendly animals that you can feed. They move around you \u2026",
          "Seems like it's run by someone out of Australia zoo. Not really much to look at and charge like a wounded bull",
          "Was amazing, but sad to see a lot was under construction and missed a lot",
          "Wonderful zoo \nIt has everything and very well organized \nElephant rides are pricey though",
          "Fantastic experience. We did the night tour with fire dance & meal. Absolutely recommend this tour to everyone. Best event we did in Bali.",
          "Sorry for the 4 stars.its on renovation,incoming savanna area with more animals.for you who want tanning your skin while watching animals attraction,please come and enjoy.its a huge zoo,feel like we go into real jungle",
          "Great place for recreation and education for family, group or couple",
          "Very nice to visit and for the most part the animals have good sized enclosures",
          "Too expensive and under major construction. We enjoyed the Marine Park Night safari much more. However the animal encounters are fun.",
          "Definitely a must for all ages we did breakfast with the orangutan, elephant mud play and visit to zoo\nWent with open expectations and was blown away ... staff friendly food excellent and interaction with elephants out of this world all \u2026",
          "Great zoo. There is also a bathing area for kids. Very cool on a hot day",
          "It's a very impressive zoo I'll tell you, but the selections of animals are poor and extraordinarily slim. I am quite happy they are making a new zone called the \"Savanna.\" cant wait for that change. The animals sometimes look very hungry, and looked not cared for. 7/10 zoo might come back. loved the bird show. Well overpriced too.",
          "Elephant mud fun was a dream experience..although fantasic you do share with quite a few other people so dont be naive in thinking you get your own elephant !!! Even so there are more than enough one on one moments to have",
          "Eazy to touch many soft animals totally different experience....",
          "A decent Zoo to visit if you have the time.\nNot much exhibit.\n\nBut it is among the cleanest zoo i've ever been.\n\nTicket or entrance fee can be bit pricey.",
          "Amazing day and had so much fun with outmr daughter. \nEnjoyed feeding lion, elephant and small deers.\nThey do have elephant ride too. If you have kids take them here they will enjoy.",
          "It is a good place to hang out with family or friends. Probably because i visited there when the place is under renovation, so the place was not as exciting as i thought. Hopefully they add a lot more exciting activities and attraction inside the zoo",
          "I went here for my birthday, we had so much fun. Ticket for domestic is 140K if you buy on the spot. I bought from traveloka which is cheaper. Lol. My suggestion come early in the morning, they have animal presentation at 10.30, then you \u2026",
          "I was really looking forward to seeing all the animals here especially the elephants but when I actually saw how during the elephant rides they poke sharp metal rods in the elephants head made me cry. Honestly that's the most cruel thing I \u2026",
          "Breakfast with the orangutans at Bali zoo is quite an experience. The staff are extremely attentive, our waitress, Puri, was particularly helpful. The food was excellent and it was such a pleasure to be so close to such amazing creatures.",
          "This is an awesome place! We have been here couple of times and have enjoyed both visits. We watched a few shows where the animals interact with the crowd as well a fed giraffes, breakfast with Lions next to us and the list continues. This zoo is massive in comparison to our NZ zoo's.",
          "An amazing place to take your children here. Despite of the on going renovation it doesn't hamper the experience of seeing the animals there. The staffs are super friendly and the instructions to go around the park are very commendable.",
          "nice place to hangout with your family. anyway the toilet seems set for foreign coz you will not find water to clean after pup. but tissue is provided.",
          "very good place for family but not too much animal",
          "Though the variety of animals is less it is well maintained zoo worth vositing",
          "the zoo is quite wide and the staff are friendly, there are many animals that are docile and wild, the animals look healthy and well groomed, a clean and comfortable place.",
          "Our visit here included the Elephant Ride, which was good fun.  Prices and food were a little on the expensive side, but we excellent overall.  There's a reasonable amount of expansion happening at the zoo at the moment, so some of the \u2026",
          "Good clean. Most animals in natural environment. Lion feeding is fun to watch.",
          "We got there early at 8:30am for the first elephant show. \n\nWe got some delicious Balinese pastries and coffee before meeting our new big friends. \n\nThere are few activities that we\u2019ve done during an hour or so with the elephant:\n\n1. \u2026",
          "Small but full of excitement Zoo...\n\nFirst of all, the entrance fees was quite affordable, especially if you booking through online ticketing app (trav**ka, etc). And the admission fee for foreigner was much higher, than domestic one. \u2026",
          "The small zoo exceeded our expectations. It's true that they don't have many species, but the animal interactions are plenty and the keepers are friendly in answering our curious inquiries. The zoo is actually separated by a public road in \u2026",
          "Good zoo with lots to do but maybe too many animals in certain enclosures. Some animals looked sad although seemed well looked after with no chains or anything.",
          "can enjoy some animals freely hang around without a cage",
          "I think this is one of the best zoo i had been in my life.We went there early morning for breakfast with orangutans, which was too much fun.Most of the animals were kept in open and natural environment. The zoo was clean and staff was \u2026",
          "Was a good day. Will be awesome when all new enclosures are finished. A lot of construction going on. Breakfast with orangutans was good. Very hot take water, hat and sunscreen",

          "The night at the zoo was amazing.  Highly recommend",
          "There are good and bad. I would love to have given a higher rating but what stops me is that everything, and I mean everything is a rip off.\nWhen I travel, I always try to show kindness by giving more, and not arguing on price, but i walked \u2026",
          "the biggest and best zoo in bali.  so many animals you can see.  the staff are friendly too.  The place is pretty clean and also neat.  You must visit this place",
          "I love the interaction you have with most animals. Beautiful. Great experience.",

          "Highly recommended. \nThe zoo is well maintained. There are interesting animal encounters with deer, wallaby, lemurs and iguanas. There is a small swimming pool for children under 7 and a playground. Walking is easy because the path is in \u2026",

          "Night zoo visit was very good. The evening meal  was also excellent. Loved the elephants.",
          "Its been worst zoo i have been in my life. I think first of all its way too expensive. Its a perfect tourist trap with more stores than animals.",
          "Recomended. Good place n good staff",
          "Expensive and not so much animals. Good for family with children, a lot of playground could spent all day, but for adult its 1 hr fun.",

          "Had a great time having breakfast with the orangutans. We got to feed the elephants too and get close to many other animals plus see the rest of the zoo",
          "Nice zoo and very big one. You can see almost all the different types of animals here. There are deers that are left freely in zoo to roam around. You can touch them and feed them food. The zoo is very big. You can have elephant ride also \u2026",
          "Nice place. A bit expensive but you can feed the elephant, that was really cool.",
          "Good zoo. Waiting till all the upgrading finish.",

          "Currently under renovation but looks great so far... we had breakfast with the orangatans and elephants... had a great day.",
          "Great place to bring the kids. Took us 3-4 hours to go through everything. I preferred zoo to the Bali safari (and it's considerably cheaper too!). Although most the path is in the shade, remember to bring sun protection.",
          "I was very skeptical about coming here, i really wasnt sure what i was going to see, but i was so happy to see all the animals were clean and healthy, there enclosures were quite spacious and they all had at least 1 friend in there with \u2026",
          "We did the Night at the Zoo and we went in having no expectations. The animals didn't seem very well kept or happy. The staff seemed all about the money and trying to get you to by souvenirs, less about the animals... Which made it \u2026",

          "Amazing place ... it looks like the animals here are very happy because they are cared for so well",
          "We went to have breakfast with the Orangutans. Brilliant! Staff were friendly and accommodating. The breakfast was everything you could want and plenty of it. You had a lot of time with the animals so able to get a lot of fabulous photos. \u2026",
          "I will never go to this place again after seeing the man kicking the orangutan, I literally saw the man punching and kicking the orangutan until crying.  I will actually be contacting the world organization who protects animals from abusive \u2026",
          "Nice privately owned zoo. Well maintained with a nice choice of animals. Entrance fee is not cheap, but that's easy to explain once inside.",
          "Do dinner with lions. You are served food her there is lion outside. Food was good here. Zoo is still not fully complete many animals are going to come in future.",
          "The very best thing of our visit here was feeding the deer near the front of the zoo. There were a couple of blocked off areas and expected more from the Sumatra section where we had to access by taking a bus. This zoo is adding a whole new Savanah area which certainly will enhance the visit here.",
          "This must be the best zoo in Indonesia. The zoo is very clean. Lots of animals. We can interact with deers and elephants.",
          "Bali zoo's staff really friendly and welcoming guest. Waiting for other facilities that it is still under construction. Good job bali zoo!",
          "Not much to see and over priced",
          "Not impressed. Very overpriced, too spread around, and most of the animals looked very sad in such tight cages. The zoo also offers elephant riding, bathing, mud playing etc, so extremely commercial and only with profit in mind, not so \u2026",
          "absolutely and definately made ur kids happy!",
          "Refreshing with family look so beautiful area in Bali",
          "Breakfast with the orangutans was slightly disappointing. There were only 2, the leaflet shows 5 and very intimate. The photo wasn't taken in the venue we had breakfast. We were sat far away so couldn't see them through breakfast. Breakfast \u2026",
          "Fun place to go with kids. Not many animals. You can feed deers, watch interactive bird show. Quite pricy. We got tickets from klook, it was a bit cheaper than walk in.",
          "If you can do the Elephant Mud Fun as it was incredible! You can tell the elephants are well cared for and adored by their keepers! A fantastic day out!",
          "It costs almost $25 US pp. Nothing much in it. You need only 45min to see all zoo.",
          "Nice Zoo and good playground for kids plus waterplayground but for all smokers just two smoking areas",

          "The cleanliness is satisfying with not much animals to see",
          "Very nice zoo!  My son really enjoyed the interaction with deers at the entrance. Shuttle bus is available to move from one area to another. Playground available near food court. Too bad when we were there, the Savannah area is still under construction.",
          "They have buses to transport you around, it's so hot.  But loved our visit",
          "It's okay like, not much animals. I think thay have some animal shows as well & having fixed time, but when we visited we could not watch that show.",
          "lovely but very pricey entrance fee",
          "This place change a lot. Get much better than 2 years ago. Keep it up!",

        "wiki": "Regent Hotels & Resorts is a luxury hospitality brand, jointly owned by InterContinental Hotels Group and Formosa International Hotels Corporation since June 2018, with hotels and resorts in Asia and Europe. Since the formation of the joint venture, the brand logo and monogram have been refreshed and works have begun to reposition the brand at the top end of the luxury hotel segment.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe brand was started by hotelier Robert H. Burns as a joint venture with Japan's Tokyu Group in 1970.  In 1986, EIE International acquired a 35% stake.  When Burns decided to sell his remaining 65% stake in 1992, EIE exercised its right of first refusal to acquire the entire company, which was then promptly sold to  the Four Seasons hotel chain. Hotels under development at the time of purchase in Bali, Milan, New York, and Istanbul were subsequently opened as Four Seasons.\nIn 1998, Carlson acquired the Regent name for new hotel developments and created a luxury hotel division while the Four Seasons continued managing existing and new Regent hotels.In 2002, Carlson agreed with Rezidor SAS to develop the Regent hotel brand in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.In March 2006, Carlson renamed its Radisson Seven Seas Cruises to Regent Seven Seas Cruises and merged the cruise operation and Regent International Hotels under a common brand.In 2008, Regent Seven Seas Cruises was sold to Apollo Management, an investment company. Carlson retained ownership of the master Regent brand, along with the operations of Regent Hotels & Resorts around the world.In 2010, Carlson sold the Regent Hotel business to Formosa International Hotels, the largest listed hotel operator in Taiwan and owner of Grand Formosa Regent Taipei hotel in Taipei, Taiwan, which was opened by Regent's founders in 1990 as The Regent Taipei.Co-founder Robert Burns was appointed Honorary Chairman and Ralf Ohletz president. Ohletz had worked with another Regent co-founder, Adrian Zecha, for 25 years.In March 2018, the InterContinental Hotel Group (IHG) announced that it had agreed to buy a 51% majority stake in Regent Hotels for $39 million and hopes to expand the brand's footprint to 40 hotels from the current portfolio of six hotels. This includes rebranding the iconic InterContinental Hong Kong, which initially opened as a Regent property in 1980, to a Regent property once again in 2022 following major renovations. New properties have since been signed in Kuala Lumpur, Chengdu and Shanghai, with IHG planning a careful rollout of the brand to ensure its exclusivity at the top-end of the hospitality market.\n\n\n== Current properties ==\n\nEuropeRegent Berlin - opened in 1996 as Four Seasons Hotel Berlin, converted to Regent in 2004\nRegent Porto Montenegro - opened 2014AsiaRegent Beijing - opened 2006\nRegent Chongqing - opened 2017\nRegent Taipei - opened 1990\nRegent Shanghai Pudong - opened May 2020, formerly Four Seasons Hotel Shanghai Pudong\nRegent Singapore - opened 1988 as The Pavilion Inter-Continental Singapore, converted to Regent and managed by Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts from 1992 to 2018. Following Regent's takeover by Carlson hotels in 1998, the hotel was rebranded as 'The Regent Singapore, A Four Seasons Hotel' to distinguish it from other Regent hotels that were not managed by Four Seasons. Pontiac Land Group, the owner of the hotel, and Four Seasons, mutually agreed not to extend the management contract when it expired on December 31, 2018. It was originally planned to have the hotel managed by Capella Hotel Group, an affiliate of Pontiac Land Group, yet a management contract with InterContinental Hotels Group was signed ensuring that the hotel stays within Regent's portfolio.\n\n\n== Pipeline properties ==\nRegent Phu Quoc -

          "This is an extension to the south of Seminyak beach and suffers in my opinion from over development. Too many sun beds etc on the beach and too many water sports vendors. I realise that these things are there for tourism but perhaps the balance has been lost or perhaps it is",

          "Spent most of a day here just relaxing after a full day of travel. Hired a pair of beds 400,000 (maybe should have negotiated but jet lag was in full swing). Lots of surf schools using the water so no swimming allowed and when I dipped myself in the current was very strong so be",
          "Yes you guessed it this place is one of the most expensive places to eat or drink in Bali.. Dont know why....it is an awfull concrete building no atmoshere at all, the ocean view is great but thats it,be aware also parts of the resort insist on a dress code in some areas........",
          "For swimming maybee not the best spot, but for surfing or even learning how to surf, a great place Sunbeds however are way to pricy",
          "What a fabulous setting to eat dinner while watching the sun set. Only issue we had was all the people trying to sell us stuff, this went on all night and while I appreciate people in Bali work dam hard to make a living, harder than kiwis could imagine it is not overly pleasant",
          "Good beach but everyday Red Flag for no swimming allowed! Still adults can and are going in! Very strong current and not suitable for young children. Nice relaxing rental beach beds - make a deal for day price ! Lots of beach selling ladies - very expensive so know what you're",

          "My husband and i loved Double Six beach. Beers, good vibes and some sun on a beanbag is the perfect way to spend the afternoon in Bali and watch the sunset. No need to go to pretentious beach clubs (Potato Head) and pay ridiculous prices for a beer or cocktail.",
          "Catch some waves, drink some beer, stroll along the beach, watch the sunset, enjoy a game of soccer or lounge in one of the many beachside restaurants and enjoy a night of karaoke. The beach captures everything that is great about Bali, its welcoming, relaxed and just about",
          "Had been at Double six Beach today with the family (2kids 7&10h, and the beach has been perfectly clean. What you need to know is, that from Dec-Mar), the beach is NOT be cleaned, as there is too much garbage coming out of the sea because of the winds. So, you cannot go during",

          "Visited this stretch of the beach right in front of the Double Six Hotel because our villa happen to have their own beach corner there. Was pleasantly surprised that the beach is wide and clean and not too crowded. We were glad that our villa had their own quality sunbed and",
          "In Semyniak and at the beach you are never bored. There are lots of things to do and see for everybody.",
          "This beach is nice. The regular beach sellers like to target foreigners but are not intimidating. The black sand stains your clothes and your feet so you might want to wash off when you leave. The beach has an array of bars and several live bands playing....it almost seems",
          "A clean beach with loads of beds to choose from. Enjoyed watching sunsets and walking. Beware of people just wanting to sell you something - this beach is no exception. Dont forget to by your lantern to let off at night time",

          "Scammers around the public toilet block it off and demand a 5000 rupiah payment if you need to use it. What a crap place. People will just end up urinating in the water. First place I've ever visited that needed a payment to relieve yourself.",
          "This beach is always busy. Considering the surge of growth over the past 20yrs. It was the dead end of bali. Now you cant park and is very full. The inlet river to the right is not the best and is sometimes very dirty depending on the day.",
          "Double six the best beach.. the best view, the best in Bali.. come on visit Bali and Denpasar - Indonesia",
          "The beach at Double Six (Legian) is the best of the beaches running south from Kuta to Seminyak. There is a much larger beach area from the water to the hotels/restaurants etc. The Seminyak beach is steeper and not as much beach area, whilst the beach at Kuta is just too busy.",
          "Go visit Made Kolu's Beach Bar. Made is so helpful & provides great beach beds, surf lessons, cocktails, cold drinks & a great fun vibe - he's our go to guy at the beach. Whilst they all provide a similar experience at Double Six - I think Made goes the extra mile.",
          "The beach is great , lots of space and many seats to choose from if u come early . Around 50 for a seat. We spent the whole day, the kids had a blast as one of them rented a boogie board for 50 full day and our son went for the surf class -1 1/2 hours for 250 with one of small",
          "We walked along this beach a couple of times and couldn't help notice that the surfers were coming right in among the swimmers. Having said that, it is and has long been known as a surfing area. I won't swim where there are surfboards. Having said that, it is a lovely beach to",
          "You need to pay a small fee to rent an umbrella or a reclining chair and relax though. Nothing is free in Bali \ud83d\ude02 The beach, however, is much cleaner and quieter than Kuta, which led to the 5 star! My local friend recommended this beach too, and he was right. It's not far from",

          "This place good for family if they want to learn surfing. Many surfing school here and they was professional. We happy the surfing instructor good in English, so we can have fast learning. And this place good for waiting sunset",
          "Surfing was especially good here, and there are many restaurants located on the road parallel to the beach. Ideal for starting a long beach walk all the way down to Kuta. Closer to sunset, all the beachside cafes take out their bean bag chairs and set them on the sand. Great",
          "Rented surf boards in Europe earlier - but ended up paddling the water. Great surf schools and perfect waves made it possible for all ten of us to surf the waves in just two hours. Amazing!",

          "Double Six Beach is one of best beaches in Bali. It has fine sands throughout and no stones to hurt your feet. It is great for surfing and swimming. The local lads who teach surfing were great and could speak good English. The beach also has lots of eating places and the food",
          "This is a nice wide open beach with minimal sunbeds, so no to overcrowdrd. There are a lot of sellers on the beach and you be repeatedly hassled by them to buy some of their rubbish or even worse allow them to massage your legs and feet. They can and do get annoyed if you",

          "We walked from Double Six to Potato Head. A lovely walk in the ever-present breeze. But it's sad to see such a beautiful location scattered with plastic debris. The debris created mainly by the very reason the beach ( and other areas ) needs to be clean - tourism and all the",

          "We came here on a whim, as it was still early to go elsewhere. Enjoyed the walk along the beach, the eye candy, and dogs frolicking in the sand and sea. Watch the surfers or learn to surf as there are plenty of shops offering lessons, and to 'hang out with Bali boys'. There are",
          "This place does not get enough credit!! So glad we found this place. Awesome to watch the sun go down with live music and awesome drinks and food. Sitting on bean bags on white sand with candles is picture perfect. 100% worth the trip!",
          "I first travelled to bali in the 70s. It's just such a shame the locals don't take care of the rubbish situation. The government needs to step up and help with this problem. It's a sad state of affairs. One of Bali's biggest attractions- the beach! Has become overloved. It is",
          "Great pool, bar and spa but pricey. I enjoyed my day there. The service was great and the drinks were lovely. The pool is great and the staff were attentive. I enjoyed the spa but it's on the pricey end! Much higher than other hotels in the area. It was lovely though but I'm",
          "We loved this beach for the sunset view, didn't surf or swim as we had young kids-but loved having a drink on the bean bag chairs and enjoyed the beautiful sunset! A must!",
          "Standard long Kuta style beach. One of the better surf spots because of a stream, but that was polluted - not so nice. Locals (friendly ones) dominate in the surf so hard for intermediate surfers to get waves. Surf schools, etc.",
          "The beach is beautiful and there's plenty of comfortable loungers available. There are lots of people trying to sell everything you can imagine and it can be a little overwhelming. Everything that is being sold on the beach is at an inflated price. Just a warning. Two beach",

          "it's more of a surfers beach....waves are impressive!! spacious quiet beach (unlike Katu beach) with many kiosks serving local and western food and drinks... if you're a sun worshipper and looking for quiet and relaxation then this is the beach for you!",
          "we did love just to walk on that beach . Lots of little places , very relaxed vibe. We will def be back",
          "Sand is black and hard.the surf is quite rough but the bars at the beach are alot of fun and cheap.stick to the hotel swimming pools or head off to coccon beach club",
          "Double Six Beach is more crowded than the neighboring beaches probably because it has more bars, sun-beds etc. so if that's what you're looking for then this is the place for you. With that come the traders and the sea is not that good.",

          "A nice clean beach with sun lounges provided by the drink vendors. I settled in under an umbrella with a nice guy keeping my drinks coming as required. I asked him to keep away the pushy locals trying to give you massages, magic mushrooms etc. and he was really good at",
          "Beach is ok just if you are white/tourist they actually hunting for you just to rip you off not the nicest experience",
          "Double six has some good waves at moment where the stream flows out. Unfortunately recent rain has turned the water brown and stanky. Try not to drink lol. Best mid to high tide.",
          "The sea view was nice with nice weather but it wasn't clean in many places and there was dogs I liked the idea of sitting a while in front the sea but didn't like the idea of swimming there",
          "We stayed at luxury double 6. The beach directly in front is dirty. The water is brown and we were told that this was from the rains. We were here 5 days and it never rained and the water never changed. The beach is filthy and something should be done to clean it up.",
          "Beah was dirty, with toxic materials (similar to orange paint) causing beach closure. Further down (+ a km) beach was open, but couch hire (offered at exhorbitant rates - negotiate down from A$20 ph) only option - and couches were as clean as the beach. Walk down, swim between",
          "Nice beach but you can't really swim in the sea. Nicer than semiyak beach for sure. We paid 2000000 rupas for two beds and umbrella. It was ok for a while but too hot for a long time and a bit expensive. Look like it really comes alive for sunset and kuta was definitely cheaper",
          "The waves are great but the sand and the first 40 metres or so of the water are not so nice. You can only guess why the water is so brown and there is so much rubbish embedded in the sand. Hopefully the island will improve this over time.",
          "There are better beaches in Bali than Seminyak, even in Kuta at the rear of the Centro Shopping centre looks better.",
          "The issues with this beach is the amount of bars and businesses operating on it. There is filth and grime everywhere. The ocean itself has various plastic objects floating around the shore at all times. I know this is a local money maker but the impact on local conservation is",
          "Fairly clean beach a popular spot so quite busy hard to get a photo without other people in the background we went at sunset so perhaps not so busy during the day",

          "This beach is nice and clean. Sometimes a bit rough but overall an enjoyable day out spent here. Some amazing hotels and restaurants here. If you need to find it our driver Putu at fair dinkum transport (on tripadvisor) was a great driver and can show you exactly where To go.",
          "We took the extended family down to Double Six Beach to watch the sunset. Ages from 7 to 55. Grabbed beanbags at the Blue 9 Beach bar and settled in with drinks and pizzas to watch the sunset and catch a few tunes. Very touristy, crowded with restaurants many with music",
          "I was really disappointed with this beach. There is loads of rubbish and overall a but grotty. There are loads of dogs roaming around just doing their business everywhere so was worried where I was walking. At sunset there is quite a nice buzz but overall it didn't live up to",
          "If you are used to living in a country with beautiful white sandy clean beaches then prepare to be a little bit shocked.",
          "Double six beach is famous....especially for sunset in seminyak area. The wave quite good for surfing even sometimes there is no wave (depend on season). U can enjoy ur sunset with drink or small bites...especially there is bakso there... there is so many small warung to chill",
          "Love this beach, clean and nice sunset. Every afternoon we stayed here to drink beer and enjoyed nice sunset",
          "Instagram likes to boast it with colorful seats and all, but the band wasnt really great, the beach wasnt pristine, i think W beach was better.",
          "This beach is filthy. So much garbage, even broken glass in the sand. It can be dangerous to walk barefoot. The sand is also a dirty grey. Not nice to look at, not nice to walk, overall terrible.",
          "The sea needs to be kept cleaner! It had a greenish-brown tinge. It was warm, though. There are eateries and places to have massage. You can rent loungers at 100,000 rupiah.",
          "The view is great. It was not that crowded that time. However, I still prefer to go to beach clubs than the beach alone.",
          "like to spend the evenings in this location, enjoying the sunset. The beach is big and you can go for long walks but it is also very touristy and noisy and which was not a very nice experience.",
          "Perfect ambiance for family/couple afternoon walk. Don't forget to enjoy your time at some local cafe, sitting on the sand chair, order some pizza or beverages. Enjoy the air, the sound of waves, and the sun set! :D",
          "We just picked our way between all the disgusting garbage bought in by the tide. Not conducive to wanting to sit and drink etc.",
          "We had a lovely walk along double six beach after a nice meal at The Plantation Grill, would have stopped for a drink if we weren't so full from dinner",
          "The place was smelly, and had rubbish strewn around. The sands were rough and grey, and the water was grey too. I've seen better beaches, so so disappointing! The beach clubs were more of a party-crowd place, and not really a place to relax. I went with my friend, just 2 of us",
          "Loads of beach bars pull out their bean bags and umbrellas for sunset and crank the music up. It;s noisy and a bit chaotic but fun and relaxing all the same. Enjoy a drink,watch the waves and the sun go down.",
          "Nice Beach to chill at the beach, a bit dirty probably because the rainy season. A lot of places to grab a drink and enjoy sunset.!",
          "This is one of the most disgustingly dirty beaches I have ever seen and I have travelled. The amount of rubbish washed up on the beach and not cleared away is a disgrace and an example of the crisis our oceans are suffering. Why anyone would want to come and sit on it and look",

          "Beautiful Beach, but it was kinda dirty. A lot of Plastic rubbish on the beach. Maybe it was very very bad Weather for 4 days. But I hope they will clean it. On Sunday was very crowded, many local people as well, they played football on the beach. Otherwise we love the beach.",
          "Great beach front restaurants that allow you to lounge on bean bag chairs while watching the sunset. Food was off good quality at fair prices. Not as many hawkers as Kuta and Legian",
          "Very long beach, plenty of bed and places to drink. Pestered a lot by people selling stuff or trying to get you to select their beds. No place to shower or even rinse your feet. Lot of stray dogs about Lots of debris on the beach, including animal dirt!!! Could do with serious",
          "There are many restaurant and bars that setup in the evening which play live music while you lounge on large bean bags under a umbrella while being next to the beach. Lovely place to be, highly recommended.",

          "A beach that would've been so relaxing and a great spot for us, however during wet season it was littered as far as the eye could see with washed up plastic and rubbish. Even walking you could see it in the waves as well. We were asked for 100.000IDR for two beach seats for an",
          "Disappointing with the hawkers constantly harassing you to buy something every 2minutes. Sunset was lovely however the area did smell unpleasant. Hired the deck chairs/umbrellas for $7AUD for two people for the afternoon, but the first person to approach asked us for $25AUD.",
          "So nice and peaceful. Very relaxing siting on bean bags. Could easily have fallen asleep. Will visit again",
          "Large busy beach, not white sand if that's what your hoping for. Lots of bars along the beach and sun loungers available during the day, bean bags in the evening. We came in the set season so there is litter deposited on the beach constantly. This does rather spoil it, though",
          "This beach is dirty and very busy every 10 steps you are approached by people, who are nice and friendly but who want to sell you a bed. After 10 minutes we had to get off the beach. This might be fun in the evening but not so nice during the day. Definatly not a pretty beach",
          "This is a great beach for simply hanging out, so many chilled bars to stop by with everything from coffees to fruit juices to everyones favourite tipples! As far as going in the sea, be careful, depending on tides the sea can unfortunately be full of rubbish and waste, its very",
          "This section of the beach is more well maintained than adjoining ares along the beach front. There is a more visible effort to remove the trash from the evening before prior to morning visitors arriving. All in all the beaches in Bali are average at best. These are not the",

          "Went down and walked along this beach, had some decent size waves. Surfers everywhere offering you surf lessons which is nice if you wanted to learn. There are seats everywhere which cost to sit on them and charge by the hour which I think it cost roughly 50,000 for 1hr. Good to",
          "The beach has black sand and is not so cozy as is described in the leaflets. Although separated from the main area, sellers of all kind of products annoyingly demand attention for their merchandise.",
          "Without doubt probably the busiest of all the Bali beaches. This is where you will find your more formal beach bars where you can get a comfy bean bag to sit on , a cocktail in your hand whilst nibbling on tasty tapas. Not as many beach sellers up this way as Kuta in the south",
          "This is one of the busier beaches in the area and that brings both pluses and minuses. Because there are some nice hotels around the prices in shops and restaurants and to be dearer than in other areas and it does get very busy. Having said that, it also means a lot of",

          "I was shocked to see a beach that dirty- empty bottles and cans are scattered around, not a very nice walk on that beach. Can't go there with little kids! Also, can't swim because of waves, but looks like to be good for surfing - surfers seemed like having fun.",

          "66 is a great place to hangout and have a few cheap drinks in the sun, before heading off to a restaurant or bars for the evening. Please note the recent comments stating the beach is covered in litter is a yearly event at this time of the year due to the predominant wind",
          "Gone is the Bali or old. There's simply no excuse for the filth we behold: piles of garbage topping 6' in places, and miles of garbage stretching south and north as far as the eye can see. To make matters even worse, the return of the beanbag chair, filled with styrofoam",

          "The beach was covered to litters, and although some surfers were there. I seriously doubt it is safe to be in the water. The color of the sea water were brown and murky, ee were disappointed and did not stay there long. It needs a thorough clean up badly!",

          "Incredibly crowded on a Sunday. The sand is a dark brown and I could see that there were oil spills before. It's okay if you want to sit and chill on a beanbag (many restaurants offering that) but I think you'd be better off at Jimbaran or some other more secluded beach. There",

        "wiki": "Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue (also GWK statue) is a 122-meter tall statue located in Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park, Bali, Indonesia. It was designed by Nyoman Nuarta and inaugurated in September 2018. The total height of the monument, including the 46-meter base pedestal is 122 m (400 ft). The statue is about 30 m (98 ft) higher than the Statue of Liberty, but Liberty is tall and thin, while Garuda is almost as wide as it is high \u2014 its wingspan is 64 m (210 ft). The statue was designed to be the Indonesia\u2019s tallest statue, that was inspired by a Hindu about the search for Amrita (the elixir of life). According to this myth, Garuda agreed to be ridden by Vishnu in return for the right to use the elixir to liberate his enslaved mother. The monument was completed on 31 July 2018 and inaugurated by Indonesian President Joko Widodo on 22 September, 2018.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt took twenty-eight years and around $100 million to build the statue. GWK was designed back in 1990 by Nyoman Nuarta under the auspices of then-Tourism Minister Joop Ave, Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana and Governor of Bali Ida Bagus Oka.  The groundbreaking event of the statue\u2019s construction took place 1997. In the late 1990s, the project was brought to a sudden halt by the combining force of the global economic crisis. \nConstruction resumed in 2013 after a sixteen year hiatus, when property developer PT. Alam Sutera Realty Tbk (ASR) agreed to financing the construction of the statue and the project. The idea for the monument was not without controversy; religious authorities on the island complained that its massive size might disrupt the spiritual balance of the island, and that its commercial nature was inappropriate, but some groups agree with the project, because it will be a new tourist attraction.\n\n\n== Fabrication and dimensions ==\nThe statue was assembled in Bali from 754 discrete modules that were constructed in Bandung, West Java and then transported to the work site. The modules were cut into 1,500 smaller pieces to accommodate the cranes maximum load. The last piece that was placed onto the gigantic artwork was at its tail, which is located at the highest point of the statue.  Garuda's shape is so complex that engineers have designed special joints in the supporting structure, with up to 11 enormous steel girders coming together at the same point, whereas normal construction joints have four or six girders. The Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue is designed to withstand storms and earthquakes, and expected to last for the next 100 years.The completed monument is about as tall as a 21-storey building. It weighs 4000 tonnes, making it the heaviest statue in Indonesia. The artwork is made of copper and brass supported by 21,000 steel bars, and bolts of 170,000. The statue is made of copper and brass sheeting, with a stainless steel frame and skeleton, as well as a steel and concrete core column. The outer covering measures 22000 m2 in area. The crown of Vishnu is covered with golden mosaics and the statue has a dedicated lighting arrangement. The sculpture sits atop a building base which will function as a restaurant, museum, and viewing gallery.\n\n\n== References ==",

We went early in the morning but it might be nice to visit during sunset. Either way you shouldn\u2019t spent more than 1 hour there",
          "There\u2019s been mixed reviews about this place. But I think it\u2019s world class. This place has the feel of both Petra and Teotihuacan. I think it\u2019s worth visiting now, and again a few years down the road as they continue to populate with other buildings and attractions.",

          "Don't expect the same kind of experience you get when visiting an ancient place ... Large park with impressive statues and interesting corners. You either walk up the entire way or take a buggy car shuttle service - recommended especially in high session. Didn't do the GWK",

          "Just another one of Bali\u2019s way of taking advantage of the tourists. The park had an expensive entrance fee. You could handle if the organization and knowledge of the workers were visible. We were given the wrong entrance ticket and had to argue with them to make good. We spent",
          "The entrance fee is expensive. The shuttle bus from parking to the entrance site is unorganised, there is no official staff who manages the queue, there is no clear queue barrier so people just cut in line. Aside from that, the Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue is impressively",

The ticket for foreigners is 125k per person, which is the biggest admission fee I\u2019ve paid in Bali. It\u2019s full of shops and restaurants, but all the",
          "The place is a scam and a rip-off. It is not even a park, just a huge tourist-trap not even constructed yet by JAN2019. They have stands of 3d renders showing cascades of waterfalls, in reality you have a huge stone-pit, an asphalt road to the statue, where there are NO",
          "We were intrigued by the reviews and had time for a visit with our guide. There is a lot to see but the highlights were the huge monuments and massive carved out plazas. The amphitheater had hourly performances from various parts of Bali and the one we saw was entertaining.",
          "If you wanna see the huge statue you have to go to the culture park. It\u2019s not finished yet but they\u2019re still building it. It\u2019s a huge project! Not worth the price right now.",
          "The Garuda Visnu statue is technically something to be seen. At 120 meters, it is visible from far away and is quite spectacular if you first see it from the bridge taking you in Nusa Dua. But should you decide to go and take the elevator to its top be prepared to be",
          "I hired a driver to take us here and wait for us to take us back, worth the price for the piece of mind to me. The experience and the place is indeed awesome however a few things you should know to make sure you enjoy the experience. Be aware that there is a two tier pricing",
          "This monument took over 20 years for the Balinese to build and it's big (you can see it flying in). You can take a taxi to get there but I'd suggest organising a hire car from your hotel to guarantee your driver sticks around. You arrive at a drop off car park where an open",
          "It was the most expensive tourists attraction we visited in Bali and was not even worth going there and forget the free drink voucher, the juice was very sweet and artificial. To reach the Statue of Wisnu you have to walk far from the parking area. The place was also very",
          "The line was so long due to two counters opened only and we came around 10am.. please come early around 9am to avoid super long line and you can pay additional 30k rupiah to pay for buggy to bring you to the big statue. Honestly it was just ok place for us and we won\u2019t come",
          "Everything\u2019s great and organized unless we have to very careful with our steps caused by all the caterpillars. it was a really unpleasant trip for me (phobia) and dangerous to all people. please put more attention",
          "Not very organised expensive to visit a statue. Couldn\u2019t even see the view as the statue wasn\u2019t open and there\u2019s trees in the way at the base. Wouldn\u2019t recommend. Statue is very beautiful though",
          "Awesome statue. Very interesting location to visit, also with children. Very large and tall statues. There is an amphi theater area that displays Balinese dances which are very interesting to see.",
          "This was never on our initial agenda and I had not even heard/ read abut it before. But one could not miss the sight of the huge statue even as the plane was approaching the runway at Bali airport. Sometimes, these unplanned, last-minute changes to an itinerary can be real",
          "Management could have done better. It\u2019s an okay venue. Rubbish everywhere which is a shame. Price is 125k each per foreign adult with buggie rides extra at 15k which you must buy and prepaid when buying entrance tickets. Signages are not that clear.",
          "Its a terrible shame that this enormous structure and the great trouble they have gone to to build this monolith and then to have it ruined by poor service and atrocious filth of the park. Rubbish everywhere and very poor organization....such a shame and such potential.",
          "With just 2 TICKETS COUNTER OPEN during the holiday season, the management seriously need to address this matter urgently as many tourists visit Bali to use their quality time with other activities as well",

          "Pros: Very unique temple and many shows Historical temple and giant statues Cons: Ticket is way too expensive Too crowded and slow on the ticket system.",

          "Like the comments of the other negative reviews, this is really a bit of a tourist trap if you go for the first time. Sad again to see so much rubbish and building debris throughout this public area. Slow and antiquated ticket system , needless shuttle ride to the monument that",

          "This experience was an absolute waste of time and money and I wouldn\u2019t recommend anyone to visit this place. Firstly you pay 15 dollars for entry which includes having to pay for the shuttle bus up to the statue. The ticketing system there is shocking and slow (a better system",
          "Back here after years expecting to see the full version of Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue. To my dismay, the walking path was closed during preparation of DWPX and we must pay extra shuttle service to come to the statue. Another combo, we can only see the statue, cannot get up (",

          "This is a tourist scam. A large part of the park was closed for some event, but tourists still have to pay 125k then if you want to see the statue you have to pay an extra 20k. It should be included free, as there is no way to walk to the statue. Then the wait is 40mins in the",
          "The main attraction to this park is the quite newly completed GWK Statue. This Statue is huge and can be seen from most parts of Bali if the skies permits. Worth to take a look but be prepared to pay for the charges. You will need to take the tram/buggy up to the statue area.",
          "We actually spotted this huge statue from Jimbaran at one of the beach restaurants in Jimbaran (20 mins from this place) and it just stood out, so we went on our last day to see this park and it was amazing. However I wouldn't go during the day, it's piping hot and there aren't",
          "We arranged a driver to take us here from Nusa Dua. We had noted previously rave or poor reviews so had an open mind what to expect. In reality it is good and was worth the hour and a half spent there. It is neither excellent or terrible. It is good value for money Rp250k for 2",
          "This cultural park has the potential to be magnificent. It is huge in scale & size. When fully completed sometime in 2019???? you\u2019ll be able to take a lift up inside the GWK statue & take in magnificent panoramic views over Badung. It will become the major tourist attraction",
          "Saw this when we flew into Bali and didn't know what we saw so I wanted to go explore. It was interesting to see the 3 statues. It cost about 125,000rp/person. It's worth going and seeing while you're here.",
          "Really nice 3 large statues that the government has built. But for the tourists, paying 125, 000 IDR for entry may be too high a price per pax.",
          "It gets hot there so make sure you bring your hat. We had a great day there it only take about an hour to get to the statue and back down but we spent the day watching the amazing Balinese dances that are free to watch they happen every hour and go for 45mins so when a play",
          "The idea is great to bring the Balinese culture back to the world. After buying the tickets and start our Journey, the first thing I saw STARBUCKS!! Then we went around to see most of time only commercial area until we found a cultural space where we were enjoying our eyes with",
          "Everything is magnificent.. entrance fee about rp250000 for 2 foreigners. There are markets outside the venue. Just went for a walk & sightseeing at the park. Relaxing & breathtaking \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

I called them twice, they said \u201csorry we don\u2019t know\u201d... omg they cheated my money, no recommendations!!! They broken my birthday",
          "This site is worth the visit, great space and a very good cultural experience, the statues are breathtaking and the route is family friendly",
          "We saw this as we flew into Bali and wondered what it was. A fantastic addition to Bali to celebrate the culture. Amazing views. Even though it wasn\u2019t finished it was well worth the trip. Will go back on next trip as I am sure when you can get inside the views will be the best.",
          "My favourite park in Bali, in the world perhaps. Great view! Best for running if you stay at the hotel around the area. Some local dance performances everyday.",
          "It was certainly worth the visit but be prepared to spend the whole day if you wish to do the pedestal tour. We arrived around 11am queued for approx 20 minutes and purchased tickets to go on a shuttle bus to the main statue as it is apparently too far to walk. Upon gaining the",
          "Was there at Night, not a must in my opinion, there are better places, looked very tourist attracting like, area with Starbucks, gift shops",
          "We\u2019ve read the reviews here, and still decided to gave a go. The site is magnificent, the main statue is quiet a sight. However the area is not yet finished, plus the roads and deco seems to be already deteriorating. Its a pity, There\u2019s plastic rubbish everywhere. Maybe it could",
          "The attraction charges 120k for entrance and for that you walk . Nothing is really finished, roadways are already deteriorating and whilst everything is built on a grand scale it needs cleaning and maintenance and rubbish is strewn every where. And good luck avoiding the",
          "The cultural park is incomplete in particular the main Garuda complex on the hill and as such lacks facilities once you enter the park itself. The web site only shows the price for Indonesians though doesn't state such and there is no discount for children, having to pay $125K",
          "Was there yesterday with a couple of friends. Entrance ticket to the whole area was Rp 80,0000/pax. Extra Rp 20,000 for tram ride. It was super sunny, so better bring a hat, sunglasses, and make sure to use sunscreen lotion! The whole area was huuge! The newly build giant",
          "We were interested in visiting and as our driver was taking us past, he asked if we would like to go and have a look. And we did. We spent about an hour and a half wandering around the park and loved the statues, cut away cliffs, gardens and was inspired by the amount of",
          "Our driver dropped us here during a day tour. Admission fee was 120k idr from memory, way more expensive than any temples & monkey forests etc we visited. All it was was a big walk uphill in the sun to a massive statue, which you couldn\u2019t even go very close to/nothing much to",

          "The planning for this place started from 1993 and the construction of the whole statue was only recently finished last month. This is an impressive landmark, you can even see the statue from the Ngurah Rai airport which is kilometers away. Here's what you can expect: - There are",
          "We spotted this huge \"thing\"from Legian beach and 2 days later we grabbed a GRAB visited this statue. It is the second largest in the world and quite a sight to see. It has only recently opened so still a few teething problems but it is really impressive.",
          "The giant Garuda Wisnu statue was opened just a few weeks ago in late September. It\u2019s a large park with a huge promenade area before the ticketed area. Prices as of October 2018 were 125,000 per foreign adult. Gives you something to do if you have an extra half day, but we found",
          "Park is large and all areas require considerable waling up and down and in the heat. Saw what needed to be seen as well as immersing in the cultural aspects. Entrance cost was a bit excessive but when completed will be worth it.",
          "Nice place. Beautiful view. This is first time i come here after GWK project finished for a long long time. Before now i come here on 2004, the project unfinished yet.",
          "Visited this park two weeks ago, very impressive. There is quite a lot to see and shows to watch. The park is not quite finished yet, but when it is the facilities will be excellent. The Garuda is so awesome and made out of metal , the viewing platform and restaurant not open",
          "This place has a lot of potential, but everywhere I look there's rubbish on the floor. I mean plastic bags and rubbish everywhere. For a cultural park you would think they will get their staff to clean up this rubbish Dump and make it look nicer.",
          "Went to GWK Cultural park to check out the statue you can see coming into land at Bali and from the airport. It's a big walk and we turned back to the admission area to get the free bus tour up there. We had to wait over an hour for the next bus but it was worth the wait. The",

          "Well at last, after 28years of ground breaking, now the Garuda Vishnu Statue is on His final form perching at 120++m high on Ungasan highland, it can seen from as far as Bali airport. See it by yourself and got amazed by the gigantic size and majestic aura of the statue",
          "We were travelling from Kuta to Uluwatu and decided to stop by as it was on the way. The park was more than I thought - there were hourly performances at the amphitheatre, and our driver from Balisafestdriver explained what the performance was about. The statues were magnificent",
          "Garuda Wisnu Kencana (GWK) Cultural Park truly made a significant improvement of anything since my last time visiting them. The improvement, of course, including number of public toilets and its cleanliness, also whole place cleanliness, and they do take care of the statue much",
          "Visited this place in March. It was not much interesting. Just go if you have free time. It may take around 1-2 hours for this place.",
          "My wife and I love the park but they\u2019re still working on completing the enormous statute\u2019s interiors. Bali is so amazing and we would love to come back again one day.",
          "This is truly a beautiful place to visit. Walking around it is just amazing to see how huge these statues are when near them. Take some time to sit and watch the show in the amphitheater. The day we went there were not that many tourists but it was difficult to get a photo",
          "We wandered around the park and there were some great statues. We didn't realise there was a shuttle to see the big statue until we were leaving. So disappointing. My suggestion would be to book the shuttle when you first get there as it only runs at certain times. We were",
          "Really impressive attraction that is rare in Bali in that there were not many tourists there at all. Amazing that whereas the beaches and bars will be full of people, GWK had plenty of space to walk around in peace and enjoy what is a series of impressive statues, scenery, and",
          "First time went here. Visit the cultural park with awesome view in Bali. We can see many show in amphitheatre. You have to visit here if going to Bali.",
          "We visited this place to see the new Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue. I thought the statue is inside the complex, there's a red bus will bring us to this statue. We can join the ride to Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue after pay for the entrance fee. Inside the complex you can find",
          "We had not been to GWK Culture park for at least 5 years, however, with the opening of the new Wisnu & Garuda statue (in August 2018) it was time to take another look. We were looking forward to see the new Wisnu & Garuda statue that could be seen being built over the past",
          "Got taxi there to find we were just in time for final coach ride round park. It was JAMMED. Whole place is a building site. All the cafes closed so no where to eat or drink so just left wondering round. The status are impressive and the park will be great when its finished i'm",
          "This is the spot that we will later have in Bali. Balinese statue with high size and extraordinary artistic value and in the hills. This place has many good locations to take photos. We strongly recommend visiting this place.",
          "The last time we visited Bali 2 years ago, the statue was just a frame so we were keen to see what all the fuss was about. The statue itself is impressive and beautiful even from a distance. The park itself is very big but many things are still under construction. On the",
          "We had not been to GWK Culture park for at least 5 years, our previous visit left us disappointed as the area & attraction seamed to be let run down. However, with the opening of the new Wisnu & Garuda statue (in August 2018) it was time to take another look. We were both",
          "The park is not very spectacular and has only 3 attractive sights to visit. Nevertheless we enjoyed it as it was our first touchpoint on our first day in Bali. It starts with some cheap shops where you can buy traditional stuff and ends with a temple and 2 impressive sculptures.",
          "This statue is the biggest thing on the island. You can see it from literally miles away. Was on my list as a must do so we got a car and headed up after a day out. Got to park, purchased tickets to go and see it. Time was 5.30 and it was still quite busy, quite a walk and some",
          "Everything is not ready yet and the the area to explore is really small. You can do one or two pictures and the whole park is covered. The restaurant for the entrance drink is hidden and almost not to find without asking as well as the pathfinding in general. If you want to",
          "Nice spot on a Sunday. Lots of local food stalls. Seems to be a place where lots of local people take their kids on Sunday",
          "Known for attracting 5 million tourists every year, Bali now has one more hidden gem - The World\u2019s 2nd biggest Statue of Lord Vishnu riding the mythical bird Garuda at a majestic height of 121 meters high (including a concrete pedestal) and 64 metres wide. To put this in",
          "Grand statue was impressive, with a lead up walk through gardens and stairs to view tall statue up close, then a walk to see open quarried grounds that is reminiscent of an ancient stone site but it is a modern build. It is too new in setting near the amphitheatre with no great",

          "If you are short of time to see the sights of Bali, this should be very low on your list. It is expensive compared to other tourist attractions. It is around 120,000 rp - compared to 30,000 to get in Ulawatu, It is still building site in many places and empty retail units.",
          "The main statue itself looks very impressive from afar but make sure you book the bus tour up to it as soon as you arrive (included in price). It's too far to walk in the heat. The 'Entrance' leads to gift shops and lower statues only. Ask at info desk. The other areas are",
          "Curiosity to get a close up view of this gigantic statute that dominates the southern Bali skyline drew me here. It is interesting but incomplete. Large park but not the weather to wander around. Didn't stay for the dance performances or eat there, so hard to fully review it.",
          "Entry fee (120.000) to high compare to this park and the sculpture are fare from being finished. Furthermore, you can get a better view of the big bird from outside the park.",
          "I will start by saying this will a fantastic place to visit in the future. As a tourist you first must incur the expense of getting there and then pay an entrance fee. Their website says 60 hectares of parkland that the park is made up off, I think we travelled about 250 metres",
          "We went to this place as I saw it on here and Google, the big statues caught my eyes. When we got there I realised there was an entrance fee and that except the statues there was this \u201ccultural center\u201d, which was a little outside my interest. Although I paid the entrance and",
          "We wandered around for an hour or so before seeing everything. It is a pretty amazing complex and will be incredible when it is all done. Really amazing statue work and great surroundings. The view from the top overlooking Bali is especially good.",
          "In mid July 2018 I went to Bali and had the opportunity to visit the new wisnu god statue in the gwk complex. This statue is really epic, made not only for bali tourism but also for Indonesian tourism, an icon. With a height exceeding the statue of liberty in new york, the",

          "It depends on what you expect from a monument. Even though one of the parts hasn\u2019t been completed yet, it will be the biggest monument of the world. You can see its unique monuments still.",
          "Entry ticket is for IDR 100,000. The project is still under construction and development. Lot of empty/closed shops and nothing much apart from a photo stop. All the shops sell the same stuff which is available across bali at exorbitant prices. Entry ticket price is not worth",
          "I went there because my FIL requested.. Since I'm not really into art, I don't really pay attention to the history and the show they provide, only look around the statues.. But the facilities are quite complete in it.. Many praying room for moslem, various snack stall and resto",

          "Few years back when i went here, it was so easy to get in. After they renovated the whole place... yes the whole place is super big now but the only way for you to get inside the touristy area is to wait for a shuttle bus from the carpark which took about at least 20 mins to",
          "Very nice walk through this nice Cultural Park, dedicated to Garuda and Wisnu. The big (huge) statues of those two are marvellous. And there is an ambitheatre which is very nice to visit, they show traditional dances among other things.",
          "Visited yesterday and while it is on the way to being a cool place, it is more or less a fundraising campaign for the giant statue at the moment. The actual \"sights\" and walking part of the venue took us maybe 10 minutes and everyone around us was confused as well as to how",
          "It is a must visit for a tourist. Nice place to take photos. Enjoyable to a family, couple or solo traveler. Now still on progress to finish the giant statue.",
          "You need to pay entry fee to go in, but the status is not finished yet. I think once completed, this place will be amazing.",
          "Future wise, I think this place is going to be crowded. with statue taller than Liberty and big park. Entrace car charged Rp 10.000 and you have to pay for admission ticket for entrance. Improvement needed : ticket booth need to be open all, not just only 1 or 2, too many",
          "I came here many years ago and this place is expanding and well maintained. Impressive tall statue and one in finishing exceeds 120 meter height. I always like the stone hill cut into square with alleys to walk thru. Good spot for sureal photography. Amphiteatre holds regular",
          "We went there because we saw this mammoth object on the horizon from Sanur beach. It turns out it's the GWK Garuda Wisnu statue. They've been working on this statue since 1989 if memory serves me and will stand taller than the statue of liberty when completed later this year. It",
          "GWK is quite an epic experience and I am surprised to see people complaining about the entrance price - its only about $10 (foreigners). It might not be complete yet but there is already quite a bit to see and do here and its kind of fascinating to see a cultural park come to",
          "This park is meant to be a cultural park with performances and beautiful landscaping, complete with hotels and a small theme park. However it's not completed yet and so is rather expensive given that only a few attractions are opened. It's in a very large area and the statue of",
          "We arrived at the entrance after a long walk up to it and it was way over priced at 125,000 for non-locals, because me and my partner wanted to see this we thought it was worth spending that amount. When we got into the cultural park, it was beautiful for 5 minutes... you walk",
          "Very expensive for something unfinished. Only 3 statues to look at, maybe in 5 to 10 years it\u2019ll be worth it when it\u2019s nearer being completed. Cultural dance was interesting though. \u201cFree drink\u201d not worth it, just a small glass of ice tea.",

          "Its a beautiful park which highlights the Hindu culture and one of its mythological character 'Garuda' - the mount of Lord Vishnu. Its a peaceful place to stroll around and later to witness the live performance of local artists playing the epic mythological story of lord Vishnu",
          "We booked this tour off of our cruise ship, Radiance of the Seas. The place was designed and is being built on a massive scale. The unfinished statue of Wisnu will be taller than the Eiful Tower when finished. Complete components of the statue are on display for close up",
          "On our way to Uluwatu temple our driver suggest to make short stop and was indeed worth it. The garuda is indeed iconic and also you can get a cold refreshing in the bar with a spectacular view. If you are on the way it worth a stop over,",
          "Area is not too big and there are some places that are still close as they are still under construction. From picture taking area, statues, free 1 drink ( ice tea that taste like water ) \ud83d\ude05 and free shows it's worth the money you pay. I did enjoy my time here even I'm traveling",
          "The drive way to the entrance is the best part , with lovely gardens and statues. You pay $25.00 Australian per couple to get in , there is a fair bit of walking , you can't even get close to the main statue. We will be taking more friends to Bali in August but I won't be",
          "Just have a huge Garuda Bird and Visnu statue. The rest of the place is still under construction. Too expensive to pay for 100,000 rupiah",

          "Beautiful place to visit. Beautiful sculptures of Lord Vishnu and Garuda. Traditional dance is worth seeing.",
          "This is a good place for watching balinese dance and take some great pictures with great service from the staffs. I went to this place with my son(21 month-old) and at noon where the sunlight is so intense.Ticket is 70K rupiahs for locals and they also provide shuttle for who",
          "Our guide just took us here without really explaining to us what it was. We totally wasted our time. It basically is a fund raising scheme to raise money to build a statue--which has no real significance unless you are Hindu. If they could have explained their religion and",
          "Many place for taking great pictures with lots of perspective, great artwork! A very huge place to have fun with your friends",
          "We came there just for seeing the famous kecak dance but the price of the entrance ticket was the same as for the whole day. We had to pay 110per person. It was not worth it. The dance was too touristic. Nothing authentic there. If you go there for the whole day with watching",
          "The sculptures depicting Lord Wisnu and Garuda in Hinduism. A huge park with massive sculptures. Great views, still under construction. Admission is expensive in Bali standard",

          "This theme park is showcase of Balinese culture, art and religion. Founded in southern part of the island. They have statues, amphitheatre, food court, photo spot and souvenir shop. However, parking area is not near attraction site, so it will become a problem if you carry",
          "It's a wonderful place to visit. You can see a cultural dance of Bali in the ampi theatre . There is a huge statue of garuda and lord Vishnu which is really magnificent. Even in India I have never seen such a huge statue of lord Vishnu. Must place to visit",
          "It's an artificial cluture park to remind the Bali cultural heritage. You may enjoy the live performance of Balinese dance inside it. There are two newly-built huge statues of Wisnu and Garuda, a little bit astonishing, but not that attractive. BTW, the entrance fee is no",
          "Visit this place if you want to know more about Balinese culture. A place for many pre-wedding photoshoots. Bring sunglasses because it can be hot and sunny. Not much to explore, though.",
          "The place is not fully completed with major structures still being. The statue of Vishnu and the statue of the mystical bird Garuda is the main object of this attraction. Entry tickets are a bit expensive though especially for foreigners",
          "We went to GWK as part of our day tour with Gede's Bali Tour. The park is still a work in progress but it's already operational and there are a lot of places to visit. We enjoyed the cultural dance performance at the amphitheatre where the performers invited guests to",
          "Wide space with Garuda statue...some people may love it and some people just see it as not too attractive. I was thinking it is not too attractive as I love more to natural sightseeing rather than this. But this place is cool for having a concert or big crowds gathering. So if",
          "The place was amazing and mesmerising. This place is a must-go for enthusiastic travellers. You get to hike up a hill before you get to the main entrance and you are greeted by a majestic statue of Vishnu. Avid photographers can catch a beautiful, breath-taking view from the",

          "I\u2019d always wanted to visit as I call it the big head statue. I was not disappointed the Balinese have done this well beautiful and the performances are fantastic.. also. Sry affordable entry price and good and beverage once in the park is exceptionally reasonably priced I can\u2019t",
          "Shows the unique cultural heritage of Bali. The great statues and the huge limestone pillars form part of the history and the culture.",
          "Around 2012 or 2013, somehow the ambience is more Balinese than now. It's too modern now and after a long time, it still has very little to show. I was expecting more shops, more art-related activities, besides the dance that they've already had. It will attract more guests and",
          "This place is abandoned more than 5 years but now back on progress again Great statue og Brahma and Jatayu as his ride ... they said the monument will finish this year hopefully There are dance performance at severe times and also ampitheatre too",

          "We visited GWK on a whim, and really weren\u2019t sure what the draw was. The cultural dance was the most interesting bit, but if culture is what you\u2019re after, Taman Nusa is a much better destination for that (see separate review). Beyond that, the place seems to be primarily people",
          "Its a good place to hang around, The Vishnu and Garuda statues and mind blowing. Just curious about how it would look when the entire statue would be ready. But, no worth to watch Kechak dance here. You have better places in Bali for this, definitely not in GWK.",
          "Take this visit as a learning opportunity to find out about the story of Garuda and more Hindu mythology as well as how and why it has impacted Bali so much. The views are spectacular and you shoul spend 2-3 hours here. Very wonderful place. -cinema -spectacular view of Bali",
          "I visited this place in the evening. We entered at 4 pm. The entry ticket for foreigners was IDR 100k per person. They take welcome picture of yours and at the exit they offer print of ur photo with Lord vishnu statue background, but it ips expensive. There are two giant",

          "They have quite big amphitheater for traditional dances. The performance are few times a day. They are still constructing the statue until now; but we still can take photos and enjoying the art. Those who has children can play segway in their very big park. Approximately you",
          "I went with my husband and Yande from Bali Golden Tours. This is a lovely park and we were fascinated by the big walls cut from mountains or hills. Lovely. Plus they are building a big monument which will finish in 2019. We will come back to see the finished article.",
          "Interesting place,nice a musical theater Balinese culture,great place for photography..dont forget to bring a camera :)",
          "I enjoyed visiting this park as not only did we see some extremely big statues, we could look down into the workshop area to get an idea on how they are made as the biggest statue of all is still being created. That wasn't the best bit though...for RP50,000 ($5AUS) we hired",

          "In this location you can explore cultural, they have it a dance show almost every hour!!!!! Also you can enjoy the view and sunset from this location They have delicious big with amazing view restaurant, recommend to come! good for family, couple and big group",
          "The park was poorly signed but very expensive once we made our way in. The size of the statues were impressive as were the rock outcroppings which were massive but overall I can't say the 100K rupiah entry fee made it worth the visit. There was an amphitheater but no",
          "100k Rupiah per person. We went there in the early afternoon, when there weren't any performances, so all we saw was a couple of large statues and many souvenir shops. Very tidy grounds, well-manicured, but again, not much there other than the shops. Not worth the money.",
          "Such of amazing place because it's showing the giant statue of Lord Visnu. But just please take it care specially about the cleanlinest of the are.. otherwise it's superb! Thanks young man",
          "One of the most important things to do in bali You can get very big statue of Wisnu in here Maybe for now it's nothing for you But at least you can see a big statue You can take picture between the big rock You can have a rileks time They offer attraction also Like barong dance",
          "This cultural place is dedicated to Hindu god Vishnu and his ride Garuda the bird. Its a planned architecture with huge statue of Lord Vishnu. Theres amphi theatre for play on hindu mythology. There is huge pathway with segway rides and some adventures. Nice picturesque",
          "One of the high point in Bali where you can see the city and beach. With history about Balinese culture where they build statues of Wisnu and Garuda. They are in a process of building another big statue of Wisnu standing on Garuda, which when complete will be the tallest statues",
          "Nothing found here just unfinished huge statue dance also is not interesting such as samples, not real dance, if you a smart tourist and want to see the real Balinese culture, dance can see the real Barong dance at Batubulan village art is here most people is an professional",
          "Very impressive as you drive in - its a long walk but the do have drivers who can take you up the hill to the start of the walk - the big Vishnu statue is very impressive and the new monument under construction will be magnificent when finished - guides will give you all the",
          "First of all - yes, it is quite expensive at 100,000 IDR per head for non-locals. Go if you wish, but know that it is still being developed. There is a wide expanse of grounds, good for a morning or afternoon stroll. Grab a drink or a snack, take pictures of the beautiful",
          "you can see bali from here, the panoramic is nice, the statue will be the highest statue in the world.",
          "The entrance fees are exorbitant 770000idr for a couple. What s there to see is their barong dance, statue of garuda and vishnu. The view is good. There is a lotus pond ( just the name) where lot of concerts happen and we could see artists rehearsing. In the end you see a",
          "Almost 20 dollars per two persons for just 2 big pieces of statue. They closed the pond and gateway to Garuda. Nothing to look at. Not 1 star just for extremely perfect coconut ice cream.",
          "Prices are higher on weekend and they closed the lotus pond due to an event. Nothing to see. Just waste of money. Totally not recommended.",
          "As stated above the dances are the highlights of the visit. We got a shuttle from hotel. Coffee shops are both inside and outside. Dances arevthe best. Starts at ten AM and every hour.",
          "Garuda temple is one of the must visit place in Bali. There are giant statues of Lord Vishnu and Garuda. One cannot find such huge statue of lord Garuda in any part of the world. After doing the payment, we need to climb few steps to this temple. We are given local attire before",
          "The entrance ticket is very high compared to the displays in the park. Not a must visit, can be avoided.",
          "You will watch traditional dance and history with high and amazing statues. Suggestion to bring some mineral water there very hot and exhausting weather during your trip, but if you have extra money, there is a booth of mineral water available there. The perfect Bali",
          "There are many shows that you can watch here. Every hour is a different show. The landscape is very beautiful. Recommended if you are a photographer. But the weather is hot. Make sure to drink a lot of fluid and wear a suitable cloth.",
          "anytime I visited Bali, I always spare my time to visit GWK, I love watch balinese dance here besides at uluwatu temple, those are my favourite places in Bali. and for two years I visited Bali and attended Soundrenaline (the biggest rock concert in Indonesia)",
          "This attraction was average with just huge statutes. Make the trip worth while by watching at least one performance. I caught the Garuda Wisnu Ballet at 12pm.",
          "Very nice and modern park dedicated to the culture of Bali. I enjoyed the clean bathroom facilities. There was a Balinese dancing show in the beautiful amphitheater. There a sweeping panoramic views of the island.",
          "Verry beautiffull...i just wonder how they made all of this??and how they will combine all of it into 1 big statue?bali is wonderfull..",
          "We were took here by our driver for the day. It wasnt somewhere on our to do list but glad we went. Its an interesting place and very cheap to enter. The statues are amazing as is the centre point of the place. It was not busy at all which was great for taking photos. In",
          "This wasn't our first time here. But we just have a chance to see the traditional dance here. Barong dance and several other traditional dance. It's quite interesting. But one of my kid afraid to see the barong.",
          "Well was not what we expected when our driver pulled up there once inside we changed our minds and throughly enjoyed it it's not finished yet but definitely with a look",
          "It has big statue of Wisnu and Garuda and part of huge landmark project in Bali. They have big Amphitheather for Balinese Cultural Show. You can spent hours in these place with they Bali Dance and other show. It has beautiful panorama of Southern Bali. One of the most visit",
          "Drive quite far from our hotel. Finding some giant statues is amazing. Need to bring a camera while visiting here. Because a lot of good spots for selfie here. This place is visible from the works of fine art and has a beautiful park.",
          "A huge venue. The Garuda statue is simply stunning. The whole project under development is an impressive piece of art and exciting to witness. We had lunch in one of the restaurants, frankly speaking, the food was just so so.",
          "Any temple, even small family temples, are far more beautiful and nicer cultural experience. Half of the stores were closed, the place needs a lot more eye for detail before it can call itself a \"culture park\". Any half day trip to Ubud by far nicer to experience Balinese",
          "Huge cast statues of Wishnu and Garuda are visible from far off, however when you get close to it the huge size and details of the statues take your breath away. Don't forget to see the live Balinese dance performance. Visit in the early morning hours to avoid sun. I am sure you",
          "This place is not much attractive for Indians, as we regularly see those type sculptures, dance performance in the auditorium was good as we can see the cultural dance of Balinese. The driver or guide along with you ll get some points if he brings u to this place. They ll have",
          "Great attractions take time to develop and this is even more applicable in Bali time. The statues make a great back drop for family pics. The ticket price of 100,000Rp per adult or child (foreigners price) is more than other Bali attractions and I think too high for families.",
          "It's a good place to visit on the way to uluwatu temple. The statute of Garuda and Lord Vishnu is great. Good place for a Ariel view of Uluwatu from the Statue. Would say the visit was bad.",
          "Big surprise! Such a huge statue at the end of the world! Somewhat hidden in the hills of Jimbaran. Several restaurants and shops around, and a beautiful park for joggers and nature lovers.",
          "Recommended by our taxi driver who took us for uluwatu afternoon trip. It's a huge beautiful park, but not much to see, only 2 big statues, over-crowded with many local tour\u00ecsts. Some parts of the park were dirty cos of the spreading of empty dirty box, bottles, plastic, and",
          "Really love to came here! We can watch Barong dance, Balinesse dance, Kecak Dance with hour schedule. We can also get a picture with all dancers here. Come and See guys !",

          "Spent several hours here. My daughter loved the Segway and the Movie. Lots of stairs to climb, did not try any of the restaurants , just ice cream and cold drinks, Great place to see Balinese Performance",
          "Good view , Best Culture and Right choice for family time. Here u will know culture about GWK and watch film about GWK at Cinema GWK.",
          "Well its looks quite interesting from outside but you just have 3-4 big statues to see. Its not worth the money and time. If you are correct time then you can attend dance shows which are usually available every hour. We saw Borong dance here and that was the only saving grace.",
          "Went here as part of our tour itinerary with our driver and we were actually clueless about the place. The place is actually boring. Nothing much to see if you ask me. You just get to see a huge statue. Basically that becomes the highlight of the place. So if you ask me, better",
          "My preteen daughters rented the segway around the GWK fields. Apparently there are few restricted areas which is under construction, but there were no sign and/or closed gates. She went down there n the segway got uncontrolled due to rocky downhills road. She fell down badly,",
          "Recommended by the driver who took us round for a half-day trip. The statues are impressive but not enough to make you come all the way out, however, if you are out anyway then no harm to pop in if you don't mind the entrance fee.",
          "The place is well located with great view in the surrounding. But the big statue is not finished yet and it's been years the development is abandoned. Standard experience for tourist visiting this place. Many other better options in the surrounding area.",
          "Garuda Wisnu Kencana is a phenomenal tourist attraction in Bali. You could say this is one of the icons of Bali are worth a visit. Many international events been held in this park. You should be have no doubt about its reputation. The iconic statue both of Vishnu and Garuda",
          "The spacious grounds of this complex were beautifully laid out and the rocks had interesting carvings. The very large statues of the Garuda and Shiva were very impressive. There were some lovely views, the best being looking out to the north over Jimbaran Bay and the narrow",
          "On arrival we were curiously directed to a drop off point, ignored the girl, parked up and were left wondering what next!! Walked up the hill, through the gift shop, spoke to some staff and worked out what was inside and spent the 100k. Was actually very scenic and the",
          "There was a Bali traditional dance performance which was quite entertaining. The structure was magnificent. There was a bench between the rocks where you can sit and enjoy the cool wind, quite a bliss.",
          "for me, the entrance fee is a bit expensive. not much to see, except if you willing to spend half day there, watching some performance.",
          "The Cultural Park is a recent addition with many of the attractions still under construction. Whatever is in place, is wonderful though. The final version once ready, would surely be a must visit place. You can visit this place on the way to Uluwatu Temple.",
          "The place is still under construction however they have traditional dances every hour so if you like to stroll around and get some culture is a good thing to do. The place was a mountain and they carved it so you are strolling in the ancient 'mountain park' however the statues",
          "Garud Vishnu Cultural Park  is 20% finished. The planned monument of god Vishnu riding Garuda is yet to be assembled. You can now find arms, body and garuda in different spots on top of the mountain.  . . The amphitheater hosts shows of Balinese dances. It's worth the while",
          "Nice place to visit. Overpriced for the GWKCP for what it is. Lotus pond is pretty. 2 huge statues that are impressive and another being built. The park looks unfinished in my opinion. I expected more but maybe my expectations are too high. Aimed at tourists.",
          "Entrance fee: locals (idr 70k), foreigner (idr 100k) thats huge amount of money for an unfinished cultural park. My friends and i a total of 3 paid idr 300k and was very very disappointed. While entrance fee for popular destination is bali like tanah lot is just idr 20k and",
          "great place for recreation with family, both a unique photos, history and culture for curious visitors. vasilitas imaginable: the eagle monument Vishnu and Garuda form of a human head, the fountain mystical, art shops, performing arts, dance and culture konfoi in the afternoon.",
          "Garuda wins kencana is a great place for you to take a photo, to have fun with others, or just see the wonderful sight. I reccomended for you to come to this place,Maybe its far from Kuta but its worth",
          "Found the place on the way while going to Uluwatu Temple. The sculptures are huge, detailed and impressive. The park is made from the rocks. You can even set the concerts in there.",
          "We went to see the dance and we found it a little bit complicated to get to the top as we had to park the motorbike at the bottom of the hill but worth it every minute",
          "This attraction when finished will be better ,but at the moment it's all a bit too much too soon. The head of the statue is impressive as are the other pieces and when it all comes together it will look stunning. but at the moment the park is almost empty apart from a few shops",
          "Its a good attraction for people who loves exploring Mythology , the statues looks very alluring . Its a great built to view The performance by local artist is worth watch ,There is a mini theater where shows are played in intervals, do not miss this , it helps us understand",
          "I didn't know what to expect coming to the GWK Park in October 2016. The park was still very much under development, and I spent most of my time wandering around trying to work out where to go and what to see as there was no signs. There are some beautiful enormous carved out",
          "We came to GWK Cultural Park as part of our day tour itinerary, recommended by the driver. Entrance fees was 100,000Rp/pax. We spend less than an hour here and still wondering what should we be looking at! No proper explanation of the park and besides a few statues, many",
          "A nice place for you to take a relaxing stroll if you don't really have anything planned for the day. They provide cultural show about the Vishnu, but it's gonna be hard for foreigners to understand because they don't talk in english nor provide a slide for translation. Even as",
          "Our driver took us here and was very enthusiastic about telling us about the culture and religion of Bali, which was interesting, but aside from that it is nothing to write home about. We understand the cultural park has been in the developmental phases for many years but has",
          "I found this location on Google maps in the middle of Nusa Dua area for a side trip for my parents visit. Lots of stairs so my dad could only enjoy the theatre dancing while mom and I ventured to see the giant Hindu sculptures that seemed to tower over what seems to be an",
          "The park is set in an abandoned limestone quarry. It is scenic and pleasant but the BIG attraction is this huge statue of Vishnu that they are building. The body of Vishnu is only a relatively small part of the statue. It will be right up there with the Statue of Liberty etc.",
          "Is it park? Photography studio for prewed? jogging track? Sport game station? Superblock? Dance theather? Or resort? I can't see something special, just cheap souvenir in park area. I think this is failed investment, no progress. Need any mantainance, new vision of management,",
          "Very nice day here intresting and cultural bit of a distance as stayed in legian bit had a nice day and photos",
          "The entrance gives you an idea there is much to see but soon after many empty shops, unfinished parking lot etc etc. In the park itself you can walk around and see everything in 20 min. In the beginning I saw a dance show where everything was told in local language...",
          "Loved walking through this park and was glad that we had a guide to explain the statues and their significance to Bali's culture. First, I was extremely impressed with Wisnu - both the statue and the history of Wisnu. Then I was completely surprised by the Garuda statue which",
          "Located on Uuwatu area, this is the famous gigantic Bali's cultural park....the entrance ticket is expensive compared for what you get inside. But indeed they need big money to maintain this huge park, so please understand. Inside there's giant statue of Vishnu and his Garuda",
          "GWK closed to Uluwatu, so I plan it in my Uluwatu trip too. The place still under construction, some of the area not open yet. It's just only have two big statue, Garuda and Wisnu. And may have traditional show on some period. Entry fees bout IDR100k.",
          "The complex is beautiful with walkways cut through huge pieces of stone. The statue they are building will be larger than the Statue of Liberty. It has an amphitheater for performances, shops and food. Portions of the statue are on display. It's a cool place to hang out",

          "If you wanna watch many authentic show, like barong dance, balinese dance and many more, you should go to this place. There are many show on their schedule in here, but they still need to provide a way for disable person (wheelchair and elderly member) to enjoy this place",

          "There are many show in here, you can watch balinese dance, barong dance and many more. You can bring your family to enjoy this place. There will be the tallest statue in Bali (still under constraction).",

          "First time i visit this place, i got piss ,and the toilet of this place was clean. And that started to walk highland. So many entrance. First souvenir shop next to the theathre and then next to climb some stair to reach GWK statue......and wow,,,,take some photo next to great",

          "Tourist trap. The park is not finished and it doesn't look like they plan to finish it. You have to pay extra for every little thing. The statue is impressive but it's placed on an ugly looking building. No chance to take a good picture. Also all the good reviews here seem bought reviews. I don't recommend it.",
          "Beautiful temples and statues located in the large park. Easily accessible as well for those with disabilities. The main areas are pretty clean, but look next to the fences and outside and there's tons and tons of trash. Please pick up \u2026",

          "Very good place. It has a huge statue of Garuda. Very nearly maintened.",
          "The statue is impressive. However there isn't much interest in seeing it close up. The surroundings don't have much interests, sun is blazing, organisation is heavy:you have to park, shuttle, pay, walk 10 minutes to entrance. All this for a price, above your average meal.",
          "Awesome place, dont forget book from traveloka apps so you got souvenirs",
          "Total rip-off. Spent lots of time waiting for transportation and ticketing upon arriving. The statue is huge from outside but you could only access the ground floor, which is a gallery area without much to see. Access to higher floor of the \u2026",

          "Good place, but can be skipped if not enough time.",
          "Amazing to look at the statue from far away. But the cultural park isn't worth for a visit tho",
          "Amazing site. It was one of my favorite pleces in Bali.",
          "Really great experience, to see this monument, but additionally, to 125000IDR entry, they wanna have 150000IDR for entering the platforms, in the statue. That's outrageously.",
          "Heaps to see and do if you get the chance I highly recommend it",

          "It was quite nice place but try to go early in the morning or late evening..",
          "Place is great and better compared last time. But everything pay and quite expensive in GWK. Ticket to entry 125K (local), keret\u00e0 30K, scuter 60K all cost per person and look in top 250K (if i'm not mistaken - i'm forget). Mineral \u2026",

          "Nice place. U can watch kecak dance.",
          "Nice views from high at the statue but not that impressive as a total experience. Feels like a lost chance to show visitors more about the history of Bali. At the base of the statue were only pictures of the presidents during various phases of the building procedure. The dance show at the amphitheatre though was very nice...",
          "Money money money! Interesting place with some nice mega statues, but somehow I find it very commercialised. There are additional charges for transport, and tour within the statue. Can be quite pricey (300k) per pax if you add them all up. \u2026",
          "Got to learn about the history of GWK and the people involved with it. Very inspiring. I felt lucky that I am still alive when it is finally done.\n\nThere's a tour inside where we can go up the statue and learn, and the system is pretty solid where we ride shuttle bus until the bottom of the statue. Very well organized.",

          "This park is a joke. Just some new big statues that seem to have only commercial purposes. Clear intention of this \u2018cultural\u2019 park is to make as much money as possible out of tourists. For the 125000 rupee entrance fee, you get nothing as \u2026",

          "On the whole this place is a tourist trap, but one worth seeing.  The Garuda and Vishnu statue is the 4th largest bronze monument in the world and the smaller reliefs offer great selfie opportunities. It's built in an old quarry which is interesting in itself. Note: you enter and exit through the gift shop...",

          "Great place to come and join with the family, there is shuttle bus from parking area to ticket area.

          "The park is not fully finished but it is already amazing.  It is divided into small scene or stage until you reach the main \"Garuda Wisnu Kencana Statue\".\nIf you wish to see the whole park, pretty sure you will spend more than 1 hour.\nSome show is also available depending on the schedule.",

          "The admission price for the park does not include admission to go up the Garuda statue which is a additional 150k per person, which is more than the admission price. \n\nThey have e-scooter rentals inside the park but you would need to return them to the same point, which is a little redundant.",
          "Impressive statue of Lord Visnu. Verry nice site to visit!",
          "Cool place.one of the must go place in Bali, but once is enough. Magnificent statue i must say. And there are also performances to entertain you. Do buy tickets online for a cheaper pricing and better to go by motorbike is u plan to leave the place after sunset. Traffic is quite bad because it shares the same road from uluwatu temple.",
          "The access for visitors who choose to walk is not very friendly. Better if there have some trees to cover them from the sun.",

          "I've been there 5 years ago when the big statue was just in it's early stage of construction. Now you can hardly get lost anymore if you go upstairs at any place in a radius of 15km around it including Kuta. Even works as orientation at \u2026",

          "Nice place to visit and take photos. But IMO, it's overpriced. You should pay 3\nIDR30k more to use shuttle car, and then pay again if you want to go up from the lift inside the statue.",

          "nice place, love to visit but not going in, cause ticket prize so expensive",
          "Waste of time. Beautiful statues but that's all. Pay 150k for entrance, should paid another 150k to go inside statue for a museum and a view of Bali. Not worth it. No clear exit sign, staff aren't helpful either. Asked for directions to staffs only to have us run around in circles",
          "Amazing park. We stumbled upon it on the way to Uluwatu and it needed up being so nice to see their modern work. The park is peaceful and offers unique souvenir for visitors:)",

          "A mesmerizing scenery, so much change since last time i was here.",
          "Its awkward, kind of big on a scale to walk yet nothing much to see. Its deceiving and not worth the money or effort unfortunately. No views either, although on a hill. Disappointing indeed.",
          "Great cultural park, very worth a visit. Be prepared to walk since the amenities are added extras. Don't hesitate to linger at the festival grounds downstairs (not at sculpture base), because there's virtually nothing in the pedestal",

          "The place is huge and requires quite a bit of walking, so make sure to bring and drink a lot of water. For families with kids/toddler, it's a good idea to purchase additional ticket for shuttle golf car. When we visited here on Jan 2019, \u2026"

        "wiki": "Besakih Temple is a pura complex in the village of Besakih on the slopes of Mount Agung in eastern Bali, Indonesia. It is the most important, the largest and holiest temple of Hindu religion in Bali, and one of a series of Balinese temples. Perched nearly 1000 meters up the side of Gunung Agung, it is an extensive complex of 23 separate but related temples with the largest and most important being Pura Penataran Agung. The temple is built on six levels, terraced up the slope. The entrance is marked by a candi bentar (split gateway), and beyond it the Kori Agung is the gateway to the second courtyard.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe precise origins of the temple are unclear but its importance as a holy site almost certainly dates from prehistoric times. The stone bases of Pura Penataran Agung and several other temples resemble megalithic stepped pyramids, which date back at least 2,000 years.\nIt was certainly used as a Hindu place of worship from 1284 when the first Javanese conquerors settled in Bali. By the 15th century, Besakih had become a state temple of the powerful Gelgel dynasty.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe temple is on the southern slopes of Mount Agung, the principal volcano of Bali.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nPura Besakih is a complex made up of twenty-three temples that sit on parallel ridges. It has stepped terraces and flights of stairs which ascend to a number of courtyards and brick gateways that in turn lead up to the main spire or Meru structure, which is called Pura Penataran Agung. All this is aligned along a single axis and designed to lead the spiritual person upward and closer to the mountain which is considered sacred.The main sanctuary of the complex is the Pura Penataran Agung. The symbolic center of the main sanctuary is the lotus throne, or padmasana, which is therefore the ritual focus of the entire complex. It dates to around the seventeenth century.A series of eruptions of Mount Agung in 1963, which killed approximately 1,700 people\nalso threatened Pura Besakih. The lava flows missed the temple complex by mere meters. The saving of the temple is regarded by the Balinese people as miraculous, and a signal from the gods that they wished to demonstrate their power but not destroy the monument the Balinese faithful had erected.\n\n\n== Festivals ==\nEach year there are at least seventy festivals held at the complex, since almost every shrine celebrates a yearly anniversary. This cycle is based on the 210-day Balinese Pawukon calendar year.It had been nominated as a World Heritage Site as early as 1995, but was pulled out on 2015.\n\n\n== Visitors ==\nIn 2013, foreign visitors accounted for 84,368 persons (77.2 percent of all visitors), while domestic visitors accounted for 24,853 persons (22.8 percent).\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIllegal donations are extorted by local youths from surrounding villages from visiting tourists.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndonesian architecture\nBalinese Hinduism\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nI Nyoman Darma Putra and Michael Hitchcock (2005) Pura Besakih: A world heritage site contested in Indonesia and the Malay World, Volume 33, Issue 96 July 2005, pages 225 - 238\nStuart-Fox, David J.(2002) Pura Besakih: temple, religion and society in Bali KITLV, Original from the University of Michigan (Digitized 5 September 2008 into Google Books) ISBN 90-6718-146-3, ISBN 978-90-6718-146-4 . 470 pages\n\n\n== External links ==\n Besakih travel guide from Wikivoyage",

          "Biggest scam of Bali. \u201cMandated\u201d tour guide wanted a tip on top of parking and entrance fee and scamming us into praying and forcing us to donate. Do not visit. Better temples in Bali that are FAR less expensive.",
          "This is a very busy tourist spot so there will be long lines and a wait so try to get there very early. For the Gate, There is a Picture Stand in line where they hand out Numbers & this goes all day long and can take hours. All that said you have to go here. It is a climb",
          "The ticket price includes the entrance fee, a motor scooter ride up the to the temple itself and a guide. We have our own sarong (essential kit if you want to visit several temples in Bali and show respect for local culture). At the entrance you will probably be surrounded by",

It\u2019s a ton of walking, but it\u2019s so beautiful. Be careful of all the tourist traps. People try to insist",
          "The temple itself is situated at the base of Mount Agung,an active volcano, and right at the edge of the exclusion zone as the volcano continues to erupt and has done so the last few years. Be mindful of current warnings as if there is an eruption there's essentially one road",

          "Also called the mother temple this complex is quite picturesque. The entry ticket you buy includes a sarong, a guide and a scooter ride up till the main entrance (however one needs to walk down back). If you are a hindu and want to perform the prayer do buy the offerings vendors",

          "Only downside is at every step you will find people trying to get money out of you. Just be clever and avoid that at all cost. However, I give it 5/5 because this review is for the temple only. Beautiful temple with such rich history. Definitely worthy of one day trip. Roam",

          "The people around the temple are con artists and appear to have nothing but money on their minds. Beware of all the little tricks and lies to get your money, including the guides that are supposed to be free once you purchase the entry ticket. Couldn't even go into any of the",
          "I went to visit the temple without reading the reviews first. That was a mistake. The ticket was I think 80000rp or 100000rp I can\u2019t remember. It includes a scooter trip from the ticket office to the temple ( up the hill, about maybe 1.5km. A guide is also included in the visit.",

        "wiki": "Tirta Empul temple (Indonesian: Pura Tirta Empul) is a Hindu Balinese water temple located near the town of Tampaksiring, Bali, Indonesia. The temple compound consists of a petirtaan or bathing structure, famous for its holy spring water, where Balinese Hindus go to for ritual purification. The temple pond has a spring which gives out fresh water regularly, which Balinese Hindus consider to be holy or amritha. Tirta Empul means Holy Spring in Balinese.\n\n\n== Construction of the temple ==\nTirta Empul Temple was founded around a large water spring in 962 A.D. during the Warmadewa dynasty (10th-14th centuries). The name of the temple comes from the ground water source named \"Tirta Empul\". The spring is the source of the Pakerisan river. The temple is divided into three sections: Jaba Pura (front yard), Jaba Tengah (central yard) and Jeroan (inner yard). Jaba Tengah contains 2 pools with 30 showers which are named accordingly: Pengelukatan, Pebersihan and Sudamala dan Pancuran Cetik (poison).The temple is dedicated to Vishnu, another Hindu god name for the supreme consciousness Narayana. \nOn a hill overlooking the temple, a modern villa was built for President Sukarno's visit in 1954. The villa is currently a rest house for important guests.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Water quality ==\nFor most of the time, Tirta Empul is believed as a source of clean water for ritual bathing. However, according to a Coconut Bali report in 2017, authorities were investigating reports of water pollution and health risk at Tirta Empul from Gianyar.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBalinese Hinduism\nList of Hindu temples in Indonesia\n\n\n== References ==",

          "I found this temple a bit too touristic. I think you have a better experience if you go into the water (you have to do it in the tradition) but if you don't then the temple itself is not the most beautiful.",

          "We visited the Tirta temple on our visit to Bali, it was a beautiful place, felt so peaceful and calm. Costs 50,000 ind rupiah for tourists and 30,000 for locals to go inside and pray. We all were given a sarong to our on even though we had long trousers and shoulders",

          "Another Bali temple that is being ruined by mass market tourism in my view. Twenty, thirty and forty years ago when I have visited, there was a delightful aura about the place as local Balinese used the pools to carry out their rituals. Today, tourist hordes line up to change",
          "This by far is the highlight of Bali - so mesmerizing in its energy, beautiful temple of holy water and simple Hindu rituals that energize the body, mind and soul. Take a guide, read up before if you are not familiar with Hindu beliefs. This is the one place you should not miss",

          "We went there in the morning during the less touristy hours when it was calm and beautiful. The temple looked very traditional and less touristy. The architecture and the vibe around the temple will enable you to embrace your inner peace and happiness. This is one of those",
          "Anyone staying in Ubud should definitely try this! The temple is beautiful, but you really need to do the cleansing ritual to get the best of this experience. They loan you a sarong for both walking around at the entrance, and then another for entering the pools - which you can",

          "I went to the Git Git falls 4 years ago and accessed it from a different direction from which we took this time.There are allot of stairs to go up and down so if you are not of average fitness then maybe don't do this one.It seemed allot bigger than the last time I was",
          "We were on our way back from lovina beach , and our driver dropped us there , a guide there met us , i believe that we got scammed as the guide explained that seeing one waterfall is 100000 IDR and 3 is at 300000IDR , than took us to get the vouchers , we opted for 1 waterfall ,",
          "A short walk past all the local vendors, they are not too persistent, and you reach the falls and the river. Worthwhile taking time to stop off here and sit with your feet in the cool river. Buy some spices from the stall holders and of course barter barter and then barter more.",
          "To reach it you descend a steep ladder so if you're afraid of heights don't go. However, it's worth it if heights don't bother you. Tip though it always seems to be raining or about to rain when you go to Git Git so if it's been raining heavily in southern Bali the falls will",
          "Visited with our tour guide we had some pics in front of the water fil which is amazing and then we swam in the cold water. The water is very fresh. Make sure you go to the lower pools as the top ones have a lot of water pressure and could cause you to fall and hurt yourself",
          "This waterfall was a nice surprise after parking in a very urban area. The walk down was nice but be careful if it's wet because it can be slippery. Be prepared for souvenir shops lining the path down to the falls. The waterfall is very picturesque and serene. I very much",
          "The mornings are the best time to visit the waterfalls as it tends to be quieter. No need for a guide who hang around at the entrance and charge up to 300000 for their service. The paths are good and easy to navigate. Dont forget your towel if you fancy a swim!",
          "We were staying in Lovna and still the journey took about an hour. To reach the waterfall you have to take about a 300 metre hike up and down steps passing quite a few sellers with sarongs etc.There is a small warung but not very appealing. Think twice if you are planning a day",
          "It is on a main road and tons of tourists. We stopped here and unfortunately so did several bus loads. I think if I visited again it would be early morning before the tourist arrive. Try to get there about 8am so you can actually enjoy this attraction.",
          "We stopped here on our way back to Ubud from Lovina Beach. It was a very tall majestic waterfall. Easy access form the main road and worth the stop.",
          "Only short walk from road, paved with some steps but well worth looking at. Beautiful dramatic waterfall with pool at bottom. Bit cold with heaps of spray. Went for swim a little further downstream. Clear and clean with fast flow. Hidden natural gem. Very glad we stopped. Take a",
          "Pretty waterfalls but don't take a guide. A guide will quote an entry price that \"is just for the entry and for the village\" not for the guide them self. If you agree to pay, you're just paying for the guide. Entry is pretty cheap but the guides are just not necessary and ask",
          "Lovely waterfalls BUT be careful as the local guide will try and SCAM you. The entrance price is only max 20k for adults and 10k for children, the guide will try and sell you a story regarding tour and monies will go to educating the kids from the village. This may be true but",
          "The view was amazing. There is only 1 way down so don't worry about getting a guide, just politely say you know your way. Along the way down there will be vendors selling their handmade wares - crochet, quilts, etc. for you to bargain. You can go by the waterfall, pretty",
          "A gentle stroll to a fine waterfall. Quite a lot of stalls selling local produce and souvenirs on the walk ... No problem. A popular but not over busy attraction.",
          "Gitgit has been famous since dutch time for recreational activities. Its close location to the Singaraja main road makes it so popular among locals. Stop a moment and enjoy the cool clean water flowing on your feet. There are many handicrafts made locally in the area such as",
          "When we went we got their early and was the only ones there for.a while. The entrance fee was only 10,000 which was good. I'd read other reviews saying you could swim in there, but the water was too cold and there's loads of rocks! There was a Balinese woman there preying and",
          "Worth the visit if it is along the way - but not a destination in its won right The seller on the path to the waterfall are pretty desperate and prices of their goods are 25-50% of what they are in South Bali",
          "Tucked behind thick foliage and off an off-beat road from Singaraja, these waterfalls were a pleasant discovery. The gushing waters fall off a dark,secluded corner of the forest and its perfect for an adventure swim too.",
          "This waterfall is definitely beautiful, but not worth making a special trip for. However, if you are in the area or passing through, it's worth stopping for. The waterfall is not super big compared to others I'd seen, but the scenery around it is gorgeous. This is not a fall to",
          "Easy short walk to magnificent waterfall. Easily accessible and justifiably popular. Go early if you can to avoid the really big crowds and you won't be disappointed. Take swimming gear if you fancy a cool dip.",
          "A short walk from the entrance will take you to the falls, a guide is not necessarily. There are many vendors along the way trying to sell you souvenirs. Not worth a deliberate trip, but could be lovely on your way to Lovina or to hot springs. 30-60 minute excursion in total.",
          "We stopped here when passing by and were glad we did. We went under our own steam and didnt use a guide. Personally you don't need a guide ... It's really well sign posted and you just follow the path and steps down. Along the way there is the usual stalls selling goods. The",
          "The waterfalls itself was amazing, but the lack of information on the entrance cost made it expensive. We're not sure if we entered through the right entrance, as it looked fishy. But everything turned out fine, we had a guide who went with us.",
          "This beautiful waterfall is a lovely way to kill half an hour but isn't a must see tourist attraction. Beware of guides trying to sell themselves, our driver warned us of them but a guide is far from necessary. The route down to the waterfall is a good 10/15 minute walk with",
          "This waterfall was amazing! My husband and I climbed the rocks and took some amazing photos. My husband tried to go underneath it but he said being close enough was good and that he loved to be under such a powerful force. Our boys loved it as well but stayed off the rocks to be",
          "Nice spot. Great view. And super refreshing. Nice walk all the way down to the waterfall. For you who have a chance passing this place, you won't regret it. I am a local tourist living in a village with lush rice paddy view and gitgit waterfall I found very charming spots.",
          "About a 15 minute walk from the carpark down into the gorge you get to a series of waterfalls. Turn left and follow the noise to get the the double falls which are very beautiful. You can get in and swim here and go between and under them ( good head massage!). There are also",
          "Me and my friend visited this rainfall recently and it was pouring with rain so we had the place to almost to ourselves. We left our belongings under the sheltered hut and ventured out to swim in the waterfall because we had driven so far to see it! You should wear thongs as the",
          "We went to Gitgit Waterfall yesterday with a hired driver. On arrival at the waterfalls parking we didn't get a chance, the scammer was all over us the minute we stepped out of the car. He told us the price was 200000 Rp for one person and one waterfall and 300000 Rp to see two",
          "We went here early in the morning before the seller stalls were opened. It was very peaceful and beautiful. The water was roaring but there was a quiet feeling in the area except for the sounds of birds. The lush tropical green is a spectacular setting for this beautiful",
          "Roaming in Singaraja at the first time, we thought, that we should have to visit Gitgit waterfall since it was close and we already heard too many praises of it to omit it. The second time I was curious that will it be the same impressive as the first time or disappointing.",
          "we like this waterfall eventhough we need effort to get there . i suggest to take a guide to save your time. this waterfall is save for children compare with sekumpul waterfall due to the track is not too extreme. don't forget to bring extra clothes, towel and water.",
          "First of all - DO NOT PAY anyone who asks you money, except the necessary 10k at the entrance booth. The reviews mention having to pay 300k for entrance...that is simply a tourist scam. Don't be crazy. The waterfall is beautiful. You can bathe around it and sunbathe on the rocks",
          "The place is not hard to find. The walkways to the waterfall is also nicely paved, so, don't worry have to walk on dirt road, which we don't really care about (it's the adventure that made it worth). The stairs down is only steep in some places, otherwise it's a leaisure walk.",
          "The waterfalls are beautiful. The walk ways are very steep with lots of irregular spaced out steps this could be difficult in places for older people or those with bad knees. Wear good shoes. The hawkers on the paths are mostly friendly and fine if you dont buy something.",
          "about 3 hours drive from main Bali areas, really nice set of waterfalls accessible from an easy path straight off the road. The 10 minute walk takes you past a few local merchants and you don't need a guide, but can do so from the road if you see value. Waterfalls are",
          "We went yesterday, the walk is nice and peaceful and the waterfall is cool and refreshing, however the entrance fee is a scam. They say money goes to school the children but a cut back goes to your driver for bringing you here. The price we were charged was stupid. There are",
          "A pleasant stroll of about twenty minutes down to the 'fall itself down a well defined path - beware \"guides\" at the roadside touting for business - you do not need one. Plenty of stalls selling clothes and souvenirs on the way. Not pushy, and available for about a quarter of",
          "We were in the area so decided to stop. It was lovely, but we have seen more picturesque and natural on this island.",
          "A quick walk from the road opens up to a huge and lush waterfall. The greenery around the water is truly tropical making the sight breathtaking. Beyond the stunning view is the pool at the bottom of the falls where you can bathe. It is a way to connect personally with this",
          "We got taken to these by our driver when we would have preferred to go elsewhere but somehow there was a communication breakdown. We were grabbed by a guide as we parked and our driver said we would be better off with guide so we went with it. In the end the guide was OK but",
          "This waterfall is up north in Bali,its far away from places people mostly stay in, so try to take other attractions on the way,The ride to the waterfall is amazing,lots of beautiful scenery. For me Tegenungan waterfall was more fun but gitgit is the highest waterfall in Bali so",
          "We chose not to use a guide and had no problem finding the falls on our own. We arrived after a big downpour so the steps were a little muddy but still easy to navigate. With clearing skies and warm temperatures the spray from the falls was refreshing. Also, it was not too",
          "We got there a little late in the day, so we had to rush. It was not a long walk, but we got very sweaty anyway because of the heat and humidity. The waterfall is nice, but we've seen bigger and nicer ones for example in Island. But it is worth a trip anyway.",
          "This place is amazing. The main waterfall is incredible and was not busy at all when I visited. Got to swim around the base of the waterfall on my own for 20 minutes which was great. The landscape in general is amazing around there. Costs a nominal amount to enter 30k I think",
          "Don't wear slippers. Wear water shoes! Be careful when walking through the currents. Water was cold. Had nice picnic. Great time.",
          "We stopped here as part of a tour with a hired driver. We also met some Balinese men at the entrance who wanted 600,000RP entrance fee. We were very shocked by this high cost and hadn't expected it, he did not explain what this cost was, just said it was the entrance fee, so",
          "Don't get me wrong, the falls are quite beautiful and there is an opportunity to swim under the falls but this was nothing spectacular and it's worth a visit if you're in the area. The drive to the site was very scenic; foggy jungle hills dotted with monkeys. When we arrived",
          "Went on a rainy day, nice short hike, beautiful falls. Of all the waterfalls we saw this would be the last to recommend however it is right on the major route so why not?",
          "just a few tourist, for an amazing place ! You need to go here, if you're brave you can go swim at the bottom of the waterfall. And enjoyed the picture you'll take !",
          "A lot of stairs to navigate, but we thought it was worth the hike. Nice waterfall that the kids enjoyed. Not enjoyable carrying the kids back up....but that is family life! A lot of shops along the walk that you can use to break up the walk. A sign said 250 m, but I think it is",
          "Gitgit waterfalls are very impressive, especially the very tall one at the lower level (45m high) generating a strong force and wind",
          "Lovely walk DOWN to the waterfall. Don`t know the cost as it was a group prepaid tour. The falls are nestled in an out of the way place, well worth the visit. I do have pictures but cannot show them as people are in them.Quite a steep walk back up.",
          "The drive to this place is prettier than the water fall itself. It was a pleasant experience but it's not a must visit place.",
          "There are 3 types of this waterfall. Single, multi level and twin. We missed the first 2 spots as there were no obvious signboards to those places (or we were too concentrating on the road). But we managed to go to the twin type. It is like a normal waterfall only. There's a",
          "Our driver told us it would be around 20 minutes to walk into the waterfall, and it was. A man approached us and offered to \"guide\" us for Aus $15 but we declined his offer and walked in ourselves. We had to pay a 50c entry to the falls a little further on but that was fine!",
          "Such an amazing beautiful waterfall! Looking at other reviews it would seem to depend on which entrance you use, as to the price charged. The one we went to had the price printed on the ticket booth & was only 10000 IDR each. Well worth the trek as it is truly beautiful.",
          "Brought my my tour guide here, needed to trek for 15-20 minutes before reaching the falls, not swimmable but you could chill in front of the fall, take pictures and rest for a while",
          "Nice place, seemed to be a bit dark (not sunny), but it is still worth to see this nice waterfall and wash your body in the cold clean water!",
          "Really beautiful and peaceful place to visit. Waterfall is easy to be found by yourself. Walk takes around 10min. Take dip in water!",
          "There is about 20 minutes walk/stairs until you reach the waterfall. On the way there are a lot of shops and it can be quite annoying as they put a lot of pressure on you to buy...saying you are the first customer/ or for good luck. All i can say is bargain if you want to buy",
          "Magnificent waterfall appreciated more because of the walk down there and then found out that families in that area and the kids walk that pathway every day to and from school. What a wonderful sound that would be to hear every day. Loved it and all the little shops on the way",
          "Waterfalls are beautiful, and Git Git Waterfall is no exception. From the parking area, you have to take a walk down some steps to get to the waterfall, and one of the Balinese men in the parking area, it appeared---and was the case for us---must accompany you to the waterfall,",
          "We've seen so many waterfalls across Asia that it's often times difficult to recall any that stick out after a visit. This is not the case with gitgit waterfall. After taking a motorbike through stunning winding roads you arrive at the falls (after of course wandering through",
          "Gitgit Waterfall is too beautiful I'm lost for words! One of the must go attraction in Bali! Really!!!",
          "Nice small lagoon, short hike. Make sure you get a receipt for the entrance fee. You pass a small private clove farm on the way in.",
          "We paid about \u00a32.50 each entrance fee to go here, there's a short trek (about 15min) to get to the actual waterfall and it's not a very accessible path so bear that in mind. Also be aware of the young children trying to sell things although this stops very close to the entrance",
          "Slippery when wet! Nice walk true all kinds of schops with the know Souvenirs. Waterfall is not that far from the road. Take a towel with you. You can get wet from the waterfall.",
          "Amazing waterfall! It's quite a walk when it's really hot, but it's a nice walk. There's some marketstalls along the way. Once at the waterfall, it's so peaceful. Out driver told us that it's not popular because it's so far away but it's the nicest one to see. We went closer to",
          "First thing you need to know is that a \"Guide\" will appear, just say \"Don't Need a Guide\" and stick to that and they leave you alone after 30 sec or so. Second is that there will be little girls trying to sell you things or beg for money, just say \"no,thanks\" and keep walking",
          "This was my husbands fav... Him and my daughter went in swimming under the waterfalls which was as cold as our waters back in Victoria, Australia, rare find for something that cold in Bali! The walk down is quite steep and the walk back up is a killer although the beautiful view",
          "Like many people we got majorly ripped off. We visited Gitgit as part of a day tour with a driver from a friend's hotel. We paid 600,000 rupiah for the day (15k each) and additional fees for each place we stopped at. Gitgit was by far the worst - as soon as we stepped out of the",
          "The place not too far from singaraja about 15 minutes .. And the waterfalls not too far from the parking areas, tracking about 5 minute, and we can listen the waterfalls from parking areas .. Gitgit waterfall has two.. The one we can't swim we only can take a picture cause the",
          "The waterfalls themselves are very nice but nothing spectacular. Our experience, unfortunately, was overshadowed by the crooks running the entrance booth and the amount of trash. We had read that the entrance fee was 10,000 IDR but the people there insisted on 20,000 IDR per",
          "We were advised by our driver to visit Gitgait waterfall as he said it was further out of the way and not as many tourists would be around so it wouldn\u2019t be as busy as other waterfalls. It was well worth the drive and it was only a short 5-10 minute walk down to the waterfall.",
          "Walking through a rainforest, you face 1 huge waterfall, the Gitgit one, and the twins on the other side, where you can swim in the swallow lake.",
          "The experience is simply not worth the money paid. It was $15AUD/head, to view the waterfalls. There track was narrow and suitable for the short walk in, but not for the shooters that were also allowed to go up and down. Litter is appalling walking in and also in the water.",
          "We read lot of good reviews about this place. We had very high expectations from this place. Frankly this was like any other waterfall. Like all other waterfalls you have to walk down an endless number of slippery stairs. Once you reach the bottom you can't even bathe there.",
          "Wake up early and have a quite and zen time at the waterfalls with a nice guide. It was beautiful and non touristic!",
          "a great place, however there is entry charges. the water is clean and area is quiet preserved. we when there for photoshooting and paid 200,000 rupiah. i personally feel is not that worth of $$, the waterfall is a bit small, good for relax and chill but not photoshooting (as",
          "We took a day trip to Lovina and went to Git git on the way. It's a bit of a walk to get to it, up and down some steep steps but it was worth it. The waterfall is beautiful; we got some lovely photos thanks to our guide.",
          "Visiting Gitgit was our driver's idea. We can't thank him enough for bringing us to this fabulous place. On a very warm day with occasional showers it was a pure bliss to jump in a refreshing waters under Gitgit waterfall. An experience to remember!",
          "This twin-falls is in the middle of nowhere and only very few people go there. U can park close by and walk about 500 m to the falls. The entrance is 5000 (not 10,000) rupiah. They are worth going to, very beautiful falls",
          "If you drive to the North this is a good place to stop. Take the time to visit the Waterfall. Your driver can have a rest and drink some coffee. It also saves you the trip to visit this when you are staying in a hotel in Lovina.",
          "If you are heading up the north of Bali, do yourself a favour and check out GitGit Waterfall. It is a couple of hundred meters off the road however there is a paved path all the way. There are a lot of steps along the way, however if you take it slowly it is an easy walk.",
          "The waterfalls are of course stunning and you can swim at one. There are 3 in total and the drive up is great for views of the rice fields and mountains. Along the way stop and buy some fruit to feed the monkeys that are on the side of the road. When you get there",
          "These falls are very high, the weather near them is cool and fun! the water is cold and its fun to have a short swim! You get tea and some snacks and good 1 hour to spend with family and friends! Only disadvantage - they are in north bali which is almost 5 hour drive (one way)",
          "Although walking past the vendors trying to sell you everything you could think of (which was the only thing I didn't enjoy about my time at Git Git), this visit was one of the stand out places I visited in Bali this trip. We hired a guide, 300,000 - but got a receipt and the",
          "when its not busy with many tourists its quite nice sitting there with the huge fall and the many butterflies. to bad the entire walk you are faced with shops and shouting salesmen...about 15 minutes long. very annoying",

          "Short 1km walk, on well made path to waterfall. A lot of water rushing down but at the end of the day it's just a waterfall. If you've never seen one or got spare time while in the area go see it, but I wouldn't go out of my way. Felt like I was on a well trodden tourist path -",
          "We visited all 3 waterfalls which all where stunning. It is also possible to take a bath in one and swing on a rope like Tarzan. We had a local guide which we paid at the end (you can choose how much to pay). The guide made the experience even better with much of information,",
          "Maybe I am too picky, but this is an average waterfall, at the end of 800 m up/down stairs from parking. Lots of cheap souvenirs shops along the way.",
          "The falls are some of the best you can see but be prepared for a fair hike. Scenery is superb so natural and untampered with but the walk back is overtaxing if you are not used to a rigorous trudging up a lot of step , would not recommend to anyone with bad knees .",
          "The trip from South Bali to here, was really interesting, where you can see the real Bali The Falls is great and good for photography. Just don`t pay any money for a guide, coz they asked us 7 euro, which compared to other guides in other waterfalls, is very expensive, while the",

          "If you're starting from Kuta get ready for a long drive through the Balinese country, forests and mountains. This is where you see the real Bali. Its an area with 3 waterfalls, but you can only swim in the first one. At first you will be hassled by the locals asking for insane",
          "This was a highlight of our recent trip to bali. Lucky for us we took a wrong turn and ended up at the bottomof the waterfall which meant we had very few stairs to climb to get some amazing pictures. The entrance fee was extremely cheap at 5000 rupiah per person. The waterfall",
          "As with most places in Bali, you have to allow plenty of time to get there, and Gitgit isn't any different. Thankfully most of the drivers you take will have suggested places to stop along the way to break up the journey. Gitgit is one of the better waterfalls in Bali and a",
          "We paid for the local guide, it was totally worth it, he told us about the fauna and the area, he spoke great English and it was really interesting.",
          "This waterfall is so high! When we arrived, it was raining. We were on a tight schedule so we just played in the waterfall in the rain. The water was cooold! Standing under the fall is quite painful especially to the pinna of your ears. Excellent place for some photo-shooting.",
          "Not a bad waterfall but not what I was expecting. The pool area was cool. Beyond that the area was so so. Maybe I didn't go down far enough to the other entrance but I did not see the multitier that I was expecting. Maybe next time I will venture more with more time.",
          "Who doesn\u2019t like waterfalls? Water spilling over rocks from anything more than a few feet seems to enchant just about everyone. Waterfalls have long been synonymous with romance. From time to time, people have spent a great amount of time trying to capture the romantic essence",
          "We were so lucky that our driver never had been at this waterfall. So he took the \"wrong\" entrance to the waterfall. There were no turists but a great walk from the bottum up to the waterfall.",
          "Was a nice waterfall.. Nothing too exciting though. On the way down are loads of stalls with touristy crap.. The first ones are much more expensive and will push you to buy something NOW because they know the further down you go the cheaper it gets. They'll offer you the same",

          "There is more than one waterfall in this area, but we only saw the largest and most accessible one. It was beautiful and serene and cool. The walk was easy and paved the whole 6 or 7 hundred yards down. The only drawback was the angry guide who bristled when we rejected his",

          "The waterfall is a short 300 m hike away; and the hike is full of vendors selling stuff. We were mislead into getting a guide - who did nothing and we paid him 100,000. Felt a bit stupid. The waterfall is strong and cool. we enjoyed it.",

          "My husband and I stopped at the waterfalls in the way to the airport. It had just started to rain so there were only a couple of people at the falls. When you first park, a guide says he can show you around for $15/person. You don't need a guide. There is a small entrance fee",
          "The falls are spectacular, you can even bathe in some of the pools. At the park entrance, however, there are some guys who you will never know whether they work for the park or whether they are self-appointed. You have to bargain with them. At least 50% off the price.",
          "there are 2 waterfalls nearby, this one is actually more tourists visiting, I prefer the other one which has multilevel waterfalls but lack of maintenance in the area.",
          "When reading about these falls, we'd expect at least a small roaring monster - we found a nice twin waterfall hidden among the rocks. Nice, but not jaw-dropping ;-) Worth to see though if you are a fan of waterfalls, as it's not a long walk to see it. By the way, there are 2",

          "The trek was relatively empty when we went at around 8.30am. It was a peaceful short trek to the waterfall as it was too early for the shops to open. Do beware of stray dogs though. Proper shoes are recommended for this short trek as slippers might get uncomfortable.",
          "Park just off the road and make your way slowly down into the valley. Guides are available should you wish to take for deeper info. Entrance fee should be IDR10k but often try to change higher. Worth the walk.the cool waters are spectacular so make sure u have your camera.",
          "This place is beautiful. The waterfalls are so pretty and there is no other way to describe it but perfection. There's a little bit of a walk to get down to the waterfalls so take plenty of water. The walk is well worth it though and it is stunning once you get to the",
          "Requires a long, narrow trek towards the waterfalls, but totally worth it! The water is cool and refreshing. If you are brave and daring, you can try one of the high swings! Very exhilarating!",
          "It reminds me of Multnomah Falls in the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon. Made me homesick for a minute. Nice, easy walk to the Falls. Beautiful forest enroute. Felt great to get out of the vehicle and walk in nature to breathe deep the fresh air.",
          "In area north of Ubud (North/Central Bali, we visited both Munduk Falls and GitGit Falls. We really loved GitGit. Nice excercise and walk. Don;t forget to see the equallt beautiful upper falls too. A guide is not needed.",
          "It is pretty enough, and very easy to walk to. I say if you are in the area do it, but I wouldn't make a special long trip for it. Also there are a LOT of shops on the walk to the falls, so expect a lot of people asking you to buy things.",
          "The main reason Gitgit is so popular is simple: it is easily accessible. It means that it is close to the road and doesn't require lengthy climbing to get to the actual waterfalls. It is picturesque but, as a result of its popularity, very crowded. Realistically, you'll spend",
          "Me and my boyfriend visited a number of waterfalls while in Bali (Tegenungan, Aling-Aling and Sekumpul) with Git Git being our last stop. It was lovely, but compared to the others it was disappointing. This is the most popular tourist attraction and we put this simply down to",
          "We visited here yesterday as part of our day trip to nearby places. It was towards the end of the day, hardly any tourists and beautiful light. It really is a gorgeous place, both waterfall and surrounding ferns and foliage. It's about 500m to walk and lots of steps but truly",
          "U need to walk a good distance from main Road to reach this beautiful multi waterfall. There is clove field and many unique wild flowers on the way. Water is crystal clear and cold. Taking bath under this waterfall was memorable experience.",

          "Was amazed by the beauty of this natural waterfall... Must visit!!! Be aware there is alot of stairs going down and back up haha",
          "We take shower in this waterfall is very nice. We take tour for full days, Tamana Ayun - Bedugul - Gitgit Waterfall ( the best one place ) and Jatiluwih. Get a lot experience.",
          "The path is quite easy, not too demanding. The views on the way down are nice, but the real view it's the waterfall itself. You can refresh yourself under it, it's a bit cold and slippery, but if I could make it with one arm in a sling, so can most people.",
          "We rent a car to discover bali on our own and gitgit was one of the things we wanted to see. We stopped at the parking lot for gitgit (the first when coming down from the north) and a guide appeared and explained that their organisation is the only one showing tourists the way",

          "Short 15 minutes walk to reach Gitgit Waterfall. There's a need to pay an entrance fee before you are allowed to venture down the forested path to see the waterfall. Waterfall looks just like what is shown in the pictures. Place is very chilly and the steps are slippery.",
          "Avoid the guides that will charge you just for walking around with you, you don't need them. Save your money. Lots of kids on the way begging you to buy bracelets etc. The waterfalls are ok but not amazing. Better ones to be found elsewhere on the island.",
          "Nice waterfall, but nothing in compare with Sekumpul. Strongly recommended to visit before 9-10 am when crowds of tourists are coming.",
          "The waterfalls are nice but they are not particularly beautiful or dramatic. Apart from this fact, there were a few things which left me wishing I hadn't made the effort. When we arrived, we were politely accosted by a guide who led us down the track towards the falls. By time",
          "Visit this place with my family. . The place must visit if you go to buleleng.. natural water fall with very warm people se round that area.",
          "Visited the falls today (only the first one). Also we got ripped off by the so called \"guide\". 200.000 rp. Per person! For 1 fall. Because we drove more than 2 hours for it we decided to do it anyway, but we already knew we where paying way too much. We did have a nice swim",
          "We visited one part of the waterfall on a day trip all around the island, en route to the hot springs. Small trek to the waterfall and I've seen more impressive falls. Not worth the visit for me",
          "Nice location, where you can come rather near the waterfall. It is a good place to take some nice pictures.",
          "Walk is not very far, a few stairs but nothing too over the top. I am fairly fit but I can't imagine it would be overly difficult for those who aren't. Entrance fee was 3000 rupiah. Water was cool but not freezing. Water is not very deep.",
          "Amazing waterfalls to look at and swim in. A bit of a drive away but very worth it (2 hours from Seminyak). There is a paved trail to get to the waterfalls so be prepared to walk a little. Not too busy, had the whole swimming area to ourselves when we were here.",
          "Having read mixed reviews we still wished to visit and were pleased we made the effort. 3 adults entry including a very pleasant well spoken and knowledgeable guide (Maddi) cost RP 300,000. As far as we were concerned excellent value. There were plenty of photo opportunities",
          "While you really do not need a guide, we used one for around $10. It is supposed to help the community. It was worthwhile to get an insight to the flora and fauna on the way. The falls themselves were like many you see in the various parts of the world. The scenery was",
          "Visited today. 5,000 Rh entrance fee. 10/15 minute tiring walk down to the waterfall. Impressive waterfall, very cold water. Lovely picture opportunities. Not sure where the other waterfall pictured is, we only saw the one but still worth a visit as part of a day trip we",
          "The weather was breathing, so we stayed till sunset there. It takes around 10 minutes down and the same for going back up again. If you have no experience with waterfalls, definitely you will love it",

          "Whilst driving up to Lovina our driver for the day stopped off at the waterfalls. There are three waterfalls 2 close together and about a 40 min round trip the 3rd is further away so all three would take approx 1.5 hours. The entrance fees for attractions vary so much in Bali",

          "The place is beautiful and the water is clean and clear. But the entrance fee is a little bit too expensive. There's no banner to indicate how much you need to pay. I saw people negotiate the price. The local people cheat the tourists money. Therefore the best way is to ask",
          "Only few tourists but many shops along the paved road leading to waterfalls. Park on the left side (if coming from the north), this stop will take about 1/2 hour. Do not to pay anything except 5k entry and volunteer parking fee. Enjoy!",
          "Nice waterfall for a short visit. Entrance fee; 5000 IDR (0.30 Euro/0.35 USD) per adult. At 9:00am we were the first visitors of the day, so had the place to ourselves for a few minutes. The shop stalls were just opening. Probably in the middle of the day it will be over crowded",

          "it was quite a good walk. takes more time than the internet actually tells us. it was good fun since we were quite a few of us.",
          "A beautiful nature walk on a ridge that allows you to admire the view and the few rice fields. It is best to go early to enjoy the peace. A great way to start the day! To have quit look of the walk, we did an amazing video on YouTube Watch it on our channel: Better2Boutside",
          "We did this walk early in the morning! I would say the best time because it\u2019s the coolest and the sun coming over the ridge was spectacular. If you keep walking far enough there are some homes with small businesses. And if you keep walking farther there are some open rice fields",
          "Although the trailhead is pretty tricky to find, it was a good, short hike. Plan on doing this either in the early morning or late afternoon because once you are on the ridge, there is little to no shade. To get up on the ridge, it is a short, climb (some might say",
          "This an interesting walk as there is a great variety in the scenery along the way. However, although we consider ourselves good walkers, we started out at 10am on a very humid (normal Ubud) day but even wearing hats on the open pathway, we suffered quite badly from the heat.",

          "Perfect nature and good walking area, but there nothing special, or incredible. Just pure nature, which you can find all around Bali.",
          "We didn\u2019t see what all the hype was about.. thankfully this is free, because we would have felt duped if we had to pay. The view was less than amazing and there were a bunch of shops along the roadside close to the end. Nothing special, wouldn\u2019t recommend.",
          "Not that good actually. Foliage is so long along the edge of the path that you cant even see the view. Wouldnt recommend",

          "You will need to go early in the morning, or late in the afternoon and regardless of when you go it will be HOT! Bring water, wear a hat and comfy shoes and you will be rewarded with a fabulous view of Ubud from a very different perspective. The views from the ridge make you",

          "I was keen to do lots of walking in Ubud and was very happy to discover the ridge walk. Beware at the start of drivers telling you the roads are very busy and they\u2019ll drive you to the top so you can walk down! It\u2019s a beautiful walk and at the top you can continue as far as you",
          "Giving none proper parks for walk in Ubud, this is a nice walking route to have some air and some distance to enjoy",
          "This ridge walk gives you a wonderful insight into local life in Ubud. I am not a huge hiker so wasn't really excited about it initially but once I got on the trail, it was captivating. There are luxury elements along the way, third world experiences and all kinds of little",
          "Nice walk with pleasant views of jungley terrain. Would recommend going early in the day or towards the evening to stay out of the mid day heat. Would also recommend bringing water and wearing shoes (or at least sandals that are secured on your feet). Would not recommend",
          "A pleasant enough walk through Ubud but not to be taken in the heat of the day. Seems like stating the obvious but there you go..",

          "A great experience. This roughly 10km long walk offers stunning views and is a must visit when in Ubud. After about 6km you hit a small village where you can refresh and buy water. I recommend to go around 5pm, cause you will then reach by 5:30pm a plateau for sunsets which are",
          "This is a short hike up with a beautiful view of the sunset. It is a nice walk if you want to go out and get some fresh air, but the scenery is a bit boring during daytime. The suset, however, was amazing. You have a full view all around you and to watch the sky change colors",
          "The ridge is a bit more than I can cope with in the humidity but it is wonderful to see so many people walking or riding their bicycles along the path.",
          "If you want to escape the bussy buzzling of the town. You will find here a nice green scenery. Up Hill is quote tough (starting from the Southampton) if you walk in the middle of the day \ud83d\ude43) Back down is easier. I had a nice Indonesian meal at the small hill top restaurant.",
          "hill with a very beautiful view, can be enjoyed at sunrise and sunset. You must be here when you're at ubud, bali",
          "Great way to get some exercise on vacation. The trail was far more surrounded by commercial outlets than we expected, but we were glad for the ample options to stop for refreshments. Once you get up past all the initial cafes and galleries, you\u2019ll get to see some actual rice",
          "Go early in the morning or the afternoon. Take water and good shoes. Check out also the surroundings of the path.",
          "I enjoyed every bit of it. Free of charge. Nice views. Swarms of tropical insects and sounds of nature around. Please pay attention there's no shadow, so get prepared.",
          "Dont get your hopes built up too much....it is a nice walk with nice views and one to do if you are staying in Ubud but it is over before you know it...good thing is there are place at the top to get a drink etc.... Go early to avoid the heat.",
          "We went up the walk at 3 when it had clouded over a bit. don\u2019t do it in the heat of the day as it could be unpleasant. Walk on a bit after the first 10 or so cafes at the top just before it turns into proper road you get to a couple of cafes set back in the rice paddies with",
          "Go super early am (before 9 am) or after 5 PM as it gets super hot and would be more difficult to do.",
          "It is an easy walk just for 1-2hrs. Mostly free of any shops and people trying to sell you things, so you can just walk and admire nature. View is nice but not spectacular. Come in the morning, before all of the tourists.",
          "A lovely little walk across hills and through rice fields . At the end you pass through a little village . Make sure to stop off for a delicious juice or beer at the Healthyshop cafe . Meet the chatty and beautiful Wayan kormi for some local knowledge and a good ole chin wag .",
          "Kajeng is a better walk. This one is easier because path is wide and well defined. But there's less local life going on and too many cafe and spa. Nice enough. 2-3km",
          "Nice walk, I expected more rice terraces, I recommend the Karma Kafe halfway along the track, good prices and no service charge or government tax.",
          "The walk is very relaxing and good for family activities. The pavement is gentle and the view is fantastic. The walk along the paddy field after the ridge is also amazing. For athletic people, this will be more a breezy walk",
          "Beautiful walk and stunning views all the way along. I would say a fairly easy walk that most should be comfortable with. It can get rather busy during the day. I\u2019d recommend going early morning.",
          "It\u2019s a nice walk. Some good views. Free. But if you\u2019re short on time you wouldn\u2019t be missing much here.",
          "This is just a fantastic hiking path which starts from the Ubud central and is just 1.8km long. At the end, there are a couple of small restaurants with very low prices. There's quite a lot of climbing when you are taking this path from south to north, but returning is way more",
          "Nice walking path with good view, very hot at mid day, some local caf\u00e9 and restaurant along the way. Good to take a walk at early morning or late afternoon",
          "Beautiful views, huge rice fields and green hills- a incredibly easy walk. Almost too easy for me, but perfect if you have a lot if others things on schedule. Also some restaurants at the north end of the walk.",
          "This walk is actually very steep at points and requires a lot of energy. There's also not much shade so it's blazing hot unless you go very early or late. I preferred some of the other rice walks in Ubud to this one.",
          "One of the few free activities around Ubud. Recommended visit. We couldn't do the full length due to time constraints but it looked very safe and with good views of the natural spaces around Ubud.",
          "Beautiful walk, can be easily done with kids. Great views ! We did it with 4 and 6 yo kids and 1yo (he was carried in a baby carrier most of the walk). We caught a heavy rain and it was a bit slippery, so be aware of that. Highly recommended!",
          "If you have never seen the Balinese countryside it is a good sample of what exists outside rural areas. It can be tiring and great if you can get a lift back to Ubud at the end of the hike.",
          "Go early morning or late afternoon as it gets hot and humid. Lots of places to stop for coffee or snacks. Lovely little village to visit",
          "The view is just breathtaking. Very beautiful. I need to see more place like this to soothe my eyes from the hectic city life.",
          "Relatively easy walk for those used to walking. Very exposed with little shelter so be prepared! A short detour to Bamboo Kitchen was worth the effort too.",
          "Nice walk between the valleys with great scenery. A must do but most likely you will sweat a lot. The walk start from the main street until you reach the rice fields and at the end you can find cafes, Warung (local restaurants) and Karsa Spa if you want to treat yourself with a",
          "A little hard to find the start but a good walk once you do, some gorgeous views along the way, no real fitness needed but uneven surfaces so need to be aware.. we went at 6am and there were already many people. It would be very hot any later on the day as it\u2019s quite exposed.",
          "Beautiful walk with jungle views. Get comfortable shoes and enjoy for 30 minutes. Just outside the main town",
          "When staying in Ubud for a while. I enjoyed to visit many local interest place. I love jogging and the view was so very cool and great. Some people do jogging and photography, i love it. Higly recommended for your list \ud83d\ude18",
          "Its a nice route for running in Ubud if you\u2019re into that, but go early morning or for sunset, it gets really hot and busy. A lot of insta shoots going on. Check it out if you\u2019re close but don\u2019t go out of your way to get there.",
          "Do it it's free and good for you nice on the ridge starts a bit steep but becomes easier and there's a bar on the right side at the top which sells cheap Bintang",
          "This walk requires a moderate level of fitness, takes you through nice views of rice fields and is easy to get to from Ubud centre. Considering how close it is the to the centre, the peacefulness of the area is amazing. There is a great restaurant at the end called Karsa Kafe.",
          "We walked the ridge in the morning but it was still really hot - You can buy water on the way. It's pretty easy to walk and you can easily do it in flip flops. Very lush and serene walk.",
          "Nothing special. Too many buildings around, no nature any more. The Karsa Cafe and its view slightly compensated our effort but we found this attraction not worth spending time on",
          "Our group did this walk based on the other reviews and it was enjoyable. We didn\u2019t take the advice to do it early in the day, so it was hot, but so is Bali! No rubbish like others have said and available bins. A nice way to spend an hour doing something a little different.",
          "I\u2019ve done this walk many times now & always find it a great walk. Wonderful scenery with lots of sights along the way. The walk is evolving every time I come with many little warungs, stalls & swings popping up along the walk. I look forward to enjoying a nice cold Bintang at",
          "Beautiful easy walk for the whole family. Amazing views with interesting little cafes on the route. Make time for this free unbelievable activity.",
          "Due to many ups and downs, I found the walk both ways to be more challenging than I had expected but the scenery was pretty and it was good exercise. Don\u2019t pay to take a tour. Once you\u2019re on the path, it\u2019s easy to follow and there is always someone else nearby if you need",
          "OK place to hike in the centre. Go in the morning or before sunset. If you staying for sunset do bring torch light as the Ridge has no lighting. After sunset there is loads of flying insect which can be irritating. Can get good view of the sunset though.",
          "Stunning view with greeny valley. Catch this place in early morning and absolutely fresh air. I will visit it again in the near future.",
          "Don\u2019t miss this walk. It\u2019s quite easy, can be managed by young kids too. We were caught by rain on the way down and decided to wait at the small cafe along the walk. Great food and view!",
          "Don't expect any serious trekking here. It's just a nice little walk up the hill. There's some pretty nice views of the valley, villages and paddy fields. Some of the cafes on top of the hills are quite cool. Nice place to chill for sunset. Go when it's cool.",
          "If you can do steps, this is a beautiful, tranquil walk with magnificent scenery. Best done early morning to escape the heat and there are fewer people to navigate around. There would only be a hundred steps at the beginning and then a steep slope for a little way before softly",
          "Nice walk, close to ubud. Bit unclear where it ends but we went for about 2km until we hit some proper roads and then turned back. Take some water and head out before it gets too hot and too crowded with people facetiming their friends at full volume.",
          "Went up on the Campuhan Ridge twice - once on a cloudy afternoon and again on a sunny morning in Dec. Came back with sunburnt after the morning trek. Did it a second time as I had an appointment at Karsa Spa. The trek itself was average. There is an entry sign followed by a",
          "Don't contemplate, just go. If you love nature you will love this walk. Kids and elderly were on the path but I suggest one have basic physical fitness, easy to get winded for someone who isn't used to physically activity. I went at sun down, it was great",
          "It was an extremely humid morning but the sites were brilliant. Close to the top of ubud but don\u2019t get the rice walks confused...this is a longer walk!! Amazing to see the rice farmers in action up close. Make sure you take some water. Highly recommend it",
          "This is a lovely little walk that takes you to the far end of Ubud to start and ends with some lovely little bars and cafes. We had a nice cold drink sitting overlooking fields.",
          "I have walked the Campuan ridge walk a number of times. it offers a great scenic view, quite hill so sweaty on a warm afternoon. best advice is to go early morning, and take water. There are a number of places to sop along the way",
          "Best to come here for sunsets! I'd recommend walking in running shoes for convenience, but flip flops are also ok. It's a beautiful spot to spend a slow evening at, there's a swing too! And a cafe where you can buy some food and refreshing coconut water :)",
          "Citizens must become a bit more aware of the plastic toxicity of ubis area. Come on. Wake up. Rubbish in streams, rivers will go to the sea. Wildlife will die. Thank you",
          "We spent a good hour on this walk, passing a temple at the beginning before climbing an incline up to the ridge, definitely worth the initial effort. A few places to get some food before the walk and up on the ridge itself. The trail is clearly signposted and follows a paved",
          "Very pleasant walk which starts in the middle of Ubud. Lovely views, walk is gentle and doesn\u2019t take very long (half an hour one way). Best to go early as it does get very hot! We didn\u2019t stop at any of the cafes but there are plenty along the way if you need a break.",
          "Good if you don't get too much out of Ubud but not impressive if you di wonder near munduk or other places...",
          "This is a great walk with unbelievable views of the jungle! Definitely a must. Also you can combine this walk with a visit to the Karsa spa which is very beautiful and affordable (you need to book in advance)",
          "We have done this a couple of times and would recommend an early start to see the sun rise and beat the heat. A reasonable easy walk about 2 km to the village starting from Ubud main street, about 20 min one way. Valley views on both sides of the path.",
          "This is a wonderful walk up to the ridge, accessed from the main road in central Ubud. It is not a long walk, but views are lovely across the lush canyons of the river courses. Go early as it is fully exposed to the sun; take water. At the top there are some neat art",
          "If you\u2019re an early riser and want to enjoy some views, highly recommend doing this walk. Gets a bit hot after sunrise so the earlier you go the better it is. Probably not a bad spot for sunset either.",
          "And too short. Overhyped as most things are around here. Its a nice stroll if ur bored but if ur short on Time, dont waste it.",
          "I did this walk during my last Bali trip 5 yrs ago and I did the walk twice during this trip! the walk is nicely paved with concrete slabs and the best time to start is anytime from 4.30-5.15pm to avoid the afternoon heat and enjoy the sunset. If you start from the north, do",
          "Its beautiful walk next to rice field and forest. Best before sunrise for rhe most beautiful views! We took the 2 km walk which was just perfect for us",
          "Sun exposed ridge walk with couple of warung at beginning & end. Views to homes perched on the hillside & tropical scenery.",
          "Stumbled upon this gentle stroll when we first got to Ubud. Unfortunately it was at 11 am so it was just starting to get pretty miserable. The view on both sides is really scenic. Just be prepared to bring some water or better yet, aim to do this at sunset.",
          "Beautiful scenery, very accessible close to downtown ubud, and free. Mid day it is very hot without much tree cover so either avoid mid day or be prepared.",
          "We went early morning which is the best time. It was hot but manageable. Quite an easy walk and well worth doing.",
          "We walked in the late afternoon. If not fast walkers, plan for 2 1/2 hrs at least. We did not start early enough to get up to the restaurant to overlook the rice fields. The views of the rainforest made a nice change from busy Ubud. The first 300 metres going down, across and",
          "Come just before the sunset and enjoy one of the loveliest walk in Ubud. Still, can get rather touristy.",
          "I stayed at Amora Ubud hotel at the top of this hill so I walked down this path which I thoroughly enjoyed! We walked down this hill and then into Ubud- loved it! If you are walking up the ridgewalk trail, once you reach the top you can enter Amora hotel for an entrance fee to",
          "This walk took us 1_2hrs. Go early ! Before it's too hot and crowded. Lots of beautiful views and free. Bring water. Recommend :)",
          "We woke up at 0500 as we were still jet lagged so took the opportunity to head to the ridge walk. Once you get to Ibah Hotel, there are signs to lead you to the walk. It probably took us just under an hour to walk along the ridge and back. It was quiet early in the morning and",
          "The most interesting part of this walk is at the start, as you walk past one of the most photogenic temples of Bali. After that the walk is a long trek along a straight metalled footpath, which steadily climbs up. There is little shade, so precautions against sunburn and",
          "Fab morning activity, views are stunning. Very warm and humid but there are few lovely warungs for a lovely soft drink or food",
          "The walk is quite short and not as picturesque as some photos would suggest. It was quite busy even at 6:30am. There is quite a bit of rubbish laying around (as there is just about everywhere) Would not rush to do it again!",
          "Yup, you heard it. Nothing to see. Our hotel owner tried to tell us the day before but we didn\u2019t listen to her! If you just feel like an early morning stroll, at 7 am before it gets too hot and you risk heat stroke, then go or it with zero expectations. On the first part all you",
          "The hike started at the temple and finished with cafes and street vendors. We expected to see rice fields galore etc. so a bit disappointed. Scenery is beautiful. It\u2019s fully exposed to the sun so take water and protective covering.",
          "Took us roughly 25 mins at a leisurely pace to near the top where there's some half decent bars and places to eat. I'd recommend going up near sunset and relaxing at a bar for this. It was quite relaxing and beautiful.",
          "Can be a little tricky to find, but has some great views and there are some great cafes just after what seems to be the end (e.g. after the shops) with really good sunset views over rice paddies (and beanbag seats of you opt for them).",
          "My wife and I completed this trip on a recent trip to Bali and here are a few of my thoughts and tips. * The walk begins on the western part of Jl Raya Ubud. You walk west from ubud palace until you get to Ibah Luxury Villas. Go up the driveway and you should see a small sign",
          "Was the question we heard twice. As we walked the whole thing we can say: no. Hot, nothing to see or do and just a short but exhausting walk where you will meet a number of people who tried to find a hike close to Ubud.",
          "We walked this from the northern end , back into Ubud, so it was mostly downhill and its a really lovely way to explore the connecting villages.",
          "We visit Campuham ridge walk during we stay in Ubud. The view amazing. We recommended to do in the morning or late afternoon.",
          "The Campuhan Ridge Walk is definitely a beautiful walk that is filled with greenery and hills. More of a jungle or forest walk. This beautiful paved walk along the Campuhan Ridge showcases the natural side to Ubud. There are rice field further along near Karsa Kafe. I suggest",
          "It's better to do the paddy rice walk that starts on the right of museum lukisan. At desa visesa you can cross the river and return by passing the sunset caffe and lots of other cosy things. Campuan ridge is a bit boring & you have to return the same way.",
          "This is an interesting walk with lots of ups and downs. It starts quite steep and then levels out. There are villages along the way and lots of construction of new houses/hotel type buildings. In some parts there are motor bikes coming and going which took away from the",
          "a taxi driver told us about this walk, we decided to do it and were not disappointed,,amazing scenery, is steep in parts, but well worth it, lots of cafes, bars so you can stop and have a rest if you want. we were going to do it again, our last trp, October, but ran out of time",
          "Campuhan ridge walk is located in the heart of Ubud, a short stroll away from the main streets. Best enjoyed early in the morning whilst the temperature is cooler, and fewer people are around.",
          "It's a nice walk, with some good views. However, it's a bit too built for most of the walk and better options with more pristine views are available",
          "It was a nice walk to start the day with. It was already starting to get pretty hot during the walk back, so definitely go early as others say! There's not much shade. All in all, it was a nice little trek with some good views and pretty scenery. I didn't buy anything along",
          "Get up early and enjoy the views. Good snacks and drinks can be had along the route. The local merchants selling their crafts are cheaper than in town. Disappointing to see so much litter along the route.",
          "Do this walk early in the day as very few trees to shelter under along the walkway! Also, start the walk from the village end and not the Ubud main road villas, as then you will be walking mainly downhill - except at the end of the walk.",
          "We thought this was going to be really cool but it wasn't. We went early evening for sunset but there was heaps of people and it's now so built out, all the views of the beautiful rice terraces are gone. Just becoming another tourist trap with hotels and cafes instead of being",
          "The ridge walk is a 2km walk with beautiful surrounding view! Not too hard to walk and completely free",
          "First part quite a climb and nothing to see. Then some Ricefields. There are areas mutch more nice to take a walk",
          "This is a very short walk, and the views are not that great. Halfway through it becomes businesses, and you no longer have jungle views. It was just okay - but we had higher expectations based on reviews we read.",
          "Great scenery even though it wasn\u2019t wet season. Easy walk with a few up hill sections and easy to add an extra few km\u2019s if you want.",
          "This is an interesting walk, but nothing more really. Maybe we had too high of expectations, but we had been walking for a long time and began to wonder what it was we were supposed to be seeing. There are some decent views and valleys in the beginning stretch, and some ok",
          "a short walk that has amazing views. if you forget to take some water don't work there are some \"shops\" along the way to purchase. as well as some swings to take pictures on.",
          "We were advised to go on this walk when staying in Ubud. We started this walk around 10 in the morning and was quite surprised how busy the walk was absolutely crowded with people we preferred the magical rice field walk over the Campion Ridge as it was better scenery and not",
          "Go early morning as it gets hot! Beautiful scenic walk relatively easy as we did with two younger children.( 4 yr old did want carried for a bit) Not suitable with prams/buggies) I saw a few people with babies in baby front packs! I recommend getting a Grab car / taxi to The",
          "Walk is promising at the start, with nice valley views, even though pretty soon becomes peppered with tourist shops full of same mass produced `art ', pretty soon cafes start, some even offering a swim. It's 3 km to Kampa Spa, easy enough, slightly uphill in places, don't need",
          "Tricky to spot the entrance, but a nice walk in the morning or early evening ( Don't delay in the evening as it gets dark and then mosquitos get into play) Tip : Don't just rely on Google maps for this. Look out for Ibah hotel and then look for the sign board ( I've uploaded a",
          "Nice and quiet place which is not far from the city. You have to walk up a hill at the beginning, after that it's just an easy walk.",
          "we walk only ca 3km but it was very nice ! We came back by taxi. There are restaurants and caf\u00e9s midden in the rice fields!Don't forget sun protection and water !",
          "What a pleasant morning walk. You feel so close to nature. It leads you to nice country walk looking at rice fields. It was just beautiful.",
          "If your looking for a good hike around ubud . It's got some nice views but nothing spectacular. But a good pass time in ubud",
          "Wonderful views, we went in the morning early and the mists from the river and overnight drizzle were still present. We found our way easily from Sama's Cottages and lots of little warungs to eat and drink at on the way",
          "We headed out relatively early, having read that the walk was beautiful and relatively quiet. Enjoyed the walk but quite popular even early. Stopped at the Karsa Cafe, beautiful views over the rice paddies and up to the mountains (we had a clear morning and the view was",
          "This is a great way to see some of the local scenery without having to go too far from Ubud. You get some great views along the ridge but start early as it gets hot and very busy and there's no shade. We took a taxi from the top and walked back into Ubud which worked well and it",
          "This is the place to walk up to at the first blush of dawn. It is cool and there is plenty of due on the lush foliage. The sight of the sun lighting up Agung Volcano to the east is absolutely breathtaking. I could do this every morning and never get tired of it.",
          "early morning sunrise hike was fantastic. Nice, fresh & crisp the higher you got. Fantastic opportunities for great pictures and scenery. Well worth the effort.",
          "My husband and I walked the entire ridge one morning. Everywhere we looked was breathtaking. We started in the town a little outside of Ubud center and enjoyed a calm walk through small local shops and rice fields. The ridge itself had incredible views of both nature and",
          "Would highly recommend doing this walk at the start of the day and not in the midday heat. The initial climb up is quite strenuous. Once the walk levels out it reveals very pretty scenery along a well maintained pathway. Lots of Warungs along the way to get a cool drink or even",
          "This is not an arduous walk but we started from the temple - the Ubud end of the walk and it was late morning so got quite hot. At the top of the ridge is a village with some warung which was just as well as it was thirsty work going up hill. We continued round to Neka Art",
          "Initially the beginning of the walk is quite steep and uneven in areas but it eventually evens out to a comfortable walking trail. The first couple of kilometres are probably the best in terms of views and scenery, after that it becomes a little commercial in terms of warung and",
          "For me, it was underwhelming. Nothing really stood out. And it was HOT. Probably good for very early morning hikes, but I would not attempt it after 9 or 10.",
          "If you are looking for a break from the busyness of Ubud, this could do the job. Some reviewers said the photos looked better than the real thing. I will agree with that. There's definitely no ooh's and ah's here. The typical picture you see with the greens on both side is",
          "I recently visited Bali it\u2019s friends and we went to the Ridge Walk. It is a great way to stretch out your legs and get some exercise. Some good places to get some great pictures. Recommend sturdy walking shoes although you can do the trip in Jandals. A sun hat is also a",
          "We were prepared for a 2 hours walk, instead of that we finish the whole walk less than an hour. It was a bit disapointing, lot of trash.",
          "I used the walk as running track in the early mornings. It\u2019s a good spot to watch the sunrise and it isn\u2019t getting too busy. The walk itself is short and easy (2km up and downhill) so you don\u2019t need to be a professional and trained hiker with hiking equipment. Make sure to take",
          "We did this walk one morning and although it was pleasant, I definitely didn't think it was anything to rave about. If you are just wanting a bit of exercise, then great, its off the road and its a nice pathway with pleasant enough views. If you don't do it, you haven't really",
          "You need to be a walker or hiker, meaning you\u2019re fine with the distance and height! There are some bigger trees that throw some shade but the majority of the walk is completely out in the sun so you should prepare for that. While you\u2019re walking there is no possibility to get",
          "We are sorry it has taken so long for us to do this walk it was really showcasing Bali away from the hustle and bustle and a place we would like to stay at, we loved our walk there stopped and had a foot massage and there were fabulous little warnings and coffee shops along the",
          "It\u2019s ok. Definitely beautiful green during raining season, not so much during summer. Don\u2019t expect too much, it\u2019s a nice little walk. By the way don\u2019t wear slippers, I would go for normal shoes",
          "I recommend this Walk if you want to get away from the noise and the traffic from Ubud. It\u2019s an easy tour, there are some terraces on the way where you can enjoy some young coconut or evwn have lunch. And the views are great!",
          "This is a ridge just south of the town of Ubud. The pathway itself is about 2klms long but you can make it longer at the southern end as you are in the countryside. It is an easy walk. Beautiful views of rice fields and villages on the way. Perfect for an early morning run.",
          "Nice walk. Easy to find entrance. Easy to gentle walk. Although if you are not fit there is an uphill portion near the start. Lovely views and you soon come across some very scenic spots to have a massage or a drink. Would recommend walking to the furthest spa and having",
          "Nice activity to be out of the noise and traffic of Ubud. Not easy to find the entrance. The hike wasn\u2019t too strenuous but ended at a street with shops, hotels and restaurants.",
          "We came early to see the sun rise, but missed it due to clouds. A nice walk, but a real shame with all the litter, both in the holy river and along the paths up to the rice terrace - people really have no respect... A good 3-4hours spend walking and picture taking, a few snack",
          "Good for morning walk before you start your day in ubud. There is also a mini swing which cost 75k per pax. Didn't walk all the way in as the scenery is kind of repetitive.",
          "have done this walk many times and rarely see any tourists the path is firm to walk on and you feel in the middle of nowhere away from the noise of ubud best way to find it is to go to the bridge hotel and make you way to the temple just follow the steps you cant miss it",
          "It was very pretty. I went early. Still a lot of people. Lots of garbage along the way. Beautiful views. Nice exercise.",
          "take a walk through beautiful Bali country..take some water..a few uphill stairs but not real extreme...worth the effort",
          "Nice place to go get some fresh air and exercise. Close to central Ubud but a world away. Needed to get this openness and fresh air.",
          "We started the walk by Warwick IBAH villas - go early in the morning or late afternoon as it's very hot and not much shade available. The path is very clearly marked and easy to navigate, I opted for trainers but it would be managable in flip flops at a push. Due to the",
          "A nice spot to trek, take a morning walk or just looking for a good picture. Located near Warwick Ibah Resort, you just need to park your vehicle near this resort and take 10 minutes walk by the temple before you can actually arrive at this place. There are some warung",
          "I\u2019d recommend to do this walk in the evening time otherwise you\u2019ll suffer the heat! Check on google how to get to the walk because there\u2019s no big sign or anything.",
          "Family of 4. 2 girls ages 7 and 11. We picked up the trail at the bottom as our hotel was just a few minute walk from the startiing point and did the walk round trip. Nice little with the family offering differing vistas from jungle to rice paddies (with flocks of ducks) to",
          "Putu our butler, suggested to ask the driver to drop us at the top of the walk, since then you primarily stroll down hill! At the top is a great painter community with friendly people Of course..if you want to buy something..bargain Our butler went with us as guide which was",

          "Very beautiful surroundings! Bring a camera and go crazy! Just keep in mind the weather. If it is a very hot and sunny day don't do the walk between 11-14.",
          "I thought the trail was going to be a lot longer. It's really not a very long walk from end to end. There is a \"Bali Swing\" near the start, which is fun. It's a nice walk to get out of town and away from the traffic and scooter noise. There is a little cafe and a few other",
          "this is a nice little walk on the edge of ubud. you are totally removed from the hustle of ubud. Go early before the day heats up, Walk out to where the path widens and you start to meet cars",
          "Campuhan is definitely a leisurely walk but it's a beautiful one to see the sights. The views along the way are really something, though you do spend a fair amount of time just walking through small settlements. Kind of hard to know where it ends but really it's just a relaxing",
          "We're called the trail to get to Karsa spa which were booked a month in advance and still struggled to get a convenient time. The walk itself is picturesque and lively with some great restaurants and cafes enroute",
          "Loved this we found it and hiked up the hill , it starts with a major incline but gets better and had the most amazing views , it\u2019s like Bali in one temples , terraces and rainforest with loads of places to get a drink , chill and eat or stay and homes to rent all really cool",
          "Very beautiful view on left & right track, and the fresh air are very relaxing and the track is very easy",
          "This place will satisfy your mind when you are in this place ..... you can enjoy the fresh air with almost no pollution ... it's not wrong if you make this place as one of your travel agenda on the island of Bali ....",
          "A nice place to walk early in the morning or at sunset. So many green on the left and on the right of the ridge. There are some shops if you want a refreshment of a fruit.",
          "I dragged my husband out of bed to come do this trek and it was totally worth it!! The trek is fairly easy, bits of an incline here and there but nothing horrible. It was easy to find as google has it clearly noted and locals are happy to point you in the right direction. It\u2019s",
          "Pictures made the walk look luscious and green. It was very average looking with a lot of it just being dirt. Wouldn\u2019t recommend",
          "This ridge walk is a great option when you have some time to spare. It\u2019s peaceful and quite. You will get some pretty amazing views of rice fields and the surrounding forrest trees. Definitely recommend going early or late afternoon as there isn\u2019t much shade and can get quite",
          "The Campuhan Ridge Walk it\u2019s not so difficult to find, being right on the bridge to Gunung Lebah Temple (common entrance/ small street going down with Warwick Ibah), few meters from Ubud Klinik. The beginning of the walking tour isn\u2019t very nice, but keep going until the rice",
          "Nice walk in the morning. Not amazing. Peaceful though. Definitely go early in the morning to avoid the most heat.",
          "The entrance is hidden away alittle. Enter on the right just before the bridge heading out of town. The start is alittle steep but not to hectic and can easily be done in sandals. It\u2019s probably best done early morning as it gets extremely hot up on the ridge. Lovely view of the",
          "This place is near by were we were stayed in ubud, we went there just for a walk and this place was so beautifull, really fresh and wanderfull view in the morning,.",
          "The start is a little tucked away down a side street so it took us a while to find the walk (right on the first side street as you cine down the hill from central Ubud, if you pass a school you're on the right track!) The walk is pleasant enough, nice views and chance of",
          "It\u2019s s great walk but not signposted well. We had a great meal at a Dicarik warung along the way. Cant post a photo as it\u2019s too large for this site.",
          "It\u2019s a lovely walk around rice fields, with bars, restaurants, a spa and several art shops along the road.",
          "We walked along here at sunset and really enjoyed the walk. There wasn't much of a sunset but the walk was enjoyable. It took around 20 minutes to walk from one end to the other, Its an easy walk and easily doable in sandals.",
          "This is a nice chilled walk. It starts opposite Bridges restaurant. There are nice coffee shops etc along the way.",
          "One of the few areas to go for a exhaust fume free walk. Great views on either side. I prefer to go early morning or late afternoon as there is no shade. Best also with closed toe shoes that allow for stepping on the awkwardly sized steps.",
          "Unlike most walking routes outside of the town areas, this one is the gentlest I have encountered. Hence, it does not require much effort and can be done easily.",
          "We like walking and did the whole 8km ridge and corcuit back via the western edges of ubud and some villages. This is a steep hot and humid walk but well worth it. You can do a muvh shorter up and back along the ridge but if you're of reasonable fitness the whole circuit takes",
          "I set off with no expectation of finishing and managed about half of it. Beautiful scenery and a nice wander.",
          "This activity takes 1 or 2 hours. It is nice to combine with a drink on the top. Also are there a couple of small art shops with beautifull paintings of the area. Start from the bridge in Ubud (on the other side of restaurant Bridges).",
          "It is an easy walk between the rice fields and jungle! We decided, at the end of the walk to spent time in the jungle fish and it was beautiful, you have an infinity pool with a good restaurant! ( don\u2019t forget the bathing clothes;) )",
          "Beat the traffic and get good exercise on an easy walk with good views in safe and friendly surroundings. Ubud urban is crowded and this walk is easy to find and a wee treasure to get out of town. It skirts a ridge with great valley and rice padi views and there are good stops",
          "Beautiful walk with a very scenery view over rice fields and the jungle! It\u2019s an easy walk that can be done with children as well! It\u2019s located near Ubud downtown, but it\u2019s a good place to escape the traffic!! Totally recommend it, especially at sunset!",
          "Took some friends here for their first visit to Bali. Stopped at Karsa Spa and Cafe and then continued to walk the round trip. Probably should have gone back the way we came!",
          "A nice easy paced walk, occasional uphills, but not long. You walk though rice paddies and small villages with artist wares for sale and cafes. A nice way to see Bali away from the traffic on Ubud",
          "It's nice place to stroll at evening and watch a beautiful sunset. It's doesn't far from ubud market but, the place is a little hidden so you must ask local people to know which way to goes there\u2764\ufe0f",
          "This was a nice place to go for jog and get away from the crowded city. There is no entrance fee. If you a lil bit confuse when you get there, i can tell you this: park your vehicle in school field and look for a bridge, beside the brige you\u2019ll see a smaller brige with lil",
          "Decent walk (\"trek\") uphill so was a good way to get some exercise without motorbikes or cars whizzing by. Is quite popular though with plenty of other people doing the walk while I was there. Plenty of little cafes, restaurants and shops at the top",
          "One of the standard walking spots in Ubud but nothing special. I'd recommend going for a walk further north if you get a chance. This place is overcrowded and only a small ridge walk. We were quite disssapointed.",
          "This is a short enough walk but the views are simply incredible and the only noises you here are those of nature and the river flowing in the valley. A beautiful walk to start the day with.",
          "If you are in ubud and have extra time or you like going for a 2km walk then you can't miss this one. It is a bit hilly but you can enjoy great views.",
          "I can\u2019t believe this is my 4th visit to Ubud and I haven\u2019t known about this walk. It\u2019s lovely! Start early to avoid the heat. We took our time to walk the 4kms return. Walking each way took about 30 mins allowing for us to stop and take in the scenery and some pictures. Plenty",
          "Decided to do this trek to watch the sunset. Best decision ever! Even though there are many tourists doing the walk, there's not a lot of confusion or noise, so you can just enjoy the sunset.",
          "Love walk around with dog in this area, beautiful view and peaceful. Sometimes too many tourists do pre wed photos but don\u2019t really bother me to keep walking and do run errands here",
          "We had a great time walking this ridge and a lovely drink at the a newly openly place called The Bamboo Kitchen, only openee 2 weeks ago. Has groovy bright coloured bean bags and umbrellas. Two young brothers havw started thisbup and we were happy to support them rather than",
          "We stayed 3 nights opposite the ridge walk in the rice fields at Juglo Organic which has a wonderful walk all on its own. The ridge walk was a little steep to begin with but levels out. The are some wonderful views and some tasty restaurants along the way. Comfortale closed toe",
          "Good view. But not much we can see. A bit difficult to find parking for a car. But motorbike is easier.",
          "Definitely worth it! Beautiful walk along the ridge, not as long as I was hoping but the views spectacular all along the way. Relatively easy walk too.",
          "Great views. Interesting walk through the jungle and small villages Nice places to stop for drinks Along the way. Karsa is pretty The rice fields are cool",
          "The start of this walk is right in Ubud. It is hard to believe that there is this beautiful rural walk and stunning outlook so close to the chaos of Ubud. Such contrasts. A very easy walk with beautiful views over valleys and rice fields. You can do as much or as little as you",
          "This little path is incredibly beautiful! as you can see very early on morning at sunrise with a little luck ... perfect moment \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Nothing spectacular really. Plus, it was a little difficult to find. But I went for a jog here and all the greenery was a nice little reward. Wouldn't necessarily recommend it as a must-see but if you've got nothing better to do or feel like going for a long, easy walk then this",
          "This is worth the short walk but is only a path up a hill (we do a lot of hiking). The views are lovely and you get to see rice fields and views over the valley. If you are not used to walking, then completing this out of the mid day sun would help, however the are lots of",
          "The place and walk was very nice but I was expecting more of a \"wow-moment\" due to all the great reviews. Its a nice place to get away from the busy streets but it wouldn't be a must see in my book. If you have time definitely go. Bring water as it gets hot in the sun.",
          "We decided to do this walk in the late afternoon when it would be a bit cooler. However you can really do it at anytime, it isn't very long so just take water and enjoy the views! About 3km in are a bunch of cafes and restaurants which have gorgeous views of the valley, so I'd",
          "This is my fourth or fifth time here. Always relaxing to smell the fresh air. This time i walked up instead of jogged up the small ridge, scenic place, easy to walk",
          "You know how busy Ubud can get...motorcycles, scooters, cars, vans, and people walking about....well you can get away from it all on this little trek that leads you above the city and upon a ridge. Very doable for anyone with some semblance of fitness. Go early and you won't",
          "This was an amazing walk from our hotel (lokha) to the ubud center. Would recommend this way as it is more downhill, the other direction might be more of a challange.",
          "Walked the ridge at sunrise with my sisters and mum. We had originally planned to take our small kids (6,3 and 2) but left them with the men due to the early hour. We had read reviews saying it was a suitable walk for kids and had disabled access. This is not true. You enter via",
          "What a great way to get some quiet and space in often crowded and loud journey to ubud! Easy walk with beautiful views and not too many people. Make it a point during your stay and go early for better temperatures and less crowds.",
          "We went early to avoid all the tourists. It was a short but lovely walk. It was definitely nicer as it was quiet. I can\u2019t imagine enjoying the walk if it was full of tourists.",
          "Around 2 km walk through the nature,this is a quiet ,scenic ridge and you will love it.The blue skies and the jungle is worth watching. Not a very difficult trek, at the end you can eat some refreshments. Early morning is very good.",
          "Lovely little walk starting from the centre of Ubud with some nice cafes at the top of the ridge. We enjoyed the walk in the evening before sunset (although it was quite busy contrary to reviews we had read).",
          "Very pleasant walk, lovely views, nice and peaceful, nothing too strenuous ... but do it early morning or late afternoon, anything between will be too hot, and there's very little shade! I'd say it's a good walk, rather than a \"trek\". The path, fully paved throughout it's 2 km",
          "A short walk through nature with nice views on either side. It's convenient how close to the city it is but I wouldn't describe it as incredible or stunning.",
          "For me it was the perfect getaway from the busy city center of Ubud. Personally I'm not a big fan of tye center. Just too much traffic and too many people. I mostly liked the first 1,2 km. After that there are only shops and restaurants but you do see some of the rice fields",
          "Ridge walk above the jungle and river, peaceful but lots of people and not much to see... nearby walk up to Ubud Yoga House would be my favorite in town...",
          "It was a nice morning stroll, a few pretty views. Wasn't a circuit though (unless I missed something which could be the case!) but I couldnt find any option on the map other than turning arpund and coming back... but plenty of places to grab a drink and/or food before doing so.",
          "This is probably one of the most beautiful ways to start your morning! Took a walk to see the sunrise. Absolutely beautiful. Great for joggers as well! You can hear the river water running deep down below. Birds, butterfly\u2019s everywhere. All around beautiful nature walk.",
          "We really enjoyed walking along the Campuhan Ridge from our hotel and into Ubud each day. The walk is fairly short (approximately 2.5km) and entirely paved making it do-able for people of lots of fitness levels (our 2 year old did it!). There are plenty of spots along the walk",
          "Nice walk but choose the right trail. We took the stairs near the bridge and that\u2019s a risky trail. There\u2019s a secure way to get there too. But when you on the right trail the road is not dangerous. On the way you can experience the swing. Nice view!",
          "The Ridge had a nice view overall, getting there wasn't too tough, but do not expect a flat route/trail. I'm 7months into my pregnancy and I felt it was manageable at my own pace, took about a good 45mins-1hr walk to reach Karsa cafe and the spa, we decided to take the buggy",
          "Walking along the ridge provides a nice view of the forest on either side. At the end of the ridge path there are some cafes and then the path continues with views to rural ubud and rice fields The ridge path was quite exposed with large sections with no shade. I would advise",
          "We thought that this was going to be a longer walk than it was, really only turned out to be a short linger along a pathed path. It was peaceful and the view in parts was nice and then you come out on to a road that goes pasts rice paddy fields. Enjoyable for a stretch of your",
          "Go early in the morning and watch the runners, photoshoots, it\u2019s a busy route, but well worth going.",
          "A nature walk of sorts and there were some interesting sights such as lizards and birds. But not really outstanding. The trip wasn't exactly enhanced by my first experience of someone using a drone, and I wouldn't have been upset if it had been dive-bombed by an annoyed bird.",
          "I read about this walk and another one in The Lonely Planet Guide to Bali. This walk was so good that we did it twice!! The first time was tricky to find it and we did the super long circular walk listed in the Lonely Planet, whereas most people turned round at the 'end' and",
          "One of the best place to jogging in the morning with a fresh air, you can catch the sunrise here! And if you want to do a pre-wedding session here, you have to tracking around 1.5-2KM from parking lot to the photo area. Kind of worth it, because there are many spots here!",
          "I went here every time I go to Ubud. It\u2019s really nice track to have an afternoon walk. The path is around 2km, and not steep. I recommend you to come around 3-4 so you get the best view of it! Also, use a bug spray because sometimes there are many mosquito or bugs there.",
          "We caught a taxi to the top of the ridge so walked downhill. We walked past the shops and cafes offering cool drinks at the top. The views of the rice terraces and the temple are best from this perspective - and the trek is easier on a hot day. You end up not far from Zest - a",
          "I accidentally came across this walk and what a lovely surprise it was! The ridgeway is paved, though unevenly so be careful, and wanders through beautiful countryside. I did this in the evening as the sun set and it was beautiful.",
          "We walked from Karsa Spa (the best in Ubud) back into Ubud centre for dinner. It was an easy walk for us as we are young and fit. It was a lovely way to get to dinner",
          "We took this walk during the afternoon and although the views initially were nice and interesting, the rice paddies at the end are the better highlight. After trekking for a while you will want to stop and get some refreshments at one of the cafe\u2019s and consider a taxi back to",
          "The walk can start from Warwick Ibah Hotel. It is about 2 km long. It is easy to walk there in sandals. Nice views along the walk. You end up in some pretty rice fields. Possible to book a taxi from the end point to downtown Ubud for around 100 rh.",
          "This short hike starts at a bridge at the junction of two rivers. You walk down a steep set of steps to a narrow bamboo bridge that gets you to the point of land where the ridge that separates the two gorges meets the junction of the rivers. From there you zig-zag across two",
          "We followed the instructions which some one had posted online and I was expecting a much more level, pram friendly walk of around 2 kilometres to a cafe and back. Well, it's not!!! We walked from our resort to the 'Ibah' sign and then we started down a very driveway to a bridge",
          "I'm not sure what I was expecting but this was just a short and pretty walk in the heart of Ubud. It was a much needed break from the busy streets though there was a family with an annoying drone that was near us for a bit. To the north there are some nice villas and a family",
          "A nice relaxing walk with lovely scenery. Not too strenuous and accessible to most. Worth an hour or so stroll",
          "It was a nice view and a nice walk. But a bit difficult to find. The gps indicated that we arrived but we didn\u2019t see anything. One of the local people helped us to find our way around.",
          "Be sure to stop at the temple below though you must cover your knees to enter. You can walk a long distance - be aware it is hilly and can be tiring. I would avoid this on a really hot or rainy day. There are several cafes along the route and a wonderful rope swing. The ridge is",
          "The walk is generally easy with few stairs and a couple of moderate uphill sections. We should have started a little earlier, a 10 am start meant that it was quite warm by the time we returned. Regardless we completed the walk including our lunch stop in just over a couple of",
          "Honestly, I expected more from the trip. I saw some pictures on the internet and many people are recommending this as some amazing experience. But basically it's over in 10 minutes, it is nice, you can see a lot of nature, trees,etc. But it's a short trip and there are plenty of",
          "When we are in Ubud, we like to walk from place to place, and we have walked on this ridge many times - on a trip about 10 years ago, we stayed at Sunset Hill at Bangkiang Sidem and this path became our way to getting to and from Ubud town. This trip, we stayed on Monkey Forest",
          "The entire walk is supposed to take 3.5 hours to finish. The first hour is pretty enjoyable, although not overwhelming. The next 1.5-2 hours are terrible because one has to go on a highway with a narrow sidewalk or none at all, competing with cars and motor cycles zooming by,",
          "This walk is free and really has a spectacular view of the jungle, river and plantations. If you have a drone, even better!",
          "Stunning scenery , albeit a bit touristic . thats one of the best walk you can do here in Ubud , Bali",
          "This was my very first stop on my first solo trip and Bali welcomed me with open arms at Campuhan Ridge Walk. Having arrived at around 8am, it was still quite empty along the path. As it was the first stop for my jam packed day, I didn\u2019t take the time to walk the entire path,",
          "Hard to find the entrance, as the only free thing in Ubud nobody bothered to hang a sign.. a place littered with garbage and literally 200 m \u201c worth\u201d seeing. Do not recommend!",
          "We went to the walk around noon. Luckily there has been some wind so we didn't really feel the heat. I recommend the walk as it gives tranquility.",
          "I visit Ubud once or twice a year and every time I'm there I make sure I do the Campuhan Ridge walk at least once. It's such a beautiful outlook along the way. It takes me about 40 minutes to walk the whole way, I'm not a particularly fast walker. There's a place to stop for a",
          "We walked to the start of the ridge walk which is a little further on than Ubud market. There was space for scooter parking if needed. We travelled up it around 11am so it was very hot however there were plenty of spots to spot in the shade if you needed to. We travelled",
          "It is an okay Walk, but not legendary, what it is Made out to be. A bit of a waiste to spend your entire day on to be honest. If you are standing right next to it, then maybe but if you want a proper walk, go somewhere else.",
          "One of the popular attraction of ubud. This place offer experience with nature free of charge. Scenic easy nature traits. Finding this place is a little bet tricky. Though here is the clue. From museum puri lukisan, You can follow sign to antonio blanco museum until u will",
          "Let's start a new day in ubud with campuhan trek. Great view, pure air.. we had a lot of photos here",
          "Good place for a morning stroll, get there early to avoid the heat and crowds. There is also a swing you can use",
          "We did this walk today and was very enjoyable in the mid morning sun. We walked from the centre of ubud and carried out the 2k walk. A few hundred metres up the walk there is a \u201cBali swing\u201d to go on (I think you have to pay) and some refreshments from a small stand. Some lovely",
          "Good for early morning walks and runs. The ridge walk spans 9km long, but we stopped halfway. The entire journey offers fantastic views and a lot of photo stop opportunities. Must visit for people who enjoy early morning walks and views.",
          "We did this early morning, just on the edge of Ubud town, we saw some amazing scenery as well as farmers working in the rice fields. After about 2km you land up at a little warung where we had the best smoothies overlooking a little pond. Highly recommend this walk and it does",
          "I don't understand why this walk is that recommended, the view has nothing exceptional. I imagine it is because you can access it easily from the city center, but much worth going out of the city to enjoy proper landscape.",
          "Beautiful walk. Wear good walking shoes and go coolest time of the day so you don\u2019t get to hot. Take plenty of water as no water during the walk. It\u2019s free to enter so definitely recommend for everyone.",
          "the view is more beautiful on the way up than at the destination. definitely worth the walk. however be careful when trying to peer below on the cliff sides.",
          "It was scorching when we did it in the afternoon, but it was a super easy walk. The fact that there were vendors selling young coconut water was very helpful at that time of the day. There is not much change in elevation, so it is fairly a bland view most of the time, except for",
          "This is a lovely easy walk with beautiful views. It's easy to find and you can do it on your own without needing a guide. Part of the walk is alongside the river which along with all the birdsong is a lovely way to start the day. We walked the ridge early in the morning at 8am",
          "Check this place out if you can find the entrance. Walk up the path that leads to casual cafes, yoga places past rice padi fields. Worth a walk as this still seems to be away from the tourist trek whilst still being close to town",
          "The walk takes you on a path in the midst of green hill side overlooking a small stream. To experience the sunrise you have to be there early.Not to miss while in Ubud.",
          "You dont need a guide or anything, and its not that long, about 2km or 30mins to do the ridge walky bit, the rest is just along local roads. I walked to Jungle Fish (a little pricey at 200 for swim but quality and very nice) for vegan salad lunch and a swim then walked back,",
          "this place is located behind of the Gunung lebah temple and 2 minutes walks from Ubud centre, the foot path are around 2 mil from the start point to the finish point, the foot path are surrounded by Grass that grow long the way of the foot path, you will feel like a jogging in",
          "Good walk to stretch your legs away from busy noisy center of Ubud, early morning best as bit of an uphill climb. Great views of bush .",
          "I hiked for more than an hour and only had to go back because it was getting dark. Otherwise I would've spent all day in this beautiful area. You'll get to see beautiful views and watch the sunset. A must do when in Bali",
          "The walk is lovely, about 45 mins with some nice green views. There\u2019s a mini \u201cBali swing\u201d 1/4 of the way up - we didn\u2019t do this so can\u2019t offer a review for that. Although it\u2019s a nice walk and there are some good photo ops, there isn\u2019t really much at the top except some",
          "Most visitors take the regular path at Campuhan Ridge walk, Jalan Bangkiang Sidem. If you prefer a much longer hike choose the alternative route. Enter at Jalan Raya Ubud at Ubud Yoga House. Go left on small path Jalan Subak Sok Wayah. Take warung Sari Organik as a reference",
          "Most lush greenery I have ever seen. This is a very easy walk (30-45 mins? each way, maybe less) through the most lush and amazing mountains and valleys you will ever see.",
          "A beautiful walk along a ridge with a green jungle on either side, as well as local warungs and five star resorts. The start is a little challenging for people not used to raising their heart rates but once you\u2019re 10 minutes in the going is easier. Definitely a must see in Ubud",
          "My wife and I spent a week in Ubud and wanted to do something different and to get out from the regular sites within the city center. So we decided to do the Campuhan Ridge Walk and were happy that we did. The weather happened to be perfect and made for a memorable experience",
          "Read it was a 2 km walk one way, some of it steep but no problems. Can buy food and drinks along the way. After about 2 kms, you can either walk back the way you came or take a left and walk a circuit, DON'T DO IT, sign says 2 kms but its more like 7 or 8 kms.",
          "A nice way to exercise on this walk and at the end of it a lovely cafe. Up there with the have too\u2019s if ubud. Have some time out of the shops. You won\u2019t be disappointed.",
          "Went there with my sons, youngest one was really tired, maybe because of hot sunshine we had. It was a bit afternoon and we dont prepare to do it. Anyway, anyone wanna exercise, it is good track. Cheers",
          "Our large family broke into two groups and the small children choose not to go the whole way. There\u2019s a beautiful view of the rice paddies and mountains at the end, but we also watched traditional rice harvesting along the way. Path is paved and it\u2019s a relatively easy walk.",
          "I didn't find this walk very interesting. I went early to carry on up the road where the track ended as my family were staying in a villa up there. Pretty busy , not very scenic, didn't take long. Most people seemed to finish at the Karsa Cafe whereas the path goes further to",
          "Love early morning walks on holiday. This was quite average compared to the other walks around Ubud. If you go very early also note the coffee places are not open - I finished before 8am and nothing was open. This all said, I would still do it for a different perspective on",
          "No longer has the views on either side as the plots are largely built over. The standard advert photo is the only picturesque section. The path then becomes a string of wayside shops, cafes and stalls, heavily peopled, so rather disappointing we felt. Oversold?",
          "We started at Karsa cafe, about 100k cab, then walked down, seeing the very hot people walking up, it felt like a good choice. Less glam than instagrammers make it out to be but still a lovely thing to experience.",
          "This is a 2km walk that gets your day going. Absolutely beautiful view and a must do when in Ubud. Also, they have a few spots to purchase water or beverages on the trail, so bring alittle money.",
          "We went here a fair bit during our stay in Ubud. With all the traffic in the main town it was difficult to find a nice running route but, going early in the morning, this one was spectacular and afforded wonderful views! Moreover, you can just keep going up and up and up once",
          "I can't recommend this walk enough. Try to do the walk by passing over the bamboo bridge which brings you to a temple, if your not too keen there is another entrance near by. The walk takes you through small villages with local art being displayed (for sale) There are plenty of",
          "Lovely little trek along the mountain tops. A very tranquil and serene walk. At the end of the walk is an 8th century Hindu temple- Pura Gunung Lebah.",
          "Still a lovely wander, try toavoid mid day heat. Early morning is quiet and cool. Beautiful vistas and you can wander off the main path for better photos",
          "Its very peaceful and wonderful! Very easy and relaxing! You can see local art and galleries on the walk! Its beyond worth it!",
          "I preferred the rice field walk, this one has more of a rainforest feel to it. It's all uphill one way and downhill on the way back. I thought the views were ok, but nothing too amazing. About 3 km out and another 3 back, maybe around an hour or so. We stopped to have a coconut",
          "We did this in may and it was hot we waited till late afternoon but it was still hot we didnt do the whole walk as I had a bad foot but we did about 2 kilometres until we got to a lovely little warung where we rested with a couple of smoothies. Next time we go back we are going",
          "Easy walking trek, view stunning, amazing location. There are cafes, villas, warungs, spas and yoga along the way.",
          "A beautiful hike above the city- start at the Warwick and climbs a little before it levels out to beautiful views. We went around 8am and it wasn\u2019t too crowded, but when we were wrapping up around 10 there were lots of people! A few cafes and coffee stops about 2km in...walk as",
          "Peaceful walk with a majestic temple and grand views at the beginning. Great for a morning walk. Best to go when it's not too hot. It gets less peaceful when the trail joins to a road where cars and motorbikes share the path.",
          "If you have time, this is a great early morning walk or jog. Nature is beautiful and it is serene and not as busy as other places.",
          "We did the walk early in the AM and it was beautiful. A little hot, but such beautiful views. Definitely take your time.",
          "If you\u2019ve had enough of temples, monkeys and bars and restaurants full of tourists, there isn\u2019t really a lot to do in Ubud - which is part of the attraction. We did this walk in the middle of a cloudy day and there was some shade so it was OK. Nice views and countryside and",
          "Do yourself a favor and get up early for this tranquil walk and see the river banks come alive. I got some sensational sunrise shots. A two hour return walk from my hotel in central Ubud. Can\u2019t wait to come back and do it again next year.",
          "A nice casual stroll along the paved walkway among the beautiful green nature of Bali. Nothing super tiring or challenging,pretty close to the center of Ubud. Could see some people jogging, so if you are looking for a casual hike or workout and are in Ubud this is a nice place",
          "Did this walk on a misty morning. Makes for great photos. The view of the jungle is breathtaking. It can be hard to find so walk as if you\u2019re going down the hill to the palace (or temple, I don\u2019t remember) and you\u2019ll see the trail on the right before the palace.",
          "Ideal for an early morning hike/jog. The view from the ridge is absolutely stunning. We were really happy we managed to work Campuhan Ridge walk into our itinerary, it is a must go!",
          "This is a great little walk to get a bit of exercise under your belt when in Bali but I recommend NOT going in the middle of the day in the heat and sun bearing down unless you don't mind being a hot sweaty mess. Close by, very scenic and nice to get away from the hustle and",
          "Very good walk, it was hot but humidity bearable. Had baby in carrier and walked all the way to paddy fields. Beautiful views!",
          "In the midst of Bali big upon the ridge there is silence amongst nature Absolutely beautiful experience Recommend morning or late afternoon do that your not in the real heat of the sun It\u2019s breathtakingly beautiful A serene and spiritual experience",
          "The beginning of the walk was a little hard to find for us, but some friendly locals pointed us in the right direction. Also if you're used to hiking, it will be a casual walk, and not \"steep\" at all....",
          "Wow... such a great walk along the ridge just out of Ubud... a little hard to find, but oh so worth the effort. An easy hike for a couple of km's, the view either side of the ridge is amazing - lush green jungle. Take plenty of water though as it gets hot!",
          "Started the walk at 6.30am, rest assured, it gets easier after the first part. Depending how far one wants to explore, you can probably complete the walk within an hour. It\u2019s a good walk with the nature.",
          "Views from the ridge are wonderful. Easy path to follow. You can have someone drive you out to the end so you only have to walk one way back to town.",
          "Views are lovely but so are all the views in Bali. Its steep, as is the country, so you'll get sweaty in the heat.",
          "A great way to spend a morning. We walked there and back along the same route; you can do it at a leisurely pace in less than two hours. Some good places to stop for juice or coffee along the path, and we met some locals going about their work in the village at the other end of",
          "We virtually jogged the whole of this trail being a competitive bunch The views were fantastic, trail and easy access to the town of Ubud makes it a great morning activity. Highly recommended for the whole family young and old alike.",
          "I guess I'm glad we slogged our way through this hot hike. It was quite pretty. Very steep and hot. We started at 8am, and were hoping that we'd beat some of the heat. After getting to the top, there are several options for getting a cold drink.",
          "My wife and I walked along the Campuhan Ridge in April 2019. It is located within easy walking distance of the tourist area of Ubud. It is a wonderful quick relief from the nearby busy tourist areas and a wonderful opportunity to see the countryside for free without having to",
          "We went at around 5pm. Nice and quiet. Sat in cafe at top for beer. We did think about doing look but were worried we'd get lost. Nice walk to do!",
          "This is probably the most easily accessible walk around Ubud and though overall it is nice, I did not find it particularly interesting or beautiful. The first part from Ubud main street to right after the Pura Gunung Lebah (The Temple of the Mountain Bee - could a name be more",
          "So good to be here in the morning and get the chance to see a Balinese temple. You could bring your lovly dogs as well. Better to visit this place early morning when there is no many people to take a nice picture rather than in the afternoon. And please do not throw any rubbish",
          "From Ubud center, one road takes you up and over the other is on the main road. I tried both, the up and over route is much quieter. If there is a ceremony going on, just walk past and to the trail on the right. The trail itself was a nice hike with art shops at the very end",
          "Campuhan Ridge Walk is worth doing for the panoramic views and is relatively close to town especially at sunrise or sunset. It\u2019s become more \u2018touristy\u2019 over the years with improved maintenance, bars/stalls, spas etc but is still worthwhile for the different perspective of Ubud",
          "We had heard about this so set off one morning early before it got too hot. Its a lovely and easy walk, which takes you through a couple of little villages. Great views, we loved it. And at the end is the Karsa Spa and Cafe....which we decided to do a reflexology and have",
          "I ran the ridge walk at 6.15am to make use of the cooler temperatures. The walk is paved pathway with beautiful views of forest and fields. It is steep, as would be expected, and has a few steep steps at the bottom. Lots of bars and stalls nearer top to get lunch/drinks. A",
          "It\u2019s not a difficult hike. Easy going and you can pace it out. Great for couples. There are small vendors on the way to quench your thirst... fresh coconut water etc. so you don\u2019t have carry so much. Better to wear sneakers. Love the sound of the gushing river.",
          "Really nice hike. But if you are not that strong hiking person you can actually start at the north, and then you will basically go just down all the way and see the picturesque landscape:))) (just put ridge walk start from north on Google and then you can do it too:))",
          "Great walk but get started early. We waited until 6:30, probably should have started 5:30ish. It got super hot around 8am",
          "An amazing walk. Views of rice fields and river. Allow 2 -3 hours return. Take water and wear hat and sunscreen. Not well advertised but an amazing day. Small amount of cafe restaurants at the top. Highly recommended and it\u2019s totally free",
          "We went there in May 2019. Highly recommended because it is an easy walk but you can see lots of beautiful scenes.",
          "While it is a nice, free activity to do. The Ubud area offers nicer walks than this. If you really want to go, do it very early. Around 7.30AM the tourists will come and the walk will be so much less fun.",
          "This place is absolutely amazing, such a beautiful walk with amazing views all the way. I've done this walk a couple of times and will definitely do it again on my return to beautiful Ubud.",
          "Nice easy walk along the top of the river , lovely views taking in the local Balinese scenery. Best bit stopping at Karsa Spa for a bit R&R before walking back to Ubud .",
          "Such a beautiful view! It is best to come here very early in the morning as it was already hot when I started the walk at 8am. The walk is a bit uphill so wear your most comfortable shoes. The route going here is near Warwick Ibah Villas.",
          "Lovely walk, but don\u2019t do what we did and go in the middle of the afternoon! We were so hot! Bring water and go earlier or in the evening.",
          "I walked in the late morning and it was hot and steamy. The views are gorgeous and you can reward yourself at the top with a lovely cold drink. I did not do a return walk down. I took an air conditioned taxi.",
          "The scenic view is beautiful. It is a walk of 2,5 Km up from the side of Monkey Forest Road. It is an easy trekking exercise because the path is paved. At the end of the walk we landed ourselves at Karsa Cafe for a nice breakfast in their nice garden. Although I am worried that",
          "Every year it gets busier & more small buildings, warungs, appear. Many homes added by outside owners, so go do it while there r still rice fields 2 walk by.",
          "This fairly easy walk (with good shoes) is good for an afternoon walk but it doesn\u2019t have the views you will be expecting. The ridge is over grown and the development on the other ridge detracts from the peace you could feel being up and out of the bustle of Ubud.",
          "A really enjoyable walk. Fairly easy to do but can get very hot! Make sure you have water but there are places to get drinks at the end. Beautiful scenery, full of wildlife and straightforward to follow. Definitely recommend to get a good view of the luscious vegetation in the",
          "I did this walk in reverse. I started by Mosaic restaurant and did my shopping first ( for pickup later). Had a coffee and smoothie bowl at a great studio/coffee shop close to Mosaic. You walk on the road for quite a way until you finally get to the ridge. I thought I missed a",
          "Good views but getting popular so quite busy and there is quite a lot of construction taking place along the walk which rather spoils it. It won\u2019t be long before it\u2019s been ruined.",
          "My partner and I went for a walk here one evening during sunset hour. It is a very beautiful and scenic walk. The entire path is paved, so it is not a hike or a challenge. At the time we went, it was extremely crowded, and there were many tourists taking photos and also flying",
          "This was the third time we have done this Walk. It's better to go early morning as can get quite hot and humid, however there are drink stops along the way. This time we noticed more buildings, art stores, drink stops and a \"swing\" ride along the walk. It's still popular with",
          "If you want to make a walk around Ubud village and see some nature you probably like to walk this path. It is nice but not spectacular like the rice fields north of Ubud.",
          "Sad that this is hyped up as a beautiful countryside walk. Go find rice fields to wander through just up the road or better yet, go to Sideman and see the amazing Balinese countryside.",
          "The walk doesn\u2019t start too far out of Ubud town so you can walk to the start. If you reach the bridge when you are looking for the beginning, you\u2019ve gone too far! It\u2019s an easy walk but very hot. Go early in the day. Have a bintang at the Warung at the end with the pretty lilly",
          "Campuhan Ridge Walk needs to be done in the early morning as its too hot through the heat of the day. The walk takes in views of the jungle & rainforest It takes approximately 2 hours. Bring a water bottle, sunscreen & good walking shoes. The walk starts just near the Warwick",
          "This is a fairly uneventful nature walk which is in itself a nice thing to do. But if you\u2019ve seen a bunch of rice fields and lots of greenery - this can be a bit underwhelming. I would have dropped this one down the priority list if I had my time again.",
          "We walked this ridge several times and it has wonderful views. There are several steep areas and a few stairs at the beginning, however, the majority of the ridge is flat. Many locals use this as their morning running track. Best to visit early or late afternoon to beat the",
          "This is a nice walk up, and along a ridge. It is about a 20 minute walk from the Monkey Forest to the trail head. Make sure you start off early in the morning. I started at 8am and it was already getting quite warm. I took an umbrella which I used to keep the sun off of me.",
          "The path starts near a street, quickly turns into a jungle area and then cuts through a wide grassy area with a deep gorge on either side. A few signs point the way. There is not much shade so we enjoyed it in the early morning. The surroundings are lovely. We stopped several",
          "Took me a while to get to the starting point. I only walked as far as the Karsa cafe which is approx 2km. It\u2019s a nice walk with views of rice fields. Very little shade so early morning is advised. Not a difficult walk. Would recommend if you are looking for nice scenery",
          "Not for the faint hearted, but worth the effort and the Bintang at the top. People with physical disabilities can still enjoy the panoramic view as it can be reached by road",
          "Entrance is up next to Warwick resort. Easy walk if you are moderately active, but it\u2019s hot. We saw too many families with young children and babies without hats on and they were RED! Be prepared! I had lathered myself in sunscreen, wore my hat and I still had a very light burn",
          "The daunting task of a 20km out and return walk along a concrete path dotted with patches of muddy terrain sounded initially like a chore rather than a pleasant pastime. But surprisingly the ridge walk with Valleys and ravines on either side afforded some very pretty scenery",
          "In our 60's I thought it would be a good idea to do the Campuhan Ridge walk while in Ubud. I had looked at a lot of clips and read about it however, I obviously ignored the age of the people posting the clips. We made a mistake not leaving until 9.00am because by then it was",
          "Lovely peaceful walk along the top of the ridge. Can get very hot as there\u2019s no shade so best to go early. Option to do the full loop, which takes quite a while or walk for 30 mins, then trace steps back to the beginning point (opposite Blanco Museum). There\u2019s a beautiful view",
          "Great walk along rice fields, forest and the river. Was very nice and i loved the views. Really happy with this walk.",
          "I jogged from my place on Monkey Forest Rd to the ridge walk one morning. It's a beautiful walk, easy, not too long, nice to go early in the morning when it's not too hot. Noticed a few bridal parties taking photos along here, with some drones flying around taking photos.",
          "It's nice enough, river at the start with some cultural significance (the sacred convergence of two rivers), a temple with some nice towers (which like a lot of temples here, you can't seem to access) followed by a long path with a very green, deep valley on one side. It's okay",
          "This walk was quite disappointing for me: you walk and sweat for almost an hour round trip and there is nothing interesting to see. Go to the rice terraces instead.",
          "Great walk, you get some beautiful photos and it\u2019s good exercise. Just off the main strip in Ubud so easy to get too.",
          "They make you trek for nice 30 to 40 minutes for nothing but rice fields. The view from jatiluwih rice terrace is a lot better.",
          "Nice quiet break from Ubud! Can be hot and exposed so best to do in AM or late afternoon. Nice places to eat st the end.",
          "The main entrance through the hotel Warwick Ibah is easily recognizable from the street. A greeting by stairs leading down beside a bridge and a temple primes properly for the ensuing easy 1-hour walk. All along the ridge there is concrete tiles for secure stepping and after",
          "Wonderful walk done in the early morning to avoid the afternoon sun. You see some rice fields along the way.",
          "Amazing views of the dense jungle. Absolutely beautiful. The ridge walk itself is very peaceful and quiet but once you get towards the end you\u2019ll end up in several rice fields with some lovely restaurants and coffee shops. A great way to spend the afternoon!",
          "The track was short,about 1.5 km from the the bridge to the end of the trail. More than half of the trail was under shade, and was easily completed in mid morning. Bringing a bottle of water would be a good idea. Long grass, rice paddies, river valley were spread along both",
          "While this place just tuck in the middle of jalan raya ubud, it's pretty quiet and good for escape in hustle and bustle of ubud. The walk is short and good to go in the morning, could be a little slippery, but suitable for all ages and fitness level, but not enough facility for",
          "if you in ubud, must visit this place, morning at 7 am and before evening at 4 pm is better to schedule visit this place",
          "This was an ok hike, with some decent views. It didn't really seem to have an 'end point', aside from Karsa's Cafe and Spa, which seemed pricey, so we decided not to stop there. We also went during the rainy season, and we were rushing to avoid an expected downpour. Clouds",
          "Never get bored of this place. Best to come early in the morning otherwise it\u2019s too packed. Just stroll, put your earphones, play some nice music, inhale the morning air, look at the greeneries; you are finding your peace again. Thank you Ubud for keeping this place remain",
          "This 2km+ walk starts just up the road from Bridges heading into central Ubud near the Warwick Ibah Luxury Villas. The entrance is a little hard to find but worth the effort as this reasonably easy, mostly paved track takes you away from the hustle and bustle through lush forest",
          "We took this walk at the end of a long day. I think it would be better in the am as it was very hot as we were walking. I think it was just ok; not sure it was worth the hour it took.",
          "Hot during the day with lots of people Reccomend earlier the better bet the heat Said there was a temple Walked passed one at the start but couldn't enter it Walked along the ridge but eventually came to nothing so just turned around Maybe we missed where the ridge walk",
          "A beautiful place if you like long walk distances! Make sure to take water, had ans sunnies with you! There are some natural nice spots for camera shots!",
          "It is a must do walk in Ubud as it is not a heavy trek and has beautiful views of the valley, few hawkers and gives a flavour of the Indonesian way of life. It does not require any preparation or any guide as the trail is clearly marked. Better to go towards early morning rather",
          "Great walk and beautiful views not too many hawkers. Rice paddies, lillie pond, forest/valley and temple views all available on this walk. Don\u2019t go in the hottest part of the day!",
          "Great place for a nice walk. Beautiful landscape and nice view. Amazing temples. It's worthing doing this walk. Be careful with the sun and bring water.",

          "We stayed at the top of the Ridge Walk so walked down this route to get to Ubud centre. The views are unbelievable into the valley so a lovely way to walk from / to Ubud. It\u2019s obviously really hot so I\u2019d suggest doing it earlier/later in the day and one way (into Ubud as it\u2019s",
          "It\u2019s best to go to Campuhan in early morning or late afternoon as it sometimes gets really hot during the day. Not recommended to go after rain as it gets slippery.",
          "Absolutely stunning and blissful walk in the most elegant and scenic nature around. Be in a total zen state as you immerse yourself in the most scenic and majestic nature you\u2019ve ever experienced. A truly beautiful and wonderful walking trail and a must do for anyone visiting",
          "This is worth a visit, take a bottle of water, and be prepared to come back the same way, You can also continue through and get to a spa or massage hut along the road,",
          "Excellent walk experience in Ubud / Bali. It does not require experience or preparation and gives flaovor of Indonesian nature.",
          "It was a short walk with nice view, after a while warungs, busy street with cars, motorbikes, not the place where you can walk quetly and be with yourself. But the short part of this way is very beautiful.",
          "One of the things I love about Ubud is the mixture between super busy, and when just turning left or right you can find yourself in a rice field or a quiet temple \u2013 like the Bukit Campuhan. Before going up hill to enter Ubud on the Jalan Raya you turn left and park your scooter.",
          "The ridge walk is really nice. The first few yards you run into a lot of tourists but as you go it thins out. There are also nice places along the ridge to eat and go swimming in pools.",
          "Escape the frenzy of Ubud, to the quiet and serenity of what Ubud once was. Your body and mind will be pleased.",
          "We travelled as a couple. We approached the Walk from the top (walking up JL Raya Ubud, Sanggingan, Jl. Rsi Markandya II, Jl. Bangkiang Sidem). It was quite a long walk that we would not reccomend. Nevertheless, if you like knowing a different part of Ubud it is ok. The",
          "Beautiful sights along this easy hike. Recommended in the morning before the heat as its pretty out in the open. Stunning views - highly recommended",
          "It was just ok and not sure I can recommend. It was mid-afternoon and hot when we went which was probably not a good decision on our part.",
          "We reach here at 9.45am where it not that much people..the path toward up is very steep..u need alot of walking up in order to reach the beautiful scenery.. there small bridge to cross where you can see the natural water flowing from the mountian.. there also a few temple too..",
          "We entered via the driveway beside \"Ibah\" and meandered along the walk. It wasn't overly busy, nor was it too strenuous. The view was quite amazing and it was interesting to see the other sides of buildings. On a recommendation we continued past the end of the track, along",
          "The ridge walk is really beautiful, but I recommend to come here in the morning because it\u2019s really hot there ;)",
          "This is a delightful walk on a well defined path. Better to walk in the early morning or late afternoon as it is lacking in shade. Take water although there are now a number of spots to replenish.",
          "A lovely walk out of town. A few steps off the main road and into another world, at the top of the gorge, leading onto rice fields. Great views and contrast between old farms, guest houses, shops, cafes and villas dotted along the route. Good advice to wear sturdy shoes. Plenty",
          "Covered this walk in the late afternoon. Pretty easy trail which can be easily covered by anyone. The views were good at some places. Better to do it early morning.",
          "After the rice fields walk yesterday we took on the Campuhan Ridge this morning. Starting from Ubud the first bit has some steep ups and downs which then level out for a gentle rising walk on the ridge track which enters a village. However after about an hour, if that, the",

          "Do this walk as early as possible. It gets busy and hot later in the morning. Easy to find. The tough part is the first two hundred metres. Keep your eyes open for birds. You can see kingfisher, bulbuls, grassbirds, coucal, white bellied swifts, palm swift and fork failed",
          "Easy stroll, dont expect much, just lovely views and after 30 mins come through a village, have a drink at the end of the paved area, turn back or carry on in a loop back to ubud. turn into the IBAH hotel to start, then down and head right",
          "Walked around nine am. Probably should have headed off sooner. It was warm. Lovely surrounds and easy walk after the initial steps and incline. Lovely art to look at along the way. Not as many dogs this time. Rewarded at Karla kafe with a refreshing Jamu at the end. Yum.",
          "Nice walk if you are looking to get away from all the shops and restaurants for a while. Someone had suggested it would afford good views of the rice terraces as well, but there were only a few towards the end of the trail, and they were generally unremarkable.",
          "This is a jogging trek so you won\u2019t see things other than the track and the greenery on the right and left. Best time to go is before sunrise (non-rainy season), around 7am (on rainy season), and sunset time. The best part of being an early riser is you can have this place for",
          "Very close to ubud city centre. You can go for a walk to refresh your mind. Its pleasing to walk around the greeny place. 100% recommended place to visit",
          "A short walk from the centre of town to the start of the ridgewalk. The start point is easy to walk past so don't forget to ask the locals when you think you are in the area. The walk itself is not overly taxing and offers fantastic views especially at dawn and dusk. Make sure",
          "Left Ubud hotel at 17.30 and hit the trail just as the sun was beginning to set. Not really a rice filled walk was some make it out to be, rather a nicely paved track along a hill ridge. Magnificent colours over the jungle cannopy. Bring decent shoes and water. Aim to get back",
          "I went for little walk . On 4 pm good to go and lucky i found nice spa.. Karsa spa.. Before it you will see nice temple and river view.. We will be back to ubud",
          "This is a lovely walk, the entrance being not far from the centre of Ubud. Do it in the morning , as it gets very hot in the middle of the day. The beauty of the walk is the unimpeded view. But this means no shelter in the middle of the day! I took a parasol \ud83d\ude01",

          "It\u2019s nice how wonderful and beautiful everything is. Clean. Must try. And when you get to the end go to Karsa cafe and spa!!!",
          "We started from the Ubud main road and got our driver to wait for us after the shops at the other end. A nice scenic walk with red millipedes, skinks, butterflies and dragonflies for company. After the shops, passed by some fabulous views of paddy fields. Best to do in the cool",
          "Don\u2019t have unrealistic expectations from this place. Its a nice green and beautiful hiking trail, not very long. After around 1.5-2 kms all the cafe\u2019s etc start. The karsa spa is also situated on route (we didn\u2019t go here but that spa has some amazing reviews- so you can try it",

          "I took my parents on the walk this time, so we didn't walk that far, but it's a lovely walk to get away from the hectic motorbikes and buses. Plenty of cafes dotted on the way to relax with a coconut while sitting in the shade to rest from the walk and heat.",
          "We really enjoyed the Campuhan ridge walk. A real break from the bustle of Ubud. Very well organized, with a little water stall right when you need it. Beautiful views on both sides of the ridge.",
          "I reccomend to choose a little cloudy day for taking this ridge walk, because there is only a little shadow. The earlier you start, the less people you are going to meet. After about 2 km, there are lots of beautiful warungs where you can rest, eat, drink or get a massage.",
          "..., as my review. Had a nice lunch at the rice fields before walking the ridge down to Ubud! The walk was much shorter than I expected and I had imagined longer views, but it was very nice. It was not so crowded when we were there.",

          "We walked this very early to avoid the sun. There are plenty of little places to stop for a drink along the way and it's just about doable with a stroller (though the paving slabs are far apart for the first half hr, so our little wheels kept getting stuck between them). At the",

          "Early in the morning it is a pleasure to walk and listen to birds. Unfortunately, cafes did not work so early.",
          "This place was awesome, but from reading other reviews we came expecting quite a hike! It was quicker than we thought, but very pretty. A bit muddy after rain so no pretty shoes.",
          "Nice walk, take good shoes and water if it's a sunny day as with it being a ridge it's exposed most of the time. We went at about 10am so it wasn't to busy but on the way back it was getting noticeably busier.",

          "Truly enjoyed this \u2018village\u2019 walk in the middle of the city of Ubud. If you are a nature lover, take 30-60 minutes of your stay in Ubud & walk through greenish fields, admire the sunset and beautiful surroundings. The entry to the track is almost right at the Zest restaurant.",
          "It is not a mind blowing walk by any means. Yes it is hot and humid, take your water and wear sensible shoes. Saw plenty of people in thongs, not wise. Not too much to see, sure there are some nice viewing spots. Just take your time and have no expectations. I still recommend",
          "Not as good as the Kajeng rice field walk, however still worth doing and better than the Monkey Forest. The ridge walk officially ends where the road starts, and cars become a hazard again. Worth walking all the way up to Krasta Cafe with 's amazing views and gardens.",

          "Lovely place for walking. It is too green and you will definitely enjoy it even if your aren't a hiker because it is not too long and it is quite easy. We went later in afternoon and the temperature was not high but I think early in the morning will be better. Highly recommended.",
          "Another place for you to go if you want to just hanging around walking with your pet or your lovely one, located at Ubud, it's a little bit hard to spot from the road if you ride wheeler, but you can ask local people instead, that easy :) \u2026",

          "This is a nice walk to do in Ubud - Nice little Warung towards the end of it to chill before you head back. You can keep going and it will lead you to the othersise of the gorge and past Naughty Nuris. Some very nice ribs to eat there. Doing the whole route is a long walk and you will need google maps to navigate for a bit too",

Some cafes along the way for those who fancy a refreshment. \nOne of best attractions in Ubud for those seeking a bit of tranquility after the busyness of the Ubud Market and centre",

          "Nice to take a morning walk when it's not too hot. We went during sunrise and it was nice and quiet! Path is not as long as expected. You should not be under the impression you will be hiking for two hours. It's maybe 2 km total, from which maybe half has houses and cars.",
          "Great, easy (but hot!) walk in nature. There's a swing by the entrance and some cafes/warungs at the end too for a refreshment and views.",
          "Impressive walk. Karsa kaffe and spa. A must see, between de rice fields.",
          "Nice walk..\nTry early in the morning because it might be hot during the day and not many shaded trees",
          "Nice hiking place near Ubud centre. Good view and good exercise",
          "If you have the time in Ubud it's a nice little walk. But definitely not a must see. Especially around noon it's way too hot here.",
          "Beautiful walk,and that's it,I been there during the hottest time,and there is no shade,so if is very hot go in the morning(in the evening you could be eaten from the mosquitos).",
          "This is a necessary stop in Ubud for anyone wanting to take in a bit of nature. The views from the ridge are second to none. We did the 2km loop as I\u2019m 7 mos pregnant but would definitely have gone on the longer circuit under different \u2026",
          "Nice walk before 7am...nice clean air. Put on your comfy shoes. Wear t-shirt because you will be sweating. Well at least if you start to walk or run from the path near ibah hotel. \nSo many people walk their dog. Becareful you walk on the \u2026",
          "A very nice morning stroll. Best to get there by 7-8 to avoid the sun. Nicely paved path with big white blocks. Grass on the sides. Huge trees too. Some nice restaurants and cafe around. A little steep towards the begging. Good parking facility.",
          "Good but not extraordinary. Few scenic spots for Instagram worthy shots. Carry sunscreen (SPF 50 preferred), comfy shoes and a bottle of water.",
          "Very hard walk when it's hot. The view is very nice. At the top we went back because it was to hot. Don't do this on mid day.",
          "There was no clear end to this walk and it can get pretty hot midday\nBring WATER and a camera",
          "One of the best natural parks to take a walk in. The weather on February is the best too!",
          "It's free for entering  place and good for who want to walk and taking pictures but I don't recommend it on sunny days.",
          "Cool place, the walk is a bit shorter than we thought but great views. Can become really hot so pack some sunscreen.",
          "Nice little walk on the ridge in between two small rivers. There is also a swing on the way and choice of places to stop for a drink or meal. Nice atmosphere.",
          "Great place and view. Only go ahead if you can climb 1.5 KM.",
          "It's a nice walk but do it either early morning or afternoon/sunset time, otherwise it's too hot. It's a nice stroll, but not really extraordinary. I wouldn't put it as an absolute must do. It's free though so you've got nothing to loose",

          "This place is usually listed as an absolute must-see in Ubud but it's better to know what to expect. The walk is literally paved, so I wouldn't even consider it hiking. There's shops and restaurants most of the way and a couple of cafes \"in \u2026",
          "Best place for a morning walk! You can enjoy the lush green and see a few paddy fields as you burn your calories! The track is well maintained so it's not exactly a trek but more of a stroll. You will also spot a few structures which depict \u2026",
          "Nice, but something special. Good for a walk but nothing very memorable",
          "Trek was OK and easy during dry season, not sure if it was raining. A bit crowded before the sunset i guess because sunset is the best time here. I'd love to come back here in the morning.",

          "The view was beautiful. It was a longg walk though",
          "Really peaceful. Go for sunrise. Bring water and sunscreen and big repellant. Very little shade so plan accordingly!",

          "Be prepared for a long, likely hot walk, with very long inclines and various stairways to climb up and down. That said, take some wonderful photos, or perhaps enjoy the \"Love Swing,\" which is less than half way up the walk. The river is \u2026",

          "If you're staying in Ubud, definitely take the time to go on this short Campuhan Ridge Walk (only about 2km one way I believe) for sunrise or sunset. It's a really enjoyable walk with beautiful views of the rice fields and valleys. Lots of \u2026",
          "Over rated & too short.\nThe start just in Ubud is promising as you climb the ridge, the ridge walk itself is ok with some nice views but before you know it, more art shops and Wurang...back in a village with more of the same. Start early, or late might be nice.",
          "Found some locals along the path that offered me to come drink with them, ended up taking quite a few shots of their homemade mojito. Other than the the trail was alright, I also walked it as the sun was going down and missed a lot. But left drunk! Fun walk for sure",
          "The temple is great at the beginning of the walk. The walk is good but shorter than what i though but good in the heat.",
          "Very nice hell. You will have to walk for 40 to 60 minutes. But the place worth it. It is difficult to go there by bike but some people did it. I read recommend you to visit it if you are nearby.",
          "Joggig track which recommended by me if you do love practise and you are in Ubud. Best view in the early morning rather than evening. You can come around 6am and it's free entry. For you who confused to found this place, search maps with WARWICK IBAH hotel and villas, because the way to enter campuhan ridge walk is in this hotel area.",
          "I wish I live in Ubud, so that I can walk at Campuhan every morning! It's been a while since I went there last year and got surprised by some local people who offer roasted satay, corn, and coconut inside the track! It's really good for \u2026",
          "Its nice to take a walk around and enjoy the scenery. Other than that there isn't much to see. So if you just want to relax and walk around. You'll love it! However, if you're hoping to see something touristic then you'll be disappointed. Make sure to go down to the river and walk on the tiny bridge.",
          "Nice foot path to walk back and forth",
          "Nice walk that requires a moderate level of fitness. Takes you alongside some rice fields and a small village towards the end. Considering how close it is to Ubud centre, the peacefulness of the area is amazing. \n\nThere is a great \u2026",
          "Relaxing easy walk for all ages 1KM going and the same way back.... beatiful temple, forest, and rice fields on the way.... nice small art market with great prices and an amazing little cafe at the end called The Shed... or continue to the pool in \"Fish Jungle\" I think its called",
          "If you like to walk then go else don't and singles pls avoid this place.",
          "Good place for exercice in the morning, burn your fat, track 2km away and Beautiful view. No car park crouwded road. You shoul walk from your hotel for warming up.",
          "It's a nice walk with a pleasant scenery, and it is a great spot to take some pictures or even fly a drone. I would definitely recommend to go early in the morning or in the afternoon during golden hour.",
          "Hot walk but it was a nice walk! There's a bunch of small places to take a break at and grab lunch or a drink. This walk was one of my partner's highlights from our entire Bali trip.",

          "Great little walk to do and get some good views. The walk itself is not too intense. You looking at a total of about 4 kms from start and back. There is a nice little restaurant at the end and if you eat too much there are taxis from the end.",
          "The views are very good, interested to visit, nice, fresh, save place, beautiful river. Top !!!",
          "Worth doing but although it\u2019s touted as a \u2018trek\u2019, it\u2019s actually a fairly short and easy walk. Lovely views over the valleys on either side. Can get very hot when the sun is high in the sky, so if you can face an early rise, morning is the best time to go.",
          "Super chill, nice to walk, lots of green haha go to the swing tho",
          "People known this place as a good place to take a instagramable picture. I suggested to you, do not come in the dry season. There is no place to take cover.",
          "Not worth your time. There are a couple of alright views, but there is litter everywhere and there are much better views in Ubud.",
          "You have to walk little bit but you can find wonderful scenery of Bali.",
          "Need a bit of walking to the Ridge, choose to go early morning or late in the evening. Great place for a quick hike.",
          "Nice walk,go there in the morning or later in the afternoon coz of the sun!its 2 kilometres long.",
          "The campuhan ridge walk itself is okay, worth 3 stars. A few very beautiful views, but that's all. The reward for travelling the campuhan ridge walk lies in the warungs and cafes at the top of the ridge. These are so great, than an extra star was awarded by me.",
          "It's a lovely walk. Can be a bit crowded. But nice to go early in the morning or late afternoon",
          "Really nice walk, mosquito repelent can be very helpfull!",
          "Somewhere just about anybody could walk. Nothing too difficult or taxing. Some very pretty views along the route, first jungle views and further along you are among rice fields.",
          "Great place for a morning walk. Better visit early morning to catch a sunset.",
          "Great jogging or hiking spot in the middle of the town. Great views and also has a small version of the Bali swing! End the walk in the forest at karau cafe and spa. Follow the signage/Google maps walking navigation to karsu.",
          "I like walks and hikes but this really went to nowhere with not much to look at. Would be nicer to do earlier in the day",
          "A serene 3km walk with sound of water gushing, Mountain in one side and a valley on the other side!",
          "Nice peaceful walk. Not much to do, but there are a few good spots to take pictures. I feel like its a one time thing. Glad we did it, but won't be doing it again next time we visit Bali.",
          "Awesome walk. Lots of scenery to see on the way. Rice fields local shops and restaurants. Be warned...food in the local restaurants take a long time to come to the table. Like a long time...i am guessing due to making it fresh to order for \u2026",
          "Nice stroll but shorter than expected. Suggest stopping along the way for a drink and lunch",
          "Nice place for hike and walk, free entrance with parking area near a school (for car and bike). I think it's more beautiful if you come at early morning before the crowd come. And if you come at sunset, make sure you head back before dark because it's little bit scary at night, no light at all...",
          "It was awsome, beautiful! Our first hike, we woke up 5am, so we could catch the sunrise!",
          "come here in d morning bfore sun burn u n u got streak by heatstroke while hiking XDDD",
          "Nice view\nGood place to walking and jogging",
          "The ridge part itself was a lot shorter than i imaged, you can finish the walk in 15 minutes! And there is really only one part which gives you nice views. However if you keep walking on, you soon come to a small road which has spas and \u2026",
          "Peaceful walk close to Ubud proper. Lovely views and a calming experience",
          "A serene 3km walk with sound of water gushing on one side and hill on another side.",
          "One of the popular sightseeing place in Ubud area. Combination between paddy fields, forest, and river will refresh your eyes. The ridge walk has two access, both is from Jalan Raya Ubud, and the hill located between the road. I suggest to wear a proper shoes because a quite medium trekking to the hill.",
          "Free walk but not worth doing after the dry season. Looks brown, lots of rubbish and unkept. Perhaps after the rains the lush greens would make for a more enjoyable visit.",
          "The walk is good but nothing worth seeing plus it's over crowded as well. Hardly anything worth seeing or spending time. There are few cafes and spa's along the way. It would be a good idea to carry a water bottle along else you might a lot just on drinking water.",
          "Nice walk near the city, you can find the famous swing on the way and go to a small village with somes shops and hotel/bar. There is a nice temple on the way and the \"secret Bridge\" but you have to find it.",
          "It's an okay place. Nothing to see except walk and cliff. High grass and stuff. Best in rainy season I guess. It's free tho, so, really can't complaint.",
          "Nice place for trekking, if you in Ubud must go there",
          "The distance. The distance to campuhan entrance itself, then a 2km trek up to where u can take the pictures. For US specifically on na 12 day vacation it felt a bit exhausting to do and time consuming. But if your willing to spend about 3 \u2026",
          "The walk is amazing, at the end of the ridge you can find lots of coffee shops were you can have some rest, drink a nice cup of coffee and enjoy a relaxing moment. It is recommended to have this experience if intrested in a long walk.",
          "Really nice view for about 3 kilometers. For free and in the morning or evening sun a lovely mood. Everybody who visits Ubud should take a look there.",
          "Very nice place. U can go through these terrace walk. There are so many good view and u can take a swing.",
          "Very nice walk but be warned it is lacking any shade. If you intend to walk it then it\u2019s probably best to avoid during the hottest part of the day. Views were nice and a good reflection of Ubud.",
          "Just finished walking this trail, very pretty views & before sunset so it was cooler yet still that golden hour sunlight. Stone path the entire way but glad we had comfortable shoes. Bring a little bit of water. No bug bites. Took 30 minutes, free, definitely recommend!",

          "I enjoy it very much. Awesome view, neat ridge walk, fresh air. No entrance fee. Small parking area.",
          "This \"walk\" was extremely disappointing. The route through the landscape was only a few hundred meters and not spectacular at all. The rest of the route goes through some villages and busy streets with no pedestrian space. \nForget the ridge \u2026",
          "Amazing walk not far from the central of Ubud. It's an awesome place for a stroll in the morning before it gets too hot. It is a relatively easy walk overing unbeatable vista of the valleys and local lives in the area. I would recommend a \u2026",
          "Very picturesque. nice walk overlooking a nice stream and then proceeding up great views. can be very hot so bring water and a hat if you plan to walk the full way",
          "The walk is about 1.8km, after which you can turn around and walk the same route back. If you're not used to any nature you might be impressed but we were not so much. If you're in the neighbourhood and have 1 or 2 hrs left to kill it's a decent activity.",
          "Lovely peaceful walk away from the hustle and bustle of Ubud. Nice to see a few bins for litter, but they need to be emptied regularly. Some lovely warungs to have drinks and eats looking over rice fields",
          "Nice walk. Not advisable to do it now day. Early morning or later afternoon. No shade.",
          "Nice walk in the nature. But don't go there between 10am and 3pm or you will burn as there's very few places to hide from the sun. At the end there are nice cafes where you can get great coffee with a great view.",
          "It\u2019s a nice activity if you want to enjoy walking outdoors in Ubud without sweating profusely, but you must go before 8am for this. I arrived at 6.15am and spent just over an hour there. People have mentioned vehicles - if you start at Ubud \u2026",
          "a good place for enjoying the nature of ubud.\nyou need to litte tracking to reach this place.\nno entry fee. but need to be polite. very hot in the day because less of tree. you can choose morning or afternon. worth it to see the nature green. it also use as jogging track",
          "Short and beautiful walk. Take a drone if you have one, perfect spot to film :).",

          "For taking a stroll or jog",

          "Nice hiking route that ends with unexpected guest houses area",
          "Well worth getting up early morning and going for a stroll along the ridge. Breakfast is one of many cafes and walk back is a lovely morning exercise.",
          "As far as walks go, it was pretty good. Not the best walk I've ever been on, but a decent walk. There was beer to be found at the end.",
          "Beautiful scenery and great exercise trail. Busy with people, we went an hour before sunset so it was much cooler. Not too difficult, has ups and downs so if you aren't in shape it could be a bit of a challenge. Best to go when it's not too hot / sunny as there's not much shade.",
          "peaceful beautiful place. i recommend you skip it if you're short on time in Ubud but if you have a 2 or 3 hours to spare then it is definitely worth this stroll",
          "Fresh air with naturally scene, I feel the peace valley sound",
          "The walk is around 2km and it took us less than 30 mins to complete. The view was beautiful. Go when the weather is good.",
          "Easy but enjoyable walk. We did it early morning before any crowds which was great",
          "It was a nice parh, a chance to leave behind the people and the town for a little while. Nice rice fields, lots of bars to have a drink and stay. A good route for a run as well!",
          "Nothing special.  If u like to take walks, than this is for u.  Nothing special along the trail",
          "Nice nature trail in the heart of Ubud. A nice place to admire beautiful sunsets and stroll around",
          "Beautiful place but at entrance from the main road there is no indication. You must forget the path if you follow the Google map. Don't go down stairs from the main road's bridge toward the river. It will be serious for you. Maximum \u2026",
          "Very nice walk in the nature! It's always busy so be aware when you go.",

          "It was a nice getaway from the busy-ness of Ubud along the valley but it was a bit too hot to walk under the scorching Sun in the afternoon. A little cafes and a few hide away spots along the road were a relief and pretty cute too.",
          "Not much to see, just a road with nothing but grass and minimal scenery. Walking through this felt like torture in the heat and humidity. Not pleasant at all, plus the cafes near the end of the road has no AC at all.",

          "Beautiful walk. Recommend evening",
          "I personally didn't find it that \"attractive\". I would rather recommend walking on the parallel track to the Orange Warung. Here you will walk along rice padies and meet several locals on the way.",
          "This was you enter from Ubud. IT was quite crowded and you have to use the same way back If you don't like to circle back along the road side which I did. But I would't recommend it because of the Traffic (scouters+cars). You share the same space so you have to bei careful.",

          "It was a beautiful walk, but do bring plenty of water and a hat.",
          "It was a great and peaceful walk I took alone and it was really safe. Maybe a bit touristic but as in every place in Bali after 40 minutes you reach the rices fields which are beautiful especially on the sunset. It's quite difficult to find the \"start\", but it can be a positive thing since it's more difficult for tourists to find.",

          "Amazing hike between the green fields \nWith amazing view.\n\nThe path is easy and well prepared \nYou don\u2019t need any kind of guides, just go and enjoy.\n\nAfter around 2.5 km you will start seeing the rice fields and the farmers working there. \u2026",
          "It's a must stop for people visiting Ubud..\nIt is not too far from the main Ubud market.. It comes on the same direction after Monkey forest.\n- The entrance is quite confusing.. A small Lane is there close to one clinic and hotel at the \u2026",

          "Wear sturdy shoes or trainers. The scenery is amazing and for the first 10 minutes or so the sound of the waterways, on either side, can be heard. Rice paddy fields can be seen and the lush foliage along the way. There are a few cafes, galleries and some temples. Well worth the effort but set off early, you may catch the Sunrise.",
          "It was a nice easy walk. Did not find the view as good as I expected and it was hard to find the start of the walk. Continue through the village to a warung with huts over water. Try the pizza . It's great",

          "Good for a bit of exercise but quite busy and you aren't exactly walking into the wilderness but great for a 1hr stroll to break a bit of sweat",
          "Only walked 4 kilometres from the temple as we had to return, the track consist of two sections, the first is paved foot traffic only about 2k then the rest is mixed car foot, plenty of places to stop for drinks or food went in the afternoon nice walk if you like that sort of thing.",
          "Average, its not a 'pristine' nature walk as all the guides say. Could easily have given it a miss. Definitely recommend going early in the morning or late afternoon, better lighting, cooler and not too hot. Only really one part that has \u2026",

          "This hiking trail is amazing.. the route is not  far away. it's probably 2 or 3 km and  the view is worth to see. You need to bring the water and proper shoes to walk there. But don't worry you can find some cafe or small resto along the way.",
          "The Campuhan Ridge walk is definitely a beautiful walk which is filled with greenery and hills. More of a jungle or forest walk. This beautiful paved walk along the Campuhan Ridge showcases the natural side to Ubud. There are rice fields \u2026",
          "Nice walk, enjoyed the scenery, relay on karsa cafe before turning back.",
          "Not overly impressed, yes we went at the hottest time of the day which isn't wise but really I am not sure if it is work it.\nI would rather have spent my time looking at other locations.",
          "Nice chilled walk on the edge of ubud - free and cafes at the end.. Very pleasant",
          "took 1 hour. Lots of people, especially in the afternoon. It's a gentle walk, not really a hike.  Very scenic though.  It is not a loop, you have to turn around and go back at the end.",
          "Good place to see green spaces and to walk around .",

          "Lovely walk and all paved so quite easy to manage for walkers - perhaps not as breath taking as I was expecting. Early morning would be the best time for light, views and less foot traffic",
          "A nice walk. Worth a visit at least once. Definitely agree with the other reviewers who have said to start off early, because it does get hot. But I also found there was a nice mix of sun and shade.",
          "Just a normal walking path with some good views. Good thing is it's free. There is also a stream where you can take bath. The swing was being installed. It would give a super view.",
          "rice fields and artist's shops. Walking in the fields on a  comfortable road with abundant chance to eat or drink . Bit busy in my opinion .",
          "Was a lovely hike .. takes about 3 hours to complete one circle.\n\nFirst half of hike is great as it's only walk way without vehicles, but the other half is normal road with cars and bikes moving on the street though you can see rice field \u2026"

        "wiki": "Bali () is a province of Indonesia and the westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. Located east of Java and west of Lombok, the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan. The provincial capital, Denpasar, is the most populous city in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia. Bali is the only Hindu-majority province in Indonesia, with 83.5% of the population adhering to Balinese Hinduism.Bali is Indonesia's main tourist destination, with a significant rise in tourism since the 1980s. Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its economy. It is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. The Indonesian International Film Festival is held every year in Bali. Other international events held in Bali include the Miss World 2013 and 2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. In March 2017, TripAdvisor named Bali as the world's top destination in its Traveller's Choice award.Bali is part of the Coral Triangle, the area with the highest biodiversity of marine species especially fish and turtles. In this area alone, over 500 reef-building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about seven times as many as in the entire Caribbean. Bali is the home of the Subak irrigation system, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is also home to a unified confederation of kingdoms composed of 10 traditional royal Balinese houses, each house ruling a specific geographic area. The confederation is the successor of the Bali Kingdom. The royal houses are not recognised by the government of Indonesia; however, they originated before Dutch colonisation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient ===\nBali was inhabited around 2000 BCE by Austronesian people who migrated originally from the island of Taiwan to Southeast Asia and Oceania through Maritime Southeast Asia. Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are closely related to the people of the Indonesian archipelago, Malaysia, the Philippines and Oceania. Stone tools dating from this time have been found near the village of Cekik in the island's west.In ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, namely Pasupata, Bhairawa, Siwa Shidanta, Vaishnava, Bodha, Brahma, Resi, Sora and Ganapatya. Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal Godhead.Inscriptions from 896 and 911 do not mention a king, until 914, when Sri Kesarivarma is mentioned. They also reveal an independent Bali, with a distinct dialect, where Buddhism and Sivaism were practised simultaneously. Mpu Sindok's great-granddaughter, Mahendradatta (Gunapriyadharmapatni), married the Bali king Udayana Warmadewa (Dharmodayanavarmadeva) around 989, giving birth to Airlangga around 1001. This marriage also brought more Hinduism and Javanese culture to Bali. Princess Sakalendukirana appeared in 1098. Suradhipa reigned from 1115 to 1119, and Jayasakti from 1146 until 1150. Jayapangus appears on inscriptions between 1178 and 1181, while Adikuntiketana and his son Paramesvara in 1204.\n\nBalinese culture was strongly influenced by Indian, Chinese, and particularly Hindu culture, beginning around the 1st century AD. The name Bali dwipa (\"Bali island\") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by Sri Kesari Warmadewa in 914 AD and mentioning Walidwipa. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system subak to grow rice in wet-field cultivation. Some religious and cultural traditions still practised today can be traced to this period.\nThe Hindu Majapahit Empire (1293\u20131520 AD) on eastern Java founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of Hayam Wuruk is mentioned in the charters of 1384\u201386. Mass Javanese immigration to Bali occurred in the next century when the Majapahit Empire fell in 1520. Bali's government then became an independent collection of Hindu kingdoms which led to a Balinese national identity and major enhancements in culture, arts, and economy. The nation with various kingdoms became independent for up to 386 years until 1906, when the Dutch subjugated and repulsed the natives for economic control and took it over.\n\n\n=== Portuguese contacts ===\nThe first known European contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1512, when a Portuguese expedition led by Antonio Abreu and Francisco Serr\u00e3o sighted its northern shores. It was the first expedition of a series of bi-annual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century usually travelled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands. Bali was also mapped in 1512, in the chart of Francisco Rodrigues, aboard the expedition. In 1585, a ship foundered off the Bukit Peninsula and left a few Portuguese in the service of Dewa Agung.\n\n\n=== Dutch East Indies ===\n\nIn 1597, the Dutch explorer Cornelis de Houtman arrived at Bali, and the Dutch East India Company was established in 1602. The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century (see Dutch East Indies). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various competing for Balinese realms against each other. In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.\nIn June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at Buleleng on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his Wallace Line theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and Lombok. It is a boundary between species. In his travel memoir The Malay Archipelago, Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, of which has a strong mention of the unique Balinese irrigation methods:\n\nI was both astonished and delighted; for as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly undulating plain extends from the seacoast about ten or twelve miles (16 or 19 kilometres) inland, where it is bounded by a fine range of wooded and cultivated hills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of coconut palms, tamarind and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every direction; while between them extend luxurious rice-grounds, watered by an elaborate system of irrigation that would be the pride of the best-cultivated parts of Europe. \nThe Dutch mounted large naval and ground assaults at the Sanur region in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who rather than yield to the superior Dutch force committed ritual suicide (puputan) to avoid the humiliation of surrender. Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 200 Balinese killed themselves rather than surrender. In the Dutch intervention in Bali, a similar mass suicide occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in Klungkung. Afterwards, the Dutch governours exercised administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and Maluku.\nIn the 1930s, anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, artists Miguel Covarrubias and Walter Spies, and musicologist Colin McPhee all spent time here. Their accounts of the island and its peoples created a western image of Bali as \"an enchanted land of aesthetes at peace with themselves and nature\". Western tourists began to visit the island. The sensuous image of Bali was enhanced in the West by a quasi-pornographic 1932 documentary Virgins of Bali about a day in the lives of two teenage Balinese girls whom the film's narrator Deane Dickason notes in the first scene \"bathe their shamelessly nude bronze bodies\". Under the looser version of the Hays code that existed up to 1934, nudity involving \"civilised\" (i.e. white) women was banned, but permitted with \"uncivilised\" (i.e. all non-white women), a loophole that was exploited by the producers of Virgins of Bali. The film, which mostly consisted of scenes of topless Balinese women was a great success in 1932, and almost single-handedly made Bali into a popular spot for tourists.\n\nImperial Japan occupied Bali during World War II. It was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on Borneo were inoperative due to heavy rains, the Imperial Japanese Army decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps Prajoda (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942, the Japanese forces landed near the town of Sanoer [Sanur]. The island was quickly captured.During the Japanese occupation, a Balinese military officer, Gusti Ngurah Rai, formed a Balinese 'freedom army'. The harshness of Japanese occupation forces made them more resented than the Dutch colonial rulers.\n\n\n=== Independence from the Dutch ===\nIn 1945, Bali was liberated by the British and Indian 5th infantry Division under the command of Major-General Robert Mansergh who took the Japanese surrender. Once the Japanese forces had been repatriated the island was handed over to the Dutch the following year.\nIn 1946, the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed State of East Indonesia, a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia, which was proclaimed and headed by Sukarno and Hatta. Bali was included in the \"Republic of the United States of Indonesia\" when the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence on 29 December 1949. The first governor of Bali, Anak Agung Bagus Suteja, was appointed by President Sukarno in 1958, when Bali became a province.\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\nThe 1963 eruption of Mount Agung killed thousands, created economic havoc and forced many displaced Balinese to be transmigrated to other parts of Indonesia. Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional caste system, and those rejecting this system. Politically, the opposition was represented by supporters of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further increased by the PKI's land reform programs. An attempted coup in Jakarta was put down by forces led by General Suharto.\nThe army became the dominant power as it instigated a violent anti-communist purge, in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup. Most estimates suggest that at least 500,000 people were killed across Indonesia, with an estimated 80,000 killed in Bali, equivalent to 5% of the island's population. With no Islamic forces involved as in Java and Sumatra, upper-caste PNI landlords led the extermination of PKI members.As a result of the 1965\u201366 upheavals, Suharto was able to manoeuvre Sukarno out of the presidency. His \"New Order\" government reestablished relations with western countries. The pre-War Bali as \"paradise\" was revived in a modern form. The resulting large growth in tourism has led to a dramatic increase in Balinese standards of living and significant foreign exchange earned for the country. A bombing in 2002 by militant Islamists in the tourist area of Kuta killed 202 people, mostly foreigners. This attack, and another in 2005, severely reduced tourism, producing much economic hardship to the island.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe island of Bali lies 3.2 km (2.0 mi) east of Java, and is approximately 8 degrees south of the equator. Bali and Java are separated by the Bali Strait. East to west, the island is approximately 153 km (95 mi) wide and spans approximately 112 km (70 mi) north to south; administratively it covers 5,780 km2 (2,230 sq mi), or 5,577 km2 (2,153 sq mi) without Nusa Penida District; its population density is roughly 750 people/km2 (1,900 people/sq mi).\nBali's central mountains include several peaks over 2,000 metres (6,600 feet) in elevation and active volcanoes such as Mount Batur. The highest is Mount Agung (3,031 m, 9,944 ft), known as the \"mother mountain\", which is an active volcano rated as one of the world's most likely sites for a massive eruption within the next 100 years. In late 2017 Mount Agung started erupting and large numbers of people were evacuated, temporarily closing the island's airport. Mountains range from centre to the eastern side, with Mount Agung the easternmost peak. Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector. South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee-producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle. The longest river, Ayung River, flows approximately 75 km (47 mi) (see List of rivers of Bali).\nThe island is surrounded by coral reefs. Beaches in the south tend to have white sand while those in the north and west have black sand. Bali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small sampan boats. Black sand beaches between Pasut and Klatingdukuh are being developed for tourism, but apart from the seaside temple of Tanah Lot, they are not yet used for significant tourism.\nThe largest city is the provincial capital, Denpasar, near the southern coast. Its population is around 491,500 (2002). Bali's second-largest city is the old colonial capital, Singaraja, which is located on the north coast and is home to around 100,000 people. Other important cities include the beach resort, Kuta, which is practically part of Denpasar's urban area, and Ubud, situated at the north of Denpasar, is the island's cultural centre.Three small islands lie to the immediate south-east and all are administratively part of the Klungkung regency of Bali: Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan. These islands are separated from Bali by the Badung Strait.\nTo the east, the Lombok Strait separates Bali from Lombok and marks the biogeographical division between the fauna of the Indomalayan realm and the distinctly different fauna of Australasia. The transition is known as the Wallace Line, named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who first proposed a transition zone between these two major biomes. When sea levels dropped during the Pleistocene ice age, Bali was connected to Java and Sumatra and to the mainland of Asia and shared the Asian fauna, but the deep water of the Lombok Strait continued to keep Lombok Island and the Lesser Sunda archipelago isolated.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBeing just 8 degrees south of the equator, Bali has a fairly even climate all year round. Average year-round temperature stands at around 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) with a humidity level of about 85%.Day time temperatures at low elevations vary between 20 to 33 \u00b0C (68 to 91 \u00b0F), but the temperatures decrease significantly with increasing elevation.\nThe west monsoon is in place from approximately October to April, and this can bring significant rain, particularly from December to March. During the rainy season, there are comparatively fewer tourists seen in Bali. During the Easter and Christmas holidays, the weather is very unpredictable. Outside of the monsoon period, humidity is relatively low and any rain is unlikely in lowland areas.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nBali lies just to the west of the Wallace Line, and thus has a fauna that is Asian in character, with very little Australasian influence, and has more in common with Java than with Lombok. An exception is the yellow-crested cockatoo, a member of a primarily Australasian family. There are around 280 species of birds, including the critically endangered Bali myna, which is endemic. Others include barn swallow, black-naped oriole, black racket-tailed treepie, crested serpent-eagle, crested treeswift, dollarbird, Java sparrow, lesser adjutant, long-tailed shrike, milky stork, Pacific swallow, red-rumped swallow, sacred kingfisher, sea eagle, woodswallow, savanna nightjar, stork-billed kingfisher, yellow-vented bulbul and great egret.\nUntil the early 20th century, Bali was home to several large mammals: the wild banteng, leopard and the endemic Bali tiger. The banteng still occurs in its domestic form, whereas leopards are found only in neighbouring Java, and the Bali tiger is extinct. The last definite record of a tiger on Bali dates from 1937, when one was shot, though the subspecies may have survived until the 1940s or 1950s.\n\nSquirrels are quite commonly encountered, less often is the Asian palm civet, which is also kept in coffee farms to produce kopi luwak. Bats are well represented, perhaps the most famous place to encounter them remaining is the Goa Lawah (Temple of the Bats) where they are worshipped by the locals and also constitute a tourist attraction. They also occur in other cave temples, for instance at Gangga Beach. Two species of monkey occur. The crab-eating macaque, known locally as \"kera\", is quite common around human settlements and temples, where it becomes accustomed to being fed by humans, particularly in any of the three \"monkey forest\" temples, such as the popular one in the Ubud area. They are also quite often kept as pets by locals. The second monkey, endemic to Java and some surrounding islands such as Bali, is far rarer and more elusive and is the Javan langur, locally known as \"lutung\". They occur in a few places apart from the West Bali National Park. They are born an orange colour, though by their first year they would have already changed to a more blackish colouration. In Java, however, there is more of a tendency for this species to retain its juvenile orange colour into adulthood, and a mixture of black and orange monkeys can be seen together as a family. Other rarer mammals include the leopard cat, Sunda pangolin and black giant squirrel.\nSnakes include the king cobra and reticulated python. The water monitor can grow to at least 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in length and 50 kg (110 lb) and can move quickly.\nThe rich coral reefs around the coast, particularly around popular diving spots such as Tulamben, Amed, Menjangan or neighbouring Nusa Penida, host a wide range of marine life, for instance hawksbill turtle, giant sunfish, giant manta ray, giant moray eel, bumphead parrotfish, hammerhead shark, reef shark, barracuda, and sea snakes. Dolphins are commonly encountered on the north coast near Singaraja and Lovina.A team of scientists conducted a survey from 29 April 2011 to 11 May 2011 at 33 sea sites around Bali. They discovered 952 species of reef fish of which 8 were new discoveries at Pemuteran, Gilimanuk, Nusa Dua, Tulamben and Candidasa, and 393 coral species, including two new ones at Padangbai and between Padangbai and Amed. The average coverage level of healthy coral was 36% (better than in Raja Ampat and Halmahera by 29% or in Fakfak and Kaimana by 25%) with the highest coverage found in Gili Selang and Gili Mimpang in Candidasa, Karangasem regency.Among the larger trees the most common are: banyan trees, jackfruit, coconuts, bamboo species, acacia trees and also endless rows of coconuts and banana species. Numerous flowers can be seen: hibiscus, frangipani, bougainvillea, poinsettia, oleander, jasmine, water lily, lotus, roses, begonias, orchids and hydrangeas exist. On higher grounds that receive more moisture, for instance around Kintamani, certain species of fern trees, mushrooms and even pine trees thrive well. Rice comes in many varieties. Other plants with agricultural value include: salak, mangosteen, corn, kintamani orange, coffee and water spinach.\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\nOver-exploitation by the tourist industry has led to 200 out of 400 rivers on the island dry up. Research suggests that the southern part of Bali would face a water shortage. To ease the shortage, the central government plans to build a water catchment and processing facility at Petanu River in Gianyar. The 300 litres capacity of water per second will be channelled to Denpasar, Badung and Gianyar in 2013.A 2010 Environment Ministry report on its environmental quality index gave Bali a score of 99.65, which was the highest score of Indonesia's 33 provinces. The score considers the level of total suspended solids, dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand in water.Erosion at Lebih Beach has seen seven metres (23 feet) of land lost every year. Decades ago, this beach was used for holy pilgrimages with more than 10,000 people, but they have now moved to Masceti Beach.In 2017, a year when Bali received nearly 5.7 million tourists, government officials declared a \u201cgarbage emergency\u201d in response to the covering of 3.6 mile stretch of coastline in plastic waste brought in by the tide, amid concerns that the pollution could dissuade visitors from returning. Indonesia is one of the world's worst plastic polluters, with some estimates suggesting the country is the source of around 10 per cent of the world's plastic waste. Indonesia's capital city Jakarta features several large rubbish dumps and it is common to see swaths of plastics bobbing on the city's few waterways.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe province is divided into eight regencies (kabupaten) and one city (kota). These are, with their areas and populations:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nIn 1970s, the Balinese economy was largely agriculture-based in terms of both output and employment. Tourism is now the largest single industry in terms of income, and as a result, Bali is one of Indonesia's wealthiest regions. In 2003, around 80% of Bali's economy was tourism related. By end of June 2011, the rate of non-performing loans of all banks in Bali were 2.23%, lower than the average of Indonesian banking industry non-performing loan rates (about 5%). The economy, however, suffered significantly as a result of the Islamists' terrorist bombings in 2002 and 2005. The tourism industry has since recovered from these events.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nAlthough tourism produces the GDP's largest output, agriculture is still the island's biggest employer. Fishing also provides a significant number of jobs. Bali is also famous for its artisans who produce a vast array of handicrafts, including batik and ikat cloth and clothing, wooden carvings, stone carvings, painted art and silverware. Notably, individual villages typically adopt a single product, such as wind chimes or wooden furniture.\nThe Arabica coffee production region is the highland region of Kintamani near Mount Batur. Generally, Balinese coffee is processed using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency. Typical flavours include lemon and other citrus notes. Many coffee farmers in Kintamani are members of a traditional farming system called Subak Abian, which is based on the Hindu philosophy of \"Tri Hita Karana\". According to this philosophy, the three causes of happiness are good relations with God, other people, and the environment. The Subak Abian system is ideally suited to the production of fair trade and organic coffee production. Arabica coffee from Kintamani is the first product in Indonesia to request a geographical indication.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nIn 1963 the Bali Beach Hotel in Sanur was built by Sukarno and boosted tourism in Bali. Before the construction of the Bali Beach Hotel, there were only three significant tourist-class hotels on the island. Construction of hotels and restaurants began to spread throughout Bali. Tourism further increased on Bali after the Ngurah Rai International Airport opened in 1970. The Buleleng regency government encouraged the tourism sector as one of the mainstays for economic progress and social welfare.\nThe tourism industry is primarily focused in the south, while also significant in the other parts of the island. The main tourist locations are the town of Kuta (with its beach), and its outer suburbs of Legian and Seminyak (which were once independent townships), the east coast town of Sanur (once the only tourist hub), Ubud towards the centre of the island, to the south of the Ngurah Rai International Airport, Jimbaran and the newer developments of Nusa Dua and Pecatu.\nThe United States government lifted its travel warnings in 2008. The Australian government issued an advisory on Friday, 4 May 2012, with the overall level of this advisory lowered to 'Exercise a high degree of caution'. The Swedish government issued a new warning on Sunday, 10 June 2012 because of one tourist who died from methanol poisoning. Australia last issued an advisory on Monday, 5 January 2015 due to new terrorist threats.\n\nAn offshoot of tourism is the growing real estate industry. Bali's real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5-star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the south side of the island. Expensive villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic, many Jakarta individuals and companies are fairly active, investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.\nIn the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors improved value for their currencies.\nBali's tourism economy survived the Islamists terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has slowly recovered and surpassed its pre terrorist bombing levels; the longterm trend has been a steady increase of visitor arrivals. In 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists, which surpassed the target of 2.0\u20132.3 million tourists. The average occupancy of starred hotels achieved 65%, so the island still should be able to accommodate tourists for some years without any addition of new rooms/hotels, although at the peak season some of them are fully booked.\nBali received the Best Island award from Travel and Leisure in 2010. Bali won because of its attractive surroundings (both mountain and coastal areas), diverse tourist attractions, excellent international and local restaurants, and the friendliness of the local people. The Balinese culture and its religion are also considered as the main factor of the award. One of the most prestigious events that symbolize a strong relationship between a god and its followers is Kecak dance. According to BBC Travel released in 2011, Bali is one of the World's Best Islands, ranking second after Santorini, Greece.In 2006, Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir Eat, Pray, Love was published, and in August 2010 it was adapted into the film Eat Pray Love. It took place at Ubud and Padang-Padang Beach at Bali. Both the book and the film fuelled a boom in tourism in Ubud, the hill town and cultural and tourist centre that was the focus of Gilbert's quest for balance and love through traditional spirituality and healing.In January 2016, after musician David Bowie died, it was revealed that in his will, Bowie asked for his ashes to be scattered in Bali, conforming to Buddhist rituals. He had visited and performed in several Southeast Asian cities early in his career, including Bangkok and Singapore.Since 2011, China has displaced Japan as the second-largest supplier of tourists to Bali, while Australia still tops the list while India has also emerged as a greater supply of tourists. \nChinese tourists increased by 17% from last year due to the impact of ACFTA and new direct flights to Bali.\nIn January 2012, Chinese tourists increased by 222.18% compared to January 2011, while Japanese tourists declined by 23.54% year on year.Bali authorities reported the island had 2.88 million foreign tourists and 5 million domestic tourists in 2012, marginally surpassing the expectations of 2.8 million foreign tourists.Based on a Bank Indonesia survey in May 2013, 34.39 per cent of tourists are upper-middle class, spending between $1,286 to $5,592, and are dominated by Australia, India, France, China, Germany and the UK. Some Chinese tourists have increased their levels of spending from previous years. 30.26 percent of tourists are middle class, spending between $662 to $1,285. In 2017 it was expected that Chinese tourists would outnumber Australian tourists.\nIn January 2020, 10,000 Chinese tourists canceled trips to Bali due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe Ngurah Rai International Airport is located near Jimbaran, on the isthmus at the southernmost part of the island. Lt. Col. Wisnu Airfield is on the north-west Bali.\nA coastal road circles the island, and three major two-lane arteries cross the central mountains at passes reaching to 1,750 m in height (at Penelokan). The Ngurah Rai Bypass is a four-lane expressway that partly encircles Denpasar. Bali has no railway lines.\nIn December 2010 the Government of Indonesia invited investors to build a new Tanah Ampo Cruise Terminal at Karangasem, Bali with a projected worth of $30 million. On 17 July 2011 the first cruise ship (Sun Princess) anchored about 400 metres (1,300 feet) away from the wharf of Tanah Ampo harbour. The current pier is only 154 metres (505 feet) but will eventually be extended to 300 to 350 metres (980\u20131,150 feet) to accommodate international cruise ships. The harbour is safer than the existing facility at Benoa and has a scenic backdrop of east Bali mountains and green rice fields. The tender for improvement was subject to delays, and as of July 2013 the situation was unclear with cruise line operators complaining and even refusing to use the existing facility at Tanah Ampo.\n\nA Memorandum of Understanding has been signed by two ministers, Bali's Governor and Indonesian Train Company to build 565 kilometres (351 miles) of railway along the coast around the island. As of July 2015, no details of this proposed railways have been released. In 2019 it was reported in Gapura Bali that Wayan Koster, governor of Bali, \"is keen to improve Bali's transportation infrastructure and is considering plans to build an electric rail network across the island\".On 16 March 2011 (Tanjung) Benoa port received the \"Best Port Welcome 2010\" award from London's \"Dream World Cruise Destination\" magazine. Government plans to expand the role of Benoa port as export-import port to boost Bali's trade and industry sector. In 2013, The Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry advised that 306 cruise liners were scheduled visit Indonesia, an increase of 43 per cent compared to the previous year.In May 2011, an integrated Aerial Traffic Control System (ATCS) was implemented to reduce traffic jams at four crossing points: Ngurah Rai statue, Dewa Ruci Kuta crossing, Jimbaran crossing and Sanur crossing. ATCS is an integrated system connecting all traffic lights, CCTVs and other traffic signals with a monitoring office at the police headquarters. It has successfully been implemented in other ASEAN countries and will be implemented at other crossings in Bali.On 21 December 2011 construction started on the Nusa Dua-Benoa-Ngurah Rai International Airport toll road which will also provide a special lane for motorcycles. This has been done by seven state-owned enterprises led by PT Jasa Marga with 60% of shares. PT Jasa Marga Bali Tol will construct the 9.91-kilometre-long (6.16-mile) toll road (totally 12.7 kilometres (7.89 miles) with access road). The construction is estimated to cost Rp.2.49 trillion ($273.9 million). The project goes through 2 kilometres (1 mile) of mangrove forest and through 2.3 kilometres (1.4 miles) of beach, both within 5.4 hectares (13 acres) area. The elevated toll road is built over the mangrove forest on 18,000 concrete pillars which occupied 2 hectares of mangroves forest. This was compensated by the planting of 300,000 mangrove trees along the road. On 21 December 2011 the Dewa Ruci 450-metre (1,480-foot) underpass has also started on the busy Dewa Ruci junction near Bali Kuta Galeria with an estimated cost of Rp136 billion ($14.9 million) from the state budget. On 23 September 2013, the Bali Mandara Toll Road was opened, with the Dewa Ruci Junction (Simpang Siur) underpass being opened previously.To solve chronic traffic problems, the province will also build a toll road connecting Serangan with Tohpati, a toll road connecting Kuta, Denpasar and Tohpati and a flyover connecting Kuta and Ngurah Rai Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Bali was 3,890,757 as of the 2010 Census, and 4,148,588 at the 2015 Intermediate Census; the latest estimate (for mid 2019) is 4,362,000. There are an estimated 30,000 expatriates living in Bali.\n\n\n=== Ethnic origins ===\nA DNA study in 2005 by Karafet et al. found that 12% of Balinese Y-chromosomes are of likely Indian origin, while 84% are of likely Austronesian origin, and 2% of likely Melanesian origin.\n\n\n=== Caste system ===\n\nPre-modern Bali had four castes, as Jeff Lewis and Belinda Lewis state, but with a \"very strong tradition of communal decision-making and interdependence\". The four castes have been classified as Soedra (Shudra), Wesia (Vaishyas), Satrias (Kshatriyas) and Brahmana (Brahmin).The 19th-century scholars such as Crawfurd and Friederich suggested that the Balinese caste system had Indian origins, but Helen Creese states that scholars such as Brumund who had visited and stayed on the island of Bali suggested that his field observations conflicted with the \"received understandings concerning its Indian origins\". In Bali, the Shudra (locally spelt Soedra) have typically been the temple priests, though depending on the demographics, a temple priest may also be from the other three castes. In most regions, it has been the Shudra who typically make offerings to the gods on behalf of the Hindu devotees, chant prayers, recite meweda (Vedas), and set the course of Balinese temple festivals.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nUnlike most of Muslim-majority Indonesia, about 83.5% of Bali's population adheres to Balinese Hinduism, formed as a combination of existing local beliefs and Hindu influences from mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia. Minority religions include Islam (13.37%), Christianity (2.47%), and Buddhism (0.5%).The general beliefs and practices of Agama Hindu Dharma mix ancient traditions and contemporary pressures placed by Indonesian laws that permit only monotheist belief under the national ideology of panca sila. Traditionally, Hinduism in Indonesia had a pantheon of deities and that tradition of belief continues in practice; further, Hinduism in Indonesia granted freedom and flexibility to Hindus as to when, how and where to pray. However, officially, Indonesian government considers and advertises Indonesian Hinduism as a monotheistic religion with certain officially recognised beliefs that comply with its national ideology. Indonesian school text books describe Hinduism as having one supreme being, Hindus offering three daily mandatory prayers, and Hinduism as having certain common beliefs that in part parallel those of Islam. Scholars contest whether these Indonesian government recognised and assigned beliefs reflect the traditional beliefs and practices of Hindus in Indonesia before Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule.\nBalinese Hinduism has roots in Indian Hinduism and Buddhism, that arrived through Java. Hindu influences reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as the first century. Historical evidence is unclear about the diffusion process of cultural and spiritual ideas from India. Java legends refer to Saka-era, traced to 78 AD. Stories from the Mahabharata Epic have been traced in Indonesian islands to the 1st century; however, the versions mirror those found in southeast Indian peninsular region (now Tamil Nadu and southern Karnataka Andhra Pradesh).The Bali tradition adopted the pre-existing animistic traditions of the indigenous people. This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.Apart from the majority of Balinese Hindus, there also exist Chinese immigrants whose traditions have melded with that of the locals. As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism but also find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's odalan. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese. Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nBalinese and Indonesian are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of Balinese people are bilingual or trilingual. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from Java, Lombok, Sumatra, and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the Balinese caste system and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. Kawi and Sanskrit are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.\nEnglish and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the tourism industry, as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as Japanese, Korean, French, Russian or German are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. Balinese cuisine is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as gamelan, is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the Ramayana but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous Balinese dances include pendet, legong, baris, topeng, barong, gong keybar, and kecak (the monkey dance). Bali boasts one of the most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world, with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private ceremonies, or public shows.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThroughout the year, there are a number of festivals celebrated locally or island-wide according to the traditional calendars.The Hindu New Year, Nyepi, is celebrated in the spring by a day of silence. On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of Ogoh-ogoh monsters are paraded and burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese pawukon calendrical system.\nCelebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), cremation or odalan (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of d\u00e9sa kala patra, which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context. Many of the ceremonial art forms such as wayang kulit and topeng are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation. Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ram\u00e9, is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more gamelan ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ram\u00e9.\n\nKaja and kelod are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to one's orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (kaja), and the sea (kelod). In addition to spatial orientation, kaja and kelod have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.Most temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest kaja. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as wali, the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where bebali ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called bali-balihan. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.Tourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of tourism is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the barong dance have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a barong mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.Balinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied. Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as customary law sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including \"kasepekang\", or shunning) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.Other than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents Bali Arts Festival to showcase Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have. It is held once a year, from the second week of June until the end of July. Southeast Asia's biggest annual festival of words and ideas Ubud Writers and Readers Festival is held at Ubud in October, which is participated by the world's most celebrated writers, artists, thinkers and performers.\n\n\n=== Beauty pageant ===\nBali was the host of Miss World 2013 (63rd edition of the Miss World pageant). It was the first time Indonesia hosted an international beauty pageant.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nBali is a major world surfing destination with popular breaks dotted across the southern coastline and around the offshore island of Nusa Lembongan.As part of the Coral Triangle, Bali, including Nusa Penida, offers a wide range of dive sites with varying types of reefs, and tropical aquatic life.\nBali was the host of 2008 Asian Beach Games. It was the second time Indonesia hosted an Asia-level multi-sport event, after Jakarta held the 1962 Asian Games.\nIn football, Bali is home to Bali United football club, which plays in Liga 1.\nThe team was relocated from Samarinda, East Kalimantan to Gianyar, Bali. Harbiansyah Hanafiah, the main commissioner of Bali United explained that he changed the name and moved the home base because there was no representative from Bali in the highest football tier in Indonesia. Another reason was due to local fans in Samarinda preferring to support Pusamania Borneo F.C. rather than Persisam.\n\n\n== Heritage sites ==\nIn June 2012, Subak, the irrigation system for paddy fields in Jatiluwih, central Bali was enlisted as a Natural UNESCO world heritage site.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBalinese Hinduism\nBalinese people\nCulture of Indonesia\nTourism in Indonesia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHaer, Debbie Guthrie; Morillot, Juliette & Toh, Irene (2001).

          "This place was ok but the entrance fee was quite high for Bali. There were a few birds that were good to see, but other than that, it is definitely not worth the time or money to go all the way there. I was very disappointed by the 4D show they had.",
          "Honestly it was a real highlight of the trip to Bali. Just outside the center of Ubud near the markets it's well worth going to. Lots of birds, great shows to watch and interesting to learn about the different species. Really worth your time and support.",
          "Expensive entry fee for a small park. I was disappointed with this visit. Several birds or \"exhibits \" were confined in small cages with some showing stress by repetitive behaviour. Also several aquatic fowl were displaying symptoms of angel wings! Not good!",
          "We went to Bali Bird Park in april 2019. We had our 7 year old child with us and she can't stop talking about this place. She loves all kind of animals but it is always the bird park she speaks about. It as so many up-close encounters with the birds that it was stunning. The",
          "Wow is all I can say. The bird park is accessible for prams and wheelchairs with minimal assistance for Wheelchair users. So many interactive activities and photo moments. Worth the admission price! The pro photos were reasonable and have a digital package available. Only",
          "We had an amazing visit. Staff were amazing and the birds seemed well looked after. Some of the aviaries were a little small (the owls and some others) and wing clipping was widely used but the aviaries were immaculate and the birds were obviously being looked after very well.",
          "Lovely bird part in immaculate surroundings. Good selection of birds and the walk though aviaries are amazing. You can get really close to the birds and some will sit on you if encouraged.",
          "My wife and I got our private driver to stop at the Bali Bird Park during our transfer from Seminyak to Ubud. Here are a few of my thoughts. PROS * The big difference between this bird park and others that I have been to both in Australia and abroad is the ability to get hands",
          "Amazing Bird Park with Lots of different types of Bird . Loved the show and took pictures with standing Bird on Hand. Took ticket from Klook which is much cheaper.",

          "A MUST SEE IN BALI! I work in a zoo, and care deeply about conservation and animal welfare. This is one of the my favourite animal parks that I have visited. Small but excellently laid out, and so well staffed for such a small institution! You can spend about 6 hours here",
          "We found the number of birds in small cages disappointing. The displays were fun but not much shade for watching. Too expensive for 1/2 activity \u00a315 per person approx.",
          "Visited this wonderful park in October. All the birds appeared in immaculate condition and well looked after. Aviaries for the most part were adequate. The walk in aviaries were great, and i loved interacting with the lori's.",
          "An expensive entry fee but a good 1/2 day activity. The Basic Instinct (birds of pray) show was good and it was good to hold some of the birds too. I\u2019m used to seeing birds with their wings clipped but to see birds in cages that are too small is very sad. Some of the birds",
          "Very hot and some birds not able to see or photo because to far away in their cages. Smaller kids will enjoy",
          "This was suggested off-hand by my driver and I wasn\u2019t 100% convinced, but I\u2019m always keen to see some animals. I was a bit put off by the IDR385K admission, but it was definitely worth it. The food at the cafe was good, and there were plenty of great photo opportunities with",
          "Totally loved our day here. Enjoyed the shows, beauitful surroundings, saw a komodo dragon eat a chicken & got the best photos. Kids loved feeding and holding birds. Lovely lunch and really nice souvenir shop. All staff friendly and informative. Very professionally done.",

          "I got a chance to visit it in low season which means it was less packed and more time with the birds. The birds are plenty and colorful. Most of them roam freely in the area so you can approach them and take picture. Surprisingly, they are not too afraid to human. On top of",
          "Even if one is not interested in birds, this park is an excellent destination. It was such a lovely environment with the chance to get close to many exotic, unique birds. The staff was lovely and attentive. The food in the restaurant was also quite good.",
          "Drove for an hour to get here and found out how expensive it was! Not worth the entry fee at all. Nice park very clean and lovely staff. Got some nice pics of the birds and waterfalls. The birds of prey show was great but all up they shouldn't be charging more than 250,000rp for",
          "The bird park is very nice, much better thank expected. It is definetly one of the highlights in Bali. Take your time to have a few shows. The entrance fee of 385k IDR per person is well above anything. I subtract one point with the tendency to subtract another one for this.",
          "The park itself was very nice, a lot of opportunities to take nice pictures with the birds. However, the entrance fee 385K is a bit too much, given the fact you spend there an hour.",
          "Really enjoyed the Bali Bird Park today. It is well set out and the shows are held on a regular basis. There is a great variety of birds, some free ranging. Try not to miss feeding the kimodo dragon on Tuesday. The staff were very friendly. Well worth visiting.",
          "Didn't have this one on the agenda. We were heading to Kuta from Ubud and our driver suggested we give it a try. Happy we did. Nice layout. Beautifully done. Much larger and more birds than expected. Couple photo ops with the kids and macaws/cockatoo. Huge walk through aviary.",
          "You really do have the opportunity to get up close with many personal encounters and the professional photographers will use your phone/camera for photos too! Time it for the birds of prey show which is outstanding and to enjoy lunch in the restaurant (great food And a show at",
          "There are a lot of birds that aren't caged which you can get very close and personal with. The birds are beautiful and the staff are very passionate about imparting their knowledge about them. Defiantly make sure you go into the walk through enclosure which has a big number of",

          "We visited Bali Bird Park from Sanur. We always try to check animals are properly cared for first and foremost and we\u2019re pleased to see lots of staff cleaning and caring for the animals when we arrived. We got to feed pelicans and lots of other birds directly and really enjoyed",
          "The entry is bit expensive (About 385000 Rs) but good number of birds esp local are kept. Many Amazon birds also available. One should go bit early. I reached at around 4.45 pm and was on about to close so have to run thru it.",
          "I went to the Bali bird park wondering if the admission fee would be worth it. The park is set in a lovely setting, well maintained and they have a very interesting collection of birds from different places. The food at the cafe was also very good.",
          "This place offers amazing collection of birds all over the world. You can feed them and have ample opportunity to take photos.",
          "Hard to know what to do with your limited time and money on a trip, but if you love birds like I do, don't skip this one. It's a little pricier than other Bali attractions, but in my opinion, worth it. I wish we had more time, but it was our last day with our guide, and we had",
          "What a beautiful place but just a bit too pricey. You get to hold birds on your way round. I got really scratched up by one but staff didn\u2019t seem to batter an eye lid. Beautiful gardens and lovely ice cream. Compared to other bird places we have been to this was ok. The shows",
          "This bird park has some amazing birds and they are noisy. In the centre there is a part which you enter and the birds are free and they sit on the hand rails and fly around, it is an awesome place to visit and I recommend it",
          "This was pretty pricey compared to other activities but sounded interesting based on other reviews. It was a good idea to go early. My kids got to start by feeding the pelicans, then fed the lorakeets, and saw all the shows. They loved every minute and the staff was all so",
          "OMG! I loved this place because I so love birds. You can see birds of all sizes, colors, shapes, personalities! Best part is you can get up close and personal with these beautiful creatures. The highlight is the large pelicans freely waltzing the entire park. These guys are",
          "O a previous trip to Bali we went to the zoo and didn't enjoy it. So I didn't have great expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. They have a great variety of birds, many of them roaming freely. We particularly enjoyed being able to have photos taken with birds on our shoulders",
          "We visited this park on the way to another attraction, and I'm glad we did - there was lots to look at and do here. The entry tickets were expensive for Bali, but can be made cheaper by doing a tour with other attractions. As always, please be careful when booking combined tours",
          "A lovely experiencd thoroughly enjoyed by parents as well as kids. The level of interactivity with birds was a lovely surprise. Staff knowledgeable and friendly. Only negative was the cost of everything \"extra\" on site. Cost of three small ice-creams for 3 $20 plus.",
          "This was a great experience for the entire family. The staff are very welcoming and engage young children very positively unlike the Bali Safari Park.",
          "We found the bird park very enjoyable today. The staff was very good we had lunch there and my wife said the fish tacos were some of the best she ever had. I had the spaghetti which was ok. We enjoyed the bird shows and how nice and clean the grounds were and the bird cages.",
          "Kids loved seeing the birds and walk thru aviaries. We didn't watch any of the shows and were there for 2 hours. The variety of birds is amazing and we had the opportunity to have photos taken with some of the birds. The boys loved the pelicans and found a bat in one area too.",
          "We had an amazing experience watching free birds around us and taking pictures with them. If you love the big and colorful parrots this place is a must !",
          "small but lovely, funny different bird shows there. u can take very nice pictures with the birds and pay no extra fee.",
          "A bit expensive, but kids will love the park. Beautiful animals and the parks is really stunning. The shows is amazing. And remember for every animal you wanne take a photo with you have to pay. This is a hole day trip, really a great place to visit and you can eat and drink",
          "Bali Bird park is not very big but it have wide variety of birds and they are kept and looked after very well. Kids would love this park as they can touch and interact with certain birds as they roam free.",
          "This was my first time here and I was very disappointed mainly because what we charged to enter at $38 AUS per Adult I did not think it merited that price i will not be returning at that price it may be possible to get cheaper through a tour company and be prepared for about",
          "A must see place, we had a great time and could not fault the area. Will visit again of our next trip.",

          "We came along with my 4 and 2 year old kids. I wasn\u2019t expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. The park appeared well-run, with clean and well kept birds. The animals appeared to be being treated ethically and all of the staff seemed generally interested. Much more so",
          "We went to the Bali Bird Park today and I was very surprised at how well the park and birds are maintained. It\u2019s always sad to see birds with clipped wings, especially birds such as macaws, however they looked in excellent health and were quite active. The food was absolutely",
          "Astounded at the variety of birds and the \u2018free range\u2019 of many species. The children had an amazing time feeding so many birds and interacting with them close up. The staff were so patient and friendly. Food at the park was good.",
          "Amazing environment with so many birds \u2018free range\u2019. Staff very friendly and happy to engage with birds and visitors. Well worth visiting.",
          "We have visited the Bird Park 3 times prior to this visit. We took our 90 year old Grandfather to experience for the first time. Unfortune timing as there was a group of approximately 40 school children on a class excursion so the tranqulity was lost in between excited screaming",
          "I nearly had a heart attack when they charged me IDR777,000 entrance fee for 2 people, but it was worth every cent!!! If you love nature, animals or birds, just go there. And watch all of their bird shows. We were there for 4 hours.",
          "Bali bird park is a must visit place in Bali. It will take minimum 3 hours in your itinerary. So many beautiful birds in natural atmosphere. Fully trained staff. Various amazing bird shows . Activities like holding and feeding birds at places. Restaurant and toilets available",

          "With a price close to almost 400K per person which shocked all of us (three of us) I was kinda ready to be slightly disappointed especially after I saw the map and the park seemed so small. Boy was I wrong. We had a fantastic time. In many ways it was like we were visiting the",
          "Visited the Bird Park today was very impressed. Most of the birds were in large aviaries or permitted to roam free in the park. There are on going displays and demonstrations to both educate you and keep you entertained. There is even a 4D theatre. We stayed for lunch and was",
          "A beautiful well laid out park with easy viewing. Dividing the birds into their countries of origin is a great idea.",
          "The Bali Bird Park is wonderful. We are birders and found that the birds were well cared for and the ones in the cages appear to be perfectly happy. The park is pristine and just beautiful to walk around. There were birds that were free to fly too. We enjoyed our trip to the",
          "Beautiful birds, some had small cages, but overall the birds looked well, but there was one bird from Colombia Who seemed srressed, banging on the Cage with it claws, trying to get out, when it moved down you could see that it had removed some vings probably do to stress and",
          "Really amazing experience. You find here variety of birds. Friendly staff. Cool pictures with birds. You can even kiss them if you want. Definitely worthy!",
          "The bird park is very beautiful however very small. The birds are well kept and taken care of from what it seemed like. Of course they are caged, but they are given ample room and the environment that they thrive in in the cages to help them feel as if they are in their",
          "We spent half a day here with our 11 yo son. The park is very well kept and the birds appear happy and healthy. The Birds of Prey show is amazing as is the parrot demonstration at the cafe. Well worth the cost of admission",
          "If you are - as my wife and i are - bird lovers, then this is the place to visit. They have several walk-thru aviaries which are excellent. Make sure you are there when the birds are being fed! My only grouse would be that the lunch that was included was basically burgers and",
          "Lots of birds which are all well cared for. Recommend getting there at 9.00 when the bird feeding starts. Kids able to hold lots of different birds. Show was great too. We will be returning next visit.",
          "We loved our visit to this amazing bird park. Having been to numerous bird parks in different countries this has to be one of the best. There is a lot of interaction available with the birds if you are interested but there's no pressure to buy. The birds are well looked after",

          "The park is very well run. The birds and their aviaries all looked in good clean condition. The staff was very helpful. The bird of prey display was well run in spite of a very small area to do it in. We were not told about entrance and lunch tickets. We had lunch and that was",
          "From the moment you enter the park colourful birds are everywhere. They are perched in trees waiting for photos. The winding paths take you past exotic birds and into a huge aviary. The bird show was interesting and fast paced. Birds swooping across the grass to land on",
          "Went to the Bali Bird Park expecting a normal zoo type bird park , What a surprise. The entire park if extremely clean and the birds well fed with spotless averies and water features throughout the park. Saw feeding show inside the huge avery and had ample time to see and",

          "It was a really good experience. We got to see amazing birds from all around the world. It will be even better if you are visiting with your children. The parrots and the Macau birds were interesting.",
          "This was a great park, with loads of different types of wonderful birds in it. You got to feed the birds if you were in a certain aviary in a certain time. We had the honour of feeding the lorikeets and they sat on our heads, arms, you name it whilst we fed them apple. It was a",
          "We were in Bali for over 3 months, and went to the Bird Park twice because once was not enough! It is a beautiful and tranquil location, with amazing exhibits and wonderful demonstrations of different bird species. It is awesome for the kids, but all the adults really enjoyed",
          "If you love birds this place is great. If you don\u2019t mind birds or are indifferent, it\u2019s pricey and small! The majority of our party enjoyed the park and the hands on activities available. I\u2019m not much of a bird lover so staring at cages was not my thing. I did enjoy feeding the",
          "This was an excursion from our ship that included the park admission, and a buffet dinner with the famous fire dance performance afterwards. The facility, food, service and entertainment was all first class. You will even get a chance to get a picture holding one of their",

          "Very informative place to find out the types of birds from many places. The birds look very well cared for, and the environment is very clean. Maybe later on children's playgrounds can be added in several locations. It's just lacking facilities for child strollers.",
          "We got there just as they opened, and we had the park to ourselves for the first 20 min, so good time to take photos with the birds. The whole park is just lovely, good size to walk around for a few hours, and all the different shows are worth watching and participating in.",

          "This is one of the most engrossing tours that I have done. The birds are beautiful and their interaction with the trainers is fascinating. There are lots of birds outdoors that you can get some really good photos, much harder for the birds in the cages. The shows are worth",
          "Much more than we expected. This is much more like a zoo than a bird park. Many chances to interact with the birds which all seemed well cared for. Lots of staff and all helpful and happy.",

          "The variety of birds that you see is most impressive. The quality of the grounds, the personnel, and the experience is even more impressive. You are able to get up close and personal with numbers of birds. Lots of fun. There is a Komodo Dragon there. We stayed for the",
          "This was a lovely thing to do whilst driving from the south of the island up to Ubud. Many of the birds are wild and you can get quite close to them - they seem quite used to this! The peacocks were very happy to give us a full display of their feathers. There really are some",

          "We spent the whole day here as there is so much to do. This park is very interactive with a well planned out schedule to keep you entertained for hours. The park is very clean and the bird cages are also well looked after. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. I\u2019d",
          "It took us about one hour to get from Seminyak to the Bali Bird Park. The park is a bit remote so it I would highly recommend you get a private taxi to take you there and wait. A 5 hour private taxi cost us $400K rupia (about $AU40). It costs $385K rupia per adult to get into",
          "A must if you are on family, especially with young children. Beautifully set up and lanscaped. Collection is decent, although more variety species is always welcome. Food was actually surprisingly good for amusement park standard, although female F & B staffs at both the kiosk",
          "What a fantastic park! Full of birds from many different parts of the world, a place where you can see endangered species like the famous Bali starling, lesser birds of paradise and many more. The parrots are simply amazing - taking a photo in their company is an absolute must!",
          "As we walked in we noticed all of the birds in the trees as you come in were strangely docile.. a couple were even lying on the branches with one wing hanging limply down. We came to a realisation that these birds must be drugged because birds not act like this naturally. We",

          "When you do things in Bali, you expect to pay relatively little in the way of money. However, the admission ticket here was more than I was accustomed to when in Bali. But there is a reason for this and the cost turns out to be of great value. The place is well looked after and",
          "I think it was more than I expected. The birds were so funny and friendly. I didn't get the feeling that they weren't happy.",

          "The birds, spectacular! The shows, professional and informative. The 4D adventure, tacky to the point of being funny \ud83d\ude06 The only let down is that a major enclosure, aswell as the birds of prey amphitheatre and the Java enclosure are all under refurbishment and there is no",
          "A nice thing to do, if you like Zoo in general and are in favor of birds. We liked the interactions with the birds - you could touch the parrots and try to catch goose, peacocks and other birds. We arrived at around 4pm and there were shows happening right after our arrival. We",
          "About one and a quarter hours drive from Seminyak, this well established and surprisingly professional bird park was a joy. Not cheap, 385,000 Rph per person for entry, it is easy to see where they spend the money and that's on the birds. The individual cages, most smaller than",

          "Came here on recommendation from many people and it did not disappoint! As soon as you walk in you are greeted by amazing colourful birds just freely sitting on branches and trees all around. Obviously many of the birds are caged as you would expect but there\u2019s also soooo many",
          "I wouldn\u2019t waste your money, it\u2019s defiantly not worth the \u00a319 to get in, was only in there 45 mins max , takes 30 mins to walk round! Nice birds and grounds just not worth the money",
          "The Bali Bird Park is an excellent attraction. We had organised our tickets over the internet. A car picked us up from our hotel and delivered us to the Park. Once inside we found lots of lovely birds of all types. The park is very well set out, plenty of toilets everywhere.",
          "Bali Bird Park is an excellent day trip. There are a loads of different birds including several that your can touch, have photos with, watch fly, etc. We came away with some great pictures of hornbills and parrots sitting on our kids. The environment is nice too and everything",
          "A great experience that the kids and adults alike really enjoyed. A hugely diverse and interesting array of bird life, that you also get to interact with. Make sure you pack a hat and sunscreen as it does get hot out in the open.",
          "we enjoyed a wonderful day at the Bali Bird Park, with its many birds and animals and lovely flora. The surroundings were well shaded so walking around was great. The caf\u00e9 was a lovely spot for a relax between walks",

          "We went to this Bird park having visited Singapore Bird Park just days before. This park was brilliant. We were just too late to see the opening Rain forest show where they have loads of the birds being introduced to the public. We did see the hawk show, meet the stars show and",
          "We liked the birds so much! They are very pretty and non-smelly unlike usual birds. We liked the park as well, however we hope they could make certain packages and rates based on how many corners the visitors can only attend. As during our time, though we will only have to stay",
          "We went to Bali Bird Park with our kids 20 odd years ago when it was just getting established and had breakfast with the birds and it was great. This time we went with some friends and couldn\u2019t believe the development that has gone on there. Every thing about the park is",
          "The park is worth a visit. It is clean and the birds seem well looked after, overall. Entertaining and educational. However do not buy the package sold through the hotel - it is more expensive than doing it yourself (get a taxi and pay entrance fee at park). Particularly avoid",
          "Been coming to Bali for a long time now and this was the first time we have done the bird park, Clean and well presented. A great day out. Should have gone a long time ago.",
          "Despite being in the middle of some major building work, Bali Bird Park was excellent. The staff care about their birds. Tourists can get up close and personal with many of the birds, and can help in feeding a lot of them too. Photo opportunities abound. Kids love it. Next",
          "I really enjoyed my trip to Bali Bird Park. It is quite expensive, however (approx 356k). The staff are warm and friendly and you have an opportunity to pose for a professional photograph with some of the larger birds (you can see your photo at the end of the visit and are not",
          "We bought ticket via online to get special promo, and it\u2019s so easy to redeem. Their staff was friendly and helpful especially when my 2 year old daughter ask to take a pic with the birds. Better come at 9, so you can enjoy all the attraction. Sadly we missed a few attraction in",
          "Paid 385,000IDR per person (5 people in family) $192.50AU and expected this to include the reptile park only to find out once we walked over to reptile park you now have to pay to see this too. Reptile park is 100,000IDR per person so would of cost us another $50AU to see this.",
          "Both my wife and I loved our visit here even though she wasn't sure if she would like it. The shows were fantastic and their conservation programs are wonderful. There are plenty of birds to see and take your pictures with. I would say that this would take a couple of hours out",
          "After reading some reviews about the price i can now confidently say it was totally worth it. Book online for a discount. AUD $35 per person is great value for what you get to see and experience. We went for approx 4 hours and got to see 3 bird shows and had an amazing time. So",
          "This was not something that I had looked forward to but has really taken me by surprise. I was really surprised at how well maintained the park really is. I came from Singapore and this says a lot about the level of cleanliness that we are used to. I could vouch that this park",
          "This is Indonesia and someone is simply getting filthy rich of the probably wonderful park. It should not be this expensive!",
          "Spent a great morning at Bali Bird Park. The price of the admission ticket is well worth the visit. The park is well-designed and clean. There are many birds freely roaming throughout the park. Highly enjoyed feeding the pelicans and being able to get up close with these",
          "We enjoyed our day at Bali Bird Park. Our daughter was selected to help participate in one of the bird shows. She was a little shy but really enjoyed feeding the birds. Would recommend a day here if you have children.",

          "As fans of bird parks, Bali bird park was at the top of our list of \u2018things to do\u2019 in Bali. Unfortunately, we were left with somewhat of a sour taste in our mouths as soon as we got there. The price of admission was 385,000 IPR for an adult and 195,000 for a child. That equates",
          "Had a fantastic time here. Walk in and are greeted by a variety of birds just hanging around on tree branches. Many of the birds are feee to roam around creating some wonderful photo opportunities. Great chances throughout the park to interact and hold some of the birds,",

          "We were surprised by the quality and quantity of the birds here - we had low expectations - I think because it seemed quite costly to get in and they sort of tried to bamboozle you into buying a joint ticket with another park/attraction - but inside the Bird Park is lovely. The",
          "We visited the park due to the monkey forest being closed and looking on trip advisor for things to do. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a massive bird fan but thought we would give it a shot. Easily one of the best experiences in Bali. The fact that you walk around with parrots, cockatoos,",
          "I wasn't expecting much and so I was presently surprised at how nice the place was. There were some really unusual birds and my son and had a lot of fun having some birds sit on our arms and shoulder. The Komodo dragon exhibit was a real treat too.",
          "We wanted to take the kids on a day trip and decided to visit the Bird Park based on its positive reviews. The Bird Park did not disappoint. Beautiful park grounds with big birds roaming freely around the park. The layout was well thought of and we could cover the entire park",
          "I visited here today. I was hoping it would be worth the entry fee, which I initially thought was very high at $385,000. But I was happy to see many birds free. Lovely surroundings. Great to leisurely wander around. Little platforms here and there to sit down and chill if",
          "Really nice place. A little expensive entrance fee for Bali, but worth it. We loved that you can hold a few of the birds and take your own picture without the park\u2019s photographers being pushy about us buying theirs. Also the park was not too crowded. Inside the \u201cvolieres\u201d you",
          "We too loved this attraction. At first we thought that it was too expensive but after walking around experiencing some amazing exotic and beautiful birds in a very clean and structured environment we fully understood what it would cost to maintain this quality of life and",

          "It was expensive but worth a visit for bird lovers as you will see so many rare asian birds you will never meet anywhere else. There are also many birds interactions and you can take great photos. Great experience",

          "What a great place it was my child enjoyed a lot there are many species of birds and you can take pictures with them not like the JURONG BIRD PARK IN SINGAPORE its even better because at JURONG BIRD PARK you need to pay to click a photo with the birds and here its free of cost",
          "Our tour involved, initially, a tour of the Bird Park which has a large array of exotic and colourful birds which were well worth seeing. This was followed by a buffet meal, which was quite enjoyable, in the rest area at the park. The tour concluded with a performance of the",
          "The Bali Bird Park is an immaculately maintained establishment, the facilities are second to none in the Ubud area. The exhibits are outstanding with birds, some of which, you would not see in any other zoo in the world. The range of species is extraordinary and the success of",

          "We loved this Bird Park. Very interesting and loads of beautiful birds. The scenery is amazing and it is all well maintained. The staff were excellent with the birds and allowing us to hold them and take our own photos meaning we didn\u2019t have to pay extra for the photos. Will go",
          "We loved this place. It is totally worth going. Two teens and everyone entertained. We saw absolutely gorgeous birds that we\u2019ve never seen before. We went to the feeding time at the rainforest section and it was an interactive and joyful experience. We went to one of the 4D",
          "We were a bit surprised by the price of admission, but we loved the experience. We got to see two shows and spent time looking at the Komodo Dragon (the other reptiles are no longer part of the admission price) and the staff were excellent for taking pictures of us with the",

          "Colourful and variety of species . The parrot show was good . The komodo watch was a great experience . Very well maintained . There are 2 restaurants with the main one serving delicious pizza . It was raining when we went and the pizza tasted awesome . You can spend close to 3",
          "Enjoyed this place. A bit expensive at 385,000 IDR per person but amazing range of exotic birds. They have continuous bird shows, some of which are interesting. At equal intervals they have bird feeding which is exciting and fun. A lot of the birds are free so it feels like you",

          "We paid 770.000IDR admission for two, but the park was absolutely worth the steep price. Asian zoos or animal parks are often not well maintained or the animals aren't treated well. This wasn't the case here at all. This park might even be up to European standards - or at least",
          "We enjoyed our visiting. The place are awesome, clean n there are so mmany kin/species of bird. Amazing.... The attraction was entertained and be sure u come in the morning bcoz the 1st show will be start around 9.30am",
          "While this place seem pricey for the entry fee, it\u2019s well worth it when I realized how well-maintained the exhibit was. They have an extensive collection of birds. I fell in love with the golden pheasant but didn\u2019t get a great picture. My all time fave was the white peacock",
          "Pros : - Good bird collection - Well maintained place - Good bird show - Suitable for family with kids Cons : - Expensive",

          "Quite expensive to get in but it is well set out & all the birds were wonderful. Photos are taken at different points & you can purchase after. We missed the birds of prey show unfortunately. You used to be able to gain entry to both the bird park & the reptile park but they",
          "The destination was a little over an hour by taxi from our hotel in Kuta. I was not sure what to expect other than see a few colorful birds. I found out it was much more there to see and experience. Not only there were exotic Macau birds and colorful parrots but these birds",
          "This would have to be one of the better outings we\u2019ve done over the many years we have been visiting Bali. For around $AUD70 we were picked up from our villa in Seminyak and driven to the park up in the Ubud region in air-conditioned comfort. The park itself is spectacular and",
          "This is a good place to check while you are in Ubud. But kinda disappointed with the admission ticket. Like the ticket price for locals are wayyyyyy to far than for tourists or expats. Unless they have NPWP and KITAS. Just unfair. But it was a good place especially if you",

          "We were initially contemplating if a bird zoo trip amidst a packed schedule was really worth the effort, time & money. Turns out, it was one of the best moves we made this trip! 55$ entrance fee for the 2 of us was pretty reasonable considering the display on offer. Variety of",
          "Booked a trip to have breakfast wth the birds. We expected to eat with the birds with us having their breakfast too. The tour was made out to be that but it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s basically you eating breakfast in the cafe by a pond where ducks wander about However the bird park itself",
          "Really really loved this bird park, you can get up close to the birds as a lot of them are running free in the park. A very large variety of birds and the bird nursery was really interesting. It seemed quite expensive but was really worth it.",

          "Its a fair drive to the Bird Park but it is really worth it. Your driver will wait for you outside while you slowly wonder through this gorgeous park. As you enter there are these beautiful huge birds that are free and they are so colourful and so are most of these birds. There",
          "The park provides sanctuary to nearly 1,000 birds. We went for the dinner and Kecak Dance performance. We first walked through the amazing bird exhibits featuring birds in cages and on the loose. As evening descended on this tropical paradise and the last rays of the setting sun",

          "We visited the bird park mid morning and we were pleasantly surprised by how quiet it was in the park. Perhaps the price puts some people off, the equivalent of $35AUD is on the dearer end for Bali attractions but for what you get I consider it reasonably priced. In the park",
          "We went because my husband knows I love birds. The entry price was higher than other places we went but that didn\u2019t matter. It was a very quiet time of the year so we had no crowds. There is a large variety of birds and there are several places along the way where you can get",

          "Saw a lot of birds and got to interact with some (an owl, parrots, macaws, etc.)! Recommend if in the area but not worth a special trip (unless you\u2019re a bird enthusiast).",
          "Exotic birds from all over the world. Some - in cages - are hard to photograph well, but the aviaries provide close-up and personal photos. There are many opportunities for holding the birds and being photographed. The birds are just beautiful! Not so beautiful, but fascinating,",

          "We have been to bird parks in Singapore, Malaysia, a few in US and Thailand - yet this bird park was very impressive. Though it is small compared to other bird parks - yet it was a very very good experience. The birds are so close to watch. You will end up spending 3-4 hours in",
          "Even though this is not a huge park, the shows and the variety of birds makes you feel awesome. We visited the park during the lunch time (1PM) and it was bird's feeding time. First, wide variety of Parrots. We were given a piece of apple and done, the birds were all over us.",

          "We went on a rainy day and got a discount. Still it is expensive. But if you love birds, which we do, it is worth it. They have two wonderful aviaries where you can roam among the gorgeous birds. We saw a bird of paradise doing his dance (worth the price of admission). Overall,",
          "I was keen to visit Bali Bird Park but I think it's a little overpriced for the size of park and the experience you get...happy to think of it as a $10 entry fee and $25 donation. Birds are pretty and well cared for.",

          "The bird park is a good place to see different bird species of SE Asia and other parts of the world. Since I am not a huge fan of zoos, I would prefer if they would only keep local species, for which they have a rehabilitation and conservation program. Some habitats have large",

          "The ABSOLUTELY BEST DAY OUT! Yes it seems a little silly or not necessarily the main attraction in Ubud but it\u2019s well worth the visit! The birds all seem VERY well looked after and happy. Lots of opportunity to touch the birds as they seems to have some trained and tame ones. Loved this",
          "Small but very nice. Lots of open areas where some birds roam freely unlike the other bird parks where most of them are caged.\nMorning/evening is better. Take the map and ask for show timings at entrance. Can spend around 2-3hrs.",
          "We arrived at 920am and the place was pretty empty which was great, we got lots of time to feed to parakeets. We had three favourites. The Gallah Cockatoo was so cute, it kept putting it's head against the cage so we would scratch his head. \u2026",
          "Fantastic day out with the kids!  Get there early to avoid the heat (and traffic) and allow 3 - 4 hours to enjoy the shows, posing with birds on you and participating in feeding of pelicans, parrots etc.  When we were there, it was not busy \u2026",
          "Excellent experience!  The park is huge with an excellent variety of birds. The multiple shows keep you engaged through out the day. The fact t that they allow certain species free reign of the park makes it even more attractive. Best place to visit in bali for people who love animals",

          "There are a lot of exotic and beautiful birds here that you get to know about and the place is absolutely beautiful plus there are several amazing shows. You'd just love your time here roaming around through the greenery and taking pics with the birds. A must visit.",
          "I liked it but at 385k it is getting pricey.  If the reptile place was included it would be  better. The bird show under the net was fabulous and was in English too. The birds were everywhere and at the end of the show they let you feed them. They are all over you if you have food.  Very fun!!",

          "Totally awesome. They take a great care of the animals. Birds are able to fly freely, but they choose to stay. You can feed and hold all sorts of parrots and the shows are interesting and fun. It's pricey but it's worth it and you pay to the facility that treats animals(some of then endangered) really well.",
          "They manage the place so well with not so large areas but have lots of birds type.\n\nThe price is quite expensive for small park like this. Even for the foreigners, it's too expensive",
          "The bird of prey show was good and the children enjoyed the feeding show, but expensive (cost over $100 for the visit).  There were a lot of big birds cooped up in small cages (v sad, especially the owls).  The reptile park was next door - \u2026",

          "It's a good place for kids. Most of the birds roaming freely. My suggestions if you want to visit this place are: 1. Go early so you can catch the bird shows. They have quite a few shows going on in a day.  2. If possible, visit on Tuesday \u2026",
          "We spent wonderful 3 hours at the Bali Bird Park. Would def recommend it if you are a bird lover. The prices seem to be high but if you consider all of the work it takes to keep the park clean and to train the birds, it is worth the money. \u2026",

          "Nice place with a lot of birds not so many people there maybe because the entrance is too high 385k. Is it worth 385k no it isn't overpriced as many other things here. If you buy online in klook ticket is 285k",
          "Best zoo I have ever been to. The shows are superb and well timed and the birds are well kept after. It was well worth the entrance fee!",

        "wiki": "The Puri Lukisan Ratna Wartha Museum (Indonesian: Museum Puri Lukisan Ratna Warna) is the oldest art museum in Bali which specialize in modern traditional Balinese paintings and wood carvings. The museum is located in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia. It is home to the finest collection of modern traditional Balinese painting and wood carving on the island, spanning from the pre-Independence war (1930\u20131945) to the post-Independence war (1945 \u2013 present) era. The collection includes important examples of all of the artistic styles in Bali including the Sanur, Batuan, Ubud, Young Artist and Keliki schools.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n== Museum Buildings ==\nBuilding I (North) \u2013 the Pitamaha Gallery houses the Pre-War modern traditional Balinese paintings (1930\u20131945) and I Gusti Nyoman Lempad collection\nBuilding II (West) \u2013 the Ida Bagus Made Gallery houses the Ida Bagus Made Estate Collection\nBuilding III (East) \u2013 the Wayang Gallery houses Wayang Painting Collection.\nBuilding IV (South) - the Founders Gallery houses the Museum history and used for temporary exhibitions or shows new acquisitions\n\n\n== Highlights of the Collection ==\nIda Bagus Nyana (1912\u20131985)Ida Bagus Nyana was a talented wood sculptor and a gifted dancer. He is known for his impressionistic, elongated woodcarvings whose fluid shapes, devoid of excessive detail, often appear as if they had been pulled from taffy. His sculpture of the Goddess Pertiwi (Mother Earth), with its spidery legs and coiled serpent, is dreamlike and surrealistic. Nyana's son, Ida Bagus Tilem, was also a talented woodcarver. Both father and son were known for their ability to impart life to inanimate wood, thereby transforming it into magnificent forms with a sense of movement and full use of all the dimensions.\n\nIda Bagus Gelgel (1900\u20131937)Ida Bagus Gelgel grew up in Kamasan, far away from direct western influence, but his works evolved beyond the conventions of the Wayang tradition. He was so creative, that in 1937 one of his paintings won a silver medal at the International Colonial Art Exhibition in Paris. One of his works, the Priest Dharmaswami, painted in 1935 using naturals dyes on paper, is one of the masterpieces of the Museum Puri Lukisan. It tells the story of a Priest who rescued a monkey, a snake and a tiger from a well. When the priest was arrested by a prince on false charges, the animals came to his rescue. The paintings shows these animals bringing gifts as a gratitude for saving their lives.\n\nI Gusti Nyoman Lempad (~1862\u20131978)A true master and \"Renaissance Man\", Lempad is a  figure in the Balinese community as well as in artistic circles abroad. His fame extends not only beyond geographical borders but also beyond the ordinary borders of craftsmanship and artistic expression. Lempad\u2019s specialty was classical scenes, rendered in a relatively formal way. To these he applied creative genius, and the passionate intensity of his personality, in creating works that inspired many artists who followed him. Although he maintained closed friendships with the foreign artists who lived in Bali, including Bonnet and Spies, Lempad never compromised his distinctive identity as a Balinese artist. Lempad had a broad range of talents in many art forms: including painting, sculpture and architecture. He designed some of the palaces and temples in and around Ubud, including parts of the Puri Lukisan Museum. He also painted the murals at the entrance of the North building of the museum. Lempad's drawing, the Dream of Dharmawangsa, is one of the masterpieces of the museum and is rendered in his unique linear style.\n\nAnak Agung Gde Sobrat (1919\u20131992)Sobrat was the son of an aristocratic family. As a child, he delighted in the spectacles of the Balinese Wayang Kulit (shadow puppet performances). His grandfather, a well-known Wayang puppeteer, taught him to carve the rawhide puppets and familiarized him with the Hindu epics: the Ramayana and Mahabharata. His artistic talent drew the attention of other artists. Under the tutelage of Walter Spies, he learned to paint Balinese landscapes with surreal perspectives, and later from Bonnet he developed the techniques for portraiture. From 1957 to 1959, Sobrat taught at the highly regarded Academy of Fine Arts in Yogyakarta, where he developed his academic style. His painting of the Balinese Market was exhibited at the opening of the Museum Puri Lukisan and remains one of its masterpieces. Although the colors have faded, the composition of human figures clearly shows the influence of Bonnet.\n\nI Gusti Made Deblog (1910\u20131978)This exceptional artist started his career as an apprentice in the studio of the Chinese photographer, Yap Sin Tin. Deblog's work portrays a passionate sense of the beauty of nature, rendered in elegantly refined detail that reveals the presence of a deeper reality underlying the world around us. His drawing, the Birth of Hanuman (1936) was presented to the Puri Lukisan Museum by the chairman of the Ford Foundation, and depicts a lush forest with magical nymphs and other forest dwellers bringing offerings to the newborn Hanuman.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Noted Exhibitions ==\nPre-War Balinese Modernist (1999)Featuring the pre-War Balinese paintings from the Leo Haks collection. Over 100 paintings and drawings were personally selected by Leo Haks to showcase the pre-War works of artists from Ubud, Sanur and Batuan. Many of the pieces came from the paintings collected by Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead during their field study in Bali from 1935 to 1937.\n\nPioneers of Balinese Painting (July 14 - September 12, 2008)Featuring masterpieces of Balinese art on loan from the Leiden University Museum, collected between 1929 and 1958 by Dutch artist Rudolf Bonnet, this exhibition showcases the specific characteristics, and style of Balinese artists from four geographic regions: Tampaksiring, Ubud, Batuan and Sanur. The Leiden University collection was supplemented by similar works from the permanent collection of the Puri Lukisan Museum, which were also selected by Rudolf Bonnet. This exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue entitled \u201cPioneers of Balinese Painting\u201d by Helena Spannjard.\n\nIda Bagus Made (July 14 - December 31, 2008)In 2000, following the artist\u2019s last wish, the widow of Ida Bagus Made loaned about 100 paintings from the artist\u2019s private collection to the Puri Lukisan Museum. Fifty of these paintings will be presented to the public for the first time. This exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue: \u201cIda Bagus Made \u2013 the Art of Devotion\u201d co-authored by Kaja McGowan et al.\n\nIlluminating Line - Masterworks of I Gusti Nyoman Lempad (September 22 - December 18, 2014)Featuring masterworks of I Gusti Nyoman Lempad (~1862 - 1978) from major public and private collections around the world: American Museum of Natural History (New York), Library of Congress (Washington DC), Lois Bateson Collection; Tropen Museum (Amsterdam), Royal Ethnographic Museum (Leiden), Welt Museum Wien (Vienna), and Dance Museum (Stockholm). This exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue: \u201cLempad of Bali \u2013 the Illuminating Line\u201d co-authored by Bruce Carpenter, John Darling, Heidi Hinzler, Kaja McGowan, Adrian Vickers and Soemantri Widagdo.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUbud\n\n\n== References ==\nCouteau, Jean (1999).

          "Let's face it, you won't have any photos of the art works and paintings inside this museum, because photography is strictly forbidden. That is why I only have photos of the garden and the entrance gates. After World War Two, an organisation called the Ubud Painters Group",

          "Totally dissappointing after enjoying the ARMA ( Ayung Rai Museum of Arts near Monkey Forest Sanctuary ) & Antonio Blanco Arts Museum, jusr 5-7 minutes walk away from this museum. It is spread in 4 buildings East-West-North-South , but the displayed arts work is not worth the",
          "Lots to see, but it didn't particularly appeal to me, I preferred the temporary exhibits, much more my taste",

          "This museum shows Balinese art of the past (half) century. Interesting to see, but also a bit repetitive. Also, the museum could do with a bit more/better explanation. The wood carvings deserve special attention. In the entree fee, a drink is included.",
          "This museum, which consists of five or so buildings and grounds, was created by the then-King, local artists, and several Westerners who had settled in Ubud in the 1920's and 30's. I don't know enough to appreciate the art fully, though I enjoyed walking through the galleries.",

          "A cafe provides refreshing drinks between meanderings [there are 4 separate bldgs and little a/c]. Like most museums in busy cities, it is a refuge as well as a feast for the eye. An easy way to absorb traditional art in Bali. Go for the afternoon tea and escape the oppression",
          "Yes, a good collection of traditional painting and carving and a stark contrast to the noisy, crass, traffic dominated pseudo art outside the front door. Sad to consider how much has been lost in the last 70 years or so. So stop in and look. Then get in your car and go",

          "All of the four houses have mostly traditional balineise religious paintings and tapestrys. Gets a bit old (which they are) and lacks depth and contrasts which I loved in many of the paintings in ARMA. I got allergic reactions from the dust in all the rooms, besides the one",
          "A very good museum to have a look at the different types of art during the years. Interesting and good selection.",
          "Don't get me wrong. The garden and grounds are lovely and peaceful and there are many very beautiful works of art here. But unless you have a special interest in Hindu/Balinese mythology, in which case you will be a pig in mud, the collection becomes quite monotonous. A few",
          "Usually I walk quickly through a museum, but this one kept me for 2 hours. I was fascinated by the pictures, the art which Indonesia has to offer. I stood in front of some paintings for a few minutes to see what the artist wanted to tell us and I am not really good in",

          "I found the newer paintings more interesting than the older ones. I guess you need to know more about the old paintings to appreciate them. There was a lot of detail in the new paintings that were located in the left hand side building and most were for sale, but at high prices",
          "Rp.85k entrance fee. You have to be a Balinese art lover to really enjoy this museum. The best part for me was the new art rather than the old stuff. The grounds of the museum are good and deserve a walk round.",
          "I always visit the Museum Puri Lukisan for its great art collection of traditional Balinese art. It is set just off Jalan Raya Ubud where the car park is huge but in need of a bit of repair. But the tranquil surrounds make up for that. The galleries are set back into the hill",

        "wiki": "Tirta Gangga is a former royal palace in eastern Bali, Indonesia, about 5 kilometres from Karangasem, near Abang. Named after the sacred river Ganges in Hinduism, it is noted for the Karangasem royal water palace, bathing pools and its Patirthan temple. The one hectare complex was built in 1946 by the late King of Karangsem but was destroyed almost entirely by the eruption of nearby Mount Agung in 1963.Tirta Gangga is based on the beliefs in Balinese Hinduism, where river Ganges and its waters are considered sacred. Its waters are cherished for irrigation and agricultural abundance, recreation and economic activity. The Patirthan temple illustrates the historic significance of Tirta Gangga in the Balinese tradition as a pilgrimage and holy water site.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n Some of the content in this article was copied from Tirta Gangga at Wikitravel, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 (Unported) (CC-BY-SA 3.0) license.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Tirta Gangga travel guide from Wikivoyage\nOfficial website",

          "I went back to Tirta Ganga after many years and was appalled to see the level of tourism promoted there. Of course people will come in the masses if it's not protected, and I'm wondering what the long-time keepers of the this land are thinking. There were lines of people waiting",

I\u2019m no longer going to wait patiently while you spend minutes posing",
          "A beautiful place to visit! Yes there were lots of tourists, it was busy, but it did not detract from the good, calm energy of this place. We spend a couple of hours here and it was just lovely. The market however that they make you walk through as you get out, is not nice at",
          "We stopped at Tirta Gangga on our way back from Lempyang Temple and were glad we had a halt. There\u2019s a water pond one can walk on through the steps and click some wonderful pictures while those colorful fishes swim by. There\u2019s a separate pool to swim for a price. Expect to spend",

          "Loved tirta gangga. It's like a garden with shallow pools for fish. Some of the fish were huge in size for such ponds. There are many statues and fountains and a nice small bridge. It was very clean and not very crowded. If you are visiting east bali then I would highly",
          "So apparently this was the kings playground for his children to play in. These gardens were very pretty. Easily spend an hour walking around. Good fun feeding all them hungry fish too.",
          "The main attraction are the stepping stones in one pond. there is only one way in and out and people line up to walk through it. Once you are in, you are really stick until you get to the end. We spent 30 to 45 minutes walking the short path because people stop to take photos",
          "We stopped off here between The Gates of Heaven and lunch at Bali Asli. A smallish area home to several ornamental pools stocked with whopping fish that you can feed with the food on sale from the shops at the gates. Shame about the new cafes selling burgers in the place. One",
          "After being disappointed by the fake Gates of Heaven, Tirta Gangga was a great relief during that trip and it is such a beautifully built and designed water palace with lakes full of fish everywhere which you can feed, the atmosphere of the water is so relaxing and calming.",
          "I have been to Tirta Gangga three times in the past ten years. Before it was one of the most beautiful gardens in Bali. The trip I took in June (2019), however, I found it drastically changed with concrete restaurants built and under construction inside the botanical gardens.",
          "This is one of the most photographed and shared places in Bali, so it's definitely worth a visit. You can spend there at least 2 hours and keep discovering beautiful things and viewpoints. Come with your camera battery fully charged.",
          "Lovely little spot, good day trip or if your going past stop in. Fish food gets cheaper as you get closer to the entrance. It only costs about $4 per person to enter and it's worth it",
          "You can squeeze visising Tirta Gangga in as well as the gates of heaven in one day. I prefer the Tirta Gannga water temple so much more than the gates of heaven It is worth buying fish food when entering to feed all the giant koi fish inside. Tirta Gangga has nice shaded areas",
          "This temple is quite different to others and is very good. The water features are incredible and the fish feeding is very entertaining.",
          "Not very known place among tourists or maybe a bit too far from the overcrowded areas. Anyhow, it is worth the visit as this temple that combines water and architecture is just mesmerising. You can take a quick Holy bath if you dare too.",
          "This place is so beautiful, very nice grounds, the water is filled with lots and lots of coy fish and lily pads which are stunning. We really enjoyed walking through here and looking at everything.",
          "Really beautiful garden with an interesting story! It\u2019s possible to swim in the fresh water pools. Definitely worth visiting!",
          "My wife and I stopped by Tirta after a visit to Lempuyang and must say we wished we would have gone here first. The lush gardens were simply stunning, the ponds and fountains with large koi fish made for a great photo op, and the pool which is open to the public would have been",

          "This beautiful water temple, features a couple serene koi ponds that you can walk through. There is a small entrance fee of 10,000 IDR and it opens at 7AM. Located on the eastern portion of the island, we decided to visit this temple along with Lempunyang, and the Ujung Water",
          "Though the place is very scenic,it is full of crowd for that instagram shot and you need to wait till your turn comes. The mazed pools are very beautiful and you can see those colorful fishes through the waters. Early visit is suggested for less crowds.",

          "As in many of the temples here in Bali, people flock to take pictures and forget these are holy sites. In this case the site is very beautiful and it\u2019s a shame that most people treat it like visiting a garden and not a shrine. They feed the fish and all get in line on the pond",

I know most of the people don\u2019t really visit that side but it\u2019s worth it. Built in 1948 it is surrounded by beautiful sculptures, stone carvings,",

          "Although not very extensive, and very turistic (even in September), the place is beautifull and definitely worth a visit. The garden plants are beautifull, and the sculptures are very interesting. Also a possibility of walk on stone plates on the water is something uncommon.",

          "This is such a beautiful garden. It is obviously very touristy but not to be missed. The drive alone to get here is enough to warrant a visit. I came on the back of a scooter and had the cool breeze blowing in my hair the whole way. I spent about an hour walking through the gardens and taking pictures.",
          "A great temple visit, the guides were very knowledgeable of the history and we're happy to share.\nThe grounds were beautiful and as the pictures show, smiles were plentiful.",
          "Biggest koi fishes i have ever seen! The swimming area looked fun but we didn't bring swimming attire.",

          "A lot of people queuing for pictures but it goes much faster than it looks. We spent about 15min waiting. The garden is nice as well, and the bridges are beautiful. Tips: it gets really really hot under the sun when queuing above the water, would definitely recommend anyone to bring a hat and water, and some sunblock isn't a luxury \ud83d\ude0e",
          "Love this place. Very artistic",

          "Nice place to explore local culture and feed the large fish",
          "Make sure you get here early. When we left at around 11 you had to wait in line to get on the stones in the water. People are taking all the time they need to get the perfect instagram shot. So don't be surprised if you have to wait 20 minutes before you can get on",

          "Beautiful and fun little place. It's very busy, would be great to see it when it's quiet. The stepping stones was a huge attraction and takes a while to get to the other side due to the amount of people taking selfies etc.",
          "This was a stunning place and I'm happy I've seen once. However, I will definitely not return during the months of June, July, August or December. The place was packed with tourists, which made it very difficult to enjoy.",
          "Lovely place, good for a relaxing stroll. The big attraction is the trail of stones crossing one of the ponds, full of many huge fishes that are spoiled by tourists feeding them. \nExpect to do a bit of waiting to take your Instagram pictures on the path of stones or on one of the little bridges. Worth a visit if passing by.",

          "I went there at 7:15 to avoid the crowd (it opens at 7am but I was a bit late). The first part (with the steps running trough the pond) was already crawling with people taking pictures Instagram style... A bit disappointed at first, I \u2026",
          "Nice place good view. .",
          "Great watertemple, but also very touristic. You should know it's a famous Instagram-spot, so there are many locations where you have to wait for minutes just for moving on (especially the stony steps which are into the water.)",

          "I don't really get this place. I get it that it's a good place to take pictures but like it's an overcrowded place with a pond in it, with kois. But like it's too common and too much of a tourist attraction if you're saying that this is a sacred place.",
          "The spiritual, historic sites of Bali are all individual and if you are interested in culture and history you should try to visit them all. It's not a case of seen one seen the lot",

          "So many tourist and have to queue to take a pic",

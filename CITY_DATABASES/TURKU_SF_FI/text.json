        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

        "wiki": "Luostarinm\u00e4ki Handicrafts Museum (Finnish: Luostarinm\u00e4en k\u00e4sity\u00f6l\u00e4ismuseo, Swedish: Hantverksmuseet p\u00e5 Klosterbacken; Cloister Hill Handicrafts Museum)  is an open-air museum in Turku (Swedish: \u00c5bo), Finland. \n\n\n== Cloister Hill ==\n\nThis area of Cloister Hill was developed relatively late for pre-fire \u00c5bo, from around 1775, after another fire. It was decided that the previously undeveloped, although not uninhabited, area to the south of Vartiovuori Hill would be developed as residential accommodation. The South of this area was less rocky and easier to build upon, so was developed first. Plots were surveyed officially, then the plot holder would develop within that plot as and when they saw fit. These first surveyed plots still form the boundaries within the current museum. Three plots: 158\u2013160 appear on the maps of 1780, by 1800 171, 176, 178\u2013189 are included and the 1808 map (the basis of the post-fire map illustrated) includes the whole extent of the museum site.The original occupations of the first inhabitants are represented by the buildings now within the museum. Some were building trades, such as carpenters and a stonemason, and probably built their own properties. The plot would be fenced in and a simple cottage with a stove and baking oven built. Other buildings might be provided for domestic animals. In time, the buildings would expand around the perimeter of the plot, enclosing a courtyard.\n\n\n== The museum ==\nThe museum consists of 18 blocks of original 18th-century \u2013 early 19th-century buildings on their original location. The area of the museum was the only old residential area left in 1940, when the museum was opened. The location was the largest area to completely survive the Great Fire of Turku. \nThe idea for the museum was put forward in a local newspaper article as early as 1908, after the oldest part of Cloister Hill had been demolished \u2013 now the street of Sirkkalankatu. The idea was rejected for nearly 30 years, until the city's new museum committee was convinced to create a museum in the style of Den Gamle By, an earlier museum in Aarhus, Denmark. Nine blocks formed the original museum, the others being added in 1956. Expansion has continued since, with more buildings having their interiors refitted for display. On their addition to the museum, the houses were still decorated in the contemporary fashion of the 1930s. They were carefully recorded, then the interiors refitted to the style of the Great Fire period. This often involved removing ceilings of tongue and groove boards, or the restoration of open fireplaces.  Some residents remained living in the museum area even after it opened, the last, Hilma M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4, remaining there until her death in 1982.The museum received the Golden Apple international tourism award as the only site in Scandinavia in 1984.\n\n\n== See also ==\nQwensel House, the apothecary museum in Turku\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSj\u00f6berg-Pietarinen, Solveig (2005).

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

Aboa Vetus displays portions of the city dating back to medieval times, while Ars Nova is a museum of contemporary art.\nThe museum was first opened in 1995 as two independent museums. Originally, plans were for only Ars Nova, the contemporary art museum, but during its construction a number of structures and artifacts dating back to the Middle Ages were discovered, and the archaeological excavation that was commissioned eventually transformed into Aboa Vetus. The two museums were combined in 2004 and Aboa Vetus & Ars Nova is now among the most popular tourist venues in the entire region of Southwest Finland.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Aboa Vetus & Ars Nova at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial site (English version)",

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area.

Turku has recently planned a residential area for 750 residents on the premises of a former HKScan sausage factory.The area hosts, among other things, numerous sports facilities, such as the Veritas Stadion, a Finnish baseball stadium, a velodrome, a bowling alley, a skateboarding area and a BMX track, and the Kupittaa open-air swimming pools. The ice hockey arena in the district was demolished in 2005. A new one was inaugurated in November 2006.\nMost of the Turku Science Park business centre is located in Kupittaa. The centre is currently expanding around Kupittaa railway station, next to Finnish national road 1 (part of European route E18) between Helsinki and Turku. \nAccording to a version of the legend, the first pagan Finns were baptised into Christianity by the Bishop Henry at a spring in Kupittaa Park on Midsummer Day in the year 1155.

        "wiki": "W\u00e4in\u00f6 Valdemar Aaltonen (8 March 1894 \u2013 30 May 1966) was a Finnish artist and sculptor. The Chambers Biographical Dictionary describes him as \"one of the leading Finnish sculptors\".He was born to a tailor in the village of Karinainen, Finland. He became interested in art after being deaf as a child, and attended the School of Drawing of the Turku Art Association from age 16, or specifically between 1910 and 1915. He had spent many of the early years at this school studying painting, but he was mainly self-taught as a sculptor. He learned the technics of treatment of marble with his relative Aarre Aaltonen, and by working as a trainee stonemason in Hirvensalo. Sculptor Felix Nylund was a substitute teacher in the art school in Turku for one season, and his work was inspiration for young Aaltonen.A journey Aaltonen made to Italy in 1923 opened his eyes to cubist and futurist art. These elements can primarily be seen in his paintings.\nAs the Republic of Finland arose, and the First World War raged, he sculpted War Memorials. He soon became a nationalist icon, the exemplar Finn, establishing an exhibition in Stockholm in 1927. His sculpture is nationalist in nature, and he is noted for monumental figures and busts portraying citizens of Finland. An example is the 1925 sculpture of Paavo Nurmi, a cast of which is exhibited outside the Helsinki stadium. Another notable work is that of Jean Sibelius, a bust of 1928. These two works, like the main body of his work, are bronze casts\u2014though he did work in stone and even glass. Though chiefly naturalistic, the cubist influence is also present here. He was one of the early 20th-century pioneers of direct carving.\nWhen the new House of Parliament for Finland was built, architect Johan Sigfrid Sir\u00e9n wished he could buy sculptures directly from Aaltonen. Instead, an open competition was announced, and Aaltonen's Work and the Future was selected as the winner. The series of gilded plaster sculptures that Aaltonen completed in 1932 were cast in bronze after his death.Aaltonen was married four times. His first wife was singer Aino Alisa Pietik\u00e4inen from 1920, second wife actor Elsa Emilia Rantalainen from 1931, third wife gallerist in Galerie Artek Elvi Elisabet Hernell from 1942 and fourth wife medical doctor Marie Elisabeth Maasik from year 1961. His son Matti Aaltonen became an architect, who designed e.g. W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen museum in Turku.A large collection of his works are on permanent exhibition at the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art in Turku. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nTyt\u00f6n p\u00e4\u00e4, n. 1917\nGraniittipoika, 1917\u20131920\nMaria Jotuni, 1918\u20131920\nOpettajani, 1919\nAaro Hellaakosken pronssip\u00e4\u00e4, 1919\nSavonlinnan sankaripatsas, (The Hero's Grave) 1919\u20131921\nPunagraniittinen neito, 1923\nMustagraniittinen neito, 1924\nPaavo Nurmi runner statue, 1924\u20131925\nSeisova nainen, 1920\u20131924\nIstuva nainen, 1920\u20131925\nUimaan l\u00e4htev\u00e4 nainen, 1924\nTurun Lilja, n. 1924\u20131926\nMusica, 1926\nAleksis Kivi statue (Tampere), 1926\u20131927\nStatues on H\u00e4meensilta bridge, Tampere:  Er\u00e4nk\u00e4vij\u00e4 (the Hunter), Veronkantaja (the Tax Collector), Kauppias (the Merchant) ja Suomen neito (the Maiden of Finland), 1927\u20131929\nMyrsky (Memorial statue for the 53 victims of the sunken Finnish torpedo boat S2 in Reposaari, Pori), 1930\nStatues in the plenary chamber of Parliament House 1930\u20131932\nAleksis Kivi Memorial (Helsinki), 1930\u20131939\nMarjatta, 1934\nDelaware-muistomerkki, 1937\u20131938\nVapauden jumalatar seppel\u00f6i nuoruuden, 1939\u20131940\nMemorial of the Battle of K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4, 1939/1949\nTampereen Osuustoimintamuistomerkki, 1949\u20131950\nYst\u00e4vyys solmitaan (Joint monument for the cities of Turku and Gothenburg), n. 1948\u20131955\nLahden sankaripatsas, 1952\nRautatienrakentajien muistomerkki, 1957, Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4\nGenius ohjaa nuoruutta (in front of the University of Turku main library), 1958\u20131960\nStatues of president sin front of Parliament house: K.

The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

      "name": "Michael\u00b4s Church",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Michael's Church (Finnish: Mikaelinkirkko, Swedish: Mikaelskyrkan) is a church situated in central Turku. It is named after Archangel Michael and was finished in 1905. It dominates the western skyline of the city of Turku was designed by Professor Lars Sonck and is one of the most popular wedding churches in Turku being able to seat 1,800 people. When Sonck won the competition for the church in 1894, he was only a 23-year-old architectural student. Michael's Church is older than Michael's parish. The parish only dates back to 1921.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nMichael's church is a distinguished example of the neogothic style in architecture. It is a long church with three aisles, galleries and a multifaceted choir. In addition to the main entrance there are also doors at each corner of the church. The sacristy is situated behind the choir. The main spire rises to a height of 77 meters from the foundations.\nThe main building material of the walls of the church is red brick. The roof is made of grey green slate from Norway. However, the majority of the material used in the construction of the church are native materials from Finland. For the foundations, the stone steps, and the walls, natural stone was quarried not far from Turku.\nEven before the construction work started, Sonck wanted to make considerable changes to his winning design, but the church council did not agree to the proposed changes and in the end only minor detail changes were made to the facade. As for the interior, however, Sonck got a much freer hand to make changes from his original drawings. This is clearly seen in the deviations from the style of the times: Jugend follows Gothic and Romantic Nationalism.\n\n\n== Interior design ==\n\nMax Frelander the architect, who worked as an assistant to Sonck, has contributed to the interior design. A rich Jugend ornamentation decorates both the interior, the staircases and the windows. The altar, the pulpit, the altar rail, and the window frame are all made of Finnish soapstone. The central motif of the altar is a cross, on which base there is a symmetrical carving of two serpents. Also on the corner level of the altar rail there are rings of twisting serpents. The top of the cross is ornamented with a dove, the symbol of the Holy Spirit. The Jugend windows of the choir, which depict Finnish pine, were destroyed in a bombing raid during the Finnish Winter War (1939\u20131940). The national romantic movement is particularly dominant in the design of the choir. Motifs from Finnish nature are associated with traditional Christian symbolism.\nThe original window paintings, which were destroyed during the Winter War, were by the artist Willy Baer. The new ones were obtained in 1953. These were designed and done by the artists Hilkka Toivola and Otso Karpakka. The principal subjects of these works of art that were made in the Paris glass painting studio of Jean and Pierre Gaudin, are \"the Good Shepherd\" and \"Faith, Hope, and Charity\". Along with the new windows the stylistic unity of the interior of the church disappeared. Consequently, in the 1950s other changes were made in the interior design of the church to match the Gothic exterior. First the decorative paintings of the choir and the arch of triumph were painted over, and later the wall paintings in the body of the church and the staircases. However, the original decorative pictures were restored in connection with the general repair work on the church that was carried out in 1964-65.\nMichael's Church underwent a thorough renovation in the 1980s. First, an exterior repair work was carried out in 1984-85. The decayed exterior brick work and the roof were completely rebuilt. Reconditioning of the interior was done in 1985-87. First the sacristy of the church was returned to its original condition. After this came the main body of the church and the staircase. The ceiling and the interior wall surfaces were carefully cleaned of grime of decades. The decorative designs were repaired and returned to their original paint finish or painted afresh. Floors were resurfaced with a new limestone finish. The acoustics of the church, which had proved a problem, was improved. In connection with this renovation work, a basic restoration of the 48 rank mechanical organ made in Kangasala in 1965 was also done. In 2002 the new organ with 52 ranks and 3633 pipes was built by the Swedish organ builders Gr\u00f6nlunds Orgelbyggeri AB.\nThe church bells have rung out from the main spire since 1931, and they were a gift from Edla and Hjalmar Aarnio. Reino Lehto made a gift to the church of the model ship hanging from the gallery. Kaarina Lehmussaari, lecturer in textiles, donated a new decorated altar cloth.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nTurku\nEvangelical Lutheran Church of Finland\nTurku Cathedral\nVIII District, Turku\n\n\n== External links ==\nVirtual Turku - images from the cathedral",

      "name": "The Old Great Square",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Old Great Square (Finnish: Vanha Suurtori, Swedish: Gamla Stortorget) is a medieval market square located in the city centre of Turku, Finland. It is located in the II District in very close proximity to Turku Cathedral. The area was the administrative and commercial centre of Turku since the founding of the city in the 13th century up until the Great Fire of Turku.\nToday, there are buildings alongside the Old Great Square, but only on the southern side because the blocks on the northern side changed to Porthaninpuisto after the fire. There are four historical buildings which the City of Turku restored for cultural use: the Brinkkala Mansion, Old Town Hall, Hjelt Mansion and Juselius Mansion. The buildings were mainly constructed after the fire and represent neoclassicism.\n\n\n== Historical buildings ==\n\n\n=== Brinkkala Mansion ===\nThe Brinkala Mansion is best known for the traditional proclamation of Christmas Peace, which has been given from the Brinkkala Mansion balcony each Christmas Eve at 12:00 since 1886. Prior to that, Christmas peace was proclaimed from the \"doors and windows of the town hall\" as the old saying went. The wooden balcony known as the Christmas peace balcony was added to the Brinkkala facade during renovations from 1884 to 1886. The declaration started in the 14th century. The earliest information about the Brinkkala Mansion is from the 16th century when it was a town house of the owner of Brinkhall Manor in Kakskerta. Before its renovations from 1884 to 1886, it was a hotel, town hall and Turku police station. Nowadays, it is a space for art galleries and banquet halls. There is a coffee house located in the courtyard. The Turku Medieval Market also takes place in the courtyard.\n\n\n=== Old Town Hall ===\nIt is assumed that the City of Turku administrative centre was headquartered at the Old Town Hall since the 14th century. The most famous of the Turku town halls was the stone building planned by master bricklayer Samuel Berner, finished in 1736. Berner's town hall was destroyed by the fire of 1827, along with its bell tower. A private house was built upon the walls of the badly destroyed building, this house being acquired by factory owner Juselius in the 1850s. The building was redone into a three story factory in 1899, which was active until the 1920s. In 1932, the building was acquired by the City of Turku, and was for police department use. Nowadays, it is a space for galleries and a banquet hall and concerts.\n\n\n=== Hjelt Mansion ===\nAfter the fire, Captain Hjelt bought the site along the town square, and built the impressive two story stone building in 1830. The Hjelt Mansion is the only remaining stone building in Finland which clearly represents the St. Petersburg empire style. The Hjelt Mansion was taken over by the City of Turku in the 1930s, at which time both stories were used by the police department. After this, the downstairs level was a used as the children's and young adult's section of Turku City Library, and the Turku Cultural Centre worked in the upstairs level. The library section moved to the new building of Turku Main Library and the Turku Cultural Centre moved next door to the Old Town Hall.\nFour Baltic sea organisations moved into the building at the beginning of 2008: UBC Environment and Sustainable Development Secretariat, WHO Healthy Cities, Centrum Balticum and Valonia. The building was officially designated as the It\u00e4meritalo (\"Baltic Sea house\") on 19 August 2008.\n\n\n=== Juselius Manor ===\n\nThe new renaissance Juselius Mansion is the newest of the buildings in the area. It was built by Carl Fredrik Juselius in 1892, originally as his home. It has been a residential building for city officials, space for the police department and a dociros office. Nowadays, the building is used for other purposes, such as the legendary restaurant Teini.\n\n\n=== Katedralskolan i \u00c5bo ===\nKatedralskolan i \u00c5bo is a Swedish-language senior high school, built after the fire on the foundation of the former Hovr\u00e4tt by C.L. Engel. Its style is empire. There reportedly was a school under the authority of Turku Cathedral in the Turku city centre in late 13th century called Turun katedraalikoulu.\n\n\n== Events ==\nThere are different events organised at the Old Great Square throughout the year. Turku Medieval Market is organised in June and July, stretching out to Porthaninpuisto, the courtyard and Luostarin V\u00e4likatu. Christmas City events also take place for three weekends  as well as events for Turku Night of the Arts.\n\n\n== Prospects ==\nThe Old Great Square and its historical surroundings have been designed to be marketed as the old part of the city of Turku. Under EU protection, the idea is to revive the area to a European style by attracting more cafes and restaurants and organising different events at the square and park. Furthermore, a bridge called Pennisilta, to replace the one destroyed by the fire, is due to be built to connect the old part of the city to the traffic centre.\n\n\n== Photo gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sources ==\n \nTurun Sanomat\nTurun kaupungin kulttuurikeskus\n\n\n== External links ==\nTurku Cultural Centre\nIhmiselle parempi keskusta -hanke",

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

        "wiki": "Henry (Finnish: Henrik; Swedish: Henrik; Latin: Henricus; died c. 20 January 1156) was a medieval English clergyman. He came to Sweden with Cardinal Nicholas Breakspeare in 1153 and was most likely designated to be the new Archbishop of Uppsala, but the independent church province of Sweden could only be established in 1164 after the civil war, and Henry would have been sent to organize the Church in Finland, where Christians had already existed for two centuries.\nAccording to legend, he entered Finland together with King Saint Eric of Sweden and died as a martyr, becoming a central figure in the local Catholic Church. However, the authenticity of the accounts of his life and ministry are widely disputed and there are no historical records of his birth, existence or death.\nTogether with his alleged murderer, peasant Lalli, Henry is an important figure in the early history of Finland. His feast is celebrated by the majority Lutheran Church of Finland, as well as by the Catholic Church of Finland. He is commemorated in the liturgical calendars of several Protestant and Anglican churches.\n\n\n== Legend ==\n\n\n=== Vita and miracula ===\nThe legend of Bishop Henry's life, or his Vita, was written 150 years after his time, at the end of the 13th century, and contains little concrete information about him. He is said to have been an English-born bishop in Uppsala at the time of King Eric the Saint of Sweden in the mid-12th century, ruling the peaceful kingdom with the king in heavenly co-existence. To tackle the perceived threat from the non-Christian Finns, Eric and Henry were forced to do battle with them. After they had conquered Finland, baptized the people and built many churches, the victorious king returned to Sweden while Henry (Henricus) remained with the Finns, more willing to live the life of a preacher than that of a high bishop.The legend draws to a conclusion as Henry attempted to give a canonical punishment to a murderer. The accused man became enraged and killed the bishop, who was thus considered to be a martyr.The legend strongly emphasizes that Henry was a Bishop of Uppsala, not a Bishop of Finland which became a conventional claim later on, also by the church itself. He stayed in Finland out of pity, but was never appointed as a bishop there. The legend does not state whether there had been bishops in Finland before his time or what happened after his death; it does not even mention his burial in Finland. The vita is so void of any concrete information about Finland that it could have been created anywhere. The Latin is scholastic and the grammar is in general exceptionally good.\n\nHenry's Vita is followed by the more local miracula, a list of eleven miracles that various people were said to have experienced sometime after the bishop's death. With the exception of a priest in Skara who suffered a stomach ache after mocking Henry, all miracles seem to have taken place in Finland. The other miracles, which usually occurred following prayer to Bishop Henry, were:\nThe murderer lost his scalp when he put the bishop's hat on his head\nThe Bishop's finger was found the next Spring\nA boy was raised from the dead in Kaisala\nA girl was raised from the dead in Vehmaa\nA sick woman was healed in Sastamala\nA Franciscan called Erlend had his headache healed\nA blind woman got back her eyesight in Kyr\u00f6\nA man with a paralyzed leg could walk again in Kyr\u00f6\nA sick girl was healed\nA group of fishermen from Kokem\u00e4ki survived a stormMost versions of Henry's legend only include a selection of these miracles.\n\n\n=== Development of the legend ===\n\nHenry and his crusade to Finland were also a part of the legend of King Eric. The appendix of the early 13th century V\u00e4stg\u00f6talagen, which has a short description of Eric's memorable deeds, also makes no reference to Henry or the crusade. Henry and the crusade do not appear until a version of Eric's legend that dates to 1344. Similarities in the factual content and phraseology regarding the common events indicate that either one of the legends has acted as the model for the other. Henry's legend is commonly considered to have been written during the 1280s or 1290s at the latest, for the consecration of the Cathedral of Turku in 1300, when his alleged remains were translated there from Nousiainen, a parish not far from Turku.\n\n\n==== Absence from the historical record ====\nYet, even as late as in the 1470s, the crusade legend was ignored in the Chronica regni Gothorum, a chronicle of the history of Sweden, written by Ericus Olai, the Canon of the Uppsala cathedral.Noteworthy in the development of the legend is that the first canonically elected Bishop of Turku, Johan (1286\u20131289) of Polish origin, was elected as the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1289, after three years in office in Turku. The Swedish bishops of Finland before him, Bero, Ragvald and Kettil, had apparently been selected by the King of Sweden. Related to the new situation was also the appointment of the king's brother as the Duke of Finland in 1284, which challenged the Bishop's earlier position as the sole authority on all local matters. Johan was followed in Turku by Bishop Magnus (1291\u20131308), who had been born in Finland.In 1291 a document by the cathedral chapter makes no reference to Henry even though it mentions the cathedral and election of the new bishop many times. A papal letter by Pope Nicholas IV from 1292 has the Virgin Mary as the sole patrona in Turku.\n\n\n==== Appearance in the historical record ====\nThe first mention of Bishop Henry in historical sources is from 1298, when he is mentioned along with king Eric in a document from a provincial synod of Uppsala in Telge. This document, although mentioned many times as a source over the centuries, was not correctly dated until 1910.\n\nThe legend itself is also first referred in a letter by the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1298, where Eric and Henry are mentioned together as martyrs who needed to be prayed to for the sake of the situation in Karelia, associating their alleged crusade to Finland with the new expeditions against Novgorod. The war between Novgorod and Sweden for the control of Karelia had started in 1293. The first certain appearance of Henry's image in the seal of the Bishop of Turku is not until 1299.The first mention of Henry of Uppsala being the patron saint of Turku cathedral is not until 14 August 1320, when he is mentioned as the second patron of the cathedral after Virgin Mary. When he is later addressed by Pope Boniface IX as the patronus of the Cathedral of Turku along with the Virgin Mary, and referred to as a saint, it was in the year 1391.  Some sources claim that Henry was canonized in 1158, but this information has been traced to a late publication by Johannes Vastovius in 1623 and is generally regarded as a fabrication.Thus, Henry's veneration as a saint and his relation to King Eric seem to have emerged in the historical record at the same time in the mid-1290s with strong support from the church. This correlates with the start of the war against Novgorod. Sources do not support the popular assumption that Henry's cult developed in Nousiainen and gradually spread among ordinary people before official adoption. In 1232, the church in Nousiainen was consecrated only to the Virgin Mary, and it was not until 1452 that Henry was mentioned as the patronus of Nousiainen.\n\n\n=== Veneration ===\n\nDespite the high-profile start of Henry's cultus, it took more than 100 years for the veneration of Saint Henry to gain widespread acceptance throughout Sweden. As of 1344 there were no relics of the bishop in the Cathedral of Uppsala. According to one biographer, Henry's veneration was rare outside the Diocese of Turku throughout the 14th century. Vadstena Abbey near Link\u00f6ping seems to have played a key role in establishment of Henry's legend elsewhere in Sweden in the early 15th century. Henry never received the highest totum duplex veneration in Uppsala nor was he made a patronus of the church there, which status he had both in Turku and Nousiainen.At the end of the Roman Catholic era in Sweden, Henry was well established as a local saint. The dioceses in Sweden and elsewhere venerating Henry were as follows, categorized by his local ranking:\nTotum duplex: Turku, Link\u00f6ping, Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s\nDuplex: Uppsala, Lund (Denmark), V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, V\u00e4xj\u00f6\nSemiduplex: Nidaros (Norway)\nSimplex: SkaraHenry seems to have been known in northern Germany, but he was largely ignored elsewhere in the Roman Catholic world.\n\nIn the Bishopric of Turku, the annual feast day of Henry was January 20 (talviheikki, \"Winter Henry\"), according to traditions the day of his death. Elsewhere his memorial was held already on January 19, since more prominent saints were already commemorated on January 20. After the Reformation, Henry's day was moved to the 19th in Finland as well. The existence of the feast day is first mentioned in 1335, and is known to have been marked in the liturgical calendar from the early 15th century onwards. Another memorial was held on June 18 (kes\u00e4heikki, \"Summer Henry\") which was the day of the translation of his relics to the Cathedral of Turku.\nGaudeamus omnes (\"Let all rejoice\"), a Gregorian introit for the Mass in honor of Henry has survived within the late 14th or early 15th century Graduale Aboense.\n\n\n=== Political dimensions ===\n\nAccording to legend, establishment of the church of Finland was entirely the work of the saint-king Eric of Sweden, assisted by the bishop from the most important diocese in the country. The first half of the legend describes how the king and the bishop ruled Sweden like 'two great lights' with feelings of 'internal love' toward each other, emphasizing the peaceful coexistence of the secular and ecclesiastical rule during a happy era when 'predatory wolves' could not hit their 'poisonous teeth against the innocent'. The reality was quite different \u2013 Eric's predecessor, Eric himself and two of his successors were all murdered almost within a decade, one of the bloodiest times for the Swedish royalty. In the 1150s, the Bishop of Uppsala was also in a bitter fight with the Bishop of Link\u00f6ping over which see would become archiepiscopal. The crusade itself is described as a brief and bloodless event that was only performed to bring the \"blind and evil heathen people of Finland\" under Christian order.The writer of the legend seems to have been especially interested in presenting the bishop as a humble martyr. He has fully ignored his place of death and burial and other \"domestic\" Finnish interests, which were much more apparent in folk traditions. The legend and folk traditions eventually influenced each other, and the church gradually adopted many additional details to its saint bishop.\n\n\n== Folk traditions ==\nAmong the many folk traditions about Henry, the most prominent is the folk poem \"The Death-lay of Bishop Henry\" (Piispa Henrikin surmavirsi). The poem almost completely ignores Henry's life and ministry and concentrates on his death.\n\n\n=== Henry's origins ===\nAccording to the poem, Henry had grown up in \"Cabbage Land\" (Kaalimaa), which has puzzled Finnish historians for centuries. The name might be connected to a coastal area in northern Finland Proper called Kaland, which is also mentioned in conjunction with an unrelated early preacher in Vesilahti, upper Satakunta, whose local name was \"Fish of Kaland\" (Kalannin kala, also known as Hunnun herra). Bishop Mikael Agricola wrote in his Se Wsi Testamenti in 1548, that the earliest Swedish settlers in Finland had come from Gotland to the islets on the coast of Kaland, being harassed by Finns and seeking help from their relatives in Sweden.It has also been suggested that the name might be related to Gaelic, which would presumably have referred to the bishop's Scottish origins, though the legend gives him as a native Englishman.Folk traditions have no information on the crusade whatsoever. King Eric is briefly mentioned in the death-lay's preface as Henry's concerned \"brother\". Henry appears as a lone preacher who moved around southwestern Finland more or less on his own. Besides the name, he has only little in common with the Henry in the church vita.Kokem\u00e4ki is often mentioned in traditions as a place where Henry preached. Kokem\u00e4ki was later one the central parishes in Satakunta. This province was first mentioned in historical documents in 1331.\n\n\n=== Death and burial ===\n\nThe death-lay's version of the bishop's death was different from the vita. The bishop's killer was called Lalli. Lalli's wife Kerttu falsely claimed to him that upon leaving the manor, their ungrateful guest Henry, travelling around on his own in the middle of winter, had without permission or recompense, through violence, taken food, cake from the oven and beer from the cellar, for himself and hay for his horse, and left nothing but ashes. This is supposed to have enraged Lalli so that he immediately grabbed his skis and went in pursuit of the thief, finally chasing Henry down on the ice of Lake K\u00f6yli\u00f6nj\u00e4rvi in Eura. There he killed him on the spot with an axe. Lalli then proceeded to steal the late holy man's hat, called a mitre, and place it on his own head. When Lalli's mother questioned him about where he found the hat, he attempted to take it off, but with it came his scalp. Lalli then died a painful death. The 17th century lay version smugly comments that:\n\nThe 17th century lay version of the tale was intended to be performed during the annual pilgrimage along Henrik's final route.\nIn some versions of the poem, considered older, Lalli's weapon was a sword. The axe was the murder weapon of Saint Olaf, who was very popular in Finland and may have influenced Henry's legend. However, since Lalli is not portrayed as a member of the upper class, it is unlikely that he possessed an expensive weapon like a sword, and the axe is a more historically likely choice for Henry's murder.\nBefore his death, Henry instructed the coachman to gather his remaining body parts in a cloth tied with blue string, place it in a cart drawn by a stallion. When the stallion broke, he was to replace it with an ox, and when the ox stopped, he was to build a church. This is where Henrik's remains were to be buried.\nMedieval folk traditions enumerate the pestilences and misfortunes which befell Lalli after his slaying of the bishop. His hair and scalp are said to have fallen out as he took off the bishop's cap, taken as a trophy. Removing the bishop's ring from his finger, just bones remained. Eventually he ran into a lake and drowned himself.\n\n\n=== Development of folk traditions ===\nBasically the death-lay is a simple story of a short-tempered man who falls victim of his \"bad-mouthed wife's\" sharp tongue. The poem has no pity for Lalli, and he is not depicted as a hero in a story whose true antagonist is Kerttu. The depiction of Henry's death built on an independent tradition that was once in direct competition with that of the legend, which is largely forgotten today. It remains unknown whether the two traditions were built around the same person.The poem, following the traditional Kalevala metre, has survived as several 17th and 18th century literations from various parts of Finland. Some of its elements appear in earlier works, but it hardly dates older than the vita. There is debate on whether the original poem was constructed by one or more individuals. The writer has however had superficial understanding of the church legends.Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are originally German names, which might indicate that the poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose influence is visible in other aspects, too. The way Lalli is manipulated to commit the crime and what happens to him later seem to be taken from a medieval Judas fable. Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.Based on finds from medieval church ruins in the tiny island of Kirkkokari (\"Church Rock\", previously known as the \"Island of Saint Henry\") in Lake K\u00f6yli\u00f6nj\u00e4rvi, the bishop's veneration began in the latter half of the 14th century, well after Henry had received his official status as a local saint, and 200 years after his alleged death. A small granary in the nearby Kokem\u00e4ki, claimed to have been the bishop's place of rest the night before his death, could not be dated earlier than the late 15th century in dendrochronological examinations.However, the poem's claim that Henry was buried in Nousiainen was already held to be true around 1300, when his alleged bones were translated from Nousiainen to the Cathedral of Turku. A mid-15th century Chronicon episcoporum Finlandensium also confirmed K\u00f6yli\u00f6 as the place of his death. Neither place is mentioned in the vita in any way. The church seems to have gradually complemented its own legends by adopting elements from the folk traditions, especially during the 15th century.\n\n\n== Historical sources ==\nToday, the legend of Henry is challenged by some historians to the point of being labelled as pure imagination. Completely invented saints were not exceptional in Europe, and there is no direct evidence of either the crusade or Henry.The bishop's alleged violent death however, is no reason to doubt his potential existence, as many bishops were murdered during the turmoils of the 12th and 13th centuries, although most were not elevated to sainthood. Saxo Grammaticus said of the Battle of Fotevik in 1134 that never had so many bishops been killed at the same time. Notable bishops that died violently included the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1187, Bishop of Estonia in 1219 and Bishop of Link\u00f6ping in 1220.\n\n\n=== Bishop of Uppsala ===\nThere is no historical record of a Bishop of Uppsala called Henry during the reign of King Eric (about 1156\u20131160). Early phases of the diocese remain obscure up to the point of Stefan, who was appointed as the archbishop in 1164.A certain Henry is mentioned in Incerti scriptoris Sueci chronicon primorum in ecclesia Upsalensi archiepiscoporum, a chronicle of Uppsala archbishops, before Coppmannus and Stefan, but after Sverinius (probably mentioned in German sources in 1141/2 as \"Siwardus\"), Nicolaus and Sweno. Besides the name, the chronicle knows that he was martyred and buried in Finland in the Cathedral of Turku. Latest research dates the chronicle to the early 15th century when Henry's legend was already established in the kingdom, leaving only little significance to its testimony.\n\nA late 15th century legenda nova claimed that Henry had come to Sweden in the retinue of papal legate Nicholas Breakspear, the later Pope Adrian IV, and appointed as the Bishop of Uppsala by him. Even though legenda nova states 1150 as the year of the crusade, it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. It is not known whether this was just an inference by the writer, based on the fact that also Nicholas was an Englishman. However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in Uppsala. Another claim by legenda nova was that Henry was translated to Turku cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s. In the late 16th century, Bishop Paulus Juusten claimed that Henry had been the Bishop of Uppsala for two years before the crusade. Based on these postulates, early 20th-century historians assembled 1155 as the year of the crusade and 1156 as the year of Henry's death. Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.Contradicting these claims, the medieval Annales Suecici Medii Aevi and the 13th century legend of Saint Botvid mention some Henry as the Bishop of Uppsala (Henricus scilicet Upsalensis) in 1129, participating in the consecration of the saint's newly built church. He is apparently the same Bishop Henry who died at the Battle of Fotevik in 1134, fighting along with the Danes after being banished from Sweden. Known from the Chronicon Roskildense written soon after his death and from Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum from the early 13th century, he had fled to Denmark from Sigtuna, the see of the early Uppland bishops before it was moved a few kilometers to its later location in Uppsala sometime before 1164. He is ignored in all Swedish bishop chronicles, unless he is the same Henry who was later redated to the 1150s. That would make the claim about him coming to Finland with King Eric a late innovation, where memory about a killed bishop in Uppsala sometime in the 12th century was reused in a new context.Noteworthy also, is a story written down by Adam of Bremen in his Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church) from 1075/6 about a certain foreigner called Hericus, who was slain and martyred while preaching among the Sueones. Adam had heard the story from King Sweyn II of Denmark. According to some historians, resemblance to later legend about an English-born Henricus, who was allegedly slain and martyred in Finland, is too striking to be a coincidence.\n\n\n=== Bishop of Finland ===\nNo historical source remains that would confirm the existence of a bishop named Henry in Finland. However, papal letters mentioning an unidentified Bishop of Finland in 1209, 1221, 1229 and 1232 have survived. Some copies of another papal letter from 1232 call the bishop as \"N.\", but the letter \"N\" may originally have also been something resembling it. The first certainly known Bishop of Finland is Thomas, who is first mentioned in 1234. It is however possible, that Fulco, the Bishop of Estonia mentioned in sources from 1165 and 1171, was the same as Folquinus, a legendary Bishop of Finland at the end of the 12th century, but this remains only a theory.\n\nNo Bishop or Diocese of Finland is mentioned in a papal letter from 1171 (or 1172) by the seemingly well-informed Pope Alexander III, who otherwise addressed the situation of the church in Finland. The Pope mentions that there were preachers, presumably from Sweden, working in Finland and was worried about their bad treatment by the Finns. The Pope had earlier in 1165 authorized the first missionary Bishop of Estonia to be appointed, and was a close acquaintance of both Eskil, the Archbishop of Lund, and Stefan, the Archbishop of Uppsala, who both had spent time with him in France where he had been exiled in the 1160s. Following the situation in Estonia, the Pope personally interfered in the Estonian mission in 1171, ordering assistance for the local Bishop Fulco from Norway.No surviving list of bishops or dioceses under the Archbishop of Uppsala from 1164, 1189, 1192, 1233, 1241 or 1248 contains any reference to Finland, neither factual or propagandist. No claim about a Swedish bishop in Finland is made in any other source from the era prior to the so-called Second Swedish Crusade in 1249.\n\nThe first mention of a bishop in Finland is from a papal letter in 1209. It was sent to Archbishop Anders of Lund by Pope Innocent III as a reply to the Archbishop's earlier letter which has not survived. According to the Archbishop, the Bishop of the newly established church in Finland was dead, apparently from natural causes since his passing away is mentioned to have been \"lawful\", and the see had been vacant for some time. The Archbishop had complained to the Pope how difficult it was to get anyone to be a bishop in Finland and planned to appoint someone without formal adequacy, who was already working in Finland. The Pope approved of Archbishop's suggestion without questioning his opinions. It is noteworthy that the Archbishop of Uppsala, Valerius (1207\u20131219/1224), was also in Denmark at the time, temporarily exiled from Sweden after having allied with the deposed King Sverker, yet another exile in Denmark.Whether the appointment of the said preacher ever took place, remains unknown. Note should be taken that the King of Sweden at the time was Eric, a grandson of his better known namesake Eric the Saint. Eric had taken over Sweden in 1208 and was crowned king two years later. The Pope who had strongly sided with Sverker, ignored him at first, but finally recognized him in 1216, commenting many requests that he had apparently made ever since having taken the office. Based on the papal letter that year, Eric seems to have had a plan to invade some country that allegedly had been \"taken from the heathens by his predecessors\" and was allowed to install a bishop there. Similar letters were sent to the King of Denmark in 1208 and 1218, who is known to have meant Estonia both times. Sweden also attacked Estonia in 1220. Eric died of illness 1216. Almost nothing is known about his time as the king.Nevertheless, someone was eventually appointed and installed as the new bishop, since Pope Honorius III sent a letter directly to an unnamed Bishop of Finland in 1221. According to the letter, Archbishop Valerius had followed the situation in Finland and sent a report to the Pope, worried about a threat from unidentified \"barbarians\". It is notable that when the Pope quoted Valerius in his letter, he calls the church in Finland to have been established \"newly\", the same claim that Anders had made 12 years earlier. The list of Swedish bishops which survives from this era is from king John Sverkerson's coronation from the year 1219 and it mentions the bishops which have been present at the coronation. Finland as well as W\u00e4xj\u00f6 are not among those five, which so seem to have been all the bishops of the Swedish realm at that time. So the Finnish bishop's possible position under Uppsala's primacy is highly improbable.Despite so many high-ranking church representatives being involved in the 1209/1221 arrangements, later chronicles are fully ignorant on the situation in Finland at the time, or if there was even a bishop then. The first 13th-century bishop is said to have been Thomas, and his predecessor remains unknown. According to 15th and 16th century chronicles, Henry was followed by bishops Rodulff and Folquinus, after whom there was a 25\u201330-year gap before Thomas. However, according to the papal letter Ex tuarum no such gap has ever existed, since the archbishop of Lund\nwas given the right to anoint a new bishop to Finland in 1209 after the death of the previous. So the logic and datings of the sixteenth-century writers must be esteemed as false. The date 1209 is far too early for a Dominican like Thomas to step into the office, and so Rodolphus, the first real bishop of Finland and his successor Folquinus must be considered as 13th-century bishops nominated and appointed by the Danish and not by the Swedes. As an extra proof of this the ancient Finnish taxation system of church taxes has its roots in Denmark, not in Sweden. And the same goes to lay taxes especially in the \u00c5land Islands and to the old Finnish monetary system. As J. W. Ruuth already nearly a hundred years ago pointed out, Finland was at that time a Danish and not a Swedish mission territory, where the Danes according to the Danish annals made there expeditions in 1191, 1202 and possible even 1210\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Relics ===\n\nHenry was allegedly buried in Nousiainen, from where his bones\u2014or at least something that was thought to be his bones\u2014were transported to Turku in 1300. In addition to traditions, the only source connecting Nousiainen to early bishops is a letter signed by Bishop Thomas in Nousiainen in 1234. Archaeological excavations of pre-Catholic cemeteries in Nousiainen and surrounding parishes show a clear discontinuation of traditions in the early 13th century, but no abrupt changes are apparent in the religious environment among the 12th century finds.Whatever the case, the bishop's grave seems to have been traced to Nousiainen latest after his elevation to sainthood. A number of medieval documents mention that the bishop's grave continued to be located in the local church, presumably meaning that all the bones had not been translated to Turku. The church was later adorned with a grandiose 15th century cenotaph, whose replica can be found in the National Museum of Finland in Helsinki.\n\nMost of the bones in Turku were still in place in 1720 when they were catalogued for a transfer to Saint Petersburg during the Russian occupation of Finland in the Great Northern War. The man behind the idea was Swedish Count Gustaf Otto Douglas who had defected to the Russian side during the war and was in charge of the grim occupation of Finland. What happened to the bones after that, remains unknown. According to some sources, the Russian vessel transporting the relics sank on the way. However, it is generally acknowledged that a piece of Henry's ulna had been placed in Bishop Hemming's reliquarium that was built in 1514 and treasured in the cathedral. Also enclosed was a piece of parchment stating the bone belonged to Henry. During the restoration work of the cathedral, the relic was relocated to the National Board of Antiquities. It was later placed inside the altar of St. Henry's Cathedral in Helsinki.In 1924, several other bones, including a jawless skull, were found in a sealed closet in the Cathedral of Turku. These are also referred to as Henry's relics in popular media and even by the church, even though that designation remains speculative and the bones may have belonged to some other saint. The bones are currently stored in the Cathedral of Turku.\n\n\n=== Henry's status today ===\n\nAlthough Henry has never been officially canonized, he has been referred to as a saint since as early as 1296 according to a papal document of the time, and continues to be called as such today as well. On the basis of the traditional accounts of Henry's death, his recognition as saint took place prior to the founding of the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints and the official canonization process of the Roman Catholic Church. Henry is currently commemorated on January 19 on the calendar of commemorations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada. January 19 is also Henry's name day in Sweden and Finland. He continues to be remembered as a local observance in the Catholic Church of Finland, where the cathedral church is dedicated to Henry's memory. The cathedral was consecrated in 1860 and is headed by fr. Marco Pasinato.The Kirkkokari island in Lake K\u00f6yli\u00f6nj\u00e4rvi remains the only Catholic place of pilgrimage in Finland, with a memorial service held every year on second Sunday in June before the Midsummer festival. Also the medieval 140 km countryside route, the Saint Henry's Way, from K\u00f6yli\u00f6 to Nousiainen has been marked all the way for people willing to walk through it. Association of \"Ecumenical pilgrimage of St. Henry\" has been organized around the event.Based on folk traditions about the bishop's activities, the municipalities of Nousiainen, K\u00f6yli\u00f6 and Kokem\u00e4ki use images from Henry's legend in their coats of arms.Today, Henry and his alleged murderer Lalli remain two of the best-known persons from the medi\u00e6val history of Finland.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSaint Henry, Bishop of Finland, patron saint archive\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAgricola, Mikael (1987), Mikael Agricolan teokset 1, ISBN 951-0-13900-9\nAndresen, Lembit (2002) [1997], Eesti Ajalugu I\u2013II. 1997.

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

        "wiki": "F\u00f6ri is a ferry running across the River Aura in Turku, Finland. The ferry was completed in 1903, and it is the oldest vehicle still in daily operation in Finland. F\u00f6ri is also the only municipally owned ferry in Finland. The name \"F\u00f6ri\" is derived either from the Swedish word \"f\u00e4rja\", or from the English word \"ferry\".If the river freezes over and the ice is thicker than 30 cm, the ferry is replaced by an ice bridge.\n\n\n== History ==\nF\u00f6ri was built at the Ab Vulcan in 1903 to suit the needs of the employees at the Barker factory in Turku on the shore of the River Aura. The ferry was originally driven by steam engines fed from a woodfired boiler. In 1955 the steam engines were replaced by diesel engines. The ferry was operated by the City of Turku till 2008, when the operation was outsourced to West Coast Seaservices.In 2015 it was announced that the two diesel engines powering the F\u00f6ri would be replaced by electric motors. The old engines consumed 7500\u20138000 litres of fuel each year, with the average speed of ~2 km/h. According to the manufacturer Visedo Oy, the new electric engines should consume around 3-4 kW/h, depending on the season. The average speed will remain unchanged and the ferry will still have dual motors for redundancy. Each of the two engines consists of a DC/DC converter to increase the voltage from the batteries, and a permanent magnet motor drive to transform the electrical signal into mechanical energy. Both of the two motors can also be used simultaneously if more power is needed due to e.g. ice conditions. The new system is also eight tonnes lighter than the diesel engines and hydraulic motor it has replaced. This retrofit was done by Mobimar Oy, and it took place in the spring of 2017.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nF\u00f6ri, the City Ferry\nReal-time running data",

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

Pietil\u00e4 was one of the most influential people in Finnish graphic arts, and her work has been shown in numerous art exhibitions. She worked as a teacher in the Academy of Fine Arts, Helsinki, for many years, and later trained graphic artists and wrote instructional books about graphic arts.\nPietil\u00e4 began her studies at Turku Drawing School (now TUAS Arts Academy of Turku University of Applied Sciences), which she attended from 1933 to 1936, and went on to study at the drawing school of the Finnish Art Association (1936\u20131940), the University College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm (1945\u20131949) and the Fernand L\u00e9ger Art Academy in Paris (1949\u20131953). During her studies, she met her future life partner Tove Jansson; they collaborated on many works and projects, including the Moomin works, in collaboration with Pentti Eistola. These are now exhibited at the Moomin Museum in Tampere.\nJansson's and Pietil\u00e4's travels and summers spent together on the Klovharu island in Pellinki have been captured on several hours of film, shot by Pietil\u00e4. Several documentaries have been made of this footage, the latest being Haru, yksin\u00e4inen saari (Haru, the lonely island) (1998) and Tove ja Tooti Euroopassa (Tove and Tooti in Europe) (2004).\nThe first exhibition of Pietil\u00e4's work was in Turku in 1935. Her first private exhibition was in 1951. She has participated in the Purnu group's summer exhibitions since 1967, with a retrospective exhibition in 1986. She has also participated in several exhibitions abroad. Pietil\u00e4 has gained praise for her work; she was awarded the Pro Finlandia medal in 1963 and the title of professor in 1982.Pietil\u00e4 inspired the energetic figure Tooticky in Jansson's Moomin books. The architect Reima Pietil\u00e4 was Tuulikki Pietil\u00e4's brother.Pietil\u00e4 died at her home on 23 February 2009.\n\n\n== References ==",

The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

The Eurasian lynx is a permanent resident of Kurjenrahka, but brown bears and gray wolves have also been observed and are known to reside in areas within or close to the park. Marked trails in the general area extend to over 300 km.In Middle Ages the forests were jointly owned by the local parish. In early 1800s two manors bought them, but they had financially hard times and had to sell them to the state before end of the 19th century.

        "wiki": "\u00c5bo Svenska Theater (\u00c5bo Svenska Teater) is a Finland-Swedish theatre in the city of Turku in Finland and the oldest theatre in the country, founded in 1839. The building itself is also the oldest still functioning theatre house in Finland. The name means \"The Swedish theatre of \u00c5bo\"; \u00c5bo is the Swedish name of the city of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku was the capital city of Finland during Finland's epoch as a part of Sweden, and Swedish theatre companies visited Finland during the 18th-century, the first of whom was the Stenborg Troupe in 1761and the company of Carl Seuerling in the 1780s. There where however, no proper theatre building until the Bonuviers Teater was erected in the 1810s. When the old theatre was destroyed during the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, there was a need of a new theater house.  \n\n\n=== 1839-1894 ===\nThe theatre has been located in its present building since 1839, when it was opened by a local amateur society with the play Gubben i Bergsbygden the 21 January 1839.  Later that same year, the theatre house was used by its first professional theatre company, that of Ulrik Torsslow, and its first professional concert singer, Betty Boije.  In 1843, concerts by Johanna von Schoultz and Jenny Lind where both performed on its stage.Prior to 1894, the theatre did not have a permanent staff, as Finland did not have any native actors at this point, and during the 19th-century the theatre house was used by travelling theatre companies from Sweden. The most notable of these were the company of Pierre Deland, which visited the theatre regularly from 1840 to 1861, as well as the so called \"Finnish Company\" of Edvard Stjernstr\u00f6m, which enjoyed theatre monopoly in Southern Finland in 1850-53. In the 1870s and 1880s, the famed Swedish company of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Elfforss frequnelty visited the theatre. The first native theatre company performed in the theatre was the company of August Westermark in 1872, though it was not to be until 1894, that the first performance was given by a permanent native ensemble at the theatre.\n\n\n== Activity ==\nThe theatre building is owned by Stiftelsen f\u00f6r \u00c5bo Akademi and it is run by \u00c5bo Svenska Teaterf\u00f6rening.\nThe theatre has three formal stages; Stora Scenen, with 365 seats, Studioscenen with 136 seats, and Tiljan-scenen, with a maximum of one hundred seats, as well as local activity.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links and sources ==\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\nNordensvan, Georg, Svensk teater och svenska sk\u00e5despelare fr\u00e5n Gustav III till v\u00e5ra dagar.

        "wiki": "Ruissalo (Finnish; Runsala in Swedish) is an island in the Archipelago Sea and a district of the city of Turku, Finland. The island is located to the south-west of the city, between Hirvensalo and Pansio in the mainland. It is rather sparsely populated, having a population of only 126 (as of 2004), with an annual growth rate of 3.97%. The villas on the island are considered culturally and historically valuable in Finland. Some are used as guesthouses, some are owned and governed by the foundations, labor unions, sports teams, and private enterprises on the area, some can be rented freely for some days for private party such as weddings, some have cafeterias in them. Private ownership exists, a couple villas even have renters with very selective occupancy. Some villas have deteriorated for the high maintenance costs due to the historical building methods that must be used here. \nOne of the largest old oak forests in Finland is situated in the island and many parts of it are included in nature conservation programs.\nIn the westernmost part of the island there is a spa and a camping area. Turku golf course is situated also here. The Botanical garden of University of Turku is situated in the middle of the island. Near the southern tip of the western part of the island have once been a small, unofficial nude beach. Official nude beaches in Finland can only be found in Helsinki and in Pori.\n15.08% of the district's population are under 15 years old, while 13.49% are over 65. The district's linguistic makeup is 88.89% Finnish, 8.73% Swedish, and 2.38% other.\nThe island is probably most famous as the venue of the annual rock festival Ruisrock. The Paavo Nurmi Marathon route goes through Ruissalo.\n\n\n== External links ==\nRuissalo, in Finnish",

        "wiki": "Iso-Heikkil\u00e4 Observatory (Finnish: Iso-Heikkil\u00e4n t\u00e4htitorni) is an amateur astronomical observatory used by a local amateur astronomical association, Turun Ursa ry in the Iso-Heikkil\u00e4 district of Turku, Finland.\nReferred to as Turku Observatory (062) by the Minor Planet Center, it was previously operated by the University of Turku from 1937 to 1972, and is the observatory where several Finnish discoverers of minor planets made their observations.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe observatory was originally owned by the department of astronomy of the University of Turku. It was built in 1935 and 1936, and technically designed by physics and astronomy professor Yrj\u00f6 V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4. V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4's research team discovered a total of 807 minor planets and 7 comets at the observatory. V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 also contributed significantly to research in the areas of optics and surveying.\nAs the city expanded and a steel factory was built under a kilometer away from the observatory, the astronomy department of the university moved to Tuorla Observatory in the 1950s. \nIn the 1960s, an apartment building area was built in Iso-Heikkil\u00e4, preventing any observations of low-sky objects in all directions except north. Iso-Heikkil\u00e4 remained in the use of students for some time, until the university gave up its ownership completely in 1972. The observatory building and the site are now owned by the city of Turku.\nThe observatory is currently operated by Turun Ursa ry, an astronomical association founded by Yrj\u00f6 V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 in 1928. The association arranged in V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4's time and continues to arrange stargazing events for the general public at the observatory. The members use the observatory, as well as the Kevola Observatory, for amateur astronomical observations.\n\n\n== Instruments and facilities ==\nThe observatory has two 6-meter domes in the East-West direction. The main instruments of the association are located in the western dome: the 15 and 13 centimeter telescopes made by Yrj\u00f6 V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 and a 19 cm Schmidt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 camera. In the past, the dome has housed a 50 centimeter wide-angle camera which is nowadays located in the Kevola Observatory \u2013 it was the telescope used to discover the aforementioned minor planets and comets.\n\n\n== Standard baseline ==\nIn the forest further away from the observatory, about 200 metres (660 ft) to the northeast, is a concrete pillar used by Yrj\u00f6 V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 in the 1940s in his baseline measurements. The V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 comparator has been used in important baseline measurements around the world.\nAnother pillar that remains today is located 500 metres (1,600 ft) to the southwest from the previous one, in a forest across the railway.\n\n\n== External links ==\nTurun Ursa, amateur astronomers association\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

        "wiki": "Kultaranta (Swedish: Gullranda; lit.  '\"Golden Shore\"') is the summer residence of the president of Finland. It is in the district of Kultaranta on the island of Luonnonmaa, in Naantali. The granite manor house is surrounded by 560,000 square metres (6,027,790 sq ft) of park, belonging to the property.\nThe President of the Republic's summer residence, Kultaranta, stands in 54-hectare grounds in Naantali on the southwest coast. As well as the granite-built house, the complex includes numerous outbuildings and greenhouses, and a park.\nKultaranta's original owner was the businessman Alfred Kordelin, who had a manor house built for himself in 1914. It was designed by the architect Lars Sonck. When Kordelin died in 1917 the manor's ownership shifted to the University of Turku and, in 1922, the Finnish Parliament voted to acquire it for use as the president's summer residence.\nThe ground floor contains the reception rooms and private apartments. Upstairs are the bedrooms and guestrooms. Marble steps lead from the ground floor to the tower, from which there are views of Naantali and the inshore islands.\nThe parks around the manor, containing approximately a thousand square metres of greenhouse and a garden with 3,500 roses called Medaljonki ('medallion'), are open to the public. The scent and colour of these roses are at their peak in the middle of the summer, when the President and family and their guests come to Naantali for the holidays.  Tours in the garden are organised by the City of Naantali's tourist service.\nKultaranta's Park has been described as a \"mini-Versailles\". The parkland to the north of Kultaranta is in practically a natural state, though a few sandy pathways have been built there, and the woodland is kept in good condition.Kultaranta has about 1,000 square metres (10,764 sq ft) of greenhouses. The garden supplies the President's household with both flowers and vegetables all year round.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKultaranta [1], with pictures (in English)",

        "wiki": "Naantali (Finnish pronunciation: [\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0nt\u0251li]; Swedish: N\u00e5dendal) is a town in south-western Finland, known as one of the most important tourist centres of the country. The municipality has a population of 19,389\n(31 July 2020), and is located in the region of Southwest Finland, 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) west of Turku.\nThe town encompasses a land area of 311.50 square kilometres (120.27 sq mi). Most of this area is located on the islands, but the majority of the population lives on the mainland. Most of the islands are covered with forest and farmland, while the mainland consists chiefly of residential areas.\n\n\n== History ==\nOne of the oldest towns in Finland, Naantali was founded around the mediaeval Brigittine convent Vallis gratiae, the church of which still dominates its skyline. The charter was signed by King Christopher of Sweden, the then ruler of Finland, in 1443. The convent got trading rights and other privileges, and the town around it began to grow. It also became an important destination for pilgrimage.\nIn the 16th century, as Catholicism gave way to Protestantism as the official religion of Finland, the convent was closed, and the town plunged into a depression. This lasted until the mid-18th century, when the town got a tollgate and a customs chamber. In the two centuries of economic stagnation before that the town had become famous for its knitted stockings, a craft carried on from the times of the convent.\nThe year 1863 saw the founding of the spa at Cape Kalevanniemi, which raised the town's status as a holiday venue. In 1922, the Kultaranta estate on Luonnonmaa was made the official summer residence for the President of the Republic, after Finland had gained its independence five years earlier.\nThe municipalities of Merimasku, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4 and Velkua were consolidated with Naantali on January 1, 2009.\nThe per capita tax income of the town is the second highest of all towns in Finland, and the highest in the province of Southwest Finland.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Naantali is the fennicised version of the Swedish name of the town, N\u00e5dendal. The Swedish name was given as a direct translation from the Latin Vallis Gratiae which literally means \"The Valley of Grace\".\n\n\n== Tourism and points of interest ==\nThis interesting divide between urban and rural is perhaps one reason as to why the city has been named the most popular tourist centre in the country in numerous surveys. Another factor affecting this is the proximity of both Turku, the region's administrative centre and largest city, and of the archipelago.\nThere are some important points of interest in the city, such as the Moomin World theme park on the island of Kailo.\nNaantali Spa Hotel, the largest spa in the Nordic countries, and the Naantali\u2019s medieval convent stone church. The city's popularity as a tourist venue is highlighted by the fact that the official summer residence of the President of Finland, the Kultaranta estate, is located on Luonnonmaa.\nThe archipelago sea boat traffic is handled by S/S Ukkopekka. Old steamship cruise Naantali-Turku-Naantali.\nNaantali hosts an international music festival every June, and the traditional Sleepyhead Day carnival in July.\n\n\n== Other industries ==\nIn addition to tourism, the city's main industries are electricity production, oil refining, manufacturing, and services. The Port of Naantali is the third largest in Finland in terms of goods traffic, and the city is home to a power plant and an oil refinery owned by the government-controlled company Fortum and Neste.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2014 Sister cities ===\nNaantali is twinned with:\n\n Vadstena, Sweden\n Nordfyn, Denmark\n Svelvik, Norway\n Vesturbygg\u00f0, Iceland\n Puck, Poland\n Kirovsk, Russia\n\n\n== People ==\nKaarlo Heinonen (1878\u20131944)\nTeppo Rastio (born 1934)\nPekka Siitoin (1944\u20132003)\nKeijo Virtanen (born 1945)\nIlkka Kantola (born 1957)\nLauri Heikkil\u00e4 (born 1957)\nJukka Vilander (born 1962)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTown of Naantali \u2013 Official website\nNaantali Tourist Information Ltd\n Naantali travel guide from Wikivoyage\nNaantali Spa Hotel\nMoomin World\nVG-62",

        "wiki": "Albanian rock describes music in Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia and other Albanian-inhabited areas closely related to western rock. It has a wide variety of subgenres like pop rock, alternative rock, hard rock and metal. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1960s ===\nAmerican and British influence marked Albanian rock music in its first steps. The first known Albanian rock band was called Blue Star. They appeared in 1964 in Prishtin\u00eb and were later renamed as Modest\u00ebt (The Modests).\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\nIn the beginning of the 1970s, the rock scene present in Mitrovic\u00eb, Kosovo (then Yugoslavia) was made of Albanian and Serbian bands. Some of these bands, like MAK had both Albanian and Serbian musicians. Another bi-ethnic band was FAN also based in Mitrovic\u00eb. In 1978 the famous guitarist and composer Nexhat Macula formed one of the best Albanian rock bands of all time, called \"TNT\" in Mitrovica. Between 1978 and 2006 the band published ten albums.\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\nPrishtin\u00eb was the most important city for Albanian rock music during the 1980s. In the mainstream circles Gjurm\u00ebt (founded 1981) were among favourites. Their combination of rock with \"muzik\u00eb qytetare\" laid the foundation of Albanian rock. Other known bands that formed during this period were Ilir\u00ebt, 403, Telex, Seleksioni 039, Minatori and Menkis.\nUnderground rock leaned more towards punk music. The most notable underground rock/punk band of Pristina in the 1980s was Lindja with its lead musician Luan Osmani (lead guitar).\nIn Albania, the first rock concert was organised by Aleksand\u00ebr Gjoka in 1989.\nIn North Macedonia the main Albanian rock/punk band is considered to be Blla Blla Blla who were founded in 1989. Their influence can be seen not only in Albanian but also in Macedonian rock music. Another Albanian band from North Macedonia is Shekulli i Dreqit (The Devil's Century), who are a metal band from Struga.\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn Albania the most prominent rock bands and individuals only appeared after 1990. Before that period rock music was prohibited. Although youth groups found ways to listen it through clandestine channels.The first rock band in Albania was Megaherz which was founded by guitarist Bledar Sejko. After the fall of communism he went on to form Thunderway with Elton Deda. They were a Power/Speed Metal band who recorded their first rock album in Albania called \"The Executioner's Orders\", on cassette. Meanwhile, Bojken Lako was experimenting rock with his first band, The Fishhook, who released one album on cassette.\nSome notable rock bands include Akullthyesit (Icebreakers) from Elbasan (first rock album Lindja e Ujkut), Meteor from Durr\u00ebs, Djemt\u00eb e Detit, Albatros, Grupi X, and singers like Gjergj Jorgaqi (who sang for a short while for Thunderway), Redon Makashi and many others.\nGuttersnipe was a short-lived punk band from Tirana in the early 1990s (one song was released on the compilation Last Call for the Lost Scenes vol.1 7\" vinyl on Tian An Men 89 Records in France). The guitarist, Eduard Dashi, went on to play as a session musician, while the vocalist, Klodi Agostini emigrated to Denmark.\nA very popular and important band which remains solid until the present day, is CROSSBONES. Formed in the mid-1990s, the band reached a word-of-mouth reputation that culminated in August 1997 when they released their first and only official album to date. This was called Days of Rage. It was largely influenced by the turbulent times in Albania at the time and was the first ever album to be released and distributed in CD format in Albania. CROSSBONES have participated in countless live performances, both in Albania and abroad, such as in Skopje 1999 and Thessaloniki 2015 and are probably the only band from the 1990s that carried on producing music, despite numerous changes in their lineup. The original members that recorded the Days of Rage album and many other successful songs that have recently been included in a ten-song compilation album called Toxic Waste (2015), are: Olsi Ballta (vocals), Klod Shehu (guitars), Alban Male (drums, keyboards) and Arbi Xhelo (producer, guitarist) with Red Hasa and Fatjon Gjashta (bass). Other collaborators include Eduard Dashi, Andi Haxhihyseni, Gjergj Lena, Pol Flloko. Olsi Ballta and Klod Shehu remain the only long-lasting original members. They were joined by drummer Theo Napoloni in 2010 and guitarist Ben Turku in 2014, yielding a three-song single called \"Alive\" (2015). The band's distinctive style with powerful guitar riffs and vocals has influenced many following musicians and created many fans during their near 20 years of activity.\nThe beginning of the 1990s introduced other rock bands and individuals that played in Kosovo like Troja, Dardan Shkreli, Blla Blla Blla and Elita 5 (from North Macedonia).\nDuring parallel governance (1989\u20131999) and after the 1999 war in Kosovo several new bands emerged. Among the most famous are Diadema, KEK (\"Kreativ e jo Komercial\" = Crative and not commercial), 7me7, The Hithat, Cute Babulja, Por-no, Gre3n, Retrovizorja.\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\nQelbanix were the first progressive band in Albania and in 2008 they released their first and last album \"Infinit Relativ\" as a double CD. In this album there is a piece of artwork for every song made by Qelbanix. The alternative band Linda n\u00eb Bot\u00ebn e \u00c7udirave was created in 2009 with lead singer and guitarist Linda Rukaj. Linda went on to release her single acoustic album \"Jam\" (I am) in 2011 which was written and composed by her. She was the first female artist in Albania to be a singer/songwriter and guitarist.\nAfter 2004 many alternative rock band appeared forming a new wave. Many bands formed, dissolved and then reformed. This included Bands like Votra, Gillespie, The Bloody Foreigners, and Gre3n (who ceased existing in 2008). It also includes the Glasses, the Dizzies (with some band members of Gillespie) and the Freelancers with most of them debuting in 2009.\nDuring this decade in Albania there were many alternative and rock bands such as Permit of Stay, Germs, Ora 3, The Room, The S Forest.\n\n\n== Notable bands ==\n\n\n=== Pop punk/alternative/progressive rock ===\nAsgj\u00eb Sikur Dielli\nElita 5\nElton Deda\nGjurm\u00ebt\n\n\n=== Hard rock ===\nEugent Bushpepa\nTroja\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlbanian music\nMusic of Kosovo\nRock music in Kosovo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nEra e Ndryshimit (Kozeta Kurti, 2010)",

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents.

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

          "The castle is a decent walk out of town so we got the bus back (cost 3 euros) and is unusual in that it is not on a hill but by the river. It has been well restored. The walk around the inside involves lots of stairs. In most rooms there are displays of life in the area and",
          "If you want to see authentic castle, this is not maybe the best place as the building is so hardly restored. There are exhibitions telling about the building and different ages, so as a museum this is pretty nice. Not too expensive.",
          "Turku is a small town & the castle is very interesting. A must if your in town, its got a very interesting history.",
          "One of the best castles I have been to. It is really huge and the different routes are well prepared. All information are provided also in English and a guided tour for one of the routes is available - it was really great, the guide could speak about the castle the whole day",
          "This is an old castle with a lot of character and has been impacted by kings from different eras. The visit which is longer than average was worth our while. You walk through the first part with several easy to follow images and models explaining how the castle developed.",
          "Most of the castle is reconstructed (thanks to WW II), but the restoration is excellent. The self-guided tour is nearly endless -- pace yourself. Just when you think you're done -- like you return to the entrance station -- there's another wing to explore. But the rooms and",
          "Well laid out with clear directions so you don't miss anything. Staff all dressed in period costume which helped bring the castle to life. Well-worth a visit.",
          "A well restored castle filled with interesting exhibits. It seemed much bigger inside than I was expecting as the route winds in and out of many rooms. There are a lot of steps which could be challenging if you are planning a visit with very small children. Friendly, helpful",
          "If you ever visit in Turku \"Turun linna\" is a place which you don\u00b4t want to miss. The building itself is already impressive and the historical show case is very well implemented. The interior of castle is also familiar from a movie \"The Girl king\" and many hand made costumes",
          "Visited Turku Castle with my boyfriend and we both enjoy history so we thought it was nice. After finishing the old part of the castle we thought we were done, but there was more! We proceeded to finish the renaissance part also and concluded that our about 2 hour stay was well",
          "If you're in Turku you must see the Castle. It's as simple as that. I'm sure it's the most visited site in Turku. It isn't extravagant like the typical castles in the lower European countries, but it gives you a nice perspective of the way these people lived years ago.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to Turku castle but after our very well informed guided tour, we only needed to find our way out. This proved something of a route march. To get down one floor, we had to take the 'prescribed' route and ended up climbing and descending numerous floors and",
          "Turku Castle is huge, with a lot to see. There are two trails to follow within the castle and about 60 different exhibit rooms. See the history of Turku from medieval times to the present.",
          "So much history packed in one place, so many stories and threads to choose from!! We accidentally stumpled upon on guided tour and tagged along (I wish staff would have told us that the next possible tour is starting in 20min). Our guide really knew how to grasp his audience and",
          "Visiting this site provided a useful introduction to the role the Swedish monarchy had in Sweden. The dramatic events at Turku Castle arose mostly from internal strife in Sweden, especially among Swedish royalty. Highly recommended: the guided tour.",
          "Sort of must see things in Turku in case you are interested of the history. Even you would not be interested in history it is worth visiting. Nowadays it the castle surroundings has become a venue of several different kind of happenings",
          "Excellent tour with knowledgeable guide and quite expansive museum and free to roam castle. Great place to visit with children.",
          "We went on a walk in the evening and both the park and the castle was a good choice for spending som leisure time.",
          "We visited Turku Castle after a two hour car trip from Tampere. We opted for the English guided tour of the Medieval Castle. The guide was good and English more than effective and her humour worked well despite not being a native English speaker. The information was basic and",
          "We where with 3. 2 adults 1 kid 8 year old. Entrance for two days for all of us 30 euro incl guided tours. Did the kids tour and It was really nice. Compliments to the guide. All in all nice castle. Good price and great guided tour.",

          "Gosh, I'd really like to give this a higher rating, but quite frankly I was totally bored by the so called 'Guided tour' that I and my Finnish friends were taken on. They had been through the castle quite often before and were most apologetic to me, saying that the tour was",
          "The castle lays out the history of Finland in a way that's easy to understand at a variety of levels. Both kids and adults seemed to be getting something out of the visit. We're history buffs, so we paid attention to who did what to whom, and we were rewarded with a better",
          "Interesting place to explore, many rooms and corridors. The building has big rooms that have great acoustic for screaming children, so bring earplugs or music if you want to avoid high notes.",
          "The Turku castle is an impressive and big, well preserved castle. Some of its parts are medieval. A sort of a museum is included in the end of the tour: there are e.g. old toys and clothes on display. I went there alone and 2.5 hours went by flying. There were a few families",
          "Interested in history, Finnish or Scandinavian? This is a must to visit then. The castle is from 1100 hundred and was build step by step to a modern fort against intruders at a time. A perfect example of well restored attraction in the oldest town in Finland. It was badly",
          "This is about the history of Finland. The yard is stunning and garden a great place to have a picknick. Inside a lots of Finnish and Swedish history. Suits the whole family.",
          "If in Turku, this is a must see. Very well restored and maintained museum, a lot of interesting history. It's good to reserve some time, in one hour you can barely run through the main things. There are a lot of deep stairs so certain level of fitness required for the visit.",
          "Unfortunately it was closed when we visited the castle so we could only look at the exterior of this 700 years old castle. It is very impressive from the outside.",
          "English language tours depart at 10 past the hour and takes about an hour. Could easily have spent more time there after the tour, but unfortunately had to leave. Very interesting and worth the visit.",
          "One of the must sees in Turku. Take a stroll along the river with its many restaurants and coffe shops. Nice on a sunny day.",
          "We spent there nearly 4 hours as there is really a lot so see (and read). If one is interested in history, especially the Middle Ages Turun linna is an absolute must.",
          "The castle is very large with impressive architecture. Cool place to explore with young children. We didn't go in the paid area. As we were tired we were only there for 10mins. Enough time to get a look around.",
          "This is a seriously large castle, effectively divided into three equally interesting sections. Ideal for a rainy day, you can spend many hours happily walking through the many dozens of rooms. There is a lot of information available at every point, in Swedish and English too,",
          "Beautiful and interesting place which is full of history. It is one of the places to learn a lot about history of Finland",
          "Arguably one of Finland's finest cultural heritage sites and certainly Finland's greatest castle, the medieval castle by Turku's harbour is not to be missed. The castle has imposing outer walls which preserve its Renaissance era profile, which takes you back to around 1540. The",

          "We had a nice guided tour in Turku castle. It was established in 13th century and has been renovated totally. It gives a goo time journey to the Finnish history when Turku was a capital of Finland. Strongly recommend to visit there!",
          "We enjoyed Turku castle. Although there are few original furnishings, there are great displays (most of which are in English as well as Finnish and Swedish) and the rooms are well preserved. A special treat was the woman in the nun's chapel who was playing traditional Finnish",
          "We enjoyed an interesting tour of Turku Castle which is rich in history and also houses the Historical Museum of Turku. Recommend",

          "The interesting history of Turku as well as Finland and also Sweden and Europe are well shown in the exciting castle of Turku. Children love to learn stories about the princes and the jail, the ways people lived for example in the 1500-century... This castle can wake the",
          "This 700 year old structure is amazing to tour. I do wish that there were more descriptions in English, but there were still plenty. Because the castle had fallen into ruin and disrepair by the turn of the 20th century, many of the furnishings and art work are historic pieces",
          "There is much to see in the castle. All rooms are not furnished, but you can, however, get a picture of how the people lived in the castle in old days. The furnished rooms represent a little different periods of history and the furniture and other things are original and",
          "There's so much to do and see - and two distinct parts - so better to go twice! (An annual museum card for ALL of Finland is only 65 e ...so if you are in .Finland for more than one week this is a really good option!) Take bus number 1 to the castle* ...then if the weather is",
          "The price is expensive 10 \u20ac normal and 5\u20ac student. Most of chambers are empty, would say 40%-50% but there are interesting things to see. Not a must go if you a traveling on budget, but if you care about history etc you will have fun, also you should hire a guide - I saw",
          "This is our first ever visit to a castle and we weren't disappointed. Allow plenty of time...we were there 3 hours and felt a little rushed at the end but it was closing time. We were happy so many of the signs were in English...it made the visit that much more enjoyable.",
          "One of the most recomended places to see in Finland. The castle is big, and you can go mainly throught all the rooms and corridors, so you can get a proper idea on how it was. Preserved a really good condition, restored.",
          "the castle is quite distant from the town centre but on the other hand you can make it a nice walk along the riverbank . in the castle itself there is that much to see except the building of a castle itself",

          "The main museum object in Turku, the royal castle, was the residence of many influential Swedish and Danish medieval persons. For those who came to Turku, I think it's necessary to visit! A huge territory, a lot of rooms and original interiors, a room for changing and",

          "Very nice, a looot to see and do, with good explanations and for a very good price. We have spent app 4 hrs there (and could easily spend more). I appreciate activities for kids (our is 2,5) - like castle building blocks, dressing up and playing knights, ... It would be perfect",
          "The place where you just have to visit in Turku. Nice caf\u00e9 also here serving lunch. This is also nice for kids, they usually like visiting this castle.",
          "I attended this by myself. This castle has so much history, memorabilia, furniture, passages and rooms, you must allow half a day to wander at your own leisure to enjoy. I spent over 2 hours and it was really a wonderful place to visit, well worth the money and time.",
          "Nice to see an old building in Turku. The visit is excellent. A lot of beautiful rooms. The courtyard is to see.",
          "Took a look at this fascinating place on a chilly spring day. Really suprised by what was found inside. Thought the 10\u20ac entrance fee was a bit heavy but my mind was changed quickly after realising how large and well preserved the castle is. Loads of great history and interesting",
          "What to do in Turku? We decided to stop by the castle. 10\u20ac(adult) to enter the exihibitions seemed fair. As a swede I must say I learned a lot of the swedish history(and the finnish of course). We played around in the Knight hall. But then we went all in history geeks. If you",
          "Turku Castle is not crowded as I had expected. It was forlorn looking and no supporting tourist activities or facilities were near it. I had an enjoyable walk by the Aurojoki River and ended up there. Make it a part of your river walk attractions.",
          "A beautiful castle in a nice location. The staff was friendly. A great exibition of old books and artifacts. The medival part was far better than the newer part.",
          "Worth going on the tour around both castles... Well signposted and multilingual information provided about the exhibits plus free kickers to store your bags to make wandering around easier.",
          "Turku castle is located on a beautiful edge of the city which is great if you want to spent the day exploring the area around it no foot.",
          "It was kind of far, but worth it. I was not planning to go there, but as I got bored being in Helsinki for a long time, I just decided to go somewhere out of the city, then went to Turku without knowing this castle. It was not so convenient to go there, taking bus and walking",
          "Really well designed, we spent 3 hours in there. Lot's of different types of activities for adults and children: classic museum collections, short videos, role playing, information about the castle and about Finland overall. Some rooms are designed and decorated to remind of",

          "Fantastic, authentic medieval castle to explore. Extremely large castle so allow plenty of time. Something for everyone including children with a dress up room. Kids can dress up from knights in o royalty, lots of fun. Museum sometimes has visiting exhibitions which adds to the",
          "This castle is just so big - if I have anything negative to say about it, it is that you could probably stay all day here and still not see everything! But that means there's something for everyone - the kids can appreciate the castle as a whole and some of the smaller exhibits",
          "This kid friendly atmospheric castle is an good example of (better) life in Finland under Swedish Crown. It's not any shining palace but tells slightly realistic story of the rough living conditions in Medieval Finland.",
          "Turku Castle is an awesome structure which gives one a glimpse of rich Finnish history. An imposing structure that leaves one awestruck, I will surely visit it again in my lifetime.",
          "One of the top sights in Finland. Excellent exhibits, interesting and well guided medieval tour, staff dressed in period costumes, lots of activities for kids and a fine shop. I'd say a must if you visit Turku.",

          "Old castles can be so boring - however not this one! Interesting architecture and really good at explaining Finland's Swedish past. A great place to spend a couple of hours waiting for the boat to leave for Stockholm.",
          "If in Turku you need to add this to your things to do. This castle, while seemly small on the outside is absolutely huge on the inside. Restoration has been very good to bring it back to its former glory. Lots of history.",
          "Turku Castle looks small from outside, but once you get in, you realize that its size is pretty good. Going from one room to another to discover great pieces of Finnish history is exciting and some places will amaze you with their grandeur. A historical adventure worth taken!",
          "Turku's castle is a unique historical landmark in Finland. The castle might look small, but it suprises you: inside there are lots of corridors, hallways and rooms to explore. Children especially enjoy the narrow hallways that spread everywhere, it is fun to \"get lost and",

          "It is indeed an impressive pice of work and history. Turku Castle offers a lot to see in a time range which could be between 1-3 hours approximately. It can be visited alone or for a small additional cost with a tour guide.",
          "i went there with my friends. it is a very old. full of history castle and the people working there are super friendly.",
          "Well maintained castle and grounds, nice location to enjoy a day out. Exhibition itself is nothing special really, there is not much of \"Finnish\" history there as most of it is Swedish with some Russian. But very impressive architecture, given the age of it. A must to visit if",

          "A very good place to discover the history of Turku and Finland as it was once the capital of the country. I really liked that there were explanations on each room, helping you to portray how it was and what it was used for before. I also liked the expo at the end of the visit",

          "We spent about 3 hours at this castle but we easily could have spent twice that time. This is a unique place with lots of very interesting and beautiful things to see and a fascinating history to learn. I would say that if this castle were in a less remote place than Finland",
          "We weren't sure about this, knowing very little Finnish history we might have been in over our heads, but the explanations of each room were good, and I got a better sense of the stories within. There was a somewhat strange set of animal exhibitions that added some art and",

          "You can almost imagine this is a castle from Game of Thrones! It has been beautifully restored, but the character still remains. If you let your imagination run away with you, you can imagine yourself in a beautiful gown, sitting in the ladies chamber with all your ladies",
          "I was surprised at how well laid out this castle is. You are essentially led on a walking tour throughout the castle, with many exhibits from many time periods. Exhibits plaques are mostly in Finnish and Swedish, but there are translation cards that you can borrow that are in",

          "Unfortunately we didn't have a lot of time to hang around in the castle and didn't learn a lot about it, but it was very impressive nonetheless. The inside is labyrinthine and a lot of fun to walk through, and the outside is beautiful.",

          "Good tour guide, very knowledgable. I really liked that she wore a medieval dress. The tour was a bit over an hour and definitve worth it. After that you have time to revisit the places you went through or visit the rest of the castle. Definitely bring your camera because you",

          "I love the place! The normal tickets are 9e; discount for student (which I had) 5e/student; I think children under 16 are not charged, not so sure now. You'll get a sticker to attach on your clothes and a tiny guide brochure when you buy the ticket. It took me 3 hours to",
          "The castle was pretty neat, and spanned different eras of architecture, which we enjoyed. There was a lot to see, and we were tired, so it did seem to drag on and on. Go with a better attitude and you'll like it more than we did.",

It was decided that the previously undeveloped, although not uninhabited, area to the south of Vartiovuori Hill would be developed as residential accommodation. The South of this area was less rocky and easier to build upon, so was developed first. Plots were surveyed officially, then the plot holder would develop within that plot as and when they saw fit. These first surveyed plots still form the boundaries within the current museum. Three plots: 158\u2013160 appear on the maps of 1780, by 1800 171, 176, 178\u2013189 are included and the 1808 map (the basis of the post-fire map illustrated) includes the whole extent of the museum site.The original occupations of the first inhabitants are represented by the buildings now within the museum. Some were building trades, such as carpenters and a stonemason, and probably built their own properties. The plot would be fenced in and a simple cottage with a stove and baking oven built. Other buildings might be provided for domestic animals. In time, the buildings would expand around the perimeter of the plot, enclosing a courtyard.\n\n\n== The museum ==\nThe museum consists of 18 blocks of original 18th-century \u2013 early 19th-century buildings on their original location. The area of the museum was the only old residential area left in 1940, when the museum was opened. The location was the largest area to completely survive the Great Fire of Turku. \nThe idea for the museum was put forward in a local newspaper article as early as 1908, after the oldest part of Cloister Hill had been demolished \u2013 now the street of Sirkkalankatu. The idea was rejected for nearly 30 years, until the city's new museum committee was convinced to create a museum in the style of Den Gamle By, an earlier museum in Aarhus, Denmark. Nine blocks formed the original museum, the others being added in 1956. Expansion has continued since, with more buildings having their interiors refitted for display. On their addition to the museum, the houses were still decorated in the contemporary fashion of the 1930s. They were carefully recorded, then the interiors refitted to the style of the Great Fire period.

          "I attended in June 2019 and it was just perfect. There were multiple displays of early Finnish life, finely crafted pieces of furniture, and people in period dress who explained how it all worked. In many ways it's similar to outdoor living museums found in many towns around",

The retirees may recognise a few practices and implements, but seeing their way of life and trade skills are memorable. We found free parking close",
          "I highly recommend this truly astonishing place for all to visit. I spent three hours here and visited every single building that was open. I loved learning about the everyday lives of folk from long ago. It was a window into the history of my own family. I enjoyed a delightful",

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

Aboa Vetus displays portions of the city dating back to medieval times, while Ars Nova is a museum of contemporary art.\nThe museum was first opened in 1995 as two independent museums. Originally, plans were for only Ars Nova, the contemporary art museum, but during its construction a number of structures and artifacts dating back to the Middle Ages were discovered, and the archaeological excavation that was commissioned eventually transformed into Aboa Vetus. The two museums were combined in 2004 and Aboa Vetus & Ars Nova is now among the most popular tourist venues in the entire region of Southwest Finland.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Aboa Vetus & Ars Nova at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial site (English version)",

          "The archeology is very well presented with an engaging and accessible story. And the strong work of contemporary artist Saara Ekstr\u00f6m was a real discovery!",
          "As the City of Turku, an old capitol of Finland, has been burnt down several times in its international history, this place gives you an understanding of the life, the way it has been in the early days of this city. Location under a placa like building adds to its attraction.",
          "It is an interesting concept: to host a museum UNDER the ground with ruins of the medieval Turku as the framework. So well organised, so many different viewpoints offered and makes me wish the whole of Turku was dug out the same fashion. Nice and cool down there, too..after the",
          "It was an interesting place. It is an archeology museum and contemporary art in one building (and there is also a pretty busy restaurant there too. I'm not a big contemporary art fan, so I can't really offer too much for that but I am fascinated with archeology and that drew me",
          "We visited after a recommendation. We enjoyed the historic part of the museum but the contemporary art wasn't that interesting.",
          "Aboa Vetus is Finland's only archaeological museum where you can descend underground and explore the medieval Turku through the ruins. Ars Nova is a two-story exhibition space where you can see contemporary art in the former Rettig Palace which is 90 years old. However, you",
          "Aboa vetus and ars nova combines medieval ruins and a historical exhibition to contemporary art. The medieval ruins were discovered during the renovation of the villa Rettig (build in 1928) - and turned into a unique underground museum. You can walk on the actual medieval",
          "A wonderful concept \u2013 an archaeological dig revealing the cellars of the old town, with a really good contemporary gallery above. The archaeological part is engagingly presented to capture anyone\u2019s imagination, and the gallery is excellent. When we were there is was showing",
          "A historical museum built around archaelogical excavations showing how people lived hundreds of years ago in this town. Interesting details found in the excavations and instructive information boards on the walls. Nice caf\u00e9 and good museum shop.",

          "This place is two museums in one! Downstairs, there are medieval ruins and exhibits on historic Finland, and upstairs you'll find a modern art gallery, and a river runs right through the building, which makes for an amazing caf\u00e9 in between the two museum areas! The medieval",
          "In this museum you can see the ruins and things found in medieval Turku \u2013 and then see modern art, too. There is nice museum shop (I always find something to buy) and good cafe, too. Peaceful and nice place indeed.",
          "Great gallery depending on the exhibits st the time . We saw lovely wooden sculptures by Finnish artist . Lovely paintings from Ukrainen women as special exhibit !",
          "A great museum to take the kids or grandchildren. Exhibits make an effort to make it exciting and educational for children. It can get a bit rowdy when there are a lot of kids around but an interesting place to visit.",
          "Wow such a beautiful place with modern art and actual medieval buildings of Turku. This place is kid friendly and a nice experience for your whole family! very nice",
          "This little underground museum showed us relevant and interesting parts of local history. The story of Matti was fun to follow and we also enjoyed the interactive parts. The art part was poor and felt very unrelated.",
          "This museum is something for everyone. If you are interested of archeology or stories of living in historic Turku or art. There is interesting things to see and try for children and adults alike.",

          "I liked the modern art exhibition better, my friend liked the archeological one more. So, there's something for everybody. We also saw lots of interactive stuff for the little ones. Price was reasonable (7 euro - student) and the museum as a whole had a very good concept.",
          "We saw the underground excavations - quite interesting to see the original houses and the development since.",
          "Was very interesting to see the relics of the past here. The homes as they existed 100s of years ago was insightful. Also learned how many times this town burned to the ground before they started building with stone instead of wood.",
          "I love museums and art. But you will not miss anything if you miss this experience here. The rest of Europe has much better art collection.",
          "You find a hidden medival Turku. It is so interesting and surprising place under streets. I suggest visiting.",
          "As this museum is built on top of old excavated ruins, you get to experience history in a unique way. There are several things to touch and interact with. and the whole place is very kid friendly. Highly recommended.",
          "A most interesting museum; you can both look at modern art and in the same building have a look at the ancient history of Turku!",
          "We enjoyed tasty Sunday brunch in Aboa Vetus Ars Nova museum. Buffet and self service, fresh and tasty salads, extra star for interesting surroundings and design in museum.",
          "I visited Turku in September 2017 and went to the Aboa Vetus and Ars Nova museum. It's a weird combination of sort of two little museums mashed together, half about the very old history of Turku, and half a modern art museum. The history/archaeological part I found more aimed at",
          "This museum and gallery is worth a visit. The archeological section is fascinating and well presented. The integration of the actual ruins and museum is well done. The exhibition of the current young artist of the year was brilliant.",
          "I have been visiting Turku many times but never visited the museums. This history and modern art museum truly amazed me. Also the museum shop was nice - small but really nice. The cafeteria looked nice sunday afternoon playing jazz. The only down side was that the caffe did not",
          "Entrance fee 10 eur. The part about Turku history very good, informative texts, interesting displays. The contemporary art part worthless. Absolutely worthless. Giftshop could be better, prices in museum cafe ridiculously high, but late was very good. It is a pity modern and",
          "I visited this time only Aboa Vetus, the archeological part of the museum. It's interesting to see actual ruins and models from different times how the area has roughly looked. You can really imagine a Middle Age alley as staring the ruins! For kids there are also interactive",
          "Ars nova part of the museum is a very good place for a short pause from the hassle in the city. Nice small exhibition of high quality. (e. g. Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso with few guests and guards). Aboa Vetus part of the museum gives you a good view of ancient Turku. It would",
          "This is two museums in one. It's an archaeological museum and a modern art museum. I think reviewers should be honest about their personal biases. Modern art typically isn't my thing. Even taking into account my disinterest in most modern art, I thought the modern art section",
          "This was a fascinating look into life through old buildings buried underground for hundreds of years, good tours available by guides very recommended, I got to see what the area was like when my g-g-grandfather lived in this area",
          "Very interesting museum with the old ruins of Turku underground and art upstairs. Nice location by the river. Well worth a visit",
          "An interesting combination. While preparing the villa for use as an art gallery, they discovered the ruins of medieval Turku underneath. The result is an archaeological museum in the basement with a contemporary art gallery above. Take advantage of the excellent guided tours.",
          "Below the museum there are ruins from Turku in the middle-ages. It is very interesting. Guides are available for free, and they do a great job \u2013 our guide was very knowledgeable and English speaking.",
          "Enjoyed one of the best deserts in my life here. Art shop is great and museum part full of exciting details about the city.",
          "We only visited the underground part of the museum due to limited time available. But it was definitely worth visiting, very interesting. I strongly recommend taking a guided tour to get the most out of the visit!",
          "A very eccentric mixture. It puts together a rather eccentrically organised attempt to provide tableaus of life in Turku in medieval times ( more oriented towards children perhaps ) with a contemporary art gallery with a genuinely excellent collection of 20 th and 21st century",
          "Well organized medieval exhibition on the very place where the buildings rest at their original sites.",
          "As the name suggests, the museum has something for history lovers, and something for art lovers, something for those who love everything old, and for those who love the new. And they also have a nice restaurant, too! The museum has contemporary art on two floors, changing",
          "Aboa vetus and ars Nova is a very small museum in the central of Turku. It is still interesting thought, and definitely worth of checking out if you want to see a piece of old Turku.",
          "When you have acqwaited yourself with Turku history in this interesting museum, it is time to have a meal or a coffee. And what better place than this spacious cafe-restaurant in the museum. You mostly get your money's worth and the setting is nice.",
          "Aboa Vetus & Ars Nova is a combination of modern art and medieval city scape. I skipped the art, and spent my time exploring the 'underground cityscape' that has been protected for centuries by building added over the top. It was a moment of wonder to step down from the stairs",
          "This museum is awesome. The was a gallery of various artists upstairs (very good selection of various artists), and my other favourite was the diggings underneath the museum, showcasing life in old times. Turku is built above another city and the bones of animals and the",
          "Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary has inspired the installation Madame B: Explorations in emotional capitalism (by Bal & Williams Gamaker). It was quite interesting, but I think it was good (although not necessary) to be well acquainted with the book. The videos took 2 hours",
          "This is a great museum in the middke of Turku by River Aura. If you have time to do only one of the two I would recommend Aboa Vetus (the Medieval part). Make sure you have time to enjoy the MBakery coffee as well!",

          "This museum is situated alongside Aura river. These underground ruins tell the history of Finland's oldest town Turku. There was also fictitious story of a boy named Matti and his life during that time. For children there were medieval games and other medieval things to play",
          "I lived in Turku for 5 years and went to this museum many times and I consider it to be the best place to visit. I love seeing the old architecture, then displays of what has been found and how they have created a world that shows what it was like hundreds of years ago in Old",
          "A strange museum which has modern art upstairs( much of which did nothing for the three of us) . However downstairs is an excavation site of a riverside area of old Turku before it was destroyed by fire. Its all absolutely real apart from the models used to illustrate how it",

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents.

          "A very nice and cooling place to be at and also the locals here are really helpful in directions. A very worth to go place",
          "A landmark of Turkey and a must visit. The cathedral dominates the skyline of Turkey. It is within easy walking distance of downtown.",
          "A very nice building located in the middle of what I consider a park, it's something you should visit if you are in the city. I can't speak of it's interiors, because unfortunately I visited on times it was closed, but the building itself, specially at night when the lights are",

          "It basically reminds me of a famous saying \"Peace is just not in absence of war, but as a cathedral, peace should be constructed with patience and unshakable faith\" and Turku cathedral is just this way. All the paintings of almighty enumerating his greatness and alluring wall",
          "Impressive and large cathedral, but nothing memorable within the place. Some stain glass windows, but little else.",
          "I walked here along the river as recommended by the travel guide I read. There was a dance festival going on during my visit, so I didn\u2019t go inside. But I walked around the outside which was interesting.",
          "I\u2019m a Church and Cathedral person and I loved Turku\u2019s Cathedral. It\u2019s not as lavish as some that we have seen but is still beautiful in its own right. It has history which you can find out about in the visit to the museum. Worth a visit.",
          "Very impressive and also holds a small museum. Definitely worth a visit if churches and cathedrals are of personal interest. At times there\u2019s also a cafe that directs the proceedings to mission welfare. You can sit on the stairs of the cathedral and enjoy a nice cup of coffee",
          "It's not really much to see and I'm even from Finland. Surely it's old but that's about it. It's not pretty and it's certainly nothing to travel for. Just kinda one of those been-there-done-that.",
          "Visited the church today. The inside is very nice. You must check out the side rooms, they are very interesting.",
          "This cathedral has a great deal of history on display. It\u2019s very well preserved and easy to access. It\u2019s just the other side of the river from the city centre and well worth he short, beautiful walk. Take your time to see all the cathedral has to offer.",
          "Beautiful inside and out. Very peaceful. Take time out to just sit and pray or just be still before moving on. We visited on a beautiful but busy day outside and this was a time to reflect for a while.",
          "Visited at end of March when it was pretty cold outside. 1st time I've ended up feeling warmer inside a cathedral. If you care nothing about religion it can still be a nice place to warm up and think about life.",
          "The only place in Turku worth seeing. The lady at the reception was very helpful. She even guided us to some nice and reasonable places for food. A good experience overall.",
          "The museum upstairs has a nice collection of historical church art, statues, altar clothes and dishes. Remember to open the \"secret drawers\" in the back as many of the most beautiful clothes can be found there. There are rarely other people in there and the lights have movement",
          "Very beautiful building from the outside especially. A great place to see the New Year's fireworks !",
          "Great place to visit if you have 30mins to spare. Amazing architecture internally and can spend very long time staring at the ceiling and the paintings on the wall.",
          "Even if you are not religious person Turku Cathedral is a place you want to see. It is approximately 800 years old, though original structures have not survived to this day. Due several wars and fires the church has been renovated several times and today it is one of the finest",
          "Turku Cathedral is one of the most beautiful churches in Turku. There is numberious interesting stopping points, witch contains historical information. You can scan quark codes, and read information about historical persons, happening and architecture. In Christmas time, there",
          "Loved walking around this fully functioning church. You have to pay to go upstairs to enjoy the museum part of the church, but there's plenty to see in the main sanctuary area. As many informed us, this is the \"most important church in Finland\" and has a fascinating history to",
          "Not to be missed, the Cathedral and Museum are an amazing record of the history of Turku. The many artifacts in the museum tell of the history of both the building and its rebuild after the Great Fire of Turku in 1827. English language brochures were available for the cathedral",
          "Wooden Turku Cathedral was built in the 13th century. It burned during the great fire of Turku and was rebuilt in 1827. The church is the religious home fore the evangelical Lutheran church in Finland. The church is historical and has a special place in annual Finnish Christmas",
          "The change from Catholicism to Lutheranism is very evident in the austere decorations of the cathedral. The building is interesting, a mix and match on the outside and very nice on the inside with high vaults. The park and trees surrounding are also nice.",
          "Me and my husband were here a sunny and warm day in June 2017. We have visited many cathedrals all over Europe and thought this was one of the most beautiful. Just plain gorgeous! If you have a physical handicap the way in have some very high and steep stairs, but inside it's",
          "There is nothing special about this building. No particularly nice park around it. Museum costs 2 eur for adults. Bach on programme at the moment, till October (when talking about music).Simply pass by when you are around and see how it looks inside. Or dont. Doesnt really",
          "Beautiful cathedral and amazing building. Many little details to notice on the walls, floors, etc. Only thing that they should fix is that they only have QR codes for you to scan with the phone, but nothing written for the tourists. If you want to figure out what you are looking",
          "This big and messy-looking brick pile looks impressive but shaggy from the outside. Inside, things are neater-looking but equally impressive. As in most churches in Finland, the prayer books are stacked and available for reading on the honor system.",
          "This kind of churches are quite rare in Finland. There is pretty much to see compared to many other churches, especially if you visit also the small museum upstairs. It's not too expensive, 2 euros for adult and 1 euro for kids, students and senior citizen.",
          "Underestimated by locals, this 13th century cathedral embodies the history of Turku and Finland in many aspects. The guided tours are excellent and very tourist-friendly. The cathedral grounds also hold many monuments that are at the core of Finnish (and Swedish) history.",
          "Wonderfully peaceful, yet majestic building with plenty to see. Located on a beautiful place next to the river. Easy to walk to from the city center.",
          "Having visited many of the major cathedrals in Italy and France, it is nice to be in cathedral that is relatively unadorned and modest. This is a huge cathedral with an imposing spire, a grand entrance, vaulted ceilings and enormous columns, an incredible organ and beautiful",
          "Interesting to see it's not very decorated from inside. We visited just when there was some concert rehearsal and enjoyed just sitting and listening.",
          "A large imposing building approached across a large open plaza. Fairly plain on the outside, built from brick and stone. Inside fairly plain as well. Tall brick pillars from huge arches down each side of the main space leading the eye forward to the altar. Several side chapels.",
          "When entering the Cathedral, try to find the very old bricks outside the building, where there are very old marks of the brick makers. Figures of keys are the best ones!",
          "Was impressed by the size of this cathedral, great being there when the bells are rung.Some interesting artifacts from medieval times",
          "We attended a service here. Excellent acoustics. Large and imposing space with several beautiful stained glass windows and huge art works.",
          "The Cathedral is on the opposite side of the river from the modern town centre so you cross one of the many bridges. It is a short walk. It stands on a small hill and is an unusual mixture of stone and brick. Inside there are old private chapels of historic nobility linked to",
          "I visited this Cathedral with a group of friends.There is a cafe located at the base of the actual building. It was very cosy & inexpensive but added to the atmosphere for our visit. (check opening times before visit).We walked around the outside first & had a knowledgeable",
          "Turun tuomiokirkko, the Turku cathedral is one of the most important buildings in Finland with a huge role in history. The building is medieval and very interesting, packed with history. Entrance is free and you can get a free guide to your smartphone. Currently there is a",
          "The cathedral is beautiful and free to enter. I liked the children's exhibit of the 500th anniversary of the Reformation. In addition there is a Cathedral Museum which displays some of the cathedral's treasures and has a small admission charge.",
          "Worth seeing this for sure! It has incredible history and is so beautiful to see how it has been restored. Definitely a must see while in Turku.",
          "The Cathedral still in use and seem to be up to date with the needs of a modern Cathedral. A small museum inside the cathedral is worth a visit. The Ejby chalk is here to be seen.",
          "Turku Cathedral is like no other Lutheran Church we have seen in Finland (7 or so now). It reminds me more of the Catholic or Church of England Cathedrals with the open vaulted ceilings, tall columns and chapels or graves in the alcoves. The church is still Lutheran in adornment",
          "I entered this church and it was a big beautiful church from the inside. Luckily I got to hear the organ being played. It created a beautiful ambience.",
          "This church is located by the river Aura in the city center, the entrance is free which is great! Amazing interior, with many benches where you can sit and enjoy the atmosphere and feel the history of past times.",
          "The Cathedral was built in 1229 and is the oldest Cathedral of Finland. Very nice building with beautiful interior. Certainly worth a visit.",
          "Turku Cathedral has a very interesting history. It began as a catholic church, made of wood in the 13th century, and now, constructed of stone, is the mother church of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. The cathedral's south gallery includes a very interesting museum of",
          "A nice medieval cathedral in Finland's former capital, located near the city centre. Interior is also quite impressive. Entrance is free.",
          "This church is quite old and a relic in a lot of ways but it has seen so much time pass by and it has seen so much history being created all around. This feeling gave me a sense of nostalgia as I entered it. Despite being so old it is well preserved. When I visited a ceremony",
          "Turku's cathedral is outstanding. Despite the many changes throughout the time, we can still consider this church as a piece of the Middle Ages (XIII). It is a crucial place for the history of Finland. It features a museum and a cafe.",
          "Very well worth visiting, in an interesting historic part of Turku, it has charm as well as grandeur. I was slightly disconcerted to realise that not only was I initially entering the building just as a wedding was starting, I was actually holding open the cathedral door to",
          "The oldest church of Finland from the 13th century, the old Finnish-Swedish noble tombs and nice cafe in the cellar",
          "If you want to get a sense of medieval Finland, come to Turqu instead of Helsinki. Not only is Turqu older, it has two stunning monuments from the Middle Ages: Turqu Castle and the Turqu Cathedral. This cathedral must have looked like a skyscraper to the early Finns, because it",
          "We arrived for a second time (to cover the small admission fee). As other reviewers have said, it's big, when compared to (say) Porvoo cathedral (qv). Unexpectedly I was touched by the phenomenological experience of hearing a striking organ recital (see photo). We visited Turku",
          "Almost the oldest church in Finland and gives also a historical view from 15th century what has happened in Finland. They have very good qr codes to read more information about graves which are under the church and history over all.",
          "The cathedral is old and beautiful and very big - it is higher than anything in the surroundings and seems therefore very majestic. Inside there are many old things and tombs and you can really feel the history. It is of course a Lutheran church so there is not so much gold and",
          "This church is just so beautiful. And perfect for amazing concerts. There is some magic when you listen beautiful choirs singing.",
          "Turku cathedral is in the heart of the city, and actually the see of the archbishop of all of Finland. It dates back to the Middle Ages, and there's a small museum upstairs (fee) where vestments and chalices over the ages are on display. The style of the cathedral interior is",
          "With only one day to visit Turku, seeing this medieval cathedral was at the top of our list. It's so beautiful and peaceful inside and it's also very welcoming. They have displays to help visitors understand the history. Allow time to thoroughly explore and appreciate the",
          "The cathedral is a spectacular sight on a sunny day. IT looms tall over the city, as it has done for centuries. the stairs to the door are steep, and the door is very large - all part of the creation of a lasting impression of power and authority. Inside it is very plain -",
          "a century old church with a museum and tons and tons of interesting artifacts which can be viewed with a small amount of entrance fee",
          "The place is a must visit in Turku. The church in a way symbolizes the city. It can be seen in a lot of post cards and every person who visited and lived in the city has a picture of it or have it as a back ground in their pictures. It always provides a good backdrop in all",
          "During a casual walk along the river after we checked in to the hotel we saw the cathedral. Decided to stop in and check it out. Wow! There are a service going on and the singing was beautiful. The place is an awesome sight and something worth visiting.Glad we stopped and check",
          "Do not miss this. Inside lies a Queen and she is not Finnish but Swedish. The pipe organ was playing, there are tombs and altars, there are old paintings on the walls faded with time, there are bodies buried beneath the church. This is such a fascinating place, a historical and",
          "The cathedral is really beautiful (not as much in the inside than the outside). It's good to visit it to understand the history of Turku.",
          "Every time I visit Turku I always pop into the cathedral. Regardless of how many times I see it, it'll always be a treat on the eye and leave me smiling. The outside doesn't really represent what you'd see inside. Both are still visually beautiful and if you like history,",
          "Full of history, super beautiful cathedral. Not take long time to visit, because it is next to city centre. Maybe not the most interesting for little children.",
          "I always take my foreign guest to see this church. It might not be all gold and glory, but it is a wonderful and huuuuge church and a bit piece of Turku's history. Also in December they have the biggest Christmas tree in front the the church!",
          "Definitely worth a visit on your wanderings through Turku -no service was on so we walked straight in. There is no charge to look around.",
          "I like to visit churches and cathedrals when I am travelling although I am not at all into religion. The Turku Cathedral is definitely a place to visit. Impressive about details and size. Don't miss it !",
          "The Turku Cathedral has a special feeling inside. It is high with Gothic interior, but looks quite different on the outside. I has a special atmosphere, because it's sparingly decorated with very little gold and thus does not express wealth and power of its founders. However, it",
          "Turku Cathedral has been in existence for more than 700 years and attending a Christmas oriented festival in it was an out of this world experience>>>so ethereal!",

          "The Turku Cathedral is the most magnificient church in Turku and also in the whole of Finland. Its history is very interesting and the museum there tells of the happenings and persons connected with the history of the church. It has had its central place in Turku for centuries",
          "A huge protestant cathedral. Simplistic, but grand in design. Interesting relics on the sides. Occasionally holds events.",
          "The Turku Cathedral is one of the oldest churches in Finland and gives a great historical insight into the religious history of Finland. However, what I appriciate most is the athmospher when one steps into the church. It is very impressive and beautiful \u00e1nd one really feel the",
          "Nice place to visit for some history that stated in the 12 hundreds and a glimpse of nobility in the form of old family tombs and heirlooms",
          "I have seen lots of churces and i got the feeling that this one is half finished with the lack of paintings in the roof and upper walls. Ok place to see.",
          "I lived in Turku for 5 years and have been in and around the church many times. It sits in a beautiful position near the river and opposite the old square of Turku. It is easy to spend an hour or so looking at sections inside the church. If you are lucky you might be there when",
          "The Cathedral of Turku is fantastic! Such high ceiling, such beautiful crypts and paintings. There is a regular organ practice and we were lucky to hear it with my family while we were inside. The high ceiling provides for amazing acoustics. There are numerous Christmas concerts",
          "This cathedral is a landmark in Turku. Easy to reach by car or walking along the river, the cathedral's exterior really doesn't prepare you for the interior. Although the main altar and organ are both stunning, I found the side chapels more enthralling. The side chapel to the",
          "There was an organ practice going on when we got there which added to the experience of this place. It's not ornate like many old churches in Europe but still plenty impressive.",
          "This is a special Cathedral for the Finnish Lutherans. It is not ornate but does contain many interesting historical pieces, crypts and paintings. The high ceilings are to be appreciated for their building achievement.",
          "Building started at 10th century this \"dome\" is the oldest and most beautiful church in whole Finland. It locates also the seat of archbishop of Finland. With its three ships, handmade decorations and high ceiling it equals with every Medieval church in Europe",
          "This church is one of the landmarks for Turku city, and is beautifully located by the river. There is a nice park around it, and also a caf\u00e9 at summer time. Concerts are a must!",
          "A quick visit to this central church close to the river. Nice interior. Had a childrens play area. Worth a visit!",
          "The combination of stonegraves, shields and pulpit was very scandinavien. Beautiful day altar and hardly any visitors.",
          "That's a very traditional old style Scandinavian cathedral. Gorgeous from outside and inside. I would definitely recommend to visit it if you are in Turku. Plus , it's in a very historic part of the city close to University and museums.",
          "Simple Northern Cathedral. I loved the delicate frescos in the archways. No Information in English. still an active church.",
          "Worth a visit but not for lingering: the interior is undistinguished and the museum pretty limited unless you are interested in Ecclesistical history",
          "Definitely beautiful from outside, and fascinating inside. Not very \"decorated\" but if you sit down when you enter you can smell history.",
          "This is admittedly a nice, large, tall and relatively spectacular building that is worth a look at least from outside. Inside this is rather classical cathedral with all the usual paraphernalia not worth loosing too much time.",
          "Well I guess the Turku Cathedral is something you should see but I was not that special. Quite a plain cathedral although the side chambers with some tombs/coffins were interesting. Some of them has really nice painted glass windows. There is no fee so just pop in to take a look.",
          "The church full of history, handsome architecture and art. Interesting place in so many ways. Alluring history and good acoustics.",
          "The most beautiful part of the church is the altar area and on side aisle one blue-roofed side chapel. Main nave is simple but high vaulted ceiling takes your focus. Beautiful stained-glass windows are abundant and there are a few coats of arms. The altar area as a whole is",
          "Yes the church is one of the landmarks because of its history in Turku. From the outside the building is impressive by its size in a calm area near the river. From the inside it is interesting because of its historic relics and tombs but not by its interieur. So have a look when",
          "Located in the main tourist area. Worth the quick visit to see this church, amazing architecture and history!",
          "Impressive big cathedral on the edge of the river. The size of the building and its position make it a very beautiful place to visit. It is well maintained and the visit is free.",
          "The Turku Cathedral is the national shrine of Finland and is a place worth visiting when at Turku. Admission was free.",
          "This cathedral is impressive in size, age and construction. It really is striking when you approach it. I really found the bare interior stunning and the light quality is really different from other churches from the same time. I bought a coffee and muffin at the cafe close to",
          "I was here for 2 days in Turku and as always I am visiting another Cathedral in another town of the World. It happened that there was a wedding that day and not just one not two but 5 weddings. So locals and tourist are not allowed to enter and wonder around so as not to",
          "The view for the top is great but there is a cost to go up the tower. Not a lot of decoration compared with other cathedrals but it is worth the 5 minute detour.",
          "When I first tried to enter, it seemed like it was locked, but later I saw someone go in, so tried again. The door was really heavy and that was why I had given up the first time. The cathedral is stunning inside - the pulpit, small ship, organ, light - all contribute to a",
          "Turku in itself is a very nice city you can see the history as you drive through it. The Cathedral was amazingly beautiful and the pipe organ was well amazing! They have many historical figures buried their quite interesting.",
          "Located very close to the city centre, the cathedral is truly majestic. It's a truly majestic and historic building. Inside the cathedral, you get the feeling of peace. The entry is free of cost. I would highly recommend this to everyone coming to Turku.",
          "This is one of those few cathedrals where you get that feeling of being at peace upon entering (there were not that many people around and the place was large, which probably contributed to this peaceful feel). The colours, lighting and architecture are just perfect for prayer",
          "It's likely you've seen bigger or grander cathedrals elsewhere, but Turku Cathedral has lots of charm. It's accessible, free, and beautiful inside. There are QR codes for information on different areas of the church. The cathedral is stroller accessible, by the way - the ramp",
          "This is the place to visit in Turku. Extremely impressive church. Easy access. A must when in Turku.",

          "...absolutely gorgeous. Turku Cathedral is huge and beautiful church and especially so for a Finnish church.",
          "While walking around Turku at night we saw the huge Christmas tree outside the Church. Walked inside and it was stunning. A choir was singing with no back up music. The church was all lit up and it was just beautiful. The sound of Christmas Carols in Finnish gave me goose",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed my visit here - the Lutheran Church of Finland built in the mid 13th century. The side chapels have been converted into funeral vaults and you will find places where graves were set into the floor. Stains glass windows are stunning.",
          "It is the oldest cathedral in Finland, back when Turku was the capital city. That should be reason enough to want to know it.",
          "I couldn't look around much because there was some sort of service going on but it was super beautiful inside. The atmosphere is almost ethereal. There were also vendors not to far from the cathedral selling yummy street food, not sure if that's an every day thing or not but if",
          "Worth visiting the cathedral near the river bank and very close to Delhi darbar restaurant. Must go.",
          "Turku Cathedral is a awesome place in Turku, built somewhere in 13th century by the Aura River ...it is one of its first place, around, which finnish habitat grew, In past, as the area was covered with merchants from all land...buying selling goods and services, big ships",
          "We visited for new year and tried to squeeze as many sites into our short stay as possible. The cathedral is beautiful and steeped in history. The other place to visit is the museum. We love Turku and will be re-visiting very soon.",
          "We only saw this from the outside but it was very pretty. It's in a very central location, next to the river, so is easy to see.",
          "The age of the church makes it one of the prettiest churches in Finland. It has an interesting history and I love the architecture of the church. Especially outside it looks very beautiful.",
          "I like the design and architecture of this cathedral. I enjoyed the view both inside and out although we arrived as the sun was going down (December - shorter days).",

          "I have always loved churches and this one is as equally beautiful. With coffins of the past rulers and magnificent altar pieces this church works as a museum as well. And in fact there is a museum in the church premises. Recommend!",
          "This is a lovely, very old cathedral in the center of Turku. I stopped in and took a much needed rest inside. It was beautiful, both in and out - well worth a day trip from Helsinki!",
          "Always lovely and so relaxing to walk around in this gorgeous old cathedral. This church is well kept and maintained, even heated in winter time.",

          "Sober but very beautiful scandinavian cathedral. Was there during Christmas ceremony. Warm inside, very much recommended.",

          "Beautiful old church in the heart of Turku. It's a very important piece of Finnish history and considered the most important Finnish monument. Beautiful on the inside. And the organ sent chills down my spine. Have a look! It's worth it!",
          "The church didn't seem much from the outside but I changed my mind when I walked it. Beautiful with nice things to see and music in the background.",
          "Built from 1300. the simplicity of the white stone is broken by frescos, mosaics and side-chapels hosting stone grieves and armors of illustrious people (Finn and Swedes). You can almost \"breath\" Middle age inside it. I visited it before the closure, so it was a peaceful",
          "The atmoshper is so different from many other churches in Finland and elsewhere as well. WE really enjoid it . !",

          "Walking through this beautiful old church is highly recommended -- do try to make one of the short afternoon concerts.",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral that I recommend. I especially enjoyed the life of Christ captured by the paintings around the front of the cathedral. I also liked the fact that it is still being utilized as a house of worship rather than a museum.",
          "This is the major medieval church in Finland and the place to include for a full day visit in Turku. If half a day is the time available I'd prefer Turku Castle. Both buildings are much more impressive inside than outside. The former capital of Finland is worth for a full day",
          "We visited on a Sunday when a congregation was having a service off to the side of the church. It was beautiful hearing the singing soaring up into the high ceilings. You have to look at the floor too.",
          "We liked the grand paved driveway leading to the entrance of the cathedral. We dreamed of loyalty driving up to be crowned and couples in this present day getting married in the cathedral We liked the simplicity and purity of the church sanctuary and to know that the Cathedral",
          "I use to speak with my son about how each church and each monastery is one of God\u00b4s houses. The Turku Cathedral is probably His favorite house In Finland. :) This a very impressive place and the energy inside and around it it\u00b4s very special. Winter time it\u00b4s even better to visit",
          "Turku Cathedral (\u00c5bo domkyrka) is together with Turku Castle (\u00c5bo slott) the symbols of Turku. It's located near River Aura in the city centre. The Cathedral was consecrated in 1300 and dedicated to Virgin Mary and Saint Henry (the first Bishop of Finland). It was originally",
          "Older than expected, this cathedral offers splendid architectural art and houses tombs some of them dated 1622! Worth a visit!",
          "Our short trip to Turku included a short stop at the Turku Cathedral. It is not only imposing but there is a spirit of holiness in the air. As a Hindu visiting this place of God, I was happy to feel it and meditate for a few calming minutes. the Cathedral is not a museum but a",

          "In the centre of Turku close to the River and the markets is Turku Cathedral. The Lutheran Cathedral is extensive and was very interesting.",
          "A protestant cathedral imposing in its seriousness. Few decorative elements. Field Marshall Mannerheim bestowed the Finnish mothers a fine War Order in 1942, with a very well-worded accompanying text, which hang in the church.",
          "We visited Turku Cathedral on a warm summer day and to our delight someone was practising Sibelius' Finlandia playing the huge church organ - quite an extraordinary feeling! The church is very old and many of the \"big\" names of Finnish history are buried there. The location of",

          "The church is visible from many parts of the town so its size attracts. Dating back to the 13th century, the exterior is interesting for all the different brick and stone work undertaken over centuries. A sizeable and as a result impressive interior with a number of interesting",

          "We went expecting jewel in the crown of Finland and found it gloomy and in a very raw state of build- more like a bunker than a cathedral. Save yourself time and avoid.",
          "Beautiful and breathtaking. You can leave the prayers request at the box by the entrance. There is also service in English and a cosy green space outside. Statues and cyclists. Very romantic too. I am coming back.",

          "If you are in Turku on a Tuesday in the summer, make sure to check out the organ concert at the Cathedral. My family and I went to the first concert of the season in early June, and it was absolutely spectacular! Concerts start at 20:00, last about 1 hour, and the cost is free,",
          "Beautiful and fine religious meeting place Nice park arround the catedral. They had fine museum ther and a coxsy cafe",
          "The Turku Cathedral is the town's landmark and therefore hard to miss. It's worth going inside, too! Check out the little sailboats hanging above your head (there is a story behind them)! If you happen to be there in the Advent season, don't miss a nice concert with Swedish",
          "The church looks astoundingly big from the outside. There is a way from the Turku Library (the old building) to the church, and you can see the most picturesque views there. On the inside, the church seems very mysterious. There is also a museum inside the church - entrance",

          "It's huge. When you turn the corner from the Library it's quite impressive how big it is. Maybe this is also the case because the buildings next to it are relatively low. The church is also worth visiting. It's open every day.",
          "Turku is a small town, each main attraction is within walk distance. Turku Cathedral is just across the river. It's tower is imposing and makes you feel small at the moment. It is a beatiful tower, I must say. Inside you will find several crypts of notable nordics, most of them",

          "I love coming to this cathedral now and then. It has a long and interesting history and I love imagining what it looked like hundreds of years ago. Sometimes I enter and sometimes I just walk past it and admire its impressive facade. I'm sure this cathedral won't impress",
          "Main reason to go there was to have a panoramic view of Turku from a vantage point. But was told, the tower is closed to public. A big disappointment it was. The interiors were ok, not as magnificent as from outside. Went to have a look at the museum. Good artifacts and measured",
          "Liked: atmosphere of cathedral, small museum in south gallery. Disliked: a slightly limited range of things in the shop compared with many English cathedrals. A lot of steps at front of cathedral - hard work with suitcase! Could not see a ramp anywhere - perhaps there",

          "This is the tallest building in my area, which makes it an easy landmark to find if you get lost. There is a nice park out front and really close to the river. The doors always seem open so it a good place to hide from the cold while waiting for friends. During the holidays",
          "This church is the central biggest landmark of the city. It is hard to be missed because it's giant. I used it to orient myself when I was lost in the city. There is a huge pipe organ inside and I was lucky enough to be there when there was a musician playing. I haven't been",

          "Most important of the few ancient things to see in Turku. The story of the sailing ship suspended inside the church has to be heard. The benches adjacent to Aura river offer a good resting and snacking option.",

          "Turku is the former capital of Finland. This cathedral is situated in the city center and cannot be missed. It has born witness to many historical events e.g. From the times when Finland was part of Sweden. The construction started late 13th century and the present interior",

          "The place is fine, but nothing very special except of this feeling of big old cathedrals - if you've seen a couple in Scandinavia you will not see anything new. It's for free, but don't treat it as 'must see'.",
          "This was an enjoyable cathedral to visit - I love seeing the magnificent architecture associated with cathedrals throughout Europe. The Turku Cathedral is not terribly ornate, which I found quite refreshing. Overall, we found this to be worth a short visit (~30min); there is a",
          "We arrived at the church just as a concert was beginning, and we didn't have a lot of time on our day trip from Helsinki, so we went for a quick peek inside, listened to a little music, visited the cute little coffee shop, and then walked along the river. So we mostly enjoyed it",
          "Interesting building full of history. The interior is lighter than the exterior suggests. It was slightly out of town so a bit of a walk.",
          "There were lots of signs in English that told about various parts of the cathedral. We did not take a tour or buy a guide, but were able to spend a couple of hours admiring the artwork and design of the building. There is no admission cost to the main part, but there is a",

          "I suppose architecture is subject to personal taste but I think it would be hard to be unimpressed by this building. It is an excellent setting by the river, a very tall tower and an amazing vaulted ceiling. Well worth a visit.",
          "You can't miss a visit at this cathedral if you are in Tuku; I was walking in the city centre looking for a restaurant after a business meeting and I stop to have a look. Unfortunately I had not too much time; from outside it is very nice, the cathedral is surrounded by gardens",
          "I loved this cathedral, was impressive. My only criticism was i was sitting peacefully soaking up the atmosphere when a group of tourists came in from a different religion, chatting, shouting and taking pictures, showing no respect for where they were..i suggest that there",
          "The building is quite huge compared to churches that you'll find in Finland. Being use to visit Catholic Churches, it is impressive to compare them with this one who is Protestant. It worth while a few minutes of your time if you are passing by Turku. A nice walk can be done",
          "The whole city of Turku is streaming with life and the cathedral is a great landmark. But once you enter, the whole atmosphere changes. It's a contrast from the outside. It was very quiet to the point of creepiness when i visited. The interiors are not lavished, but contained a",
          "Even though I am not a religious person, Cathedral of Turku is one of the most impressive places I `ve ever visited. You can almost see the bygone centaries in front of your eyes while walking towards the altar. It is a marvellous place to have a visit! :)",

          "Quite & Calm....sitting arrangements are good...i enjoyed a late night musical show, it was very good",
          "When I enter there it was a dark and an organ is played. I'm orthodox and our temples are different from west church. And I was impressed by it. There are tombes with saints. It's a good place to feel yourself in compare with God and pray to Him.",
          "Turku cathedral is like every tourist story time and time again. After a while, you kinda know how it all works and the special thing is missing. Same goes for me when it comes to churches, cathedrals, etc. Sure its nice and it has its charm, but im already spoiled, so this",
          "The place is definitely worth visiting. It's a symbol of Turku. The museum is interesting. Unfortunately, there weren't any concerts there during our stay in Turku/ Must see!",
          "You can get a lot of information about this medieval cathedral, it's interiors, history and construction, but when visiting, try to find the small details in the church, that should be fun especially when visiting with kids. The first is in the first chapel on the right when you",
          "We liked the interesting alcoves or side chapels with varied styles, especially the Chapel of Lawrence.",
          "One cannot avoid locating the cathedral for it is visible from anywhere along the river promenade. Quarter-hours are pealed by the church bells although maybe the hands of the clock may not exactly correspond to the exact time, but then the building is a lot older than me and I",
          "A very beautiful but not overly ornate cathedral in a lovely part of town. Its right along the water which makes for a nice afternoon stroll after visiting the cathedral.",
          "There is a big organ, so I would recommend to visit some concert in this cathedral. This cathedral contains coffin of Swedish queen. Very beautiful ancient frescos.",
          "Turku Cathedral is impressing since it dates back to the Catholic time in the Nordic. A lot where destroyed in the big fire in 1827 but the buildning is well restored. Do not miss the small museum it is worth the 2 Euro only by the pice of work from Albertus Pictor.",
          "I was impressed with the cathedral and its interior, really big one actually. I was also impressed that it is not that wealthy decorated comparing to the cathedrals I've seen so far. I was also there on the organs concert and it was amazing.",

          "if you got limited time, then this is a must. Here you'll find history in a nutshell, living religion and tranquillity. Skip the museum if you're in a hurry.",
          "The exterior of this church really drew us in and we were lucky enough to visit on a day that someone was playing beautiful organ music inside. The building is structurally amazing and well worth a walk-through.",
          "An interesting building, obviously very old, and with great accoustics - we were fortunate enough to visit while the choir were singing. Some information in English would have been good.",
          "The cathedral is free to enter and the museum very inexpensive. The main cathedral is awe inspiring in it's proportions, more clearly experienced because of the Lutheran austerity. The side chapels are beautiful and the museum offers artifacts from he middle ages on. Loved it!",
          "We visited and a service was coming to a close but they allowed us to quietly come inside. It was very sparse compared to many other cathedral's around the world BUT I really felt that it added to atmosphere, it was typically finnish.",
          "Physically, the cathedral dominates the city landscape and thus easy to locate from most vantage points in Turku (the old capital of Finland). In any case, it is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the river Aura. Considered to be the most important",

          "The Lutheran cathedral looks impressive situated on a small hill by the Aura river. Quite a few steps to climb to the front entrence? As most churches in Finland the interior is quite plain. I woul have liiked very much to take some pictures from the tower, but it was closed.",

          "Turku, the former capitol of finland has not, like the whole nation, that many fascinating buildings to visit - neglecting Helsinki. The cathedral of Turku is without any doubts a good exception. Just the matter of fact that one can find the only tomb of a finnish queen in whole",
          "Impressive considering it is not overly adorned. It's Lutheran, I believe. Services were in session in the side areas which made for a special atmosphere. It was lovely inside and out with the high arches and vaulted ceilings. Very central, overlooking the river and the center",
          "Quite a plain cathedral as they go but as it doesn't cost anything its worth a look. Surprisingly big and imposing when you get next to it and quite nice inside - would have liked to have climbed the tower but it was closed",
          "Impressive inside, and really beautiful from outside. Reconstructed after Turku's Great Fire. Worth a visit, it is one of the main symbols of Turku, and won't take too much time out of your trip. It's next to the river and very close to the city center, so it may be on your way",

        "wiki": "Kupittaa (Swedish: Kuppis) is a district in Turku, Finland. It is located on the eastern side of the city's centre, around the Kupittaa Park, the first landscaped park in a Finnish city. The district serves as a centre for recreation and business. Turku has recently planned a residential area for 750 residents on the premises of a former HKScan sausage factory.The area hosts, among other things, numerous sports facilities, such as the Veritas Stadion, a Finnish baseball stadium, a velodrome, a bowling alley, a skateboarding area and a BMX track, and the Kupittaa open-air swimming pools. The ice hockey arena in the district was demolished in 2005. A new one was inaugurated in November 2006.\nMost of the Turku Science Park business centre is located in Kupittaa. The centre is currently expanding around Kupittaa railway station, next to Finnish national road 1 (part of European route E18) between Helsinki and Turku. \nAccording to a version of the legend, the first pagan Finns were baptised into Christianity by the Bishop Henry at a spring in Kupittaa Park on Midsummer Day in the year 1155. In the 18th century, the spring was used as a spa facility.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Kupittaa may be associated with an old border and may be related to the word kupitsa a name for a boundary mark. Another theory is that it comes from the Russian word for a merchant, kupets.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTurku Science Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Kupittaa at Wikimedia Commons",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "W\u00e4in\u00f6 Valdemar Aaltonen (8 March 1894 \u2013 30 May 1966) was a Finnish artist and sculptor. The Chambers Biographical Dictionary describes him as \"one of the leading Finnish sculptors\".He was born to a tailor in the village of Karinainen, Finland. He became interested in art after being deaf as a child, and attended the School of Drawing of the Turku Art Association from age 16, or specifically between 1910 and 1915. He had spent many of the early years at this school studying painting, but he was mainly self-taught as a sculptor. He learned the technics of treatment of marble with his relative Aarre Aaltonen, and by working as a trainee stonemason in Hirvensalo. Sculptor Felix Nylund was a substitute teacher in the art school in Turku for one season, and his work was inspiration for young Aaltonen.A journey Aaltonen made to Italy in 1923 opened his eyes to cubist and futurist art. These elements can primarily be seen in his paintings.\nAs the Republic of Finland arose, and the First World War raged, he sculpted War Memorials. He soon became a nationalist icon, the exemplar Finn, establishing an exhibition in Stockholm in 1927. His sculpture is nationalist in nature, and he is noted for monumental figures and busts portraying citizens of Finland. An example is the 1925 sculpture of Paavo Nurmi, a cast of which is exhibited outside the Helsinki stadium. Another notable work is that of Jean Sibelius, a bust of 1928. These two works, like the main body of his work, are bronze casts\u2014though he did work in stone and even glass. Though chiefly naturalistic, the cubist influence is also present here. He was one of the early 20th-century pioneers of direct carving.\nWhen the new House of Parliament for Finland was built, architect Johan Sigfrid Sir\u00e9n wished he could buy sculptures directly from Aaltonen. Instead, an open competition was announced, and Aaltonen's Work and the Future was selected as the winner. The series of gilded plaster sculptures that Aaltonen completed in 1932 were cast in bronze after his death.Aaltonen was married four times. His first wife was singer Aino Alisa Pietik\u00e4inen from 1920, second wife actor Elsa Emilia Rantalainen from 1931, third wife gallerist in Galerie Artek Elvi Elisabet Hernell from 1942 and fourth wife medical doctor Marie Elisabeth Maasik from year 1961. His son Matti Aaltonen became an architect, who designed e.g. W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen museum in Turku.A large collection of his works are on permanent exhibition at the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art in Turku. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nTyt\u00f6n p\u00e4\u00e4, n. 1917\nGraniittipoika, 1917\u20131920\nMaria Jotuni, 1918\u20131920\nOpettajani, 1919\nAaro Hellaakosken pronssip\u00e4\u00e4, 1919\nSavonlinnan sankaripatsas, (The Hero's Grave) 1919\u20131921\nPunagraniittinen neito, 1923\nMustagraniittinen neito, 1924\nPaavo Nurmi runner statue, 1924\u20131925\nSeisova nainen, 1920\u20131924\nIstuva nainen, 1920\u20131925\nUimaan l\u00e4htev\u00e4 nainen, 1924\nTurun Lilja, n. 1924\u20131926\nMusica, 1926\nAleksis Kivi statue (Tampere), 1926\u20131927\nStatues on H\u00e4meensilta bridge, Tampere:  Er\u00e4nk\u00e4vij\u00e4 (the Hunter), Veronkantaja (the Tax Collector), Kauppias (the Merchant) ja Suomen neito (the Maiden of Finland), 1927\u20131929\nMyrsky (Memorial statue for the 53 victims of the sunken Finnish torpedo boat S2 in Reposaari, Pori), 1930\nStatues in the plenary chamber of Parliament House 1930\u20131932\nAleksis Kivi Memorial (Helsinki), 1930\u20131939\nMarjatta, 1934\nDelaware-muistomerkki, 1937\u20131938\nVapauden jumalatar seppel\u00f6i nuoruuden, 1939\u20131940\nMemorial of the Battle of K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4, 1939/1949\nTampereen Osuustoimintamuistomerkki, 1949\u20131950\nYst\u00e4vyys solmitaan (Joint monument for the cities of Turku and Gothenburg), n. 1948\u20131955\nLahden sankaripatsas, 1952\nRautatienrakentajien muistomerkki, 1957, Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4\nGenius ohjaa nuoruutta (in front of the University of Turku main library), 1958\u20131960\nStatues of president sin front of Parliament house: K.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Michael's Church (Finnish: Mikaelinkirkko, Swedish: Mikaelskyrkan) is a church situated in central Turku. It is named after Archangel Michael and was finished in 1905. It dominates the western skyline of the city of Turku was designed by Professor Lars Sonck and is one of the most popular wedding churches in Turku being able to seat 1,800 people. When Sonck won the competition for the church in 1894, he was only a 23-year-old architectural student. Michael's Church is older than Michael's parish. The parish only dates back to 1921.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nMichael's church is a distinguished example of the neogothic style in architecture. It is a long church with three aisles, galleries and a multifaceted choir. In addition to the main entrance there are also doors at each corner of the church. The sacristy is situated behind the choir. The main spire rises to a height of 77 meters from the foundations.\nThe main building material of the walls of the church is red brick. The roof is made of grey green slate from Norway. However, the majority of the material used in the construction of the church are native materials from Finland. For the foundations, the stone steps, and the walls, natural stone was quarried not far from Turku.\nEven before the construction work started, Sonck wanted to make considerable changes to his winning design, but the church council did not agree to the proposed changes and in the end only minor detail changes were made to the facade. As for the interior, however, Sonck got a much freer hand to make changes from his original drawings. This is clearly seen in the deviations from the style of the times: Jugend follows Gothic and Romantic Nationalism.\n\n\n== Interior design ==\n\nMax Frelander the architect, who worked as an assistant to Sonck, has contributed to the interior design. A rich Jugend ornamentation decorates both the interior, the staircases and the windows. The altar, the pulpit, the altar rail, and the window frame are all made of Finnish soapstone. The central motif of the altar is a cross, on which base there is a symmetrical carving of two serpents. Also on the corner level of the altar rail there are rings of twisting serpents. The top of the cross is ornamented with a dove, the symbol of the Holy Spirit. The Jugend windows of the choir, which depict Finnish pine, were destroyed in a bombing raid during the Finnish Winter War (1939\u20131940). The national romantic movement is particularly dominant in the design of the choir. Motifs from Finnish nature are associated with traditional Christian symbolism.\nThe original window paintings, which were destroyed during the Winter War, were by the artist Willy Baer. The new ones were obtained in 1953. These were designed and done by the artists Hilkka Toivola and Otso Karpakka. The principal subjects of these works of art that were made in the Paris glass painting studio of Jean and Pierre Gaudin, are \"the Good Shepherd\" and \"Faith, Hope, and Charity\". Along with the new windows the stylistic unity of the interior of the church disappeared. Consequently, in the 1950s other changes were made in the interior design of the church to match the Gothic exterior. First the decorative paintings of the choir and the arch of triumph were painted over, and later the wall paintings in the body of the church and the staircases. However, the original decorative pictures were restored in connection with the general repair work on the church that was carried out in 1964-65.\nMichael's Church underwent a thorough renovation in the 1980s. First, an exterior repair work was carried out in 1984-85. The decayed exterior brick work and the roof were completely rebuilt. Reconditioning of the interior was done in 1985-87. First the sacristy of the church was returned to its original condition. After this came the main body of the church and the staircase. The ceiling and the interior wall surfaces were carefully cleaned of grime of decades. The decorative designs were repaired and returned to their original paint finish or painted afresh. Floors were resurfaced with a new limestone finish. The acoustics of the church, which had proved a problem, was improved. In connection with this renovation work, a basic restoration of the 48 rank mechanical organ made in Kangasala in 1965 was also done. In 2002 the new organ with 52 ranks and 3633 pipes was built by the Swedish organ builders Gr\u00f6nlunds Orgelbyggeri AB.\nThe church bells have rung out from the main spire since 1931, and they were a gift from Edla and Hjalmar Aarnio. Reino Lehto made a gift to the church of the model ship hanging from the gallery. Kaarina Lehmussaari, lecturer in textiles, donated a new decorated altar cloth.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nTurku\nEvangelical Lutheran Church of Finland\nTurku Cathedral\nVIII District, Turku\n\n\n== External links ==\nVirtual Turku - images from the cathedral",

      "name": "The Old Great Square",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Old Great Square (Finnish: Vanha Suurtori, Swedish: Gamla Stortorget) is a medieval market square located in the city centre of Turku, Finland. It is located in the II District in very close proximity to Turku Cathedral. The area was the administrative and commercial centre of Turku since the founding of the city in the 13th century up until the Great Fire of Turku.\nToday, there are buildings alongside the Old Great Square, but only on the southern side because the blocks on the northern side changed to Porthaninpuisto after the fire. There are four historical buildings which the City of Turku restored for cultural use: the Brinkkala Mansion, Old Town Hall, Hjelt Mansion and Juselius Mansion. The buildings were mainly constructed after the fire and represent neoclassicism.\n\n\n== Historical buildings ==\n\n\n=== Brinkkala Mansion ===\nThe Brinkala Mansion is best known for the traditional proclamation of Christmas Peace, which has been given from the Brinkkala Mansion balcony each Christmas Eve at 12:00 since 1886. Prior to that, Christmas peace was proclaimed from the \"doors and windows of the town hall\" as the old saying went. The wooden balcony known as the Christmas peace balcony was added to the Brinkkala facade during renovations from 1884 to 1886. The declaration started in the 14th century. The earliest information about the Brinkkala Mansion is from the 16th century when it was a town house of the owner of Brinkhall Manor in Kakskerta. Before its renovations from 1884 to 1886, it was a hotel, town hall and Turku police station. Nowadays, it is a space for art galleries and banquet halls. There is a coffee house located in the courtyard. The Turku Medieval Market also takes place in the courtyard.\n\n\n=== Old Town Hall ===\nIt is assumed that the City of Turku administrative centre was headquartered at the Old Town Hall since the 14th century. The most famous of the Turku town halls was the stone building planned by master bricklayer Samuel Berner, finished in 1736. Berner's town hall was destroyed by the fire of 1827, along with its bell tower. A private house was built upon the walls of the badly destroyed building, this house being acquired by factory owner Juselius in the 1850s. The building was redone into a three story factory in 1899, which was active until the 1920s. In 1932, the building was acquired by the City of Turku, and was for police department use. Nowadays, it is a space for galleries and a banquet hall and concerts.\n\n\n=== Hjelt Mansion ===\nAfter the fire, Captain Hjelt bought the site along the town square, and built the impressive two story stone building in 1830. The Hjelt Mansion is the only remaining stone building in Finland which clearly represents the St. Petersburg empire style. The Hjelt Mansion was taken over by the City of Turku in the 1930s, at which time both stories were used by the police department. After this, the downstairs level was a used as the children's and young adult's section of Turku City Library, and the Turku Cultural Centre worked in the upstairs level. The library section moved to the new building of Turku Main Library and the Turku Cultural Centre moved next door to the Old Town Hall.\nFour Baltic sea organisations moved into the building at the beginning of 2008: UBC Environment and Sustainable Development Secretariat, WHO Healthy Cities, Centrum Balticum and Valonia. The building was officially designated as the It\u00e4meritalo (\"Baltic Sea house\") on 19 August 2008.\n\n\n=== Juselius Manor ===\n\nThe new renaissance Juselius Mansion is the newest of the buildings in the area. It was built by Carl Fredrik Juselius in 1892, originally as his home. It has been a residential building for city officials, space for the police department and a dociros office. Nowadays, the building is used for other purposes, such as the legendary restaurant Teini.\n\n\n=== Katedralskolan i \u00c5bo ===\nKatedralskolan i \u00c5bo is a Swedish-language senior high school, built after the fire on the foundation of the former Hovr\u00e4tt by C.L. Engel. Its style is empire. There reportedly was a school under the authority of Turku Cathedral in the Turku city centre in late 13th century called Turun katedraalikoulu.\n\n\n== Events ==\nThere are different events organised at the Old Great Square throughout the year. Turku Medieval Market is organised in June and July, stretching out to Porthaninpuisto, the courtyard and Luostarin V\u00e4likatu. Christmas City events also take place for three weekends  as well as events for Turku Night of the Arts.\n\n\n== Prospects ==\nThe Old Great Square and its historical surroundings have been designed to be marketed as the old part of the city of Turku. Under EU protection, the idea is to revive the area to a European style by attracting more cafes and restaurants and organising different events at the square and park. Furthermore, a bridge called Pennisilta, to replace the one destroyed by the fire, is due to be built to connect the old part of the city to the traffic centre.\n\n\n== Photo gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sources ==\n \nTurun Sanomat\nTurun kaupungin kulttuurikeskus\n\n\n== External links ==\nTurku Cultural Centre\nIhmiselle parempi keskusta -hanke",

The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

        "wiki": "Henry (Finnish: Henrik; Swedish: Henrik; Latin: Henricus; died c. 20 January 1156) was a medieval English clergyman. He came to Sweden with Cardinal Nicholas Breakspeare in 1153 and was most likely designated to be the new Archbishop of Uppsala, but the independent church province of Sweden could only be established in 1164 after the civil war, and Henry would have been sent to organize the Church in Finland, where Christians had already existed for two centuries.\nAccording to legend, he entered Finland together with King Saint Eric of Sweden and died as a martyr, becoming a central figure in the local Catholic Church. However, the authenticity of the accounts of his life and ministry are widely disputed and there are no historical records of his birth, existence or death.\nTogether with his alleged murderer, peasant Lalli, Henry is an important figure in the early history of Finland. His feast is celebrated by the majority Lutheran Church of Finland, as well as by the Catholic Church of Finland. He is commemorated in the liturgical calendars of several Protestant and Anglican churches.\n\n\n== Legend ==\n\n\n=== Vita and miracula ===\nThe legend of Bishop Henry's life, or his Vita, was written 150 years after his time, at the end of the 13th century, and contains little concrete information about him. He is said to have been an English-born bishop in Uppsala at the time of King Eric the Saint of Sweden in the mid-12th century, ruling the peaceful kingdom with the king in heavenly co-existence. To tackle the perceived threat from the non-Christian Finns, Eric and Henry were forced to do battle with them. After they had conquered Finland, baptized the people and built many churches, the victorious king returned to Sweden while Henry (Henricus) remained with the Finns, more willing to live the life of a preacher than that of a high bishop.The legend draws to a conclusion as Henry attempted to give a canonical punishment to a murderer. The accused man became enraged and killed the bishop, who was thus considered to be a martyr.The legend strongly emphasizes that Henry was a Bishop of Uppsala, not a Bishop of Finland which became a conventional claim later on, also by the church itself. He stayed in Finland out of pity, but was never appointed as a bishop there. The legend does not state whether there had been bishops in Finland before his time or what happened after his death; it does not even mention his burial in Finland. The vita is so void of any concrete information about Finland that it could have been created anywhere. The Latin is scholastic and the grammar is in general exceptionally good.\n\nHenry's Vita is followed by the more local miracula, a list of eleven miracles that various people were said to have experienced sometime after the bishop's death. With the exception of a priest in Skara who suffered a stomach ache after mocking Henry, all miracles seem to have taken place in Finland. The other miracles, which usually occurred following prayer to Bishop Henry, were:\nThe murderer lost his scalp when he put the bishop's hat on his head\nThe Bishop's finger was found the next Spring\nA boy was raised from the dead in Kaisala\nA girl was raised from the dead in Vehmaa\nA sick woman was healed in Sastamala\nA Franciscan called Erlend had his headache healed\nA blind woman got back her eyesight in Kyr\u00f6\nA man with a paralyzed leg could walk again in Kyr\u00f6\nA sick girl was healed\nA group of fishermen from Kokem\u00e4ki survived a stormMost versions of Henry's legend only include a selection of these miracles.\n\n\n=== Development of the legend ===\n\nHenry and his crusade to Finland were also a part of the legend of King Eric. The appendix of the early 13th century V\u00e4stg\u00f6talagen, which has a short description of Eric's memorable deeds, also makes no reference to Henry or the crusade. Henry and the crusade do not appear until a version of Eric's legend that dates to 1344. Similarities in the factual content and phraseology regarding the common events indicate that either one of the legends has acted as the model for the other. Henry's legend is commonly considered to have been written during the 1280s or 1290s at the latest, for the consecration of the Cathedral of Turku in 1300, when his alleged remains were translated there from Nousiainen, a parish not far from Turku.\n\n\n==== Absence from the historical record ====\nYet, even as late as in the 1470s, the crusade legend was ignored in the Chronica regni Gothorum, a chronicle of the history of Sweden, written by Ericus Olai, the Canon of the Uppsala cathedral.Noteworthy in the development of the legend is that the first canonically elected Bishop of Turku, Johan (1286\u20131289) of Polish origin, was elected as the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1289, after three years in office in Turku. The Swedish bishops of Finland before him, Bero, Ragvald and Kettil, had apparently been selected by the King of Sweden. Related to the new situation was also the appointment of the king's brother as the Duke of Finland in 1284, which challenged the Bishop's earlier position as the sole authority on all local matters. Johan was followed in Turku by Bishop Magnus (1291\u20131308), who had been born in Finland.In 1291 a document by the cathedral chapter makes no reference to Henry even though it mentions the cathedral and election of the new bishop many times. A papal letter by Pope Nicholas IV from 1292 has the Virgin Mary as the sole patrona in Turku.\n\n\n==== Appearance in the historical record ====\nThe first mention of Bishop Henry in historical sources is from 1298, when he is mentioned along with king Eric in a document from a provincial synod of Uppsala in Telge. This document, although mentioned many times as a source over the centuries, was not correctly dated until 1910.\n\nThe legend itself is also first referred in a letter by the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1298, where Eric and Henry are mentioned together as martyrs who needed to be prayed to for the sake of the situation in Karelia, associating their alleged crusade to Finland with the new expeditions against Novgorod. The war between Novgorod and Sweden for the control of Karelia had started in 1293. The first certain appearance of Henry's image in the seal of the Bishop of Turku is not until 1299.The first mention of Henry of Uppsala being the patron saint of Turku cathedral is not until 14 August 1320, when he is mentioned as the second patron of the cathedral after Virgin Mary. When he is later addressed by Pope Boniface IX as the patronus of the Cathedral of Turku along with the Virgin Mary, and referred to as a saint, it was in the year 1391.  Some sources claim that Henry was canonized in 1158, but this information has been traced to a late publication by Johannes Vastovius in 1623 and is generally regarded as a fabrication.Thus, Henry's veneration as a saint and his relation to King Eric seem to have emerged in the historical record at the same time in the mid-1290s with strong support from the church. This correlates with the start of the war against Novgorod. Sources do not support the popular assumption that Henry's cult developed in Nousiainen and gradually spread among ordinary people before official adoption. In 1232, the church in Nousiainen was consecrated only to the Virgin Mary, and it was not until 1452 that Henry was mentioned as the patronus of Nousiainen.\n\n\n=== Veneration ===\n\nDespite the high-profile start of Henry's cultus, it took more than 100 years for the veneration of Saint Henry to gain widespread acceptance throughout Sweden. As of 1344 there were no relics of the bishop in the Cathedral of Uppsala. According to one biographer, Henry's veneration was rare outside the Diocese of Turku throughout the 14th century. Vadstena Abbey near Link\u00f6ping seems to have played a key role in establishment of Henry's legend elsewhere in Sweden in the early 15th century. Henry never received the highest totum duplex veneration in Uppsala nor was he made a patronus of the church there, which status he had both in Turku and Nousiainen.At the end of the Roman Catholic era in Sweden, Henry was well established as a local saint. The dioceses in Sweden and elsewhere venerating Henry were as follows, categorized by his local ranking:\nTotum duplex: Turku, Link\u00f6ping, Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s\nDuplex: Uppsala, Lund (Denmark), V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, V\u00e4xj\u00f6\nSemiduplex: Nidaros (Norway)\nSimplex: SkaraHenry seems to have been known in northern Germany, but he was largely ignored elsewhere in the Roman Catholic world.\n\nIn the Bishopric of Turku, the annual feast day of Henry was January 20 (talviheikki, \"Winter Henry\"), according to traditions the day of his death. Elsewhere his memorial was held already on January 19, since more prominent saints were already commemorated on January 20. After the Reformation, Henry's day was moved to the 19th in Finland as well. The existence of the feast day is first mentioned in 1335, and is known to have been marked in the liturgical calendar from the early 15th century onwards. Another memorial was held on June 18 (kes\u00e4heikki, \"Summer Henry\") which was the day of the translation of his relics to the Cathedral of Turku.\nGaudeamus omnes (\"Let all rejoice\"), a Gregorian introit for the Mass in honor of Henry has survived within the late 14th or early 15th century Graduale Aboense.\n\n\n=== Political dimensions ===\n\nAccording to legend, establishment of the church of Finland was entirely the work of the saint-king Eric of Sweden, assisted by the bishop from the most important diocese in the country. The first half of the legend describes how the king and the bishop ruled Sweden like 'two great lights' with feelings of 'internal love' toward each other, emphasizing the peaceful coexistence of the secular and ecclesiastical rule during a happy era when 'predatory wolves' could not hit their 'poisonous teeth against the innocent'. The reality was quite different \u2013 Eric's predecessor, Eric himself and two of his successors were all murdered almost within a decade, one of the bloodiest times for the Swedish royalty. In the 1150s, the Bishop of Uppsala was also in a bitter fight with the Bishop of Link\u00f6ping over which see would become archiepiscopal. The crusade itself is described as a brief and bloodless event that was only performed to bring the \"blind and evil heathen people of Finland\" under Christian order.The writer of the legend seems to have been especially interested in presenting the bishop as a humble martyr. He has fully ignored his place of death and burial and other \"domestic\" Finnish interests, which were much more apparent in folk traditions. The legend and folk traditions eventually influenced each other, and the church gradually adopted many additional details to its saint bishop.\n\n\n== Folk traditions ==\nAmong the many folk traditions about Henry, the most prominent is the folk poem \"The Death-lay of Bishop Henry\" (Piispa Henrikin surmavirsi). The poem almost completely ignores Henry's life and ministry and concentrates on his death.\n\n\n=== Henry's origins ===\nAccording to the poem, Henry had grown up in \"Cabbage Land\" (Kaalimaa), which has puzzled Finnish historians for centuries. The name might be connected to a coastal area in northern Finland Proper called Kaland, which is also mentioned in conjunction with an unrelated early preacher in Vesilahti, upper Satakunta, whose local name was \"Fish of Kaland\" (Kalannin kala, also known as Hunnun herra). Bishop Mikael Agricola wrote in his Se Wsi Testamenti in 1548, that the earliest Swedish settlers in Finland had come from Gotland to the islets on the coast of Kaland, being harassed by Finns and seeking help from their relatives in Sweden.It has also been suggested that the name might be related to Gaelic, which would presumably have referred to the bishop's Scottish origins, though the legend gives him as a native Englishman.Folk traditions have no information on the crusade whatsoever. King Eric is briefly mentioned in the death-lay's preface as Henry's concerned \"brother\". Henry appears as a lone preacher who moved around southwestern Finland more or less on his own. Besides the name, he has only little in common with the Henry in the church vita.Kokem\u00e4ki is often mentioned in traditions as a place where Henry preached. Kokem\u00e4ki was later one the central parishes in Satakunta. This province was first mentioned in historical documents in 1331.\n\n\n=== Death and burial ===\n\nThe death-lay's version of the bishop's death was different from the vita. The bishop's killer was called Lalli. Lalli's wife Kerttu falsely claimed to him that upon leaving the manor, their ungrateful guest Henry, travelling around on his own in the middle of winter, had without permission or recompense, through violence, taken food, cake from the oven and beer from the cellar, for himself and hay for his horse, and left nothing but ashes. This is supposed to have enraged Lalli so that he immediately grabbed his skis and went in pursuit of the thief, finally chasing Henry down on the ice of Lake K\u00f6yli\u00f6nj\u00e4rvi in Eura. There he killed him on the spot with an axe. Lalli then proceeded to steal the late holy man's hat, called a mitre, and place it on his own head. When Lalli's mother questioned him about where he found the hat, he attempted to take it off, but with it came his scalp. Lalli then died a painful death. The 17th century lay version smugly comments that:\n\nThe 17th century lay version of the tale was intended to be performed during the annual pilgrimage along Henrik's final route.\nIn some versions of the poem, considered older, Lalli's weapon was a sword. The axe was the murder weapon of Saint Olaf, who was very popular in Finland and may have influenced Henry's legend. However, since Lalli is not portrayed as a member of the upper class, it is unlikely that he possessed an expensive weapon like a sword, and the axe is a more historically likely choice for Henry's murder.\nBefore his death, Henry instructed the coachman to gather his remaining body parts in a cloth tied with blue string, place it in a cart drawn by a stallion. When the stallion broke, he was to replace it with an ox, and when the ox stopped, he was to build a church. This is where Henrik's remains were to be buried.\nMedieval folk traditions enumerate the pestilences and misfortunes which befell Lalli after his slaying of the bishop. His hair and scalp are said to have fallen out as he took off the bishop's cap, taken as a trophy. Removing the bishop's ring from his finger, just bones remained. Eventually he ran into a lake and drowned himself.\n\n\n=== Development of folk traditions ===\nBasically the death-lay is a simple story of a short-tempered man who falls victim of his \"bad-mouthed wife's\" sharp tongue. The poem has no pity for Lalli, and he is not depicted as a hero in a story whose true antagonist is Kerttu. The depiction of Henry's death built on an independent tradition that was once in direct competition with that of the legend, which is largely forgotten today. It remains unknown whether the two traditions were built around the same person.The poem, following the traditional Kalevala metre, has survived as several 17th and 18th century literations from various parts of Finland. Some of its elements appear in earlier works, but it hardly dates older than the vita. There is debate on whether the original poem was constructed by one or more individuals. The writer has however had superficial understanding of the church legends.Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are originally German names, which might indicate that the poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose influence is visible in other aspects, too. The way Lalli is manipulated to commit the crime and what happens to him later seem to be taken from a medieval Judas fable. Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.Based on finds from medieval church ruins in the tiny island of Kirkkokari (\"Church Rock\", previously known as the \"Island of Saint Henry\") in Lake K\u00f6yli\u00f6nj\u00e4rvi, the bishop's veneration began in the latter half of the 14th century, well after Henry had received his official status as a local saint, and 200 years after his alleged death. A small granary in the nearby Kokem\u00e4ki, claimed to have been the bishop's place of rest the night before his death, could not be dated earlier than the late 15th century in dendrochronological examinations.However, the poem's claim that Henry was buried in Nousiainen was already held to be true around 1300, when his alleged bones were translated from Nousiainen to the Cathedral of Turku. A mid-15th century Chronicon episcoporum Finlandensium also confirmed K\u00f6yli\u00f6 as the place of his death. Neither place is mentioned in the vita in any way. The church seems to have gradually complemented its own legends by adopting elements from the folk traditions, especially during the 15th century.\n\n\n== Historical sources ==\nToday, the legend of Henry is challenged by some historians to the point of being labelled as pure imagination. Completely invented saints were not exceptional in Europe, and there is no direct evidence of either the crusade or Henry.The bishop's alleged violent death however, is no reason to doubt his potential existence, as many bishops were murdered during the turmoils of the 12th and 13th centuries, although most were not elevated to sainthood. Saxo Grammaticus said of the Battle of Fotevik in 1134 that never had so many bishops been killed at the same time. Notable bishops that died violently included the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1187, Bishop of Estonia in 1219 and Bishop of Link\u00f6ping in 1220.\n\n\n=== Bishop of Uppsala ===\nThere is no historical record of a Bishop of Uppsala called Henry during the reign of King Eric (about 1156\u20131160). Early phases of the diocese remain obscure up to the point of Stefan, who was appointed as the archbishop in 1164.A certain Henry is mentioned in Incerti scriptoris Sueci chronicon primorum in ecclesia Upsalensi archiepiscoporum, a chronicle of Uppsala archbishops, before Coppmannus and Stefan, but after Sverinius (probably mentioned in German sources in 1141/2 as \"Siwardus\"), Nicolaus and Sweno. Besides the name, the chronicle knows that he was martyred and buried in Finland in the Cathedral of Turku. Latest research dates the chronicle to the early 15th century when Henry's legend was already established in the kingdom, leaving only little significance to its testimony.\n\nA late 15th century legenda nova claimed that Henry had come to Sweden in the retinue of papal legate Nicholas Breakspear, the later Pope Adrian IV, and appointed as the Bishop of Uppsala by him. Even though legenda nova states 1150 as the year of the crusade, it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. It is not known whether this was just an inference by the writer, based on the fact that also Nicholas was an Englishman. However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in Uppsala. Another claim by legenda nova was that Henry was translated to Turku cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s. In the late 16th century, Bishop Paulus Juusten claimed that Henry had been the Bishop of Uppsala for two years before the crusade. Based on these postulates, early 20th-century historians assembled 1155 as the year of the crusade and 1156 as the year of Henry's death. Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.Contradicting these claims, the medieval Annales Suecici Medii Aevi and the 13th century legend of Saint Botvid mention some Henry as the Bishop of Uppsala (Henricus scilicet Upsalensis) in 1129, participating in the consecration of the saint's newly built church. He is apparently the same Bishop Henry who died at the Battle of Fotevik in 1134, fighting along with the Danes after being banished from Sweden. Known from the Chronicon Roskildense written soon after his death and from Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum from the early 13th century, he had fled to Denmark from Sigtuna, the see of the early Uppland bishops before it was moved a few kilometers to its later location in Uppsala sometime before 1164. He is ignored in all Swedish bishop chronicles, unless he is the same Henry who was later redated to the 1150s. That would make the claim about him coming to Finland with King Eric a late innovation, where memory about a killed bishop in Uppsala sometime in the 12th century was reused in a new context.Noteworthy also, is a story written down by Adam of Bremen in his Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church) from 1075/6 about a certain foreigner called Hericus, who was slain and martyred while preaching among the Sueones. Adam had heard the story from King Sweyn II of Denmark. According to some historians, resemblance to later legend about an English-born Henricus, who was allegedly slain and martyred in Finland, is too striking to be a coincidence.\n\n\n=== Bishop of Finland ===\nNo historical source remains that would confirm the existence of a bishop named Henry in Finland. However, papal letters mentioning an unidentified Bishop of Finland in 1209, 1221, 1229 and 1232 have survived. Some copies of another papal letter from 1232 call the bishop as \"N.\", but the letter \"N\" may originally have also been something resembling it. The first certainly known Bishop of Finland is Thomas, who is first mentioned in 1234. It is however possible, that Fulco, the Bishop of Estonia mentioned in sources from 1165 and 1171, was the same as Folquinus, a legendary Bishop of Finland at the end of the 12th century, but this remains only a theory.\n\nNo Bishop or Diocese of Finland is mentioned in a papal letter from 1171 (or 1172) by the seemingly well-informed Pope Alexander III, who otherwise addressed the situation of the church in Finland. The Pope mentions that there were preachers, presumably from Sweden, working in Finland and was worried about their bad treatment by the Finns. The Pope had earlier in 1165 authorized the first missionary Bishop of Estonia to be appointed, and was a close acquaintance of both Eskil, the Archbishop of Lund, and Stefan, the Archbishop of Uppsala, who both had spent time with him in France where he had been exiled in the 1160s. Following the situation in Estonia, the Pope personally interfered in the Estonian mission in 1171, ordering assistance for the local Bishop Fulco from Norway.No surviving list of bishops or dioceses under the Archbishop of Uppsala from 1164, 1189, 1192, 1233, 1241 or 1248 contains any reference to Finland, neither factual or propagandist. No claim about a Swedish bishop in Finland is made in any other source from the era prior to the so-called Second Swedish Crusade in 1249.\n\nThe first mention of a bishop in Finland is from a papal letter in 1209. It was sent to Archbishop Anders of Lund by Pope Innocent III as a reply to the Archbishop's earlier letter which has not survived. According to the Archbishop, the Bishop of the newly established church in Finland was dead, apparently from natural causes since his passing away is mentioned to have been \"lawful\", and the see had been vacant for some time. The Archbishop had complained to the Pope how difficult it was to get anyone to be a bishop in Finland and planned to appoint someone without formal adequacy, who was already working in Finland. The Pope approved of Archbishop's suggestion without questioning his opinions. It is noteworthy that the Archbishop of Uppsala, Valerius (1207\u20131219/1224), was also in Denmark at the time, temporarily exiled from Sweden after having allied with the deposed King Sverker, yet another exile in Denmark.Whether the appointment of the said preacher ever took place, remains unknown. Note should be taken that the King of Sweden at the time was Eric, a grandson of his better known namesake Eric the Saint. Eric had taken over Sweden in 1208 and was crowned king two years later. The Pope who had strongly sided with Sverker, ignored him at first, but finally recognized him in 1216, commenting many requests that he had apparently made ever since having taken the office. Based on the papal letter that year, Eric seems to have had a plan to invade some country that allegedly had been \"taken from the heathens by his predecessors\" and was allowed to install a bishop there. Similar letters were sent to the King of Denmark in 1208 and 1218, who is known to have meant Estonia both times. Sweden also attacked Estonia in 1220. Eric died of illness 1216. Almost nothing is known about his time as the king.Nevertheless, someone was eventually appointed and installed as the new bishop, since Pope Honorius III sent a letter directly to an unnamed Bishop of Finland in 1221. According to the letter, Archbishop Valerius had followed the situation in Finland and sent a report to the Pope, worried about a threat from unidentified \"barbarians\". It is notable that when the Pope quoted Valerius in his letter, he calls the church in Finland to have been established \"newly\", the same claim that Anders had made 12 years earlier. The list of Swedish bishops which survives from this era is from king John Sverkerson's coronation from the year 1219 and it mentions the bishops which have been present at the coronation. Finland as well as W\u00e4xj\u00f6 are not among those five, which so seem to have been all the bishops of the Swedish realm at that time. So the Finnish bishop's possible position under Uppsala's primacy is highly improbable.Despite so many high-ranking church representatives being involved in the 1209/1221 arrangements, later chronicles are fully ignorant on the situation in Finland at the time, or if there was even a bishop then. The first 13th-century bishop is said to have been Thomas, and his predecessor remains unknown. According to 15th and 16th century chronicles, Henry was followed by bishops Rodulff and Folquinus, after whom there was a 25\u201330-year gap before Thomas. However, according to the papal letter Ex tuarum no such gap has ever existed, since the archbishop of Lund\nwas given the right to anoint a new bishop to Finland in 1209 after the death of the previous. So the logic and datings of the sixteenth-century writers must be esteemed as false. The date 1209 is far too early for a Dominican like Thomas to step into the office, and so Rodolphus, the first real bishop of Finland and his successor Folquinus must be considered as 13th-century bishops nominated and appointed by the Danish and not by the Swedes. As an extra proof of this the ancient Finnish taxation system of church taxes has its roots in Denmark, not in Sweden. And the same goes to lay taxes especially in the \u00c5land Islands and to the old Finnish monetary system. As J. W. Ruuth already nearly a hundred years ago pointed out, Finland was at that time a Danish and not a Swedish mission territory, where the Danes according to the Danish annals made there expeditions in 1191, 1202 and possible even 1210\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Relics ===\n\nHenry was allegedly buried in Nousiainen, from where his bones\u2014or at least something that was thought to be his bones\u2014were transported to Turku in 1300. In addition to traditions, the only source connecting Nousiainen to early bishops is a letter signed by Bishop Thomas in Nousiainen in 1234. Archaeological excavations of pre-Catholic cemeteries in Nousiainen and surrounding parishes show a clear discontinuation of traditions in the early 13th century, but no abrupt changes are apparent in the religious environment among the 12th century finds.Whatever the case, the bishop's grave seems to have been traced to Nousiainen latest after his elevation to sainthood. A number of medieval documents mention that the bishop's grave continued to be located in the local church, presumably meaning that all the bones had not been translated to Turku. The church was later adorned with a grandiose 15th century cenotaph, whose replica can be found in the National Museum of Finland in Helsinki.\n\nMost of the bones in Turku were still in place in 1720 when they were catalogued for a transfer to Saint Petersburg during the Russian occupation of Finland in the Great Northern War. The man behind the idea was Swedish Count Gustaf Otto Douglas who had defected to the Russian side during the war and was in charge of the grim occupation of Finland. What happened to the bones after that, remains unknown. According to some sources, the Russian vessel transporting the relics sank on the way. However, it is generally acknowledged that a piece of Henry's ulna had been placed in Bishop Hemming's reliquarium that was built in 1514 and treasured in the cathedral. Also enclosed was a piece of parchment stating the bone belonged to Henry. During the restoration work of the cathedral, the relic was relocated to the National Board of Antiquities. It was later placed inside the altar of St. Henry's Cathedral in Helsinki.In 1924, several other bones, including a jawless skull, were found in a sealed closet in the Cathedral of Turku. These are also referred to as Henry's relics in popular media and even by the church, even though that designation remains speculative and the bones may have belonged to some other saint. The bones are currently stored in the Cathedral of Turku.\n\n\n=== Henry's status today ===\n\nAlthough Henry has never been officially canonized, he has been referred to as a saint since as early as 1296 according to a papal document of the time, and continues to be called as such today as well. On the basis of the traditional accounts of Henry's death, his recognition as saint took place prior to the founding of the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints and the official canonization process of the Roman Catholic Church. Henry is currently commemorated on January 19 on the calendar of commemorations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada. January 19 is also Henry's name day in Sweden and Finland. He continues to be remembered as a local observance in the Catholic Church of Finland, where the cathedral church is dedicated to Henry's memory. The cathedral was consecrated in 1860 and is headed by fr. Marco Pasinato.The Kirkkokari island in Lake K\u00f6yli\u00f6nj\u00e4rvi remains the only Catholic place of pilgrimage in Finland, with a memorial service held every year on second Sunday in June before the Midsummer festival. Also the medieval 140 km countryside route, the Saint Henry's Way, from K\u00f6yli\u00f6 to Nousiainen has been marked all the way for people willing to walk through it. Association of \"Ecumenical pilgrimage of St. Henry\" has been organized around the event.Based on folk traditions about the bishop's activities, the municipalities of Nousiainen, K\u00f6yli\u00f6 and Kokem\u00e4ki use images from Henry's legend in their coats of arms.Today, Henry and his alleged murderer Lalli remain two of the best-known persons from the medi\u00e6val history of Finland.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSaint Henry, Bishop of Finland, patron saint archive\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAgricola, Mikael (1987), Mikael Agricolan teokset 1, ISBN 951-0-13900-9\nAndresen, Lembit (2002) [1997], Eesti Ajalugu I\u2013II. 1997.

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational.

F\u00f6ri is also the only municipally owned ferry in Finland. The name \"F\u00f6ri\" is derived either from the Swedish word \"f\u00e4rja\", or from the English word \"ferry\".If the river freezes over and the ice is thicker than 30 cm, the ferry is replaced by an ice bridge.\n\n\n== History ==\nF\u00f6ri was built at the Ab Vulcan in 1903 to suit the needs of the employees at the Barker factory in Turku on the shore of the River Aura. The ferry was originally driven by steam engines fed from a woodfired boiler. In 1955 the steam engines were replaced by diesel engines. The ferry was operated by the City of Turku till 2008, when the operation was outsourced to West Coast Seaservices.In 2015 it was announced that the two diesel engines powering the F\u00f6ri would be replaced by electric motors. The old engines consumed 7500\u20138000 litres of fuel each year, with the average speed of ~2 km/h. According to the manufacturer Visedo Oy, the new electric engines should consume around 3-4 kW/h, depending on the season. The average speed will remain unchanged and the ferry will still have dual motors for redundancy. Each of the two engines consists of a DC/DC converter to increase the voltage from the batteries, and a permanent magnet motor drive to transform the electrical signal into mechanical energy. Both of the two motors can also be used simultaneously if more power is needed due to e.g. ice conditions. The new system is also eight tonnes lighter than the diesel engines and hydraulic motor it has replaced. This retrofit was done by Mobimar Oy, and it took place in the spring of 2017.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nF\u00f6ri, the City Ferry\nReal-time running data",

        "wiki": "Ida Helmi Tuulikki Pietil\u00e4 (18 February 1917 \u2013 23 February 2009) was an American-born Finnish graphic artist and professor, born in Seattle, Washington, United States. Pietil\u00e4 was one of the most influential people in Finnish graphic arts, and her work has been shown in numerous art exhibitions. She worked as a teacher in the Academy of Fine Arts, Helsinki, for many years, and later trained graphic artists and wrote instructional books about graphic arts.\nPietil\u00e4 began her studies at Turku Drawing School (now TUAS Arts Academy of Turku University of Applied Sciences), which she attended from 1933 to 1936, and went on to study at the drawing school of the Finnish Art Association (1936\u20131940), the University College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm (1945\u20131949) and the Fernand L\u00e9ger Art Academy in Paris (1949\u20131953). During her studies, she met her future life partner Tove Jansson; they collaborated on many works and projects, including the Moomin works, in collaboration with Pentti Eistola. These are now exhibited at the Moomin Museum in Tampere.\nJansson's and Pietil\u00e4's travels and summers spent together on the Klovharu island in Pellinki have been captured on several hours of film, shot by Pietil\u00e4. Several documentaries have been made of this footage, the latest being Haru, yksin\u00e4inen saari (Haru, the lonely island) (1998) and Tove ja Tooti Euroopassa (Tove and Tooti in Europe) (2004).\nThe first exhibition of Pietil\u00e4's work was in Turku in 1935. Her first private exhibition was in 1951. She has participated in the Purnu group's summer exhibitions since 1967, with a retrospective exhibition in 1986. She has also participated in several exhibitions abroad. Pietil\u00e4 has gained praise for her work; she was awarded the Pro Finlandia medal in 1963 and the title of professor in 1982.Pietil\u00e4 inspired the energetic figure Tooticky in Jansson's Moomin books. The architect Reima Pietil\u00e4 was Tuulikki Pietil\u00e4's brother.Pietil\u00e4 died at her home on 23 February 2009.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "We visited the place to see winter magic. We actually thought it would atleast some artificial winter like structure. Unfortunately (No snow in Helsinki side this year). But nothing . It's just few characters and that's it. We finished whole park in 45 mins. And about cost - I",
          "We chose october for visiting because then there is less people and more room for discovering the island. Also some attractions are already closed for winter but you can see all the main things anyway. When we vist, the weather was rainy and cloudy but it didn\u2019t hesitate us",
          "This theme park is not about rides or machines. It is like stepping to a different world and fairy tale. Great for kids and adults alike!",
          "the theme park is quite attractive as they provide a lot of things of Moomins, as a Moomin fan, I like the performance very much, very vivid. the Moomin house is another thing attracted me a lot, there are a lot of magic happened in this place. enjoy the good weather, enjoy the",
          "The park is very pleasant, full with attractions for kids and adult moomin lovers alike. My advice would be to try and ignore the shopping alley on the way to Moomin house. After visiting it, go on to the nature trail and the sea shore, and have a swim! After all those must-dos,",
          "First time for us here. Great park, cute characters and just lovely place for kids and parents. This park is easily accessible and has all the things family needs during the stay. I think the best age for visit is 2-5 years old.",
          "So me and my friend (24 years old) had a great time at Moomin world! We stayed for about 3,5 hours, a lunch break and a theater show included, and for us it was the perfect spent time. We got to see everything we wanted. I'm the biggest moomin fan, so this was a dream come true",
          "This is the best entertainment park for kids I have ever been. You can spend the whole day in there, the kids are well cared for and entertained. My little ones loved it - she is a great fan of Moomins. We definitely be coming back",
          "Best part are meeting charecters and seeing shows. Don\u2019t forget to check show times from day program.",
          "The archipelago setting is totally beautiful - but oddly ruined at Moominworld by the cheap fairground aesthetic and total lack of storybook magic. It was really so sad to see the Moomin stories/characters treated in this way, in second place to the sale of merchandise, food etc",
          "This place is so expensive to get in and then you are met with a bunch of over priced shops selling ridiculously overpriced merchandise. The food options are extremely expensive and awful quality. The \"theme park\" itself, is capitalising on nostalgia and is very low on",
          "Can\u2019t say enough good things about this place, it\u2019s become an annual thing for our family with good reason! Such a lovely positive place , full of fun things to do in a wonderful well thought location.",
          "I had high expectations of this place and had been looking forward to this day for months\u2026And it still far exceeded my expectations! The whole day was just magical from start to finish. From crossing the bridge to sdeing the Moomin house for the first time. All of the characters",
          "Our 2 children liked it. Especially the Moomins house. We spent 4 hours for 120 eur and another 30 eur for souvenirs. So pretty too much. Actually we visited all attractions in 1,5 hours. And later stayed at the Beach just not to be sad about the money spent. Performance was in",
          "Very close to Turku, there is a beautiful place to visit Naantali...and there is a small island, the Moomi world...we all had a good time there...a must is the theater...and everything!!!",

          "Everything was in Finnish but I actually enjoyed myself there. They have a great buffet lunch deal. Great for families. Don't expect rides because it's a theme park not an amusement park.",
          "From turku we rode the t82 bus to naantali, from the last stop we had to walk 1km or so to a connecting bridge to moominworld. The details inside houses were very good, you would think that they really do live there! Food and drinks available inside the park, tried the buffet,",
          "Always for me muumiland was air, now with children's that change, for one visit every place have change",
          "Well worth visiting for people with kids. Being a grandad and mummi. Visiting with daughter son in law and one 3 year old and a 5 month old we visited 1 - 5.30. Could have went and earlier and stayed till six but was enough time for their ages. Lots to see and do you know it",

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

It was established in 1998 and covers 29 square kilometres (11 sq mi). The area consists mainly of bog but also includes primeval forests, some of which have been unmanaged for over 150 years. The Eurasian lynx is a permanent resident of Kurjenrahka, but brown bears and gray wolves have also been observed and are known to reside in areas within or close to the park. Marked trails in the general area extend to over 300 km.In Middle Ages the forests were jointly owned by the local parish. In early 1800s two manors bought them, but they had financially hard times and had to sell them to the state before end of the 19th century. Before selling, they logged clear all areas with easy access, but some islands in middle of mires remained unlogged.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of national parks of Finland\nProtected areas of Finland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Kurjenrahka National Park at Wikimedia Commons\n Kurjenrahka National Park travel guide from Wikivoyage\nOutdoors.fi \u2013 Kurjenrahka National Park",

        "wiki": "\u00c5bo Svenska Theater (\u00c5bo Svenska Teater) is a Finland-Swedish theatre in the city of Turku in Finland and the oldest theatre in the country, founded in 1839. The building itself is also the oldest still functioning theatre house in Finland. The name means \"The Swedish theatre of \u00c5bo\"; \u00c5bo is the Swedish name of the city of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku was the capital city of Finland during Finland's epoch as a part of Sweden, and Swedish theatre companies visited Finland during the 18th-century, the first of whom was the Stenborg Troupe in 1761and the company of Carl Seuerling in the 1780s. There where however, no proper theatre building until the Bonuviers Teater was erected in the 1810s. When the old theatre was destroyed during the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, there was a need of a new theater house.  \n\n\n=== 1839-1894 ===\nThe theatre has been located in its present building since 1839, when it was opened by a local amateur society with the play Gubben i Bergsbygden the 21 January 1839.  Later that same year, the theatre house was used by its first professional theatre company, that of Ulrik Torsslow, and its first professional concert singer, Betty Boije.  In 1843, concerts by Johanna von Schoultz and Jenny Lind where both performed on its stage.Prior to 1894, the theatre did not have a permanent staff, as Finland did not have any native actors at this point, and during the 19th-century the theatre house was used by travelling theatre companies from Sweden. The most notable of these were the company of Pierre Deland, which visited the theatre regularly from 1840 to 1861, as well as the so called \"Finnish Company\" of Edvard Stjernstr\u00f6m, which enjoyed theatre monopoly in Southern Finland in 1850-53. In the 1870s and 1880s, the famed Swedish company of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Elfforss frequnelty visited the theatre. The first native theatre company performed in the theatre was the company of August Westermark in 1872, though it was not to be until 1894, that the first performance was given by a permanent native ensemble at the theatre.\n\n\n== Activity ==\nThe theatre building is owned by Stiftelsen f\u00f6r \u00c5bo Akademi and it is run by \u00c5bo Svenska Teaterf\u00f6rening.\nThe theatre has three formal stages; Stora Scenen, with 365 seats, Studioscenen with 136 seats, and Tiljan-scenen, with a maximum of one hundred seats, as well as local activity.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links and sources ==\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\nNordensvan, Georg, Svensk teater och svenska sk\u00e5despelare fr\u00e5n Gustav III till v\u00e5ra dagar.

        "wiki": "Ruissalo (Finnish; Runsala in Swedish) is an island in the Archipelago Sea and a district of the city of Turku, Finland. The island is located to the south-west of the city, between Hirvensalo and Pansio in the mainland. It is rather sparsely populated, having a population of only 126 (as of 2004), with an annual growth rate of 3.97%. The villas on the island are considered culturally and historically valuable in Finland. Some are used as guesthouses, some are owned and governed by the foundations, labor unions, sports teams, and private enterprises on the area, some can be rented freely for some days for private party such as weddings, some have cafeterias in them. Private ownership exists, a couple villas even have renters with very selective occupancy. Some villas have deteriorated for the high maintenance costs due to the historical building methods that must be used here. \nOne of the largest old oak forests in Finland is situated in the island and many parts of it are included in nature conservation programs.\nIn the westernmost part of the island there is a spa and a camping area. Turku golf course is situated also here. The Botanical garden of University of Turku is situated in the middle of the island. Near the southern tip of the western part of the island have once been a small, unofficial nude beach. Official nude beaches in Finland can only be found in Helsinki and in Pori.\n15.08% of the district's population are under 15 years old, while 13.49% are over 65. The district's linguistic makeup is 88.89% Finnish, 8.73% Swedish, and 2.38% other.\nThe island is probably most famous as the venue of the annual rock festival Ruisrock. The Paavo Nurmi Marathon route goes through Ruissalo.\n\n\n== External links ==\nRuissalo, in Finnish",

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland.

Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia.

Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history.

The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

          "We spent about 3 hours at this castle but we easily could have spent twice that time. This is a unique place with lots of very interesting and beautiful things to see and a fascinating history to learn. I would say that if this castle were in a less remote place than Finland",
          "We weren't sure about this, knowing very little Finnish history we might have been in over our heads, but the explanations of each room were good, and I got a better sense of the stories within. There was a somewhat strange set of animal exhibitions that added some art and",

          "You can almost imagine this is a castle from Game of Thrones! It has been beautifully restored, but the character still remains. If you let your imagination run away with you, you can imagine yourself in a beautiful gown, sitting in the ladies chamber with all your ladies",

          "I'll recommend to walk along the Aura River to the castle. The river view is spectacular. If you like boats and ships, the location near the river mouth will definitely feast your eyes. The castle has two parts - the round tower and the main castle itself. Worth paying a visit!",

          "I liked this excursion much more than I thought I would. This is a Huge place and well maintained. As with most things in Turku it is a very low key place with not a lot of hype. The guides dressed in traditional clothing showed very little emotion but having spent 10 days in",

          "Good tour guide, very knowledgable. I really liked that she wore a medieval dress. The tour was a bit over an hour and definitve worth it. After that you have time to revisit the places you went through or visit the rest of the castle. Definitely bring your camera because you",

          "On the outside, it is just \"a building\" but once you step into the walls of the same, you are taken back in time. It's not hard to imagine living here the way they did. This castle has many passageways, many open to the public, others not, and several other boarded up or simply",

          "Great piece of history, the castle was one of the most important in the region back in the day when it was all Sweden. The place itself is very impressive, the best of all is the timeline of Turku's and Finland's history, plus literally everything's also in English (and Swedish",

        "wiki": "Kultaranta (Swedish: Gullranda; lit.  '\"Golden Shore\"') is the summer residence of the president of Finland. It is in the district of Kultaranta on the island of Luonnonmaa, in Naantali. The granite manor house is surrounded by 560,000 square metres (6,027,790 sq ft) of park, belonging to the property.\nThe President of the Republic's summer residence, Kultaranta, stands in 54-hectare grounds in Naantali on the southwest coast. As well as the granite-built house, the complex includes numerous outbuildings and greenhouses, and a park.\nKultaranta's original owner was the businessman Alfred Kordelin, who had a manor house built for himself in 1914. It was designed by the architect Lars Sonck. When Kordelin died in 1917 the manor's ownership shifted to the University of Turku and, in 1922, the Finnish Parliament voted to acquire it for use as the president's summer residence.\nThe ground floor contains the reception rooms and private apartments. Upstairs are the bedrooms and guestrooms. Marble steps lead from the ground floor to the tower, from which there are views of Naantali and the inshore islands.\nThe parks around the manor, containing approximately a thousand square metres of greenhouse and a garden with 3,500 roses called Medaljonki ('medallion'), are open to the public. The scent and colour of these roses are at their peak in the middle of the summer, when the President and family and their guests come to Naantali for the holidays.  Tours in the garden are organised by the City of Naantali's tourist service.\nKultaranta's Park has been described as a \"mini-Versailles\". The parkland to the north of Kultaranta is in practically a natural state, though a few sandy pathways have been built there, and the woodland is kept in good condition.Kultaranta has about 1,000 square metres (10,764 sq ft) of greenhouses. The garden supplies the President's household with both flowers and vegetables all year round.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKultaranta [1], with pictures (in English)",

        "wiki": "Naantali (Finnish pronunciation: [\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0nt\u0251li]; Swedish: N\u00e5dendal) is a town in south-western Finland, known as one of the most important tourist centres of the country. The municipality has a population of 19,389\n(31 July 2020), and is located in the region of Southwest Finland, 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) west of Turku.\nThe town encompasses a land area of 311.50 square kilometres (120.27 sq mi). Most of this area is located on the islands, but the majority of the population lives on the mainland. Most of the islands are covered with forest and farmland, while the mainland consists chiefly of residential areas.\n\n\n== History ==\nOne of the oldest towns in Finland, Naantali was founded around the mediaeval Brigittine convent Vallis gratiae, the church of which still dominates its skyline. The charter was signed by King Christopher of Sweden, the then ruler of Finland, in 1443. The convent got trading rights and other privileges, and the town around it began to grow. It also became an important destination for pilgrimage.\nIn the 16th century, as Catholicism gave way to Protestantism as the official religion of Finland, the convent was closed, and the town plunged into a depression. This lasted until the mid-18th century, when the town got a tollgate and a customs chamber. In the two centuries of economic stagnation before that the town had become famous for its knitted stockings, a craft carried on from the times of the convent.\nThe year 1863 saw the founding of the spa at Cape Kalevanniemi, which raised the town's status as a holiday venue. In 1922, the Kultaranta estate on Luonnonmaa was made the official summer residence for the President of the Republic, after Finland had gained its independence five years earlier.\nThe municipalities of Merimasku, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4 and Velkua were consolidated with Naantali on January 1, 2009.\nThe per capita tax income of the town is the second highest of all towns in Finland, and the highest in the province of Southwest Finland.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Naantali is the fennicised version of the Swedish name of the town, N\u00e5dendal. The Swedish name was given as a direct translation from the Latin Vallis Gratiae which literally means \"The Valley of Grace\".\n\n\n== Tourism and points of interest ==\nThis interesting divide between urban and rural is perhaps one reason as to why the city has been named the most popular tourist centre in the country in numerous surveys. Another factor affecting this is the proximity of both Turku, the region's administrative centre and largest city, and of the archipelago.\nThere are some important points of interest in the city, such as the Moomin World theme park on the island of Kailo.\nNaantali Spa Hotel, the largest spa in the Nordic countries, and the Naantali\u2019s medieval convent stone church. The city's popularity as a tourist venue is highlighted by the fact that the official summer residence of the President of Finland, the Kultaranta estate, is located on Luonnonmaa.\nThe archipelago sea boat traffic is handled by S/S Ukkopekka. Old steamship cruise Naantali-Turku-Naantali.\nNaantali hosts an international music festival every June, and the traditional Sleepyhead Day carnival in July.\n\n\n== Other industries ==\nIn addition to tourism, the city's main industries are electricity production, oil refining, manufacturing, and services. The Port of Naantali is the third largest in Finland in terms of goods traffic, and the city is home to a power plant and an oil refinery owned by the government-controlled company Fortum and Neste.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2014 Sister cities ===\nNaantali is twinned with:\n\n Vadstena, Sweden\n Nordfyn, Denmark\n Svelvik, Norway\n Vesturbygg\u00f0, Iceland\n Puck, Poland\n Kirovsk, Russia\n\n\n== People ==\nKaarlo Heinonen (1878\u20131944)\nTeppo Rastio (born 1934)\nPekka Siitoin (1944\u20132003)\nKeijo Virtanen (born 1945)\nIlkka Kantola (born 1957)\nLauri Heikkil\u00e4 (born 1957)\nJukka Vilander (born 1962)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTown of Naantali \u2013 Official website\nNaantali Tourist Information Ltd\n Naantali travel guide from Wikivoyage\nNaantali Spa Hotel\nMoomin World\nVG-62",

        "wiki": "Turku ( TOOR-koo; Finnish: [\u02c8turku] (listen); Swedish: \u00c5bo [\u02c8\u01d2\u02d0b\u028a] (listen), Finland Swedish: [\u02c8o\u02d0bu] (listen); in Russian: \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443, formerly \u0410\u0431\u043e) is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Finland Proper (Varsinais-Suomi). The region was originally called Suomi (Finland), which later became the name for the whole country.\nIt is unknown when Turku gained city rights. The Pope first mentioned the town Aboa in his Bulla in 1229 and the year is now used as the foundation year of the city.\nAs the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden. After the Finnish war, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire (1809) under the direct rule of the Czar and the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812).\nIt was only after the last great fire in 1827 that most governmental institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the Academy of Turku (Turun Akatemia) founded in 1640, which then became the University of Helsinki.\nTurku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains the regional capital and an important business and cultural center and port.\nBecause of its long history, it has been the site of many important events, and has extensively influenced Finnish history. The history of the country is closely linked to Turku, the former capital.\nAlong with Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Turku was designated the European Capital of Culture for 2011. In 1996, it was declared the official Christmas City of Finland.Due to its location, Turku is a notable commercial and passenger seaport with over three million passengers traveling through the Port of Turku each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.As of 30 September 2018, the population of Turku was 191,499 making it the sixth largest city in Finland. There were 330,192 inhabitants living in the Turku sub-region, ranking it as the third largest urban area in Finland after the Greater Helsinki area and Tampere sub-region. The city is officially bilingual as 5.2 percent of its population identify Swedish as a mother-tongue.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Finnish name Turku originates from an Old East Slavic word, t\u01d4rg\u01d4, meaning \"market place\". The word turku still means \"market place\" in some Finnish dialects.\nThe Swedish name \u00c5bo may be a simple combination of \u00e5 (\"river; creek; large stream\") and bo (\"dwelling\"). There is however an old legal term called \"\u00e5bor\u00e4tt\" (meaning roughly \"right to live at\"), which gave citizens (called \"\u00e5bo\") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (\u00e5 meant at or on in old Swedish, now p\u00e5).In Finnish, the genitive of Turku is Turun, meaning \"of Turku\". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in Turun yliopisto for the University of Turku.\n\n\n== History ==\nTurku has a long history as Finland's largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by Helsinki. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland and the country's first capital. Originally, the word \"Finland\" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, \"Finland Proper\" for the region).\n\nAlthough archaeological findings in the area date back to the Stone Age and early literary sources such as Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154 mentions Turku, the town of Turku was officially founded in late 13th century. Turku Cathedral was consecrated in 1300.During the Middle Ages, Turku was the seat of the Bishop of Turku (a title later upgraded to Archbishop of Turku), covering then the eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the \u00c5bo Bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, the Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.\n\nAfter the Finnish War, which ended when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Turku became briefly the official capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in Turku were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of Turku, which destroyed a large portion of the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. Turku remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.\n\nIn 1918, a new university, the \u00c5bo Akademi \u2013 the only Swedish language university in Finland \u2013 was founded in Turku. Two years later, the Finnish language University of Turku was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.\nIn the 20th century, Turku was called \"Finland's gateway to the West\" by historians such as Jarmo Virmavirta. The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with Stockholm across the Gulf of Bothnia. In the 1960s, Turku became the first Western city to sign a twinning agreement with Leningrad in the Soviet Union, leading to greater inter-cultural exchange and providing a new meaning to the city's 'gateway' function. After the fall of Communism in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them Vladimir Putin, then Leningrad's deputy mayor.As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939\u20131945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel B\u00f6rs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Aura river in the southwestern corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of 245 square kilometres (95 sq mi) of land, spread over both banks of the river. The eastern side, where the Turku Cathedral is located, is popularly referred to as t\u00e4l pual jokke (\"this side of the river\"), while the western side is referred to as tois pual jokke (\"the other side of the river\"). The city center is located close to the river mouth, on both sides of the river, though development has recently been expanding westward.There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is Auransilta, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is Kirjastosilta ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013. The F\u00f6ri, a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, the Turku Region (LAU 1) is the third largest urban region in Finland, after Greater Helsinki and the area around Tampere. The region includes, in addition to the city itself the following municipalities: Askainen, Kaarina, Lemu, Lieto, Masku, Merimasku, Myn\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Naantali, Nousiainen, Paimio, Piikki\u00f6, Raisio, Rusko, Rym\u00e4ttyl\u00e4, Sauvo, Vahto, and Velkua.\nA more exclusive definition for the urban area is the city region of Turku with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and Turku.\n\n\n=== Administrative subdivisions ===\n\nThe city is divided into 78 districts and nine wards that do not function as local government units. There are, however, some projects that are based on the district divisions, particularly in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in certain areas. The largest populated districts are Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki. By area, however, Kakskerta and Paattinen, formed from former municipalities that were annexed to the city proper in the mid-20th century, constitute the largest districts.As many of the small neighbouring municipalities from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku bypass, that forms part of European route E18. Islands such as Ruissalo, Hirvensalo and Kakskerta, forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into upper-middle-class suburbs.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSituated by the Baltic Sea and sheltered by the islands of the Archipelago Sea, Turku has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is 5.5 \u00b0C (42 \u00b0F). Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.\nPrecipitation in Turku averages 720 mm (28.3 in) a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average 80 mm (3.1 in) of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only 32 mm (1.3 in). The average air pressure at sea level is 101.2 kilopascals (29.9 inHg), with little variance throughout the year.\nOperational since 1955, the city's weather station is located at an altitude of 47 metres (154 feet) at Turku Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the end of 2004, the Turku region (including the economic districts of Turku and \u00c5boland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people lived in the city of Turku. The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.83.1% of Turku's population speak Finnish as their native language, while 5.4% speak Swedish. The next most widely spoken languages are Russian (1.6%), Arabic (1.4%), Kurdish (1%), Albanian (0.8%), Estonian (0.8%) and Somali (0.8%). 93.3% of the population are Finnish citizens, and the most sizeable minorities are from Russia, Estonia, Iraq, Iran, Albania, Sweden, Somalia, China, and Denmark. Like all other Finnish cities, Turku does not collect information about the ethnic and religious makeup of its population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe business district in the city's economy is centred on the Port of Turku and other service-oriented industries. The city is also a renowned high tech centre \u2013 the Turku Science Park area in Kupittaa hosts over 300 companies from the fields of biotechnology and information technology, as well as several institutions of higher learning that work in closely with the business sector. This cooperative element is seen as a particularly important factor with regards to the city's expected future economic development, as outlined in the Turku Strategy that is published annually by the city council.\nAt least the following major Finnish companies have their corporate headquarters in Turku: HKScan and Hesburger. Other major companies which have operations in Turku include Bayer, Fl\u00e4kt Woods, Meyer Werft, Orion Corporation and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4.\nAs of June 2015, over 280,000 people were registered as being without employment in Finland. This put June's numbers at 10.0 percent of the population, 0.8 percentage points higher than June 2014. Men's unemployment rate was 10.5 percent and women's 9.4 percent.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nCultural venues in Turku include several theatres, cinemas, and art galleries, and a city philharmonic orchestra. The city's cultural centre organises a number of regular events, most notably the Medieval Market in July each year. Turku is also the official Christmas city of Finland, and 'Christmas Peace' in Finland is declared on every 24 December from the Brinkkala Hall balcony. The Turku music festival and the rock festival Ruisrock (held on the island of Ruissalo) are among the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. The city also hosts another rock festival, Down by the Laituri, and one of the largest electronic music festivals in Northern Europe, UMF (Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, \"New Music Festival\"), in addition to a vibrant nightlife, centred on the Market Square.\nThere are also numerous museums, such as the Turku Art Museum and the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum of Art. The \u00c5bo Akademi University maintains the Sibelius Museum, which is the only museum in Finland specialising in the field of music. Apart from these, there are also several historical museums that display the city's medieval period, such as the Turku Castle, which has been a functional historical museum since 1881, and the Aboa Vetus museum, built in the late 1990s over the 14th century archaeological site. The Luostarinm\u00e4ki handicrafts museum, converted from residential buildings that survived the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, was the first Scandinavian venue to receive the \"Golden Apple\" tourism award.\nConsidered to be the most important religious building in Finland, the Turku Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in the nation's history and has become one of the city's most recognizable symbols with the Turku Castle. The cathedral is situated in the heart of Turku next to the Old Great Square, by the Aura River. Its presence extends beyond the local precinct by having the sound of its bells chiming at noon broadcast on national radio. It is also central to Finland's annual Christmas celebrations. It is also known as resting place for many remarkable bishops and captains of war as well as one Queen of Sweden, Catherine M\u00e5nsdotter.Turku is European Capital of Culture in 2011, and the city council has approved numerous projects to boost the city's image in preparation for that status.\nThe Declaration of Christmas Peace has been a tradition in Finland from the Middle Ages every year, except in 1939 due to the Winter War. The declaration takes place on the Old Great Square of Turku, Finland's official 'Christmas City', at noon on Christmas Eve. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn Jumala ompi linnamme (Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott) and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll in Finnish and Swedish.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe city has two football teams playing at the top national level, the Veikkausliiga: FC Inter and TPS. TPS is one of the oldest football clubs in Finland. Both teams play their home matches at Veritas Stadion in the district of Kupittaa.\nHC TPS of Turku is one of the most successful teams in Finnish ice hockey history. It plays in the Finnish top league, SM-liiga. HC TPS has won the national championship 11 times, the latest being from season 2009\u20132010. Gatorade Center, formerly named HK Arena, located in the Artukainen district, is used as the venue for HC TPS games.\nThe Paavo Nurmi Marathon is an annual sporting event in Turku, named after the world-famous runner Paavo Nurmi, who was born and raised in the city.\nFinland's most successful tennis player, Jarkko Nieminen, was born and lives in the neighbouring county of Masku\nTurku Titans is a lacrosse club based in Turku with a relevantly successful history with three silver medals and one gold medal in the national lacrosse league in Finland. The Titans women's team has also had a successful history. The FIL U19 2012 World Lacrosse Championships were also held in the city.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nBeing both a regional and provincial capital, Turku is an important administrative centre, hosting the seat of the Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of Turku since 2010.\nThe city council of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 municipal election, the council seats are allocated in the following way: National Coalition Party 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from National Coalition Party.\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Turku:\n\nNational Coalition Party   23.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   19.4%\nTrue Finns   15.8%\nLeft Alliance   12.7%\nGreen League   11.4%\nSwedish People's Party   5.8%\nCentre Party   4.7%\nChristian Democrats   3.1%\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nFor a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized Tampere. The bus network is managed and supervised by the Turku City Region\u2019s Public Transport Committee (F\u00d6LI) (Finnish: Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta, Swedish: kollektivtrafikn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r \u00c5bo stadsregion), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by F\u00d6LI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the Turku Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of Turku.\nThere is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. However, there are plans for a light rail system in the Turku region in the near future. This system would more ably serve major suburbs of the city such as Varissuo and Runosm\u00e4ki, as well as the neighbouring cities.The State of Finland has announced plans to support Espoo with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.\nTurku's most significant highways for traffic are Highway 1 leading to Helsinki; Highway 10 leading to H\u00e4meenlinna; Highway 9 leading to Tampere, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kuopio and Joensuu; Highway 8 leading to Pori, Vaasa and Oulu; and the Turku Ring Road, which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.\nTurku Airport is located 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of Rusko. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including airBaltic and SAS Scandinavian, and one cargo airline.\nThere are also daily ferry services from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the \u00c5land Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see ruotsinlaiva), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a cruise across the Gulf of Bothnia.\nThe Archipelago Sea boat traffic is handled by, among others, SS Ukkopekka, an old steamship that cruises on the route Turku-Naantali-Turku.\nTurku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: Turku Central, Port of Turku, and Kupittaa.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nTurku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city \u2013 the first school in the city, the Cathedral School, was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the \"Royal Academy of Turku\" (now University of Helsinki), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the Bell-Lancaster method was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.\nTurku is home to about 35,000 higher education students. There are two universities and several \"polytechnics\" in the town.\nThe Finnish University of Turku is the second largest university in Finland (18,000 students), as measured by student enrollment, and one of the oldest as well, having been founded in 1920. \u00c5bo Akademi, founded 1918 as the second university of Finland, is Finland's only Swedish-language university. Turku School of Economics merged with The University of Turku in 2010, and \u00c5bo handelsh\u00f6gskola, its Swedish counterpart, with \u00c5bo Akademi 1980. The central hospital of Turku, Turku University Hospital, is affiliated with the University and it is used as a teaching hospital.\nTurku University of Applied Sciences is the second largest polytechnic in Finland after Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Also Novia University of Applied Sciences and Diaconia University of Applied Sciences have campuses in the town.\nTurku is one of only two cities in Finland to have an established international school (the other city being Helsinki). Turku International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of Turku and the University of Turku, Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe most widely read newspaper of Turku, and the area around it, is the daily regional morning newspaper Turun Sanomat, with a readership of over 70% of the population every day. \u00c5bo Underr\u00e4ttelser, a Swedish language newspaper published in Turku, is the oldest newspaper in Finland, having been published since 1824. The free-of-charge Turkulainen newspaper is also among the most popular newspapers, together with the local edition of Metro International and the national evening tabloid Ilta-Sanomat. There are also a number of local newspapers such as Kulmakunta (for the eastern suburbs of Turku, including Varissuo and Lauste), and Rannikkoseutu (for the area around the neighbouring cities of Raisio and Naantali).\nThe first Finnish newspaper Tidningar Utgifne Af et S\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, in Swedish, was started in Turku in 1771, as well as the first Finnish-language newspaper Suomenkieliset Tieto-Sanomat which was started in 1775.\nThe newspaper Turun Sanomat also operates a regional television station, called Turku TV. The Finnish national broadcaster Yleisradio screens local news, daily from Monday to Friday, for the Southwest Finland (including the regions of Southwest Finland and Satakunta) residents. All Finnish national TV channels are viewable and national radio channels audible in the Turku area. In addition, a number of local radio stations, e.g. Auran Aallot, Radio Sata and Radio Robin Hood are operational. Local public service radio stations are Yle Turun Radio in Finnish language (the regional version of Yle Radio Suomi) and Yle Vega \u00c5boland in Swedish language (the regional version of Yle Vega).\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nRauno Aaltonen, rally driver\nTeemu Brunila, singer, songwriter, musician and producer\nDarude, dance musician, artist of the hit song Sandstorm\nAlex Federley, political cartoonist and illustrator\nJohan Gadolin, chemist, physicist and mineralogist\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd, football goalkeeper\nKatja Kallio (born 1968), novelist, journalist, columnist and screenwriter\nMiikka Kiprusoff, former professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks during his NHL career\nMauno Koivisto, 9th President of Finland\nSaku and Mikko Koivu, ice hockey playing brothers playing respectively in Montr\u00e9al and Anaheim Ducks and Minnesota Wild as an alternate captain and captain\nChristina Krook (1742-1806), educator\nErik Johan L\u00f6fgren, portrait painter\nCarl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, military leader and statesman\nNiklas Moisander, captain of Finnish national football team\nMichael Monroe, rock musician, the vocalist of Hanoi Rocks\nPaavo Nurmi, The Flying Finn, 9 time Olympic Champion in long-distance running\nJoni Ortio, professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for HC Vityaz of the KHL\nRasmus Ristolainen, hockey player currently with the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL\nJiri \u201cLinkzr\u201d Masalin, Professional Overwatch player for the team Houston Outlaws and two time player for Finland in the Overwatch World Cup\nJoona \u201cFragi\u201d Laine, Former professional Overwatch player for the Philadelphia Fusion, and briefly for the Guangzhou Charge\nAleksi \u201cZuppeh\u201d Kunti, former professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJoonas \u201cZappis\u201d Alakurti, retired professional Overwatch player for the Florida Mayhem and team Gigantti\nJarno Saarinen, 1972 Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion\nMatti Salminen, bass singer\nHerman Sp\u00f6ring Jr., explorer and botanist\nNiilo Sev\u00e4nen, vocalist and bass guitarist of Insomnium\nKaapo Kakko, hockey player\nJoalin Loukamaa, a member of global pop group Now United\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns ===\nTurku is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Co-operation agreements ===\nTurku has co-operation agreements with the following cities:\n\nTallinn, Estonia\nTianjin, China\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPosankka\nTurku Cemetery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTurku at EuroWeather.\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnttonen, Martti (ed) (1992).

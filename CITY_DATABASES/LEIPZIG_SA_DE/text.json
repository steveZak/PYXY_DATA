          "This square is worth visiting due to whats placed around it and not for the square itself. Its a wide open space with nothing in its middle and needs a focal point. There are many walkways leading off of it housing cafes, restaurants and many shops. The best part of the square",

          "Visited the market as part of the Christmas Market within the city. I thought this location was the best for Christmas market experience. Nice view of the Old Town Hall Clock Tower and the old Stock Exchange building. If visiting the Christmas Market, make sure you stop by",

          "Xmas is approaching. Staying over Leipzig for one night and checked out the night market place. Though you tend to find similar stuffs exhibited from city to city in Germany, I did find a couple of eye-catching ones, e.g. flying lighting wheels, come buy - the bubble tea",
          "Beautiful historical square in the very center of the city, and its tourist center. Around you can find many shops and restaurants. The center sometimes hosts various entertaining activities. And even one museum: Museum of City History. In combination, this building is also a",

          "As in the title it is nice market built in european style. Some old buildings in the middle sorrounded by old blocks. Many bars and cafes make it possible to have a nice time.",
          "The old town Hall has just been restored to its former glory and the Market place has been repaved with the city\u2019s sogn laid out in pavement Stones. It is nice to sit in one of the cafes and have a drink and watch the people going by.",
          "I always thought that Leipzig is nothing special. Damn it! I was wrong! Really nice place for one day, not as big as metropolitans and not so small. Lovely streets, buildings, churches, monuments... Many restaurants, cafes, bars and lots of history. It is Bach\u2019s city:), so quite",

          "if you want to go to Leipzig and you are at odds as to where to go then the Marktplatz (market square) might be a good start. besides the Rathouse with excellent exhibitions most things are very near or right at the Marktplatz. starting with restaurants, icecream cafes pubs",
          "Leipzig is known as a trading city, so the main square of the city must be the market square. Where trade was - there public life was. It is logical that the court was made the same here. Executions also were carried out at this place also. The square is not a sample of taste",
          "The Market Square is a good place to visit to see the old buildings of Leipzig. The old Town Hall is particularly interesting and there are many other fine old buildings around three sides of the square",
          "Many visitors do not know of the museum inside the town hall. It\u2019s is roughly 6 or 8 euro to enter and is a great history museum about Leipzig and German history. Is worth the visit. In Leipzig town square there are many shops and places to eat and also nice boutiques such as",

          "We saw the Market Square during the Christmas market season so we were unable to see the beautiful buildings that surrounded the square. Definitely will go back to see the square in it's more natural state.",
          "Having visited Nurnberg, Erlangen and Hersbruck Christmas markets, I have to rate Leipzig as my favorite. The stalls were unique (there wasn't redundancy), and they weren't extremely crowded. I had a wonderful time!",
          "The Leipzig Christmas Market is set up in the Market Square. Hundreds of booths. Tens of thousands of people at night. This is everything that I heard about with German Christmas Markets. Glad we planned our trip so we could experience this. Worth traveling to Leipzig in",

          "This is one of the plainer, less interesting markt Squares we have seen! Some of the buildings overlooking the square are nice, but I wouldn't consider it a must-see while in Leipzig.",
          "Went to the market in the morning at 10.30 nothing there, went later at 15.00 hut's up and a stage nothing open though. Had something to eat at a restaurant in the square which was nice. Otherwise a waste of time.",

          "Like most squares it is surrounded by lots of restaurants and cafes with market stalls in the center of the square. Because one side of the square is being restored it detracts from the overall appeal of the place and excavation in areas makes it uncomfortable to walk. When",
          "Walking through this square was reminiscent of many European cities we have been in. The town hall looms large over this square as well but was under construction while we were there. This is an excellent meeting point or a place to start your explorations of Leipzig.",

          "Thanks to another Tripadvisor review, I realized I'd be in Leipzig on market day! This market gets full marks for being exactly what it needs to be: held in a beautiful, spacious old-town square, vendors that cover the entire range of what you'd need to buy for your week's",
          "When I think of a market, I imagine buzz and life. But this one is as good as dead. We went on Sunday and everything was shut. Again went out next evening and saw people shutting shop by 17:00. It looks deserted in no time and all you see is a few cafes and people on cycles",

          "This square is considered the heart of Leipzig, mainly because one side is dominated by the Town Hall ( Altes Rathaus), and there are many restaurants and shops on the other sides. There are farmers' markets usually on Tuesday and Thursday from 9am until 4pm, with an amazing",
          "It was my first ever visit to Germany imagine I'm 54 and its my first time. To my amazement it was to be a memorable visit and I think I found my home from home. The market transported me to my boyhood and the excitement of Christmas returned, the lights the smells and the music",
          "Plenty of market stalls with fresh produce. If using an airbnb we would have enjoyed food shopping here. As the name implies a good central location.",
          "I was suprised to see a Christmas style market in place for easter weekend, but the different smells was fab, it was very busy and unique stalls selling interesting crafts and produces",
          "It is a very nice place to spend some time if you happen to visit Leipzig. Especially during a sunny day.",
          "The array of 18th c panel portraits on the Festsaal is top notch; superb little mediaeval art room (much more intense and interesting than the bland rooms in the London Nat Gall); and three lovely Cranachs (der Junger). V interesting couple of pictures, one on canvas,",

          "Whether you\u2019re hungry, thirsty or just want to do some shopping, Markt has all of those. A huge arrange of restaurants for food and drink with indoor and outdoor seating. If shopping is more your thing, then you can enjoy the many beautiful passages which lead you to many",
          "In an old German town, there must be a square before the rathaus (city hall). Then, other important buildings, such as church, banks, restaurants, stores,\u2026etc were set up surrounding the square. In the market, there are shops and vendors selling fruits, vegetables, foods and",
          "Lot of tasty food, local food market. Negotiable prices and friendly people. Prices goes down close to and of the day.",

          "Good produce market most of year. In December it becomes the Weichnachts Markt or Christmas market. Beautiful buildings from modern to Middle Ages surround the market square. There is an S-Bahn stop at one end for underground train. Lots of historic sites and stores nearby too.",

          "The market is not that bid but the variety is mostly produce from the area. The surrounding stores located at the side buildings however are numerous and sells a variety of products from souvenirs to local books and glasswares. A nice place to shop and stroll around.",
          "So many little unique booths and different types of tasty food to try.. The atmosphere of multilingual multicultural peoples is exciting and memorable",
          "Really enjoyed Leipzig and in particular the centre market square. It has a lot of lovely building very close (e.g. St Thomas Church). It is also pedestrian only (apart from deliveries) in much of the city which makes it more pleasant to be there. Really recommend it.",
          "This is a central location within Leipzig that can help one glimpse back into what the historic past must have been like when there were no modern shops, stores or malls. There are of course the usual sellers of foods and wares but also street entertainers and great people",
          "we purchased some fruits there. Cheap and very tasty. Rhis was across from our apartment so easy to get to. 2 minute walk.",
          "We briefly visited Leipzig and headed to the square. It is a large open space with stalls selling fresh fruit and veg and flowers, it is surrounded by iconic buildings, well worth seeing.",
          "All the coffee bars and restaurant which surround the market square is a hive of activity. We wandered round the markets on a Friday morning and then sat at one of the bars just to watch the hustle and bustle",
          "Great food, fruit, vegetable, and sausage. The location is right at the middle of the city centre, just to make sure you go there at the right timing. Discount comes to the end of the closing time.",
          "Everything's no seems to be on sale here. I was looking for shoes and they had sales like 50% off and another 20% off the sale price. Got some great Bugatti shoes amongst other deals. Well worth the visit.",

          "We visited the Market Square while on a tour in Germany. We enjoyed a fairly leisurely lunch and were able to take in the beautiful sights nearby",
          "The square is an important orientation point, and a good place to watch buskers or dancers. The old Rathaus is best viewed at a distance to take it all in. You can get the S-Bahn to or from here.",
          "Walk round slowly both on the square itself and then around the outside. Beautiful buildings and the history museum in the Rathaus is worth a visit 9Closed Mondays)",

          "In general, a nice place to be in warm weather. If you're parents of teenagers, seems like it would be safe to leave them here for several hours and they'd be perfectly safe. Probably, though, they'd also ant to hang out here at night when there are clubs open. Always street",

        "wiki": "The St. Nicholas Church (German: Nikolaikirche) is one of the major churches of central Leipzig, Germany. Construction started in Romanesque style in 1165, but in the 16th century, the church was turned into a Gothic hall church. Baroque elements like the tower were added in the 18th century.\nIn the 18th century, several works by Johann Sebastian Bach, who was the music director of Nikolaikirche and of St. Thomas Church from 1723\u201350, premiered here. The Neoclassical interior dates to the late 18th century.\nThe church rose to national fame in 1989 with the Monday Demonstrations when it became the centre of peaceful revolt against communist rule. By capacity, it is one of the largest churches in Saxony.\n\n\n== History ==\nConstruction of the church began about 1165. It is named after St. Nicholas, patron of travelers and merchants. It was built originally in the Romanesque style (with twin towers) but was extended and enlarged in the early 16th century in the Gothic style. The Baroque main tower was added in 1730; the portal dates from 1759.Notable philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was baptized here as an infant on 3 July 1646.\nFrom 1784 to 1797 the interior was remodeled by German architect Johann Carl Friedrich Dauthe in the Neoclassical style. The church has been a Protestant seat since 1539 after the Protestant Reformation, but today the Catholic Church is also allowed to use it.The church saw four of the five performances (including the premiere) of the St John Passion by Johann Sebastian Bach on Good Friday in 1724, 1728, 1732, and 1749, as well as many of his cantatas and oratorios performed by the Thomanerchor.\n\n\n=== Peaceful demonstrations ===\n\nFrom 1989 to 1991, people gathered at St. Nicholas on Monday evenings, leading to spontaneous peaceful protests against the government. Cabaret artist Bernd-Lutz Lange said about the events which started in the St. Nicholas Church: \"There was no head of the revolution. The head was the Nikolaikirche and the body the centre of the city. There was only one leadership: Monday, 5 pm, St. Nicholas Church.\"\n\n\n=== Post-reunification ===\nMore recently, the church has been struggling to find the funds for interior restorations which have been ongoing since 1968.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Organ ===\nThe church organ was renovated from mechanical (tracker) action to pneumatic action in the early 20th century.\n\n\n== Today ==\nThe current pastor for the church is Bernhard Stief.\nNikolaikirche has a capacity of over 1,400 seats.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSt. Nicholas Church official website",

          "The interior of the church was very pink (not my favorite color) with a large pipe organ. The exterior was unimpressive, but next to a nice square.",
          "Interesting interior, but the exterior is quite normal, nothing special. Inside is the right atmosphere.",
          "This famous church, built in 1165, ud where Johann Sebasti\u00e1n Bach was the musical director between 1723-50. It is built in the Romanesque style but by the 18th century Baroque elements were added. This church rose to fame in 1989 with the Monday Demonstrations, a peaceful",
          "This church played a major historically role as a gathering place and the interior is simply stunning. Columns matching the one outside in the most lovely pastels. Please keep in mind that there are two major churches worth a stop in Leipzig.",
          "Visited this church on a trip to Leipzig. it was really nice to walk around inside and there is a small room close to the altar which explains the protests in the 1980s. However, these are all in German and it would be useful if this was also provided in English or with a",
          "All churches in Leipzig are nicely restored and worth a visit. In the restored church the bones of J.s.Bach are buried. Mostly outside of the church, student nowadays play his music.",
          "Like St Thomas church, many concerts of the Bach Festival were there too. So good highly recommended to visit and why not ... to pray",

          "This church was right across from our hotel in the center of Leipzig. Several times we sat outside our hotel and just watched the scene on Augustusplatz and around the church. We went inside while a service was going on so we didn\u2019t get any pictures. Overall a very lovely church",
          "Located just off the Market Square and one of two (with St Thomas' Church situated in the main part of the city. Of historical importance with a quite stunning interior.",
          "One of two major churches in the center of the old town, this is a magnificent, but to me a bit cold, structure. The soaring columns of green palm trees are echoed by an outside monument that recognizes the role that Leipzig citizens played in the \u201cpeaceful revolution \u201c prior to",
          "We visited the church today and will return later this week for a concert. It was well worth the visit.",

          "Lovely church to visit, nice place to lisen to the organ play if you want to hear of course. no lots off tourist here ( sometimes)",
          "This is the other church where J.S. Bach worked (the St John Passion was premiered here, for instance), although the interior is not as he would have known it. It's absolutely stunning - I've never seen anything like it - check out my photographs. Better still - go, and admire",
          "We called in and were wowed by the beauty of this historic building. There was a choir rehearsing for an evening concert, so we came back to hear them, too, which included some J S Bach sung in one of his churches.",
          "This unique and beautiful church is a very important place for not only the music of Bach but also for the role that it played in the late 1980's during the transition from communism. This is not to be missed!",
          "This church is the largest in Leipzig and well worth a visit for its beautiful painted ceiling over the altar, net vaulting and palm-shaped columns. The interior is a stunning white and can seat about 1,400 congregation. In the 18th century, several of Bach's works were",
          "Beautiful and unusual. Important role towards a peaceful and United Germany. Ceiling is amazing and interior calm and different.",

          "We went to a lovely concert here, despite not being able to be in Leipzig when the famous boy\u00b4s choir sings. We thoroughly enjoyed the church and concert",
          "If you happen to visit this city and you are interesting in building and architecture have a look at this church as well.",
          "I love the interior of this church. The colour is very different from the other church. They have pink and green pastel on the ceiling and pillar. Often they have a concert in there.",
          "St. Nicholas Church is an imposing temple having plenty of features to be subject to admiration. Its construction started in the middle of the 12th century in Romanesque style. In the 16th century it was enlarged in gothic style. It can be said that nowadays a mixture of",
          "Pastel ceilings and big columns. The place feel posh, not the usual dark church. It's pretty and worth a visit.",

          "This has a most unusual interior both in terms of pillar design and colours. It looks surprisingly modern and reminded me of Art Nouveau style. I thought it very beautiful.",
          "its remarkable, but there is a walk around town that marks all the places where the peaceful Revolution started; in 1982, the first Peace Prayers were held in Nicolaikirche, and this was the source of unrest.",
          "Such a significant church because of the part it played in the the downfall of Soviets in East Germany. A fantastic account of the peaceful demonstrations that were the catalyst is available in many languages in the church. An amazing example of \"people power\" not to be",
          "That is great beautiful church inside! This palms and organ of Bach are cool! Must visit if you are in Leipzig!",
          "Loved visiting this historic church ( and one of my favorite Saints). Pictures only if pay a fee. You can visit side chapels. Not all descriptions are in English.",
          "Built in 1165, this church is related to two important events in the history. The first, from 1723 and 1759, Bach was appointed as \u201cdirector musices (music director)\" of this church. Many of his works were premiered here. The second, the \u201cPrayers for Peace\u201d of this church In",
          "The church has beautiful decorations and paintings on the walls and up in the ceiling. So look up, when visting this place. Please notice, that taking pictures needs a permit, that costs a few euros. Absolutely worth a visit.",
          "Absolutely beautiful and remember to look up! You nay be fortunate to hear the organ playing when visiting",
          "A bit different with such a light painted old church. I liked it. As usual most in german that I dont speak so hard to dig deeper in the history but got some of it.",
          "Nice church to visit. Also enjoyed seeing the pillar outside the church. Don't need much time here, but worth a stop.",
          "Candles won against guns! Priest Christian Fuehrer, of this beautiful church, prompted a Monday Peace Prayer that took place every week and in one month, thousands came and confronted government guns peacefully with candles - no violence. 'Miracle of Leipzig' triggered",

          "A Lutheran church in the heart of Leipzig, the pink columns with their plaster foliage at the top draw the eyes to the plaster ornamentation on the ceiling. Light, bright and airy, the older religious art is in the chapel off the side of the main altar area. To take photographs",
          "An old quaint church..very serene and peaceful, was really good to spend some time in quiet meditation.",
          "This church was a major reason the wall fell and the cold war ended, though many people probably just wanted more freedom to travel, to live like the rest of the world. Peaceful meetings were held there and the Stasi often attended to figure out what was happening in their city,",
          "Surprised to see this church with its neo classical style and pastel colors . It is beautiful in its simplicity and clean lines and luckily still has wonderful frescos in the ceiling of the nave. Pictures are not allowed inside",
          "This church has fabulous architecture. Be sure to note the parish house across the plaza next to the church.",
          "One of two great churches in Leipzig. The top of the columns and the vaulted ceiling a really special and wonderful to look at. The organ is beautiful too. It doesn't take long to soak in the atmosphere of this fabulous church and if you're interested in church architecture this",
          "Not only is this a beautiful church to visit in the heart of old town Leipzig, it is also the birthplace of an important peace and anti-violence movement in Germany. There is a small museum that explains some of this history. One can also take the trek up to the bell tower for a",
          "If you visit Altstadt, you almost cannot miss this. A very pretty church, inside more than outside. And Bach was there, need I say more?",
          "dont judge a book gy its cover, and dont judge a church by the green palm tree pillars. reading the role this church played in the move to freedom in 89 was so moving, I was crying by the end of thd leaflet. Wondering would I have been one of the 2000, or even the 10,000",
          "Besides the beautiful interior and historical significance for the city, my main focus and inspiration was felt in knowing about the 1989 events that took place in a growing sense of desire for freedom. Through weekly prayer meetings and non-violent protest citizens moved",
          "An architecturally beautiful church. We attended a concert and an organ recital here. Whether you like churches or not this is a must.",
          "Much of the activity associated with the overthrow of the DDR system occurred in and around this church. By visiting it and the monuments outside, you feel part of recent history. There is a little gift-shop, and anyone who is part of this congregation or works for it seems",

          "All the churches I went in were so spectacular but St Nicholas and St Thomas were very close together. So it was easy to view them. Fine craftsmanship put into these structures. It's so amazing when you think of the rudimentary tools that were used in the day. I hope I didn't",
          "This church, in addition to its beauty and age, has a definite place in history. It was here in 1989 the populist movement toward freedom got its start. As the new movement got going, they met here and it grew and spread from here. Its old history includes Bach playing here",
          "A long history and delightful inside! Went to a service there - but suggest you sit where you can see what is going on - as the pillars block the view!",
          "I just walked through the church. I was impressed with the columns. There is a statue of a column outside the church, and it is dedicated to freedom. The church is where the 1989 Peoples Revolution started.",
          "The pastel greens and pinks of the decor of this old and classic church are breathtakingly beautiful in the shell of the original church that was bombed in WWII. The renovators were obviously very careful to provide a Baroque experience that would be sensitive to the",
          "St Nicholas was built in 1165 and was the first designated Protestant church in Leipzig. Bach was also music director at this church (in addition to St Thomas) in central Leipzig, which holds 2000 people. Four performances of his St John Passion were held here. It became famous",
          "This is a significant place for all sorts of reason. Martin Luther preached here numerous time, Bach played here at least monthly, and protests against the Berlin wall centered here. The church is free to enter, but they do ask a small fee for photo permission. (This didn't",
          "Like St Thomas', Nicolaikirche is revered as a work place of JS Bach. On the day of my visit, I stumbled on a lunchtime recital by a Dutch choir- which seemed to be quite informal, and free. The church is a calm and cool oasis in the busy centre of Leipzig. Highly",
          "Very impressive interior with the colors and sculptures. A photo permit is for sale. It is not such a big problem but claiming that the reason is because it is a sacred place looks hypocritic...",
          "We went to a couple of organ recitals here. Just as in Thomaskirche, they add in sermons and prayers during recitals so it is handy to have keep your printout of \"Vater unser in Himmel\" from Thomaskirche if you wish to join in! No need to book ours, it was not full.",
          "This church is definitely worth a visit. The pastel colours are so tasteful they help create a cool, peaceful feeling which I often find is missing in the more flamboyant churches. Also the best organ music. The concerts are really worth attending. All that plus the place where",
          "This is a rather simple and historical church, as the interior does not have much extravagant statues or ornaments or carvings. However, the overall decorations of the church is very elegant.",
          "This church played a role in some very significant history. Alas, the exhibits were completely written in German.",
          "Beautiful church where the reunion of Germany began. Oldest building with a great organ. If you have the chance to visit a concert give it a go. The inside is not overloaded as in other churches but very delicate due to the pillars and the pictures of local flowers and green at",
          "Church has great ambiance and well known for its excellent concerts. It shares with the Thomaskirche the association with J S Bach",
          "This is a very impressive church by any measure but once you hear its historical role it is even more worth a visit. The end of the Cold War was nudged along for quite some time with peaceful protests based from the church. It is also one of the few that give access to the alter",
          "While not on the main old town square, it is only a couple blocks away and is well worth the walk and visit to St. Nicholas Church. The church is very old but well maintained; the interior is beautiful and well worth the visit by itself. This church is the site where the",
          "This is where the Peaceful Revolution in former GDR started that ended with the fall of East Germany and the Berlin Wall.",
          "The church was not so extra-ordinary but beautiful! The surprise was the concert band practicing there and making some beautiful music. It seems that one can often find a free concert there, if you like classical music.",
          "Church bells ring every hour and if you book hotel (example Motel One Nikolaikirche) you will hear church bells ringing all the time. Had a room with view to the church and window was left open and could hear the noise day and night! not a nice experience.",
          "Before visiting this church, read some history and watch some videos about the non violent revolution that sparked here and led to the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. Unfortunately there is not much turistic information, none in English, so if you pass by the church without",
          "This remarkable church once was the centre of the quiet revolution that released the DDR frim its communist regime. But has been spoiled inside by a neoclassicist renovation. Such a shame.",
          "After having paid a visit to the Thomaskirche, I also wanted to see the Nicholaskirche. Both churches of course are must sees when you are interested in the live and work of J.S. Bach. Geen dag zonder Bach",
          "St. Nicholas Kirche is a church for music lovers. It is the final resting place of the bones of J.S. Bach. Richard Wagner was baptized in this church. Shubert and Brahms also have connections. On Saturdays the Church holds a choir service sung by a mixed boys and adult choir",
          "This large church has been at the centre of the city's history for almost 1000 years. Not only has it been a place of worship, but its role in the peaceful revolution of 1989 is reflected in an exhibition,",
          "The church was started in 1165 and in recent times played a part as the site for peaceful demonstrations against the old East German regime in 1989, commonly credited with beginning the movement that eventually led to reunification of West and East Germanies.",
          "This 11th century church played a pivitol role in the events leading up to the fall of the Berlin Wall. The church itself is beautifully maintained and an exhibition (in German) shows the role the church and the people of Leipzig playedc in the fall of communism.",
          "An impressive church that contains Bach crypt and a pipe organ that was played by him also! Good place to learn the history of Europe and from the city!",

          "Being Evangelical Lutheran this is not an ornate building like so many German churches can turn out to be. Instead the beautiful tall pale columns are topped with the most amazing long, leafy, decorations that curl into the more geometrically shaped roof, providing a wonderful",
          "If you love music you must come, sit, and listen to the organ play! It has a very beautiful sound! This is a really neat church! I just sat for 30 minutes listening to the organ and admiring the beautiful architecture inside!",
          "Not as appealing as Thomaskirche but well worth a visit. Bach worked in this church too . Perhaps more important ,prayer gatherings in 1989 became too big for the police to dare to crush and weeks later down came the Berlin Wall",
          "As a free attraction this is a splendid place to visit and so much part of the cultural life of Leipzig. The restoration of the building is to a very high standard and all of it accessible. The marble around the altar is particularly spectacular as is the height of the pulpit.",
          "If you are of certain age and could recall the days when Germany was divided into East and West Germany, 1989 was when the people of East Germany (GDR) rose up against the Commnunist regime and protests. It started here in Leipzig: every Monday evening there was a prayer",
          "The entire interior truly represents the very best of German art and craftsmanship. Indeed the pulpit, the baptismal font and the altar are truly beautiful. But the angel of peace pictured above the altar will be my favourite!",
          "On a trip through town we found ourselves at the Nicholai Church. Great interiors with a beautiful view of the past. Well worth a visit.",
          "In October 1989 this Church hosted prayers and gatherings of concerned East Germans as they hoped for reunification of East and West. Meetings grew in the weeks that followed and in Nov. 1989 the Wall Came Down. All started here. Very humbling and historical. Good luck and enjoy",
          "Exquisite interior in white green, old soft pink and gold. Capital columns with green fronds are stunning. This is where the revolution of he 1980's began so the building has great resonance.",
          "Nikolaikirche is a must during your Leipzig stay. You can reach it good by food from the central station. No entrance fee is required. There are information leaflets free of charge in several languages.",
          "A must visit if you are in Leipzig. As with most churches it has a wealth of amazing history and architecture. Sebastian Thomas Bach was the musical director of the church and several of his works were premiered here. The church was also the scene for the \"monday demonstrations'",

          "The eyes are immediately drawn to the ceiling. The light colours of the pillars and walls and the white pews are beautiful. This is much different to many other churches we have seen and a must-see in Leipzig. We were fortunate enough to hear the mighty organ. What a sound! It",
          "Are you a architecture junkie? If so St. Nicholas' church is where you need to be! It is truly an awe-inspiring site. I attended mass there, albeit only for a few minutes, but the sound resonating from this church was incredible! A must see!",

          "The people of this church prayed and started a peaceful movement that brought down the Berlin wall. In America we know about the Berlin wall but being here and seeing the place where such a big important part of history came to pass is really powerful! You can even sit in on a",
          "This church has an amazing internal design and has an amazing story - not just because of Bach, but because it supported the brave rebels against the Communist regime in 1989 and it afforded space for people who were at risk of being arrested and brutalised. This city is called",
          "We heard an organ recital at Nikolaikirche, what a wonderful experience. It is beautiful inside with a very unique decor.",
          "We attended an organ concert here during the Bach festival. A lovely and very comfortable church for any type of music event. One of the great organs and huge number of pipes. The botanical motif ceiling sets it apart from other churches.",

          "A place of Peace which has had a dramatic history with links to J S Bach and Germany's unification in 1989. Well worth a visit",
          "I have visited this church twice. Its interior, a riot of palm topped columns and colours, contrasts with the austere and cramped exterior. J.S. Bach was in charge of two churches in Leipzig, this being one of them. The other, a few minutes away, the Thomakirche. The",
          "We visited the church as part of our walking tour of Leipzig. The church is ground zero for the peaceful demonstrations against the communist government in 1989. The inside is typical Lutheran style. Our guide explained how the church became a focal point for peaceful protest",
          "Beautifully conceived with the loveliest colors I think we've ever seen in a church. More important, significant figures have history here, and it is the site of the peaceful services and gatherings which ultimately led to the elimination of the East German regime, and thus was",
          "Quiet atmosphere was good fit to Bach's work and his organ plan. I found a small book named \"Leipzig city of music\" here and the book was a great help for further J. S. Bach's place visits in the city.",
          "This church not only has its own history it is of course THE place where the quiet and peaceful revolution started in 1982 with the Monday demonstrations, leading to the 'Fall der Mauer' and opening of the East German borders in 1989. Wonderful for organ concerts or just to sit",

          "Being on a guided tour in Germany, I had no idea what to expect when walking to St. Nicholas Church. The exterior of the church wasn't impressive. The interior has been care for very well, which is impressive. But the greatest part of visiting this church is what happened in",

          "Historic church where Bach used to work and play the organ, worth while visiting, especially during organ concerts",
          "Well worth going inside Beautiful building with lots to admire Historic connection with Bach making it more enjoyable",
          "Attended a service there and was very impressed by the quality of preaching, music and the wonderful atmosphere. A must see point on any itinerary",
          "A must see whilst in Leipzig. The outside of the building is not too outstanding, but the inside is amazing.",
          "A nice church but probably most famous for the sit ins in 1989 that with other events led to the fall of the DDR regime. Bach connections too so a must visit on themed tours of Leipzig quite apart from itsbeing a historic building",
          "One of the two main churches in Leipzig where J.S.Bach played the organs. The structure is gothic but interior in classical style with pillars representing palm trees is absolutely stunning. There are concerts as they have massive organs.",
          "It was interesting to see one of the churches that J.S. Bach was director of music at. Quite inspiring if you are a music lover.",
          "If you are interested in the modern history of Germany this is a 'must visit', a very simple church with a great story.",
          "The inside decor of this church is amazing: pink and mint green columns ending in palmleaves! There is no other like this in the World! Great accustics for organ conserts, but: this is where the Peaceful Revolution started with the Monday evening candle marches with ever",
          "This church is very beautiful. They are very good about letting you know the history of the church. The Pipe Organ was restored with the help of Porsche Design and is very stunning.",
          "Being in Leipzig, visit this church. Always a lot of paople, nice to see inside as well as outside. Liocated in the city center, with a lot of restaurants, shops, etc.",
          "We spent the day in Leipzig and came across this rather plain Church from the outside, but once inside, it was just amazing. Quite different to any other Church we have seen with its colours predominantly pink, white and green. The huge pink columns with the green tops were",
          "Beautiful inside, outside not so much. Spent only a few minutes inside as we had so many others things on our list.",
          "beautiful inside and starting point of DDR peaceful revolution of 1989- must see. There are organ concerts on teh weekends and guided tours . Both is recommandable",
          "This elegant edifice of the Evangelical Lutheran persuasion makes an ideal place for relaxation and contemplation. The sanctuary is restrained baroque. Particularly striking are the support columns, which are done as stylized palm trees, with graceful Wedgwood green tops.",
          "We have been to many churches in Germany, but this one was impressive and emotional. Make sure you read the history of the church while you visit here so that you can appreciate all that it has been through.",
          "Grand and dark as churches go. Many visitors are drawn here, as the town honors Bach. A must see for this town.",
          "The outside was a bit off putting so thought this would be a disappointment but amazing ceiling. There was a guided talk but it was only in German so no use to me. Leaflet for 20c helped a bit to appreciate the place.",
          "Very unusual interior. Also a very interesting local history. We were fortunate to have a local guide who gave us a personal story of his experiences here during the cold war. Very glad we stopped in here!",
          "We happened to be visiting Leipzig during the 2015 Bach Festival, and were lucky enough to be able to purchase tickets for an organ concert in Nikolaikirche (only 11 Euro per ticket!). This is a beautiful old church, with wonderful acoustics and an amazing pipe organ. And this",
          "We have the opportunity to go to several concerts. They have a long tradition of music (among others Bach was there) and it was really nice!",
          "We travelled from Australia and went to five concerts at various venues in Leipzig during the Bach Festival (Bachfest) in June 2015. One of the venues was this church. I feel that I must tell non-Europeans about what they can expect. If you expect to see the performers, as",
          "Beauty and Light dominate the churches interior and ethos. The simple and stunning emulation of the natural world thru the palm capitals and simple pallid pillars takes ones breath away and then to hear of the pivotal political role this \"House of God\" played in peaceful",
          "I would visit this church and the square next to it. These places both hold a lot of history about the Peaceful Revolution and the end of communism/East Germany.",
          "The exterior might lead one to expect a rather dark, \"old\" and dignified interior. However, the sanctuary is bright with a surprisingly lively feeling. Wonderful columns with the most amazing capitals. We heard two performances in this space and both were inspiring.",
          "Unlike many catholic cathedrals you generally see in Europe, this Lutheran church is a little different. The architecture and paintings inside are very different than general cathedrals. Definitely worth a visit",
          "its an awesome place to visit, in the heart of East germany. Perhaps the best East German town and awesome architecture (excluding berlin). Awesome church with a very vibrant history",
          "Great medieval church in small village. Surrounded by cemetery and gardens. Self guided tour with brochure available. Takes about one hour to visit.",
          "The Nikolaikirche is a beautiful church - not so spectacular from the outside but when you enter you'll find a bright open room which in some sense doesn't seem too much like a typical church. No coloured windows with bible scenes, instead a fair use of white, pale green and",
          "Wonderful old pipe organ played by Bach. Attended a church service there. All in German, of course. I loved the fhistory associated with this church and Martin Luther.",
          "...particularly the peaceful marches that eventually led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Bach played here, Luther preached here. Don't miss it! I was here in June 2013 but I doubt it's changed much sine then. :)",
          "Beautiful church, wonderful organ, and of course historically significant for its role in the downfall of the former GDR.",
          "The interior remodeling of the church worked out in my opinion disastrously. The fantasy pink-green grass-leaves decoration of the columns were more fit for the interior of a fairy-tale palace in an attraction parc (think Disney-world) than a church. You have to see it to",
          "Beautiful plastel pink and green and Frederick Roccoco using designs from nature. A must see. No admission charge. You may hear organ being played. Back was director here and at St. Thomas church where he ran famous boys choir",
          "The roof is quite different from other churches I have seen before: It has some sort of leaves made of plaster on top of the columns, is very beautiful. And the altar has nice old paintings.",
          "The ceiling is something so unique, so beautiful. This is also the church Luther preached in. Ask for a visit to the private chapel.",
          "We did an organ concert there and it was really nice. Stayed right across the road, which was fabulous, Motel One. Great Indian restaurant down the road. (just off the road)",
          "Beside Thomaskirche, Nikolaikirche is known as a place where premiere of JS Bach's St John Passion took place (and opposite the old St Thomas School where Richard Wagner was a former pupil). Striking green colour interior and fine acoustic - would love to perform JS Bach's",
          "Luther preached here in 1539, but although the pulpit is known as the Luther pulpit it is unlikely he ever used it. The interior is really beautiful, with delicate shades of pink and green with wonderful fluted columns which have become a symbol. Bach auditioned for his position",
          "Really worth a visit the only church I have ever been in that was mostly white including the benches. It has a historical background",
          "I attended the Palm Sunday service here and it was brilliant to be worshipping in a church which had been so central to the events of 1989. Very welcoming, children involved in the service, loved the real donkey (!!) but also the fact we went out as a congregation and sang in",
          "This is where it all started, the movement that swept aside communist dictatorship and finally changed the map of Europe",
          "Not very pretty on the outside, but beautiful inside. Its recent claim to fame is that it was the location where the \"peaceful revolution\", leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, took place. A must to visit.",
          "Hard to miss and you wouldn't want to. Beautiful inside and outside, some lovely photos to be taken. Would have been nice to see it in action :)",
          "Bach himself played the organ here. It's non descript from the outside, but beautiful inside. The organ was playing the entire time we were inside. Well worth a visit, and a donation to keep it up.",
          "You can always find a concert at this church, located in the heart of Leipzig, which transports you to the time of Bach and his contemporaries..",
          "This is the place where the peaceful german reunification started and shoud be seen once you are in Leipzig!",
          "This Lutheran church is quite a contrast to the churches in England and Italy with which I am most familiar. It is painted in light pastel colours and the columns are in the style of palm trees. The ceiling is beautifully decorated too.",
          "The church itself is not so interesting, but recent history makes it a very important place. Sit down and read what happened here in the 1980s and what is still happening every week.",
          "We arrived in Leipzig in October 9 unaware that we were coming on historic day, the 25th anniversary of a critical day of protest centered around this church. Our guide explained the symbols of the protest, including the fountain overflowing (not one drop more!) and the lights",
          "Fortunate enough to walk into the Church and there was a concert playing. WOW!!! Beautiful setting, history, etc. If you visit Leipzig its a must!",
          "Wherever I am in Europe, I cant resist to peek into an old church-this one was hard to resist! The interior was quite different than others, and the exhibitions were very informative. It fits in with the beautiful city of Leipzig!",
          "Worth a visit, considering that it is also in the centre of the old city. It is a beautiful church, with exhibitions that are also worth reading.",
          "In the very center of the old city. Wagner was baptized there, and studied in the old school that stands besides. Very beautiful inside and peculiar outside.",
          "These days and weeks (October 2014), both inside the church and outside there are exhibitions commemorating the 25th anniversary of the protests in 1989 against the communist rule - that had the church as their centre. If in Leipzig, do visit the church and see the exhibitions.",
          "It is worth a visit for the historic aspect alone. I am not a big Baroque fan but I did like to overall feel of the church. They say no pictures but people had their cameras out and flashes going strong. It is no cost to enter.",
          "I loved the unusual interior of this church. It's long and famous history made it extra special. It's association with JS Bach and great music made it a must see for me.",
          "The site where the Leipzigers met which eventually led to the liberation of East Germany and its transcendence to modernity.",
          "This is the oldest church in Leipzig but the interior has been redone in neo-classical style. Bach worked here as well as in Thomaskirche but there is an extra element of history here. To the side of the choir is the meeting-room where the Monday Demonstrations were planned",
          "Outside service hours, the church is dominated by tourists taking photographs (often of each other!) with their digital cameras, but during services, you are more aware of the spirit of this ancient Christian community, their faith and their continuing relationship with God.",
          "It is most associated with the prayers for peace in 1989. It is a beautiful church with wonderful accoustics.",
          "I'm not a church lover, but this ancient church in the centre of Leipzig is light and airy inside and impressive from the outside. It's free to go in as well!",
          "Being aware of the fact that this place is one of the ignition points of the \"German Revolution\" in 1989 we visited the church this summer. If you want to understand the German history of the last 30 years one has to visit the place. Inside its funny to see the big pillars which",
          "I attended a service on Sunday and as a musician, it was great to experience the role of music within the church service.",
          "This is a very nice Church with a great history and a must see while you are in Leipzig. The church is a mixture of different periods.",
          "A wonder architecturally & historically. Johann Sebastian Bach's workplace & right opposite the Bach museum. Lovely cafes & square right next to the church.",
          "We were here as a part of the Bach Festival. It is a good venue for concerts. While sight lines for most seats are pretty good, the concert goer must prepare for the possibility that some views from seats are blocked by pillars and second row seats in the balcony cut off some",
          "If you want to learn more about nonviolent resistance and prayerful revolution, this is the place to go. Unlike many churches in Europe, this congregation is still active and has peacefully resisted and prayed through major conflicts in Germany and the world. This church is",
          "The church is beautiful in it's own right, but history of candlelight prayers that impacted overthrow of Eastern German regime is reason to visit.",
          "Lot of tourists makes it a touristic attraction, however it is really worth of visit. The church is nice, pity we couldn't hear the chorals.",
          "A great venue for the Bach festival in June 2014. Bring your camera...quite impressive. Great for choral and instrument concerts. Near the main shopping areas of the city",
          "We were there for the Bach Festival and acoustics were good. Seats were not very comfortable but standard church pews. Church is fairly spartan but attractive.",
          "The Nicolai Kirche is a welcoming, pretty church. I'm not religious, but I felt very welcomed here. It seemed like it was open to everyone by the services they had advertised. It's also a very important part of Leipzig and the former Eastern Germany's history, so you shouldn't",
          "The inside of this church is beautiful with columns that look like palm trees. Be sure to pay attention to the church organ, which is one of the largest ones I have ever seen.",
          "Learn about the history old and recent - how meetings in this beautiful church led to the silent revolution and ultimately the downfall of the Iron Curtain in the '80's. Walk inside and feel the peace and calm, but also the uplifting feeling that it gives you - this really does",
          "while I walk around the city I found this place. When I was inside I was quite amazed withe the inside decoration, specially ceiling. There was some special concert, so the organist was practicing her music. That was great opportunity as a tourist to listen to the nice classical",
          "Lovely church with opera singer. Great location , simple church enjoyed it. Lots of nice restaurants around",
          "Tastefully decorated in pastel shades; changed a lot from Bach's days. Interesting displays on 1989 events",
          "Another fairly unadorned church with magnificent ceilings. Main claim to modern fame is its involvement in the movement the led to the downfall of the former East German regime in 1989/1990.",
          "This church has important history, which can help visitors to Leipzig to know better to the city. Church is less grant as the St. Thomas Church, but it's worth spending some time there",
          "This church was around before Bach and it played a vital role in the peaceful downfall of the East German communist regime. The interior is spectacular, too.",
          "Architecture inside is an example thow a building can be art. Lovely column work and details leading to the ceiling sre worth a stop to examine. Also the alter is impressive along with the others details you will find as you stroll through the interior of the church. Well",
          "I went to hear a concert and the place is amazing, sure its one of the attractions to visit. Inside you can find some of the story around and you will be surprised to now that Bach use to play there",
          "Although the Thomaskirche receives much acclaim as the home of Bach, Nikolaikirche is just as significant. The fall of communism has roots in the marches that began at Nikolaikirche in 1989. Oh, and for the music lovers, Bach also spent quite a bit of time at Nikolaikirche, as",
          "It is a beautiful historical church, specially for Bach\u00b4s lovers! The interesting thing is the light and calm colors inside it.",
          "Excellent choral & organ music in the tradition of Johann Sebastian Bach and the tomb of the great master himself.",
          "It is what you expect in a city near to where Lutherism started. The church is magnificent in its simplicity but atmospheric. When you think of the great music played there and, in more modern times, the Monday marches starting from the church that helped to bring down the",
          "Nikolaikirche : open fo all . That's what the sign says at the entrance . People of Leipzig are very proud of their \" friendly revolution \" that happened in the months before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall . This Church is a simbol of that revolution, because it was",
          "The feeling of being at the place where the peace walks started in 1989 is shivering. What a nice venue to host such historic event, not to be lissed!",
          "This is the church where people of all Chrisitan creeds met in the lead up to the end of the Berlin wall. Folk travelled here in their droves to be able to discuss and pray for an end to the system at considerable risk to themselves with armed police standing outside. The church",
          "not every church offers service for late beginners. This one does. We made our trip from home to the Leipzig centre in time, even a free parking spot. The service offered heaps of singing combined with a talented organ player. Nice to be there",
          "The East German communists were portrayed as boorish tyrants when I was a child - clearly not as they could have easily destroyed this beautiful church (and many other buildings in the East). Incredibly ornate - again, few tourists. Recommended - but please remember it's a place",
          "We loved the interior, with its white pews and pastel paint, and the private boxes in the gallery. The organ is enormous - wish we could have heard it being played!",
          "1989 started here, so is a must for the history buff. Very ornate building inside and well worth a look around. Nice Cafe in the corner, where you are served coffee and cake, there is no menu as you are expected to make a donation to the church instead, so get your wallets out",
          "Not only the recent history of this church is remarkable - here is where the fall of the Berlin Wall started with peaecful demonstrations. The church is simpy beautiful and has a rather unusual design and colors. Definitively worth a visit!",
          "if you have a chance to assist mass service you'll never forgot it... it's amazing.. the music.. the singers... it's like an opera show.",

          "It all started in this chuch, Also this year the present of fear from the former DDR people can still be feeld. It is an amazing atmosphere, that everybody who visits Leipzig has to feel",
          "The church was originally built in 1165 and has been altered a number of times over the years and as such has an interesting variety of styles. It has been a Protestant church since the Reformation but the Catholic Church is allowed to use it also. Johann Sebastian Bach",
          "This church is important in the history of East Germany's downfall. A visit freshens the memory of that time. Plus the church interior itself is magnificent and a must see.",
          "For anyone who remembers the Berlin wall and the cold war in general, this warrants a special stop to see where the peaceful revolution started. There was a concert going on when I stopped in that was a pleasant surprise.There is also an exhibit explaining its role in history",
          "When we stepped inside we were over-whelmed by the sheer beauty of the Nikolaikirche, St. Nicholas church. Imagine an all-white interior, including the benches. Add delicate accent hues of pale green and pink, and, the most stunning element of all, palm-tree shaped pillars",
          "as with most churches in Europe this one has a beautiful interior. They have regular concerts so check the schedule in advance.",

          "The pillars inside have large palm leaves on top. There is a similar pillar just outside in teh square representing the place where thousands, 70,000 people in fact walked in silent protest during the Cold War. It was very cathartic, to know that so many people helped to bring",
          "Very central location downtown. The green ceiling was done to give the impression of \"garden of eden\". I like the ceiling a lot.",

          "The church is a beautiful building to admire both inside and out. But it is also the center of central Leipzig and the growth of the peaceful demonstrations that ultimately toppled the GDR.",
          "I have never seen a church with a ceiling like this. Think about the wedgwood colours and texture crossed with the fan vaulting from Henry VIIs chapel in Westminster Abbey. Its pure french rococo embellishing a late medieval church",
          "I have seen many churches over my years, but this one is truly beautiful. Not as \"historic\" perhaps as St. Thomas, but much prettier.",
          "A place to check if you're interested in the history of Germany and especially the period when the country was divided in two.",
          "All churchs i have seen in Germany are worthwhile, but the St. Nicholas in Leipzig is different. The inside white colour, is lightening the church and made it less depressed. I like it and i suggest you to take about half -hour of you time, to visit it.",
          "This church is the oldest in Leipzig. From the oitside it is massive and heavy while inside painted white columns with green plant-like tops give it an inexpectedly light and airy feeling. Not a gaudy or ornate church but pleasant and definitely deserves a visit.",
          "The tour guide was witty, informative and religious regardless of your religion. It was conducted in German though.",
          "The column in the square outside is a replica of the beautiful columns inside. A reaslly lovely church with an interesting history - including more recently being the centre and symbol for the resistance against the communist dictatorship.",
          "Fabulously historic building where Bach was Cantor and then Musical Director/ Composer for the last 27 years of his life. Hilarious to read the innocent and uninformed comments from our US friends :)",
          "Our group of American choristers came here to join with the International Bach Choir for their presentation of the Mozart Requiem and Bach \"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\". Magnificent experience.",

          "Very pretty located across from Motel One. beautiful chimes very interesting history involving events preceding the fall of the Berlin Wall",
          "An intimidating edifice by all standard. Building can be seen around 500meters radius. The artworks inside the church are very beautiful. I sat inside the church to behold the beauty and felt very spiritual. It was a worthwhile experience for me",
          "Make sure you drop in to see the Nicholaikirche when you are in Leipzig. It is a very large impressive building with an ornate altar area. Look out for the signs off the north transept to the caf\u00e9 where refreshments are served. A team of ladies will bring you teas, coffees and",

          "Well worth the visit. We only spent about 10 minutes in the church as they were closing early, but I would have liked to spend more time.",
          "This was an absolute must to visit in view of the historical importance for the fall of the wall between east and west germany about 20 years ago. The church has since then been restaurated and nowadays it is really wort a visit. I can warmly recommend this for our hectic all",
          "The church looks at best elegant from outside, but only when you go inside it, you may truly embark on a charming audio-visual journey. Think of it as an extremely samplified version if sagrada familia in Barcelona (in a sense), because the capitals of the columns look like",

        "wiki": "Leipzig University (German: Universit\u00e4t Leipzig), in Leipzig in the Free State of Saxony, Germany, is one of the world's oldest universities and the second-oldest university (by consecutive years of existence) in Germany. The university was founded on December 2, 1409 by Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and his brother William II, Margrave of Meissen, and originally comprised the four scholastic faculties. Since its inception, the university has engaged in teaching and research for over 600 years without interruption.\nFamous alumni include Leibniz, Goethe, Leopold von Ranke, Friedrich Nietzsche, Robert Schumann, Richard Wagner, Tycho Brahe, Georgius Agricola, Angela Merkel and the nine Nobel laureates associated with the university.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding and development until 1900 ===\n\nThe university was modelled on the University of Prague, from which the German-speaking faculty members withdrew to Leipzig after the Jan Hus crisis and the Decree of Kutn\u00e1 Hora. The Alma mater Lipsiensis opened in 1409, after it had been officially endorsed by Pope Alexander V in his Bull of Acknowledgment on (September 9 of that year). Its first rector was Johann von M\u00fcnsterberg. From its foundation, the Paulinerkirche served as the university church. After the Reformation, the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544. In order to secure independent and sustainable funding, the university was endowed with the lordship over nine villages east of Leipzig (university villages). It kept this status for nearly 400 years until land reforms were carried out in the 19th century. During the decline and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th and first decade of 20th century together with some other German universities Leipzig University turned into one of the centers of higher education for state administrations and elites of newly independent Balkan states (Romania, Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia) educating over 5,500 students from the region in 1859-1909 period.As many European universities, the University of Leipzig was structured into colleges (collegia) responsible for organising accommodation and collegiate lecturing. Among the colleges of Leipzig were the Small College, the Large College, the Red College (also known as the New College), the College of our Lady and the Pauliner-College. There were also private residential halls (bursen, see English 'bursaries'). The colleges had jurisdiction over their members. The college structure was abandoned later and today only the names survive.\nDuring the first centuries, the university grew slowly and was a rather regional institution. This changed, however, during the 19th century when the university became a world-class institution of higher education and research. At the end of the 19th century, important scholars such as Bernhard Windscheid (one of the fathers of the German Civil Code) and Wilhelm Ostwald (viewed as a founder of modern physical chemistry) taught at Leipzig.\n\nLeipzig University was one of the first German universities to allow women to register as \"guest students\". At its general assembly in 1873, the Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein thanked the University of Leipzig and Prague for allowing women to attend as guest students. This was the year that the first woman in Germany obtained her JD, Johanna von Evreinov.\nUntil the beginning of the Second World War, Leipzig University attracted a number of renowned scholars and later Nobel Prize laureates, including Paul Ehrlich, Felix Bloch, Werner Heisenberg and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. Many of the university's alumni became important scientists.\n\n\n=== Nazi period ===\nUnder Nazi rule many Jews' degrees were cancelled; some were later reinstated as Karl-Marx University degrees by the GDR. Noteworthy Nazis, such as Max Clara (chair of anatomy) taught at the university and were appointed to positions with great authority.\nThe university was kept open throughout World War II, even after the destruction of its buildings. During the war the acting rector, Erich Maschke, described the continuation of the university in a memo on May 11, 1945, announcing the vote for a new rector:\n\nSince 4 December 1943 a fixed determination not to abandon the Leipzig University in the most difficult hour of its more than five-hundred-year history has bonded the professors with each other and with the students. The special task of repairing the damage caused by air attacks has now broadened out to the more general duty to save the continuity of our university and preserve its substance, at the very least its indestructible kernel, through the crisis that has now reached its fullest stage. After the destruction of most of the buildings and the majority of its libraries, this kernel is represented by the professoriate alone. This is what must be preserved as the great repository of value in the university.\nBy the end of the war 60 per cent of the university's buildings and 70 per cent of its books had been destroyed.\n\n\n=== The university under the German Democratic Republic ===\nThe university reopened after the war on February 5, 1946, but it was affected by the uniformity imposed on social institutions in the Soviet occupation zone. In 1948 the freely elected student council was disbanded and replaced by Free German Youth members. The chairman of the Student Council, Wolfgang Natonek, and other members were arrested and imprisoned, but the university was also a nucleus of resistance. Thus began the Belter group, with flyers for free elections. The head of the group, Herbert Belter, was executed in 1951 in Moscow. The German Democratic Republic was created in 1949, and in 1953 for Karl Marx Year the university was renamed by its government the Karl Marx University, Leipzig after Karl Marx. In 1968, the partly damaged Augusteum, including Johanneum and Albertinum and the intact Paulinerkirche, were demolished to make way for a redevelopment of the university, carried out between 1973 and 1978. The dominant building of the university was the University Tower (now City-Hochhaus Leipzig), built between 1968 and 1972 in the form of an open book.\n\n\n=== After the reunification of Germany ===\n\nIn 1991, following the reunification of Germany, the university's name was restored to the original Leipzig University (Alma mater lipsiensis). The reconstruction of the University Library, which was heavily damaged during the war and in the GDR barely secured, was completed in 2002.\nWith the delivery of the University Tower to a private user, the university was forced to spread some faculties over several locations in the city. It controversially redesigned its historical centre at the Augustusplatz. In 2002, Behet Bonzio received the second prize in the architectural competition; a first prize was not awarded by the jury. A lobby with partial support of the provincial government called for the rebuilding of St. Paul's Church and Augusteum. This caused the resistance of the university leadership, the majority of the students and population of Leipzig. On March 24, 2004 a jury chose a design by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat, which was well received by almost all parties. He recalls the outer form of the St. Paul's Church (today called Paulinum) and Augusteum, and abstracted the original building complex. Renovations began in the summer of 2005.\nIn 2008 the university was able to prevail in the nationwide \"Initiative of Excellence\" of Germany and it was granted the graduate school \"BuildMoNa: Leipzig School of Natural Sciences \u2013 Building with Molecules and Nano-objects\". In addition, the university was able to receive grants from the Saxon excellence initiative for the \"Life\" project \u2013 a project that tries to explore common diseases more effectively. Also in 2008 the \"Bach Archive\" was associated with the university. In 2009, the Leipzig University celebrated its 600th anniversary with over 300 scientific and cultural lectures and exhibitions, reflecting the role of the university's research and teaching from its beginning.\n\n\n== Campus ==\nThe university's urban campus comprises several locations. All in all, the university is spread across 38 locations in Leipzig. The main buildings in the city center are still located on the same land plots as the earliest university buildings in 1409. The university's buildings in the center of Leipzig underwent substantial reconstruction from 2005, the new university's main building being drafted by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat. The estimated total cost for the renovation project is 140 million euros. The new buildings were scheduled to be completed in 2009/2010, in time for the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.\nBesides the faculties and other teaching institutions, several other bodies serve the university: the University Library, a university archive and administration, numerous museums (e.g. the Museum for Music Instruments and the Museum of Ancient Egypt) and the university hospital. The university's Leipzig Botanical Garden, the second-oldest botanical garden in Europe. was established in 1542.\nThe University's Musical Instrument Museum includes one of the world's three surviving pianos built by Bartolomeo Cristofori, the piano's inventor. Five other Cristofori instruments are included in the Museum's collections.Key Central institutions of the university are\n\n\n== Library ==\nThe University Library of Leipzig was established in 1543. It is one of the oldest German university libraries and it serves as a source of literature and information for the Leipzig University as well as the general public in the region. Its extensive historical and special collections are nationally and internationally recognized. The library consists of the main building \"Bibliotheca Albertina\" and forty branches situated near their respective academic institutions. The current stock comprises 5 million volumes and about 7,700 periodicals. Collections range from important medieval and modern manuscripts to incunabula, papyri, autographs, ostraka and coins. The Apel Codex, a manuscript of 16th century music, is housed in the Leipzig University library, as well as the Papyrus Ebers.\nThe Leipzig University Library also owns parts of the Codex Sinaiticus, a Bible manuscript from the 4th century, brought from Sinai in 1843 by Constantin von Tischendorf. Papyrus Ebers is the longest and oldest surviving medical manuscript from ancient Egypt, dated to around 1600 BC. The Codex contains large parts of the Old Testament and a complete New Testament in ancient Greek, and is one of the most important known manuscripts of the Greek Old Testament and the New Testament. It is the oldest fully preserved copy of the New Testament.\nSome of the University Library locations  in Leipzig are:\n\nBibliotheca Albertina at Beethovenstra\u00dfe 6\nCampus Library at Universit\u00e4tsstr. 3\nLibrary of Deutsches Literaturinstitut at W\u00e4chterstr. 34\nLibrary of Arts at Dittrichring 18\u201320\nLibrary of Musicology at Neumarkt 9\u201319\nLibrary of Law at Burgstr. 27\nLibrary of Medicine at Johannisallee 34\nLibrary of Medicine at K\u00e4the-Kollwitz-Str. 82\nLibrary of Veterinary Medicine at the Tierkliniken 5\nLibrary of Biosciences at Talstr. 35\nLibrary of Chemistry and Physics at Johannisallee 29\nLibrary of Earth Sciences at Talstr. 35\nLibrary of Geography at Johannisallee 19\nLibrary of Archaeology, Prehistory and Ancient History at Ritterstr. 14\nLibrary of Oriental Studies at Schillerstr. 6\nLibrary of Sports Science at Jahnallee 59In addition to the university library, one of the two centers of the German National Library is based at Leipzig, the collections of which are open to use for academic research.\n\n\n== Faculties ==\nThe original four facilities were the Faculty of Arts, Theology, Medicine, and Law.

It is also the home of Aspeers - Emerging voices in American Studies, a graduate-level peer-reviewed scholarly journal for American studies. Erasmus Mundus Global Studies is an interdisciplinary, research-based Master offered by a consortium of five European universities: Leipzig University, the London School of Economics, University of Vienna, University of Wroclaw and Roskilde University. In the field of anthropology, the university is cooperating with the Leipzig Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. In 1995, the Leibniz-Institute for Jewish History and Culture named after Simon Dubnow was formed as a research institution related to the university. Since 2008 the university is also home to one of Germany's few Confucius Institutes. The Institute is based on an agreement of June 2006 between the university administration and representatives of the Chinese Embassy to establish a Confucius Institute in cooperation with the Renmin University and the \"National Office for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language\". Leipzig University has been the home of the first German chair for Chinese and East Asian Languages in the 19th century, which later became the Institute of East Asian Studies, which still exists today (see Georg von der Gabelentz).\n\n\n=== Rankings ===\nThe university is ranked 18th in Germany, 98th in Europe, and 264th in the world by the web-based Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, a ranking evaluating universities' scientific online publications.

          "Although I don't regret that our family visited the Bach Museum, Leipzig, I have to say I expected more. After having taken in all it had to offer, our joint thought was, \"That's it?\" J. S. Bach was in Leipzig serving at the adjacent Thomas Church for the last 27 years of his",
          "Right next to St Thomas's Church sits the unobtrusive but remarkable Bach Museum and Archives. It has an excellent display and perfect audio guide for international languages.",

          "Lovely museum just the right size for 1 to 1.5 hours. A must for Bach fans and music fans. Lovely manuscripts to look at, and instruments, etc. with lots of information in English and German on Bach's music and life and the background in which he worked. Not as shiny as the",

          "The lady at the ticket office didn't speak a single word of English - literally. She was also quite abrupt and unfriendly. Quite honestly I expected better from one of the main tourist attractions in town, that can be expected to cater to foreign visitors as well as locals. I",
          "I was visiting Berlin and realized that Leipzig - the City of Music could be reached by fast train in just under 1.5 hours. My destination was the Bach Museum and it was the highlight of my trip ! I have played Bach's music on the piano for decades, and he is my favorite",
          "Interesting information and original scores by the \"father\" of classical music. I thought the organ pipes that had braille on them and played wonderful tones was great. Even more fascinating was the instrument room where one could press a button to see how the instruments",
          "In the museum, a short concert was offered. The music pieces were played with different musical instruments from the period with an explanation. Very unique experience that I have never had visiting other musicians' homes. Please do not miss the concert.",

          "Used English audio guide. We spent 2 hours and didn't listen to every entry or try many of the exhibits. Enthralling! Really enjoyed the narration which was very understandable and informative on many different topics. Considerable effort has been made to get the visitor",

          "Anyone who likes the music of J.S. Bach and his family would find this museum interesting. Information about his career and gives an insight into what was like to be a composer in the 18th century, how they earned their living etc. You can see original Bach manuscripts and learn",
          "It was pure luck that I arrived in Leipzig during Bach's 333 birthday celebration. There were endless activities and I managed to catch some of them. And I happened to also arrive on the day when there was no entrance fee. What a treat. Being a music geek, this was one of",
          "This museum, opposite St Thomas' church, is beautifully laid out in 8 rooms, covering the life and times of JSBach as well as musical instruments from the period and original manuscripts. To see the original manuscript of 'Sleepers Wake', to admire the only portrait of JSB made",

          "The Bach Museum is the baroque Bose House which used to be the home of the merchant family Bose who were close friends of Johann Sebastian Bach and his family. That House is one of the oldest buildings in St. Thomas Square. Some features dating back from the sixteenth century",
          "Visitors to this museum are given such a wide variety of ways to understand J S Bach's life, his family, the music and musicians of the time. We thorougly enjoyed this, and one can spend endless time listening to works,if you want.",
          "\u00cd have to confess that we were exhausted from walking, so we only had some fabulous coffee and cake at the superb cafe\u00b4with the museum. Have to go back to enjoy the museum as well. Only got to see his tombstone at the Nikolaikirche.",
          "The museum has a ton of information you could spend a few hours inside. There are interesting exhibits and cool little facts to learn about Bach's childhood.",
          "This was much more interesting and enjoyable than I expected. Lots of interesting information and huge collection of music to listen to.",
          "This is a very interesting museum with many original artefacts. Several sets of headphones so you can listen to examples of his music in high quality sound. You could easily spend a couple of hours here.",
          "If you visit Leipzig the reason is probably music. And this is the center of everything. Bach and his music has shaped the city's cultural evolution substantially. No other artist have build such an integration with a city ever. This city is actually neither the birth place nor",
          "There's a lot to see here and even more to listen to. We \"rushed\" through in about an hour and a half; we could have easily spent another hour. Lots of opportunities to listen to music. Really well done, highly recommend.",
          "It was our first visit to Leipzig. It was a good learning experience visually seeing the time he spent here and we were happy to absorb the treasures on dispay",
          "We loved the museum! Very complete exhibition also available audio guide in many languages! They have a unique audio library to hear Bach's and family's masterpieces.",
          "It's a very nice and modern museum with a lot of information. It's not as suitable for children as described",
          "Besides of the usual amount of reading on the walls of museums, this one also gives you the opportunity to have a break on the couch, pick some of the Bach's composition from an interactive list and listen to it.",
          "We are great Bach fans, so very much enjoyed seeing this small but charming museum of his life and work. We had a private guide, who took us a part of a walking tour, and that allowed us to get much more out of the visit. We particularly enjoyed getting to see his original",
          "While attending a conference in Leipzig we learned that Johannes Sebastian Bach lived and worked here and that there is a dedicated museum to him and his musical genius. We learned a great deal, heard a lot of his amazing music and saw multiple artifacts related to his life and",
          "There are some manuscripts and some instruments, well a a lot of them, but the main thing here is listening. You could spend an hour looking but 100 listening. My wife got sucked in. Wait, I think I see her now?",
          "This museum has a very extensive archive of bachs work and for that reason alone is a must visit for bach enthusiasts. I preferred the museum in eisenbach as general museum about bach.",
          "The Museum is middle in the centre of Leipzig, so if you visit the Bach Memorial or the famous Thomas-Church it is next by. Inside you come in touch with original instruments which Bach played, many old letters and original and rare music sheets and so one. You learn about his",
          "Very bright and airy and well laid out museum taking you through Bach's life. Good audio guides allowing you to take as much time as you like wandering around the exhibits.",
          "Enjoyed museum & loved the hands on interactive activities offered. Good information about bachs life & his \ud83c\udfb6!",
          "Well laid out museum with good historical facts. Take an audio guide (free), it is very informative.",
          "This museum is very well assembled with informative displays and an audio-guide. The problem is with unprofessional, under-educated and rude staff who are not capable of conversing with foreigners. The museum opened 3 minutes after its scheduled time, because a group of staff",
          "We went here after visiting the St. Thomas church next door. A great museum with a great collection of items including an original organ console. Well laid out and easy to navigate with the complimentary audio ipod. Even our older teens enjoyed it.",
          "The Bach Museum was an interesting place to visit it is a mixture of old and new. The old part includes instruments and artifacts from his life and his era. The new part includes a lot of digital recordings of his music and the music inspired by his work. It was a very hot day",
          "This is an incredible place to see. The history is wonderful. The family history, the music of the man in the listening areas and the instrument displays are all so compelling. We used the audio guides and went through at our pace. We were there on a very empty day and we",
          "...and this place really does take you back! This was one of the actual buildings frequented by Bach and the family who owned it \"bach\" in the day... Really well done and the English Tour was well worth the time and money. Very modern and tastefully exhibited artifacts and",
          "This is not a large museum, but it covers everything you might ever want to know about Bach. They do focus a little more on his time in Leipzig, but they start with his family tree and include all the highlights in between. A number of interesting displays and artifacts are",
          "My father and I LOVED the Bach Museum. We got there early, around 11am and stayed until 3pm. There is so much information, not just about Bach, but about the period, classical music, instruments, tools and techniques. We are classical music fans and I was surprised at how much",
          "This museum offered a look at Bach's time and provided a real feel as to what his daily life was like and how much work he produced. A few highlights are a room where you can see what buildings in town looked like then and now and a music room where you hear his music and can",
          "You can get an audio guide but you need to leave your passport as hostage. This is common practice we found. Highlights are the portraits of Bach and a section on forgery. You can download the audio guide from the Web onto your mobile device to get a good idea of what is on",
          "Learnt a lot about Bach from the museum plus had the chance to listen to lots of lovely Back music. There were child friendly things to do as well.",
          "Well appointed museum but staff seem to have the attitude found formerly in the Communist East German State.",
          "A trip through the museum is an excellent complement to visiting Thomaskirche across the street. It gives a very good overview of religious communities in Leipzig that may have influenced Bach, in particular, the tensions and open conflict between Catholics and Protestants. The",
          "This is a wonderful museum to see for all Bach and music lovers. With interactive parts to the exhibition and wonderful amounts of information, there was plenty to do here!",
          "The Bach museum is one of the most intimate, comprehensive museums to an individual that I have visited. Located in an elegant building opposite the choir school of the St. Thomas church, the museum seems to have everything about the great composer: his family genealogy,",
          "We were amazed at how 'new' this museum was and all the interactive elements of this museum. It was just outstanding and we really learned a lot about Bach and his music. Would really recomment this location if you like classical music.",
          "This is a wonderful museum displaying documents, instruments and other items from Bach's time. It's very close to the Thomaskirche, which you should visit as well. The museum is well worth spending 2 hours of your time.",
          "Beautiful museum of Bach and his musical family. Also contains a variety of audio clips and a number of clips taken from films about Bach. Excellent audio guide in a number of languages.",
          "The museum is by the St. Thomas Churh and is very neat. Has a good collection of Bach's story and is quite interactive. Worth it going especially if you are a lover of the classics!",
          "Big posters of Bach festival everywhere at the train station, I immediately feel the vibe in the air. St Thomaskirche and Bach museum is no doubt the highlight of our visit of Leipzig. Standing just meters from the bronze plate in front of the altar where the giant\u2019s remain",
          "A wonderful example of entertaining educational museums. We got lost following the TA map on my iPhone, but the museum is ten meters opposite the Thomas church which you can't miss! 8 euro entrance, but a free loan of the audio guide. Plan to spend an hour or two depending how",
          "A well laid out and explained museum, featuring an organ console used by J S Bach and a selection of original manuscripts.",
          "Anyone who had a modicum of knowledge about Bach would not learn much from the tour. It lacked music above all - there was nothing playing to stir the soul. There plenty of copies of things to see but, like the building in which things are housed, it is all a reconstruction.",
          "This was an wonderful and comprehensive tribute to Bach, his lufe and work. The signs were easy to read, in German and English as well as Braille. The pipes to touch & hear music were great; the instrument room where you can press a button & hear each instrument's part in a",
          "A must see in Leipzig - surprisingly the guide tried to pursuade us not to use the free head sets which are really worth getting. Students will need their uni card.",
          "Certainly, Bach lovers will appreciate this museum. Very sophisticated interactive displays; and all of them actually work! For anyone who is interested in music at all, this highly educational museum is certainly worth the time.",
          "A fascinating museum - reasonably interactive with \"sound showers\" and programmes on headphones that allowed you to listen to virtually any Bach piece you wished. Very interesting about Bach's family - they were a whole clan of musicians - and on his working life.",
          "The museum has an easy to follow layout. The audio guides are very good and easy to use (iPod). The museum is very informative with innovative ways of portraying information! This is a not to be missed attraction!",
          "Quiet museum. Helpful staff. Informative and brought history on Bach to life. Excellent. iPod tours really useful.",
          "We visited this gem of a museum today and learned a lot about Bach and his time in Leipzig. The museum was well appointed and maintained and in a lovely setting opposite the St Thomas Church where Bach worked. The exhibitions are easily accessible and most captions are",
          "Fabulous, how not. Bach is the beginning and the end of music, as Reger says. All composers know that. And those of us who can listen and absorb, regardless of background, just have to submerge ourselves into the music. It is paradise!",
          "Part of the Bachfest 2016 was a guided tour in the Bach Museum, next to the Thomas church were Bach worked and lived, all sacred ground so to speak. The Thomas school and Bach\u2019s own house don\u2019t exist anymore, but the Bose house where the museum is located nowadays, is the next",
          "This was without question the best music museum we visited in Leipzig...very interactive, very informative. Good audio guide in several languages. Lots of fun things to do, including \"remixing\" famous Bach pieces by touching plexiglass images of different players in the",
          "There is an organ console that Bach had played, many good exhibits, insluding listening staions. Well worth a visit, also there is a good gift shop and cafe.",
          "OK I hated the hour \"tour\"in English. I am one who does not like to stand in a single room for 20 minutes with 40 others when the room is tiny and windowless. There was a lot of Bach and music memorabilia and old instruments, original scores and lots of info. The building is a",
          "We have visited the museum twice now and loved it both times. It is not very big, but there are lots of different interesting items there to look at, as well as some original scores of Bach'd handwriting.",
          "This museum has a lot of detail about the Bach family and also has an interesting exhibition of old musical instruments. The audio presentation is very helpful and easy to navigate with good pictures of each topic and the facility to chose the program that you are currently",
          "Nice museum on the life of JS Bach. Not a large museum, but plenty to read in both German and English. You can also get an audio device and have the opportunity to check out his music. Interesting family tree with many organists and composers in the line. Easy to get to",
          "Having visited the Thomas Kirche, the next stop was obviously the museum opposite. It was a light and airy museum with staff on hand to guide you and answer questions. (They don't take you round). We declined the audio visual as we didn't have much time. Downstairs there were",
          "This is a very well done museum , with a variety of display types. It is set up so that it is interesting for both novice and highly knowledgeable visitors. There is a lift, interactive displays, ample opportunities for listening, well located bathrooms --in short, everything",
          "The museum gives a fine overview of Johann Sebastian Bach, his life, his works and his family in addition to describe family and political life in Leipzig and Saxony during his time there.",
          "High quality museum that is an absolute must for anyone who has ever performed Bach's works. Only 8 euros per adult, including a free, comprehensive audioguide on an iPod touch with headphones. Free lockers. Completely accessible for disabled including the hearing and vision",
          "I was disappointed of finding very few original items on display, even the walls have been covered with a flat white finish... It was nice imagining how Bach just was living in front of St. Thomas",
          "one for the music and art lovers. located near the market square it is easily accessible and definitely one of the main attractions in leipzig. Bach is really important for the city and the museum is a dedication to him.",
          "Very impressed with this museum. We did not have enough time to see and read all that was on display. I hope to revisit this museum.",
          "If you are a music lover, like me, you should definitely go to Bach museum. The museum has several different sections and one part has a theme that changes seasonally. When I went, there was exhibition about female music contributors during his time and that was interesting as",
          "This place has everything Bach. It gives a feel for what his life was like and the times he lived in. Not being a Bach fan, I found this interesting. I liked the room with the instruments. It does not take long to go through and takes just the right amount of time.",
          "Small place, a few interesting tid-bits, but it was kind of boring... There was one very fun room with instruments, in which you can see the old instruments, as well as hear them play parts of Bach's pieces (recordings). If you already know about Bach's life and works, there is",
          "We are not classical music scholars, but thought dropping into Leipzig on our way from Munich to Berlin would be a good break and this museum seemed to fit the bill for a relatively short stop over. The museum was very good at bringing music alive with interesting interactive",
          "Is a 'must' for classical lovers to spend hours of visit there! 8 euro for entrance was quite pricy, but as a classical music teacher, what I saw and learned was not the value can count!",
          "Very small place. Just a few music instruments, and his handwriting of compositions. Some old&historic pictures at the wall.",
          "The museum contained: Bach's organ, many baroque instruments, and the full works of Bach to search through. The information was well done, not too long, not too short, and I loved it along with my family.",
          "Modern, imaginatively designed museum right opposite where Bach lived and worked with interactive features. Good historical details of his positions, responsibilities, family and achievements, plus valuable manuscripts. You can listen to every work he wrote if you have time!",
          "This Museum, opposite the Thomas Kirche, is devoted to the life and work of Johann Sebastian Bach, who was Kantor or Music Director here from 1733 until his death in 1750. This is a brilliant museum, full of ingenious electronic devices which enable Museum visitors to access",
          "Since there isn't much left of JS Bacj other than his scores and music it's a very modern walkthrough his lifetime, family and the times of his activity.",
          "Fantastic museum using modern technology well to explain and present information to an international audience. The shop is excellent if you have music-lovers in your family. The information throughout is well presented and translated, and the audio tour is ace. Definitely worth",
          "You can do an easy double here. There is the Thomaskirche opposite with all the Bach associations and his grave. Then the museum, an interesting insight into Bach's life in Leipzig with much information, models and original documents.",
          "The house in which this museum is located was pleasant but the overall visit was underwhelming. There wasnt any introduction to Bach - we went straight into the family tree which seemed a very odd idea.",
          "Not too many artefacts but his life and music is exposed well enough. Modern displays, a good tale of life, times and history. His grave is in the church on the opposite of the museum.",
          "Small museum but very interactive and great audiotape explanations. It's also great that you can visit the church where Bach spent over 20 years as music director and composed cantatas for almost every weekend!",
          "Bach's museum is situated in the centre on Leipzig near the St. Thomas Church (where bach was an organist and many other things). The entrance fee is 8\u20ac for adults and 6\u20ac for students. Kids under 16 years old get in for free I think. The museum is really interesting and has many",
          "A thoughtfully constructed museum, detailing Bach's life and work in Leipzig as well as the cultural and historical influences on his work. Located directly opposite Thomaskirche, it contains numerous artefacts, manuscripts and pictures to bring Bach's personality, family and",
          "The museum shows some original manuscript, it is fascinating to see the very clean handwriting of the genius. It is not a house Bach ever lived in, but it shows the life of the great artist.",
          "Recognizing that Leipzig is as mad as a flock of rock groupies for its native son, Johann Sebastian Bach, we gave the Bach Museum a try next. Inside an old townhouse, next door to the long-since-demolished house where the composer and his family lived, this compact museum has a",
          "I agree with another reviewer. This place lacks the wow factor. My husband and I felt that this museum was overrated. Bach never lived in this house. Some of his music is shown and one can listen to his music on a loop with head phones, but there is not much substance here",
          "My 15 year old son proclaimed this museum to be \"the best museum in Germany\"! It is extremely well organized, audio guided, move at your own pace. There are separate rooms that are equipped with touchscreen devices that allow you to hear nearly any piece of music composed by any",
          "Somewhat sterile depending on the historical significance of Bach. Well described pictures and statues, but lacking a wow factor. My daughter had been there the year prior and wanted me to see it, so we traveled the thousands of miles to enjoy it together and I was",
          "This was well laid out with excellent free ( but take your passport as deposit) audio guide. Learnt a lot and enjoyed the music to listen to as well.",
          "Bach Museum is excellent, particularly for anyone interested in him and his music. Plan for one to two hours for a thorough visit. Cost is 8 Euros but includes a portable guide in a choice of languages with considerable music in addition to vocal explanation of the exhibits.",
          "No trip to Leipzig would be complete without a pilgrimage to this shrine, music lover or not. Were my joints younger I could have stayed indefinitely.",
          "If you are into classical music and are in Leipzig this is a must. It had a decent amount of historical content from Bach and was a nice tour.",
          "As a Bach lover I was a bit disappointed by this museum. The house was not Bach's which in itself wasn't a big problem. But, the interior was largely a modern display not transporting one's spirit into the time and life of the great composer. Nevertheless, if you are in",
          "Go here if you are a music lover! This was a highlight of our visit to Leipzig, rooms of detailed information on the Bach family of musicians going back several generations, details of Bach's manuscripts and how they are dated, and illustrations and details about Bach's life and",
          "Opposite St.Thomas's Church you can visit the recently renovated Bach Museum, located in a beautiful building that used to be the home of close friends to the Bach family. The museum has been arranged according to various topics concerning Bach's life and works, including",
          "Bach spent a good chunk of his life here and this town is built in his image, or so the argument can be formulated. Its a lovely place and totally worth visiting if one appreciate the baroque period.",
          "An excellent museum dedicated to Bach. If you have barely experienced this composer or if you know his works well this place is a must see. Affordable ticket prices make it accessible, and the abundant information in text and on audio guide shed light onto the composer and his",
          "It must be said that the entrance is little expensive in East German standards. But, as a very casual classical music listener, I very much enjoyed visiting this museum. Entrance is 8 Euro as of June 2015. If you are not fluent in German, dont forget to pick up the free audio",
          "Although we are not maniacal, we both like Johann Sebastian Bach's musical oeuvre a lot (we were married to the music of Bach). We loved this museum. While it definitely focuses on his years in Leipzig, it does a good job of illustrating his life and music. Good content and",
          "The Bach museum contains a beautifully conceived exhibition to show the life, works, and times of Bach. I particularly liked the \"music instruments room\" where contemporary instruments were displayed. The instruments that were used in a particular piece when it played were lit",
          "One of the best museums I've ever visited anywhere. The English audio guide is very informative, as are all the exhibits. You can listen as long as you like to selections of your choice from B's catalog.",
          "Despite Bach was not born in Leipzig, it is the place where he worked and lived a lot of years. The city is proud of that fact and the museum is an example. A must go!",
          "Museum fabulous. Well set out and interactive. Across the road from his church which had some lovely concerts. The restaurant in the open there was not so good. Better in some of the side streets.",
          "Well worth a visit to Leipzig just to see this museum alone. Really interesting displays, great audio guide, lots of music; we thought it was all excellent.",
          "This is not the house Bach lived in (which was since pulled down). There is not much documentation of Bach's life, his music, his post as choirmaster at St Thomas's church over the road, his pupils, marriage and sons. We do know about the instruments of his period and these",
          "Some parts of this are quite good, to be certain. The treasury room is wonderful, and really allows visitors to get a feel for Bach's effort. The interactive room where visitors can select which instruments play as a piece of music runs is similarly worth some time, and",
          "What a find next to the Cafe Gloria next to it. Apart from the guy o the ticket place not being welcoming the rest was brilliant. For a Bach lover to hear the music via the audio guide as well as sampling excerpts from the rest of the Bach family was wonderful. Really well set",
          "For Bach enthusiasts this is a real delight and you could stay all day. Plenty of fascinating exhibits, historical artefacts and music to listen to. Ten out of ten!",
          "Music lovers will like this museum, but you need at least two hours. The free audio guides are modern and easy to use, and add to the enjoyment.",
          "You could spend the day here, listening to Bach's music at several stations in the museum. There are period instruments on display, as well as a model of Leipzig during Bach's time, and a description of his life at the Thomas Kirche. As a boarding school teacher, I was",
          "You do need to have, at the very least, an interest in music and in Bach but even for the more casual visitor there is much here to absorb. A room of instruments as used in Bach's day with audio examples, one of his organs, copies of his music, family trees, a model of the",
          "For a real living museum, spend some time inside the church, taking in the span of history, the changes that nave has seen, the organs, the stained glass.",
          "Bach belongs to the world of music and anybody who deals with classic music, have to know Bach. This place is very good place for everyone who wants to feel and know the J.S. Bach better neither from its works. Please come and visit Mr.Bach",
          "After visiting Bach Museum, I have formed a very different view on Bach. I though he was strict and boring, but it turned out that he was very creative and had a sense of humor (as shown in his composition of the 'coffee cantata\"). I didn't understand in which circumstances had",
          "Granted, I'm a musician and really enjoy both music and history. So a museum dedicated to a musician strikes a special cord with me. I was fascinated by the history of Johann Sebastian Bach. The museum provided such a rich collection of historical facts about Bach that it was",
          "Extraordinary. It's a perfect museum if you love Bach. You leave feeling that you almost met him and his enormous family. And you learn lots about his work, the context and the instruments he used. Lots of opportunities to settle down and just listen.",
          "Very nice museum next to the church. Tons of history about Bach and great examples of his music. 6 euro per person to get in.",
          "It's in front of the church he worked, and the dormitories he, family and students lived. A lot of his instruments, and belongs are there. Interactive and instructive. My girlfriend, who is not musician, approved. Certainly a must see!!",
          "I was not sure I wanted to go to this museum. The cost is $8 Euros but that does include the audio guide. I was glad we went. It was nicely laid out with good details about his life both family and career. I liked that they had some of his pieces playing on the audio guide to",
          "A Bach historical museum. Exhibits in English and German, generally well conceived and presented. Next to St Thomas church, where Bach was the Kapellmeister.",
          "I was there during Museum night. The museum looked very maintained and layed out, but was mainly catering to people that know a lot about Bach and classical music allready. As I am a person with hardly any knowledge, I would have liked to be bedazzled. Instead, I got to see and",
          "The museum itself is good but brief. I appreciated the free audioguide. I think the main highlights are the original compositions on display in the treasure room and the listening rooms. You can hear almost anything you want to hear - the Bach music library available is",
          "We spent three hours just in four rooms. Brilliant audio guide. Fantastic displays. Almost too much to take in so give yourself lots of time. The ticket allows you to re-enter on the same day. A wonderful experience.",
          "Really very nice to see! Wonderful museum, with a lot of details. The audio explanation is clear and helpful. Combine the visit with the Thomaskirche one minut from the museum. If you are lucky (as we where) there is an organ concert in the Church.",
          "We had coffee, tea and cake. The service was good and the atmosphere excellent as it is right opposite Bach's statue!",
          "Nice mix of information on Bach. From the instrument he played, to the places he worked, both personal and professional life were included in this lovely museum. Recommend seeing it before going to the churches he played in.Nice audio accompaniment.",
          "We took a guided tour through this museum and loved it. Our guide explained so much about how Bach wrote each music composition and how others helped him by penning in many of the notes. His 2nd wife was so good at it that experts have a hard time telling which notes she wrote",
          "This small museum on 2 floors is just packed with information about the music meister & his family. An interactive museum as well. It has to do with music. Well worth a visit.",
          "I was surprised that this museum is located inside the Thomaskirche. There isn't a lot to see here \u2013 instruments from Bach's day, manuscripts, Bibles \u2013 but it is free and easy to access as you enter the church.",
          "plan to spend a couple of hours here as the hands-on interactive displays are wonderful ep if you are a classical music fan",
          "I thought this museum had a lot of interesting information about Bach's life. In particular, I thought the information about manuscript dating and the science behind music history was really interesting. It was certainly worth the price of admission. The only problems were",
          "I was looking forward to this but i found it to be rather dry and academic. It would have been nice to see some rooms furnished in the style of the time. Instead it is mostly photographs and charts. However, it is possible to hear music and watch some Bach-related videos.",
          "One for the enthusiast as it did not contain but a couple of Bach items, but a very well laid out series of rooms with displays, pictures and text in German and English along with a very effective and comprehansive audio guide (included in the admission fee). As enthusiasts we",
          "My favorite part of this museum was the Bach family tree, researched by JS Bach, of all of the musical Bachs. When a Bach family member's name on the tree was lit up, a recording of a composition by that member of the Bach family was played. There are a lot of interactive",

          "Whether you know very little about Bach or can play all the Toccatas and Fugues from memory, you will enjoy this museum. It has a lot of high tech gadgetry which entertained my teenaged grandson and he showed me how to work some of them. It is across the street from St.",

          "One big disappointment. The museum is full and empty, just like Bach's music. I Bury.\n\n",

          "You can listen to the details of all the exhibits in Japanese audio terminal.\nIt is a very interesting place for Bach lovers (^ ^)\n\n",
          "Since Leipzig is once the creek city, one should also stop by the Bach Museum. Even if you are not necessarily the classic lover. Very informative exhibition.\n\n",
          "A nice insight into the life of Bach in Leipzig. Richly provided with musical fragments with the audio tour.\n\n"

          "This is a must see place where you can hire an audio in English for 5 Euros. I didnt have the time to do this but just looking around was fascinating enough. I should imagine the guide would really give an understanding to what happened during these times. Its free to enter and",
          "A very interesting museum set in the building of the subject matter. A look at the rise and fall of the Stasi political police force of East Germany and their methods of work. Plenty of stuff on display. All in German but an English guide is available for 5 euros. Free to get",
          "This is the Stasi Museum in Leipzig. It is both informative and frightening what this organzation did to its citizens. It is recent history and well done.",
          "The StaSi - Staatssicherheit used sophisticated methods to spy mainly their own people. With then state of the art engineering and psycho methods they intruded privacy and uses anew all means to fight potential threats, like (unwanted) political involvement or civil",
          "This place is free so worth dropping in to see the former Stasi building. I can read German but partner cannot and we hate audio guides... so nothing more than 3 stars.",
          "This museum is well worth a visit. About 10 minutes stroll from the central station. Free entrance, but go in to the room directed and get a set of headphones for 5 euro. Most of the written stuff is only in German. Takes 1-2 hours, and is full of facts, pictures and equipment",
          "Entrance is free; at the time of writing the audio guide is \u20ac5. If you can't read German, the audio tour is excellent. It took us 2 hours total to look round. (There's an audio guide in German too so presumably there's extra info on it.) Very informative and interesting to",
          "This is an older style museum, but it has many interesting exhibits and information. It is in German, though, but still you should take an hour to visit.",
          "If you have an interest in the period covered by the museum, it's definitely recommended. For those that have a more casual interest, it's nevertheless quite accessible and not very large so it can be completed in a reasonably short visit. However, if you're of the latter group",
          "Fascinating to visit the former headquarters of the Stasi and learn about the surveyance of the people in th DDR.",
          "The museum's best feature is simply that it is in the original Stasi headquarters and you can really sense what it was like. As English-speakers, we had to rely on the headphones, which were fine, but you knew you were missing a lot.",
          "The \u2018Stasi\u2019 museum is worth a short visit, especially if you have not seen any other such establishments elsewhere. Entry is free, but audioguides are available for a small charge. The museum is not too large and not particularly gruesome (the interrogations and imprisonment",
          "Well appointed in the centre and host to former Stasi hq in Leipzig. There is so much information in this museum you quickly become absorbed. With today's knowledge it all seems so horrid and a real infringement on privacy. It is beyond belief some of the measures the State went",
          "This is a beautiful ole building which is surrounded by lots ofother really nice buildings in Leipzig and worth the photo opportunity.",
          "The history here is amazing from the original to the Stasi to the Americans to the Russians. Several rooms are packed with interest - labelling all in German so take a headset if you don't speak German. Rooms left as they were .",
          "Cant really complain since the museum is free of charge. That being said, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't speak German since everything on display is accompanied by only German text. It's not a huge museum and nothing I saw was of much interest.",
          "I visited the Stasi museum and rented the audio guide. I thought it was informative and interesting how much the police spied on the people of East Germany. You get the audio guide by walking into the museum and going to the small visitor center on the left. The museum is",
          "Audioguide for 5 euros but its very underwhelming considering u cant understand most of the info there For german speakers do come for an hour or 2 and its free",
          "this museum is impressive if you are even a tiny bit informed about how things ran back when. it sent shivers down our spine, though i had to translate everything as there was no english speaker available, a must see if yo want to know about the time when the iron curtain was a",
          "So visited this place at the end of Oct 2017, upon entry it was packed, I mean absolutely packed. It was a Monday. Turns out the scores of Germans were there for guided tours. Such tours are not available in English, so I learned I could proceed to the office, buy a ticket",
          "Go if you\u2019d like to see how the state police controlled the lives of people in Leipzig during the Cold War era. Very interesting. Pay for the audio guide because everything is in German. It is free to enter and browse.",
          "It is a reminder of the control the German Democratic Republic GDR had over people. The Stasi kept files on people and the Leipzig citizens can request their own file. They spied on everyone.",
          "Very educational and hard to believe this type of activity was ongoing during our lifetime (up until 1989). Upon entering head up the stairs and to your left, follow the hall a bit and look for the office on your left (it is not obvious upon entering). Rent the head-set for a",
          "Let\u2019s start with the English audio guide. It provided a good overview, but did not \u2014 and probably could not \u2014 get into the level of detail in the exhibits themselves. A lot of the material on display consists of documents. I muddled through some of the German and whipped out",
          "We just went in here for a short while; the entry is free, but you really can't understand anything unless you get the audioguide (which we didn't do). But it was interesting looking at the cameras and clothing from that time.",
          "This is a simple museum but the audioguide really brought it to life. Seeing a child's essay critical of the government is one thing but hearing what happened to the child is quite another. My teenage daughters were reluctant but they enjoyed it and learned quite a bit from it.",
          "What a wonderful exhibit. It is free but 5 euros for an audioguide which if you are not a German speaker you need. Well worth it for all the information. It is done on one floor and can be visited in an hour. Definitely worth your time to see how sinister the Stasi police",
          "As a non-German speaker, the English audio guide is an absolute must. I came with a limited understanding of the stasi or life during this era but I found my experience educational and disturbing. What a wake up call as I thought about freedom. Highly memorable and real..a",
          "What the Stasi did and how they did - banal, bureaucratic, it controlled the lives of East Germans and sometimes destroyed them. The audio guide is a must for non-German speakers. The deliberately unsophisticated presentation, in the building they actually used, adds to the",
          "We bumped into this museum by accident. We had a tour and to be honest this is a must see exhibition. It shows how the city was concured by the americans, then russians and then how the sicherheitd dienst of eastern germany under mosqow operated...very shocking. A very",
          "Unless you have a good command of German the English audio guide is a must. Not particularly large, basically about 10 offices with some info boards and a few artefacts from the communist days. Worth a visit if your staying local.",
          "Well worth visiting in Leipzig and for many this will open their eyes on a grim part of very recent history. All the artefacts and the story of the Stasi in East Germany are laid out in multiple rooms in the old headquarters five minutes walk from Leipzig centre. Staff are",
          "The museum is a great place to get a taste of the Stasi experience. There are few English explanations to the displays, so the audio guide was essential, although the two of us could have shared one guide since it's the type you hold to your ear, rather than headphones. There",
          "If you are interested in issues related recent German history this is a must see place. The communist regime had established a sofisticated system internal domestic spying featuring thoroughness and administrative efficiency.",
          "This was an interesting museum, containing artifacts and information about the secret police. Be sure to pick up the english audioguide!",
          "It was a dull day so we were looking for places to visit indoors. This was well worth visiting, what a story to tell !",
          "The museum in the rounded corner is a museum dedicated to the tidings of the east german secret police / Stasi and shows their day to day work. If you don\u2019t understand German make sure to get an audio guide to get the explanations!",
          "I've given this museum five stars, although it comes with a warning that while there is nothing grotesque on display, the subject matter is really quite evocative so do check with everyone in your group that this is the museum for them. Saying that, we learn from the past and",
          "The Stasi Museum was very interesting however the English audio is a must for anyone who does not read German well. I addition to the exhibits on the Stasi information on the Leipzig resistance was also provided. We spent a couple of hours here even though the museum is not",
          "This small museum, the Museum in the Round Corner, occupies the former district HQ of the East German State Security Services ( Stasi) which was greatly feared. It now forms a permanent exhibition ' Stasi : Power and Banality'. The marble staircase and entrance are in stark",
          "Had the chance to visit this place and was deeply impressed. The collections they have there are very complete, interesting and of course thought-provoking. Did not have a guided tour, but everything is soll well described and labelled I am positive one does not need a guided",
          "This museum is free but English audio guide is really needed as there is next to nothing written in English. That said the museum content is exhaustively detailed about the Stasi background and methods and the overthrow of the regime in 1989. However, it is starting to show its",
          "Very interesting! Definitely get the audioguide (English), it gives a lot of good information about the exhibits and what life was like during the Cold War in Leipzig. Highly recommend.",
          "Entry is free to this very informative Museum but if you are a non German speaker shell out the \u20ac5 for the audio guide as it is well worth it.",
          "Das Museum der runden Ecke (The museum at the round corner) was the location of the Staatliche Sicherheitamt (state security department) of East Germany in Leipzig. It includes the original equipments for bugging and reports of state crimes. In one case, a 9th grade pupil wrote",
          "As an English speaker you do miss a little bit of the detail (so get the audio guide) but this is still a fascinating tour of life under the Stasi. Housed in the former Stasi headquarters, you can get a real feel for the fear they sought to instil in the East German population.",
          "Somewhat informative museum set up in the former Staasi headquarters in Leipzig. Be warned though, NOTHING is in English if you don't speak German and want to know what you're looking at, you NEED to get the audio guide.",
          "Very interesting history facts. Must take time to visit this special museum - so interesting and educational. Located within the historic district of beautiful Leipzig.",
          "This was the local Stasi-headquarters, nothing in the building has been updated, you get the feeling walking through the corridors, touching the furniture. You know what to expect, but nevertheless it is astonishing and frightening to see what an organization it was. And also in",
          "Maybe I've overdosed on this theme but it didn't do as much for me as I'd anticipated. Not sure what's in the rest of the building but the museum only occupies a few rooms and cells in the ground floor. Creepy what went on for 40 years here.",
          "Very interesting museum. Too bad there are not written English translations. You need to get the audio.",
          "As someone who speaks no German, the audio guide was essential. The museum has a lot of articles and signs only in German and the audio guide doesn't even get through all of it. The layout of the museum was clear and easy to follow. I spent 1.5hrs there but could have spent",
          "Used the English audio-guide to get a good background to the exhibits which only have German written commentary. It very interesting to understand this relative recent period of history and then for the events which lead to the fall of the Berlin wall.",
          "In the original locations of the secret service of the GDR, you get a hands-on impression of how the secret service spied on its own people. Everything has been kept in its original form- the walls, floors, furniture etc., which you won't find anywhere else in Germany. You get a",
          "This museum is free to enter but if you need information in English you need to pay for the audio guide because nothing in the museum is in English. It is a fascinating place. You get a real insight into how life was for citizens of the DDR after WW2. It is like 1984 but it",
          "The Stasi Museum in former Stasi headquarters will make you understand how the German \"Democratic\" Republic worked, how was the life of individuals in the terrible machinery, and why and how they felled it. The museum is not too large, you can visit it in less than couple of",
          "This is a very different take on how museums are usually set up but it works very well. The former Stasi headquarters in Leipzig is now set up as if everything was left behind when they left in 1989. All the displays are in German (audio guides for other languages are available",
          "My father and I used the English audio guides as all the panels are in German. It was a very informative Museum that gave us deeper perspective on life under Stassi watch. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "I found this to be an absolutely fascinating insight into the Stasi and how they impacted life in the DDR. Yes, it's all in German, as it is mostly made up of original documents, but the audio guide is available in English (and other languages) and is well worth the \u20ac5 - one of",
          "This is an interesting museum which looks at the role of the \"Stasi\" secret police in East Germany. It is well set out with an informative audio guide. The museum has preserved the building as it was in the late 1980s when the Statsi last occupied the building, which gives it a",
          "great museum as it's free. but it isn't very big and most of the exhibits are behind glass and are old school boards (written in german) with a few pictures. we went here hoping to spend a few hours indoors - away from the cold and snow.. but we saw the museum in less than an",
          "The audio guide is is multiple languages but you need to get it switched to non-German language of your choice by holding down the fast-forward button for a few seconds, or ask the desk person to do this for you. All the exhibits are labelled in German except for a couple of",
          "Unique: Here they worked, spyed, oberved, controlled the people of the region. Everything orginal. Even the smell of the rooms reminds of this black age. What dicatorship means for common people, here you can feel and experience it. Highly recommended!",
          "A must see, free, museum on the history of the STASI. Photo's, documents, written and oral testimonials of the period 1945-1989 in de DDR.",
          "I knew a bit about the history of this but this is well worth a couple of hours to see in detail. Most of the written materials are only in German but they have an excellent English audio guide available. They exhibit a lot of the equipment used to spy on their fellow citizens.",
          "Extremely interesting museum. You really need to visit and buy the audio-guide service otherwise you will loose 90% of information",
          "Very informative place, even if you do not speak a word of German. This place was captured by the people of Leipzig in 1989 and it was kept as a museum since. It is in the city center, just a few minutes walk from the train station. well worth it!",
          "If you don't speak German you will need an audio guide for the museum. Unfortunately it is an older exhibit and there is no English text. That being said, the audio guide is very good. You have to pay for it, but entry into the museum itself is free. The atmosphere in this",
          "The Stasi offices are more or less as they were in the 80's and the atmosphere is creepy but the exhibits are very informative. The audio guide in English costs EUR5 and has extensive descriptions and explanation of the history of the secret police as well as the demonstrations",
          "A fantastic window into the Stasi and how they affected the lives of others. The displays were great but it was a shame that none of the displays had English translations. There was a audio guide but it did not completely replace the labels. Defiantly worth visiting though",
          "Free exhibit in and about the Stasi activities of the Leipzig district. The Stasi archives are also here. If there is a file on you, you can request it here. Best, however, was the (paying) guided tour that is given every afternoon in German. Tours in other languages have to be",
          "This is excellent, sadly for the foreign tourist, little explanations in English. I have seen exhibitions in Berlin and found this one really good",
          "This museum (former HQ of Stasi) gives a really good idea how it was to live in former East Germany. (everthing was \"watched and controlled\") The museum is kept in the original state, as if the Stasi moved out yesterday",
          "I visited the ex-Stasi (East German secret police) headquarters in Leipzig on the Day of German Unity in 2015. It was a functioning headquarters up until the Revolution of 1989. Exhibits are in German only, but a brief summary brochure is available in English and French.",
          "Museum: Stasi (East Berlin secret police until 1989) Admission: Free Audio Guides: available (English, Spanish, French) \u20ac4 *building is actual Stasi police location. Rooms have been preserved along with memorabilia. Must see!!",
          "This museum used to be the Stasi headquarters of Leipzig in DDR times. Miraculously it was handed over peacefully to the people of Leipzig. It is a chilling reminder of how dictatorships work: through the hands and actions of many that do not protest. Entrance is free, guided",
          "This is a sobering reminder of some of the DDR's darkest times. The exhibits are labelled in German only but there is an excellent, if not totally comprehensive, English audio guide. A huge contrast to the Bach and Wagner elements of Leipzig, it is in my view equally",
          "This is one of the museums that you must see, like it or not it's a piece of German history, it is not big but good and the entrance is free, at the side there also are the Stasi archives that are open to the public only 1 day each month, and I have not been able to see them",
          "We so wanted to see the former Stasi HQ having read Christoph Hein's Tangospieler, but unable to access the building :(",
          "The layout of the museum was, as others have noted, slightly confusing. However, apart from that the Museum in der Runden Ecke offers an excellent insight into life in the former DDR and the Stasi. If you don't speak German I recommend using one of the audio guides which will",
          "The former headquarters of the east german secret police, Stasi is a different and very interestng museum. Although most of the documentation is written in german, the english audio guides are very good and thorough. An interesting aspect to the museum is the documemtation and",
          "The museum gives a detailed view of the surveillance performed in the former East Germany.  The permanent exhibition reveals how deeply the surveillance extended into the daily lives of DDR citizens. New technology like better camera lenses were developed to improve the",
          "Definitely a good reason to trek to the edge of the main Leipzig tourist circle. It feels like you are transported back in time to the DDR years prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall, as the museum narrates Leipzig's role leading up to that, whilst giving you a sneak peek into",
          "It's a good museum to learn about stassi, the origin and their techniques to spy and how related they were with soviets, i really recomend you to use the audioguide wich is 4\u20ac but is totally worth it, unfortunately it's kind of small considering that the whole building was the",
          "Fabulous exhibition of the Stasi in Leipzig. It has helped me with back up to my teaching of 'Das Leben der Anderen'.",
          "Be prepared to stay longer than planned...this museum really draws you in. The English audio guide is VERY detailed. One problem is that the rooms are not number clearly, so it's hard to know which number to tap for the next comment, as you move around. The stories here are",
          "If you are keen to get some insights of how it was like to live in a surveilance state, head to this Museum. You will find interesting samples of how the Stasi was spying on their citizens, including the collection of smell samples in marmelade jars!",
          "Very cool museum about the secret police...everything is in German only but audio guides are available for 4 Euros which will enhance the visit quite a bit",
          "Experience a nightmare with the relief to know that it is over. A great teaching experience for those who support totalitarian regimes.",
          "I went with my partner since she's German and she would like to learn about what happened when Germany was divided west and east. The museum is a walking distance to the town centre and very easy to spot. Since I am not German and even with basic German, I had difficulty with",
          "For those interested in the history of the DDR, Communist East Germany which collapsed with the Berlin Wall in November 1989 this museum is an excellent reminder how a communist state developed into a police state.",
          "As an expose of the methods that a state can use to spy on its own people and of the consequences of being caught it is excellent. Its worth getting the audio guide but some of the explanations are over-long.",
          "This is an absolutely amazing place, much more informative and elaborate than I expected. It's been very lovingly done, built up with great attention to detail and a great mix of information and exhibition pieces. I definitely didn't expect it to be as in-depth as it was! No",
          "Firstly, this museum is entirely in German. If you cannot read German, there are audio-guides available, but i\"m not sure how much they cost. For those who can read German, this museum is incredibly interesting and gives guests a very detailed and intricate look into the Stasi",
          "I was not expecting the museum to present all of its information in English, since all advertisements and signs for it were written in German only. The museum is clearly made with the intent of passing on the importance of Leipzig's history to younger generations of Germans,",
          "We enjoyed the guided tour through the exhibition which was very lively and to the point. Our guide gave us a very good idea how the secret police worked, intimidated and people. If you are just walking through the exhibition the information might be overwhelming.",
          "The terrifying machinery of the Stasi is shown plain in this exhibition. It's a stark reminder that the Organs reached all the way from childhood through private lives of others. Shown through artefacts like cameras, letter opening tools, disguises and uniforms, it's chilling to",
          "Can't believe this was so recent! The location is next to the ring road where the protests in 1989 started which led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. When you arrive head straight for the office in the middle of the museum where you can get an audio translation device for 4\u20ac (",
          "You had to pay for an English translation as everything was in German. The exhibits were very poor and not what I was expecting. Don't waste your time",
          "Tremendous amount of information to help the visitor better understand the repressive nature of life in East Germany. Plan to spend a bit of time there to get the full impact of the museum.",
          "A cheap and great way to learn about the Stasi within Leipzig during the GDR. The museum is situated within the old office of the Stasi which brings the story home even more and visitors can be provided with audiobooks to talk through the exhibtion. Highly recommended to those",
          "We had a very good guided tour and learned a lot about the way the \"state security service\" worked. It was fascinating and depressing at the same time.",
          "To get an idea how suppression works and what happens if it is executed by efficient Germans, come to this place. The interior of the building itself is intimidating. The exhibits support this impression. There are a lot of authentical reading stuff and therefore exclusively in",
          "Excellent museum with an English audio guide (\u20ac4) but free entry. Very authentic being housed in the building where the Stasi operated in Leipzig. Not too big or overwhelming for kids and lots of interesting items for them to look at and only needs an hour if done fully. Right",
          "One of the most Special places in entire Germany. This museum shows all the Facts,Utilities and Legacy of the Stasi and shows many facts of this Mysterious Security Service which controlled the entire DDR , the Technology and Strategies this Service had was way ahead of Time.",
          "There are many documents, facts and exhebits placed in the building wich made me understand the topic better. Everything is in this 'old look' (the original floor,...) and the more you read, the more oppressive was the atmosphere. The only problem is, that sometimes it was",
          "\"You can't miss it \" said fellow holidaymakers in our hotel. This turned out to be untrue as we walked a good ten minutes past the museum on the wrong side of the road. It's on the bend of a very wide road and the sign isn't that obvious. If you have a street map, get someone",
          "Best of all: it\u00b4s right in the city centre, 10 minutes walk from the main station. Leipzig, the city of the peaceful revolution 1989, has the advantage that the former STASI building was run over by a citizens committee already in decembre 1989, 1 month before the central",
          "This is especially interesting for people who already know something about Stasi and the GDR. There is so much information that it is difficult to take it in. We were lucky to arrive in time for a special guided tour, in German, though the basement and up to the top floors of",
          "This museum is located in the former Stase Leipzig office; it even had secret external cameras to monitor passers by in the street outside ! It details in a fascinating fashion the means whereby the secret police of the former German Democratic Republic kept an eye on its",
          "An excellent insight into life under the Stasi and how they operated. This is not a smart museum, but the style suits the subject. Lots of original photographs and equipment that was used to oversee everyone's lives and how everyone oversaw everyone else.",
          "This in situ Stasi museum was my fave museum in Germany. Entry is free but pay the 4 euro for the audio guide if you are not a German speaker. By far the best audio guide I've ever heard, which combines the rare qualities of story telling from the era and discussing the",
          "This building was the actual headquarters from where the Stasi operated in the then East Germany. They were ruthless and relentless about gathering information on everyone and how they did it is all documented in the different office rooms. You will need an audio as the reading",
          "A very good review of the Stasi influences on the daily lives of GDR citizens. Be sure to get an audio guide as the exhibition tags are all in German.",
          "This museum can be a bit too much with so much detailed information. But if you concentrate on the essential you get a very clear picture of the methods of the Stasi and the events that led to the unification of Germany.",
          "At first the museum looks very low key and boring. However, the story of the Stasi East German Police unfolds with the excellent audio headsets. This is the actual Stasi headquarters for the Leipzig area complete with offices and detention cells. This little museum is packed",
          "This thought provoking Museum shows us how far into everyday life the 'Stasi', would delve to see who in the population were trangressing from the party line and the strange methods for listening in or taking photographs of western 'thinkers' !! The Leipzig headquarters were",

        "wiki": "Leipzig (, also , , German: [\u02c8la\u026apts\u026a\u00e7] (listen);; Upper Saxon: Leibzsch) is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. With a population of 600,000 inhabitants as of 2019 (1.1 million residents in the larger urban zone), it is Germany's eighth most populous city as well as the second most populous city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin. Together with Halle (Saale), the largest city of the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt, the city forms the polycentric conurbation of Leipzig-Halle. Between the two cities (in Schkeuditz) lies Leipzig/Halle International Airport.\nLeipzig is located about 160 kilometres (99 mi) southwest of Berlin in the Leipzig Bay, which constitutes the southernmost part of the North German Plain, at the confluence of the White Elster River (progression: Saale\u2192 Elbe\u2192 North Sea) and two of its tributaries: the Plei\u00dfe and the Parthe. The name of the city as well as the names of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.\nLeipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire. The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes. Leipzig was once one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing. After the  Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East German terms, but its cultural and economic importance declined. Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy, which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry, severe unemployment, and urban blight. Starting around 2000, however, decline was first arrested and then reversed. Leipzig has undergone significant change with the restoration of major historical buildings, the demolition of derelict properties of little historical value, and the development of new industries and a modern transport infrastructure.Leipzig today is an economic centre, the most livable city in Germany, according to the GfK marketing research institution and has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, according to HWWI and Berenberg Bank. The city is one of two seats of the German National Library (together with Frankfurt), as well as the seat of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and ranks first in Germany and second in Europe according to Anthony Sheridan. Since the opening of the Leipzig City Tunnel in 2013, Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system. Leipzig is currently listed as a Gamma World City, Germany's \"Boomtown\" and as the European City of the Year 2019.Leipzig has long been a major centre for music, both classical as well as modern \"dark alternative music\" or darkwave genres. The Oper Leipzig is one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany. Leipzig is also home to the University of Music and Theatre \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\". It was during a stay in this city that Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem \"Ode to Joy\". The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Johann Sebastian Bach is one among many major composers who lived and worked in Leipzig.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Name ===\n\nThe name Leipzig is derived from the Slavic word Lipsk, which means \"settlement where the linden trees (British English: lime trees; U.S. English: basswood trees) stand\". An older spelling of the name in English is Leipsic. The Latin name Lipsia was also used. The name is cognate with Lipetsk (\u041b\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043a) in Russia and Liep\u0101ja in Latvia.\n\nIn 1937 the Nazi government officially renamed the city Reichsmessestadt Leipzig (Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig).Since 1989 Leipzig has been informally dubbed \"Hero City\" (Heldenstadt), in recognition of the role that the Monday demonstrations there played in the fall of the East German regime \u2013 the name alludes to the honorary title awarded in the former Soviet Union to certain cities that played a key role in the victory of the Allies during the Second World War. The common usage of this nickname for Leipzig up until the present is reflected, for example, in the name of a blog for local arts and culture, Heldenstadt.de.More recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\", \"Hypezig\" or \"The better Berlin\" for being celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for the vital lifestyle and creative scene with many startups.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nLeipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as urbs Libzi (Chronikon VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by Otto the Rich. Leipzig Trade Fair, started in the Middle Ages, has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world.\nThere are records of commercial fishing operations on the river Plei\u00dfe in Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the Margrave Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.There were a number of monasteries in and around the city, including a Franciscan monastery after which the Barfu\u00dfg\u00e4\u00dfchen (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks (Jacobskirche, destroyed in 1544) near the present day Ranst\u00e4dter Steinweg (the old Via Regia).\nThe foundation of the University of Leipzig in 1409 initiated the city's development into a centre of German law and the publishing industry, and towards being the location of the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) and the German National Library (founded in 1912).\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, two battles took place in Breitenfeld, about 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) outside Leipzig city walls. The first Battle of Breitenfeld took place in 1631 and the second in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.\nOn 24 December 1701, an oil-fueled street lighting system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig between Napoleonic France and an allied coalition of Prussia, Russia, Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended Napoleon's presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on Elba. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.When it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the Royal Saxon State Railways and the western one for the Prussian state railways.\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German labor party, the General German Workers' Association (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein, ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge Gr\u00fcnderzeit areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei became the largest cotton mill company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Daily production surpassed 5 million kilograms of yarn.During the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to World War II. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.\nOn 22 May 1930, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was elected mayor of Leipzig. He was well known as an opponent of the Nazi regime. He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of Felix Mendelssohn. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue, one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. Goerdeler was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.\n\nSeveral thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.\nBeginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the Gemeinde, a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.Like all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to aryanisation. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenh\u00e4user, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.As with other cities in Europe during the Holocaust, the Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the Nuremberg Laws. However, due to the Leipzig Trade Fair and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures. Shortly before Kristallnacht, Polish Jews living in the city were expelled.On 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the \"Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig\". In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in Zionism through Jewish citizens. Many of these Zionists attempted to flee before deportations began. On 28 October 1938, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of Polish Jews from Leipzig to Poland.On 9 November 1938, as part of Kristallnacht, in Gottschedstrasse (German: Gottschedstra\u00dfe), now a popular dining and nightlife area in Leipzig, synagogues and businesses were set on fire. Only a couple of days later, on 11 November 1938, many Jews in the Leipzig area were deported to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. As World War II came to an end, much of Leipzig was destroyed. Following the war, the Communist Party of Germany (German: Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, KPD) provided aid for the reconstruction of the city.In 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported. On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors. According to records of the Theresienstadt deportation, only 53 Jews survived.Until late 1943, there was little threat of aerial bombings to the city. However, on the morning of 4 December 1943, the British Royal Air Force dropped over 1,000 tons of explosives, resulting in the death of nearly 1,000 civilians. This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, the storm was too overwhelming for them. Unlike its neighbouring city of Dresden, this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945. In April 1945 the SS Gruppehfuhrer/Mayor of Leipzig Bruno Erich Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter; the Deputy Mayor/Treasurer of Leipzig, Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter, and a Volkssturm Major Walter D\u00f6nicke committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\nThe United States turned the city over to the Red Army as it pulled back from the line of contact with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city.In the mid-20th century, the city's trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the Comecon Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which East Germany was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the Monument to the Battle of the Nations.\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in. Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.In October 1989, after prayers for peace at St. Nicholas Church, established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the Monday demonstrations started as the most prominent mass protest against the East German government. The reunification of Germany, however, was at first not good for Leipzig. The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city's speciality was, in terms of the advanced economy of  reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished. As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunificaiton, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.Starting in 2000, an ambitious (and subsequently much-praised) urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig's decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving as much as possible of the city's urban structure, especially its attractive historic center and various architectural gems, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nNowadays, Leipzig is an important economic center in Germany. Since the 2010s, the city has been celebrated by the media as a hip urban center with a very high quality of living. It is often called \"The new Berlin\". Leipzig is also Germany's fastest growing city. Leipzig was the German candidate for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful. After ten years of construction, the Leipzig City Tunnel opened on 14 December 2013. Leipzig forms the centerpiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system, which operates in the four German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLeipzig lies at the confluence of the rivers White Elster, Plei\u00dfe and Parthe, in the Leipzig Bay, on the most southerly part of the North German Plain, which is the part of the North European Plain in Germany. The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the Leipzig Riverside Forest, though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat though there is also some evidence of moraine and drumlins.\nAlthough there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-cast mines in the region, many of which are being converted to use as lakes. Also see: Neuseenland\nLeipzig is also situated at the intersection of the ancient roads known as the Via Regia (King's highway), which traversed Germany in an east\u2013west direction, and the Via Imperii (Imperial Highway), a north\u2013south road.\nLeipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and the current \"ring\" road around the historic centre of the city follows the line of the old city walls.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nSince 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten districts, which in turn contain a total of 63 subdistricts. Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike many places located in Eastern parts of Germany, Leipzig has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb close to a Dfb [0 \u00b0C US isotherm]) with significant continental influences due to inland location. Winters are cool to cold, with an average of around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F). Summers are generally warm, averaging at 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) with daytime temperatures of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours a day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours a day).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nLeipzig has a population of about 570,000. In 1930, the population reached its historical peak of over 700,000. It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation. After almost doubling the city area by incorporation of surrounding towns in 1999, the number stabilised and started to rise again, with an increase of 1,000 in 2000. As of 2015, Leipzig is the fastest-growing city in Germany with over 500,000 inhabitants.\nThe growth of the past 10\u201315 years has mostly been due to inward migration. In recent years, inward migration accelerated, reaching an increase of 12,917 in 2014.In the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates. Births dropped from 7,000 in 1988 to less than 3,000 in 1994. However, the number of children born in Leipzig has risen since the late 1990s. In 2011, it reached 5,490 births resulting in a RNI of \u221217.7 (\u2212393.7 in 1995).The unemployment rate decreased from 18.2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2014 and 7.6% in June 2017.The percentage of the population from an immigrant background is low compared with other German cities. As of 2012, only 5.6% of the population were foreigners, compared to the German national average of 7.7%.The number of people with an immigrant background (immigrants and their children) grew from 49,323 in 2012 to 77,559 in 2016, making them 13.3% of the city's population (Leipzig's population 579,530 in 2016).The largest minorities (first and second generation) in Leipzig by country of origin as of 31.12.2018 are:\n\n\n== Culture, sights and cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe historic central area of Leipzig features a Renaissance-style ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several baroque period trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the historicist style representative of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The new city hall, completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\nSome 64,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in Plattenbau buildings during Communist rule in East Germany. and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, at least 10% of Leipzig's population (50,000 people) are still living in Plattenbau accommodation. Gr\u00fcnau, for example, has approximately 40,000 people living in this sort of accommodation.The St. Paul's Church was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called Paulinum, which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings and structures ===\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of 205 metres (673 feet). With 142 metres (466 feet), the City-Hochhaus Leipzig is the tallest high-rise building in Leipzig. From 1972 to 1973 it was Germany's tallest building.\n\n\n=== Museums and the arts ===\nOne of the highlights of the city's contemporary arts was the Neo Rauch retrospective opening in April 2010 at the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts. This is a show devoted to the father of the New Leipzig School of artists. According to The New York Times, this scene \"has been the toast of the contemporary art world\" for the past decade. In addition, there are eleven galleries in the so-called Spinnerei.The Grassi Museum complex contains three more of Leipzig's major collections: the Ethnography Museum, Applied Arts Museum and Musical Instrument Museum (the last of which is run by the University of Leipzig). The university also runs the Museum of Antiquities.Founded in March 2015, the G2 Kunsthalle houses the Hildebrand Collection. This private collection focuses on the so-called New Leipzig School. Leipzig's first private museum dedicated to contemporary art in Leipzig after the turn of the millennium is located in the city centre close to the famous St. Thomas Church on the third floor of the former GDR processing centre.Other museums in Leipzig include the following:\n\nThe German Museum of Books and Writing is the world's oldest museum of its kind, founded in 1884.\nThe Egyptian Museum of the University of Leipzig comprises a collection of about 7,000 artefacts from several millennia.\nThe Schillerhaus is the house where Schiller lived in summer 1785.\nThe Zeitgeschichtliches Forum Leipzig (Forum of Contemporary History) shows the history of the German division and the everyday life in the socialist German Democratic Republic.\nNaturkundemuseum Leipzig is the city's natural history museum.\nThe Leipzig Panometer is a visual panorama displayed inside a former gasometer, accompanied by a thematic exhibition.\nThe \"Museum in der Runden Ecke\" is the best known museum in the city. It deals with the operation of the Stasi State Security of former East Germany.\nJohann Sebastian Bach lived from 1723 until his death in Leipzig. The Bach Archive is an institution for the documentation and research of his life and work.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\nLeipzig Zoological Garden is one of the most modern zoos in Europe, with approximately 850 different animal species. It houses the world's largest zoological facilities for primates (Pongoland). Gondwanaland is the world's largest indoor rainforest hall.\nMonument to the Battle of the Nations (V\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal) (Battle of the Nations Monument): one of the largest monuments in Europe, built to commemorate the victorious battle against Napoleonic troops.\nBundesverwaltungsgericht: Germany's federal administrative court was the site of the Reichsgericht, the highest state court between 1888 and 1945.\nNew City Hall: the city's administrative building was built upon the remains of the Pleissenburg, a castle that was the site of the 1519 debate between Johann Eck and Martin Luther.

It provides programmes to various TV and radio networks and has its own symphony orchestra, choir and a ballet.\nLeipziger Volkszeitung (LVZ) is the city's only daily newspaper. Founded in 1894, it has published under several different forms of government. The monthly magazine Kreuzer specializes in culture, festivities and the arts in Leipzig. Leipzig was also home to the world's first daily newspaper in modern times. The \"Einkommende Zeitungen\" were first published in 1650.\nLeipzig has one daily or semi-daily English-language publication, The Leipzig Glocal.

Few are left after the years of economic decline during the German Democratic Republic, during which time Frankfurt developed as a much more important publishing center. Reclam, founded in 1828, was one of the large publishing houses to move away. Leipzig still has a book fair, but Frankfurt's is far bigger.\nThe German Library (Deutsche B\u00fccherei) in Leipzig is part of Germany's National Library. Its task is to collect a copy of every book published in German.\n\n\n== Quality of life ==\n\nIn December 2013, according to a study by GfK, Leipzig was ranked as the most livable city in Germany.In 2015/2016, Leipzig was named the second-best city for students in Germany (after Munich).In a 2017 study, the Leipzig inner city ranked first among all large cities in Germany due to its urban aesthetics, gastronomy, and shopping opportunities.Since 2018 it also has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, only surpassed by Munich in 2018 and Berlin in 2019.According to the 2017 Global Least & Most Stressful Cities Ranking, Leipzig was one of the least stressful cities in the World. It was ranked 25th out of 150 cities worldwide and above Dortmund, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Berlin.In 2018, Leipzig won the European Cities of Future prize in the category of \"Best Large City for Human Capital & Lifestyle\".Leipzig was named European City of the Year at the 2019 Urbanism Awards.According to the 2019 study by Forschungsinstitut Prognos, Leipzig is the most dynamic region in Germany. Within 15 years, the city climbed 230 places and occupied in 2019 rank 104 of all 401 German regions.Leipzig is one of 52 places to go in 2020 by The New York Times and the highest-ranking German destination.Leipzig Hauptbahnhof is the best railway station in Germany and the third-best in Europe (only surpassed by St Pancras railway station and Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof).\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFounded at the crossing of Via Regia and Via Imperii, Leipzig has been a major interchange of inter-European traffic and commerce since medieval times. After the Reunification of Germany, immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nOpened in 1915, Leipzig Central Station is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the ICE and Intercity network of the Deutsche Bahn as well as a connection point for S-Bahn and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\nIn Leipzig, the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg-)Berlin-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Munich and Dresden-Leipzig-Erfurt-Frankfurt am Main-(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. After completion of the high-speed line to Erfurt, the ICE will run on both lines via Leipzig/Halle Airport and Erfurt. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)-Magdeburg-Braunschweig-Hannover-Dortmund-K\u00f6ln and -Bremen-Oldenburg(-Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via two S-Bahn lines, one of which runs hourly via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200 km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300 km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg is scheduled for completion in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network will considerably reduce the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200 km/h. The ICE will also be able to operate from Leipzig to Dresden in the near future. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long City Tunnel, which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a large freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\n\n=== Suburban train ===\n\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and Bayerischer Bahnhof leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n\n=== Tramway and Buses ===\n\nThe Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe, existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\nThe total length of the tram network is 149.9 km (93.1 mi), making it the largest in Saxony ahead of Dresden (130.2 km (80.9 mi)) and the second largest in Germany after Berlin (193.6 km (120.3 mi)).\nThe longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be bicycle-friendly. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\nSince 2004 there is a bicycle-sharing system. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the A 14 in the north, the A 9 in the west and the A 38 in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the A 72 is also partly under construction or being planned.\nThe federal roads B 2, B 6, B 87, B 181, B 184 and B 186 lead through the city area.\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\nLeipzig has a dense network of carsharing stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a ridesharing provider. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n\n=== Long-distance buses ===\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5 million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and Leipziger Messe for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLeipzig/Halle Airport is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). DHL uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines Aerologic and European Air Transport Leipzig.\nThe former military airport near Altenburg, Thuringia called Leipzig-Altenburg Airport about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by Ryanair until 2010.\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the Elster-Saale canal, White Elster and Saale was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of forced labor. The Lindenauer port was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and Karl-Heine canal respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, New Luppe, Plei\u00dfe, and Parthe) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing mill races and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused open cast mines, the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the Elbe from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Quotations ==\nMein Leipzig lob' ich mir!

          "Very informative but thought we would have seen more... you have to take your time to read all the information. It was terrible what they had to live through. Zero privacy",
          "Much like the museum in der runden ecke in Leipzig (not to be confused with the bunker for which this review is for, this is recommended for anyone who takes an interest in this era. But if you're not an German speaker, you need to manage your expectations. The museum do",
          "Small and very flew of the material exhibited was described in English. Go to the contemporary history forum instead",
          "This museum is well worth the visit especially if you lived during that time span. The admission was free but if you want a recorded English guide it will cost you 5 euros (well worth it). It is real and accurate history. Nothing is sugar coated. You'll learn all of the methods",
          "Visiting this museum with a local whose family was affected by the Stasi policies was a real eye opener. A really interesting insight into how the Stasi infiltrated different families and communities across Germany.",
          "Well, we wnet to the Stasi museum 'an der ecke' and thought we'd visit the bunker too. it's a way out of town, so we took an S-Bahn and then hiked the rest of the way. (5km?). it's located at the edge of a holiday park, which was its 'cover' during the cold war years. it's",

          "This museum is a must for people who are interested in seeing something of the remains of a very dark period in the history of Germany, to say the least. Not having to do with the Holocaust directly, this post.war bunker gives insight into pretty nasty methods and behaviour,",

      "name": "St. Thomas Church",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "St. Thomas Church (German: Thomaskirche) is a Lutheran church in Leipzig, Germany. It is associated with several well-known composers such as Richard Wagner and Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, but mostly with Johann Sebastian Bach who worked here as a Kapellmeister (music director) from 1723 until his death in 1750. Today, the church also holds his remains. Martin Luther preached here in 1539.\nAlthough rebuilt over the centuries and damaged by Allied incendiary bombs in 1943, the church today mainly retains the character of a late-Gothic hall church. The Thomanerchor, the choir of the Thomaskirche, likely founded in 1212, remains a well-known boys' choir.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere has been a church at the current site of the Thomaskirche at least since the 12th century. Foundations of a Romanesque building have been discovered in the choir and crossing of the current church.Between 1212 and 1222 the earlier structure became the church of the new St. Thomas Monastery (Stift) of the Augustinian order founded by Markgraf Dietrich von Meissen. This monastery later became the core of the University of Leipzig (founded in 1409).In 1217, The Minnesinger, or troubadour (see Minnesang), Heinrich von Morungen bequeathed to the church a relic of St. Thomas as he entered the order of canons after a trip to India.\nIn 1355, the Romanesque choir was changed to Gothic style. Following an inflow of wealth into Leipzig from the discovery of silver in the Erzgebirge, the Romanesque nave was demolished and replaced in 1482-96 by the current late-Gothic hall church.The current building was consecrated by Thilo of Trotha, the Bishop of Merseburg, on 10 April 1496. The reformer Martin Luther preached here on Pentecost Sunday in 1539. The monastic buildings were demolished in 1541 following the monastery's dissolution.\nThe current church tower was first built in 1537 and rebuilt in 1702. Chapels added in the 17th century and an ante-building along the northern front of the nave with two stairways were removed at the end of the 19th century.\n\nThe composer Johann Sebastian Bach was choir director of music at St. Thomas Church from 1723 until his death in 1750 and taught at its affiliated school. A statue of Johann Sebastian Bach by the Leipzig sculptor Carl Seffner that stands next to the church was dedicated in 1908.On 12 May 1789, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played the organ here. In 1806, the church served as a munitions depot for the French army. During the Battle of Leipzig, the Thomaskirche was used as a military hospital.Richard Wagner was baptized here on 16 August 1813. In 1828, he studied piano and counterpoint with the then Thomaskantor, Christian Th. Weinlig.Most of the Baroque internal trappings of the church known to Bach were removed in a Gothic revival renovation of 1884\u20139. Also from this period date the pulpit and the main portal in the west facade.On 4 December 1943, the tower was damaged in an Allied bombing raid on Leipzig, requiring repair. The authorities demolished the Johanneskirche, also damaged by bombs in 1943, in 1949 and the remains of Johann Sebastian Bach were moved from there to the Thomaskirche in 1950.\nIn the 20th century, sulfur emitted from nearby coal mines, and other pollutants in the atmospheric air caused the deterioration of exterior stonework and statuary, and even of interior Gothic paintings. In addition, the roof structure suffered from damage due to insects and moisture. For these reasons, the church was listed in the 2000 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund. Repairs were swiftly undertaken with financial support from the Fund and from American Express.\nRepairs on the church in 1961 to 1964 also attempted to emphasize the Gothic hall church character of the building. Another renovation followed in 1991.From 1993 to 2014, a 15th-century Gothic altar (originally in the Paulinerkirche, the church of the University of Leipzig, destroyed in 1968 by the Communist authorities) was located in the Thomaskirche. It was moved to the new St. Pauli church (2014) and replaced in 2016 with a Gothic-revival altar by Constantin Lipsius made in 1888, which had been removed in 1964.\n\nA statue of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, who lived in Leipzig from 1835 until his death in 1847, was dedicated on 18 October 2008, when it was re-erected opposite the St. Thomas Church on the occasion of the year of his 200th birthday. The 6-meter (20 ft) statue depicts the former Gewandhaus Orchestra director and composer in bronze. Celebratory speeches were given by Kurt Masur, also a former Gewandhaus Orchestra director, and Burkhard Jung, mayor of Leipzig. The original statue designed by Werner Stein was first dedicated on 26 May 1892. It had been located on the east side of the Gewandhaus until 9 November 1936, when it was taken down by the Nazis because of the composer's Jewish background.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe churches measures 76 meters in length, of which the nave accounts for 50 meters. The nave is 25 meters wide and its walls reach a maximum height of 18 meters. The church's roof is unusually steep with a roof pitch of 63 degrees. It rises to a crown that is 45 meters high. The tower is 68 meters in height.\n\n\n=== Works of art ===\nThe church features a number of works of art, including a baptismal font (1614-5) made by Franz D\u00f6teber and Portraits show the Stadtsuperintenden of Leipzig, the oldest dating from 1614. A crucifix made by Caspar Freidrich L\u00f6bel is one of the few remaining pieces from the times of Bach. The church also contains a number of notable epitaphs, such as the one for the knight Harras (d. 1451) and for councilor Daniel Leicher (1612). The colored windows in the choir were added after 1889. They show a number of historic motives: a memorial to the fallen of World War I, King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, Johann Sebastian Bach, Martin Luther with Elector Friedrich der Weise and Philip Melanchthon as well as Emperor Wilhelm I.\n\n\n=== Tomb of Johann Sebastian Bach ===\nThe remains of Johann Sebastian Bach have been buried in the Thomaskirche since 1950. After his death on 28 July 1750, Bach was laid to rest in the hospital cemetery of the Johanniskirche in Leipzig. With the start of the Bach renaissance in the 19th century, the public started to become interested in his remains and their whereabouts. So, in 1894, the anatomy professor Wilhelm His was commissioned to identify the composer's remains amongst disinterred bones from the cemetery where Bach had been buried. He concluded that \"the assumption that the bones of an elderly man, which had been found in an oak coffin near the Johanneskirche, were the remains of Johann Sebastian Bach\" (translated from German) was very likely. On 16 July 1900 the bones were placed into a stone sarcophagus underneath the Johanniskirche.\nFollowing the bombardment of the Johanniskirche on 4 December 1943, the bones were transferred to the Thomaskirche. The new grave with a bronze cover was inaugurated on 28 July 1950, 200 years after the death of the composer, who is now buried in the sanctuary of the Thomaskirche.\n\n\n=== Organs ===\nAnother notable feature of the Thomaskirche is that it contains two organs. The older one is a Romantic organ by Wilhelm Sauer, built from 1884\u201389. Since this organ was considered \"unsuitable\" for Bach's music, a second organ was built in 1966/7 (by Alexander Schuke). This was later replaced in 1999/2000 by a new organ, built by Gerald Woehl's organ building company from 1999\u20132000. This \"Bach organ\" was designed to look similar to the instrument on which Bach had played in the Paulinerkirche.\n\n\n=== Church bells ===\nThere are four bells in the St. Thomas bell tower. The largest is the Gloriosa, which was cast by Theodericus Reinhard in 1477. It weighs 5200 kg, has a diameter of 2.04 meters, and a strike pitch of a\u00b0. It is used on days of celebration. The second-largest bell was cast by Wolf Hilliger in 1574 and has a strike note of c\u2032. The third largest bell is called either the Monks\u2019 or Confessional Bell (M\u00f6nchs- oder Beichtglocke), which has a strike pitch of d\u2032. Jakob K\u00f6nig cast it in 1634 and it serves as the hourly bell. The fourth bell was cast by Christophorus Gros in 1585 and has a strike note of f\u2033. Its resonance is dampened by shortened yokes from which it hangs. The tower lantern holds separately a bell that is rung each quarter-hour. This bell was cast in 1539 by the Schilling bell foundry in Apolda. It was modelled on its predecessor.\n\n\n== Choir ==\nThe Thomanerchor, the choir of the Thomaskirche, was founded in 1212 and is one of the oldest and most famous boys' choirs in Germany. It is headed by the Thomaskantor, an office that has been held by many well-known composers and musicians, including Johann Sebastian Bach from 1723 until his death in 1750.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial parish page\n(in German) Entry in the \"Leipzig encyclopedia\"",

          "The choir sang in honor of the reunification of Germany. The program was beautiful, the church was full. This church once had Johann Sebastian Bach as its organist. His remains are buried in the Chancel of the Church, and an impressive statue of him stands outside the church",
          "The building and its history are impressive, but even better was a choir concert on Saturday afternoon for 2 Euros! There was a wait for the doors to open, but there were lots of seats and the acoustics were very good.",
          "This is not just any church. This is Johan Sebastian Bach`s church where he was a concert master for many many years. He is also buried in this church though originally elsewhere. A statue of him you will find just outside. There is a pretty little square there where the last",

          "In general, I am not a fan of visiting churches, even just for the sake of a beautiful view of their architecture, but I can not deny that this one, as I sometimes see in other places, looks good. In the old days they knew how to build a beautiful church. Modern \"shiny boxes\"",

          "No trip to Leipzig is complete without a visit here to pay homage to J. S. Bach. The church was packed for the Saturday afternoon organ recital, which was played mostly on the smaller organ in the center of the church. Fortunately, the final piece and the encore were played on",

          "This is the church where Back taught as the choir master. It is definitely worth a visit. Luther also preached here so it has two connections to history.",
          "This church has the tomb of JS Bach and a lovely altarpiece. It is quite a restrained church in terms of decoration but also has a small Bach museum with some of his instruments. When we visited there was an organist playing and that definitely added to the atmosphere. A very",
          "Architecturally speaking, I suppose the church itself may be (what some have called) unremarkable, but it does have a notable history. When one also considers the personages who have passed through this hallowed hall, it is remarkable indeed - Wagner, Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,",

          "I listened to Bach\u2019s music played in his church on his organ. For me, that was magical. The a choir stood at the altar and sang. Again, a moving moment. This is a must-see spot for those who are drawn to Bach, baroque music or organ music.",

          "Since the St Thomas Church was just across the street from our hotel, it was very easy to find and visit. However it was definitely on our list of things to see due to connection with Bach and Mendelssohn. The sense of history is stunning and the church is beautifully simple",

          "To be at this very special place - to meet the Man, and sit and reflect on his prodigious talent in the very place where he lived and worked, and his immense contribution to the world of Music - words fail me. Herr Bach - you are my hero.",

          "We visited Thomaskirche twice -- the first time there was a beautiful choir practice and the second time an organist was playing. The acoustics are amazing. We paid our respects at the Bach's grave. Photos are not permitted but it seems a lot of folks were snapping them.",
          "While St Thomas's isn't stunning to look at, the grave of Johann Sebasti\u00e1n Bach is located at the side of the altar. This church costs \u20ac220,000 per year to maintain and the organ sounds amazing. Each night at 7pm there is a Bach recital outside the church.",
          "Dropped in to see the inside, the outside is nice, and the inside would be great for photos, except that the day I was in there, they had the area up front from the middle of the church roped off. They have concerts on Friday and Sat. so perhaps that was why, however that meant",

          "This is a really nice church to wander around but whilst I was there, there was an organist practising for a recital so it made it extra special. A notice is on the entrance door to explain when there are practices, recitals, etc. going on in the church.",

          "JS Bach's church for which he did a LOT of composition - there is a statue of him outside. The first visit coincided with a party of US students who were giving a recital, so access was limited, but a visit later in the week allowed us to get round uninterrupted. Worth a visit.",
          "The church is cool inside, a welcome relief from the heatwave outside. It is beautifully kept and has that old church musty-woody smell which is lovely. We only spent a few minutes here but the atmosphere inside was tangible. I should imagine that listening to music and singing",
          "We ventured into this church one morning while walking around Leipzig. This is where Bach served as the choir master for the last 27 years of his life. A beautiful church in a colorful neighborhood. Definitely worth a look if you\u2019re in Leipzig.",

          "This attractive church holds the supposed remains of JS Bach, in front of the altar area. But for me the place to look is not there but up and to the rear. The loft is where Bach and his singers and orchestra created some of the most beautiful cantatas in the world. As a Bach",
          "This is also known as the \"Bach Church\" to tourists: J.S. Bach was the music director here from 1723-1750. The building is perfect in its simplicity: the bright white interior is light and surprisingly cheerful for a church. Because of the perfect acoustics the building has,",

          "Being a huge fan of J.S. Bach, this was probably the highlight of my visit to Leipzig. It's not that it's a particularly stunning church, but - as many readers will know - it's where Bach spent so much of his working life and where he premiered so many (now) well-known works.",
          "Take your time and spend 30 minutes inside the church. Listen to the orgel playing and look around all the windows in different colors. I feel small when I face what they so many years ago could achieve without power tools!",
          "Incredible standing in the church where Bach spent years working. I was fortunate that a pastor at the church was upstairs and allowed me to come up and see the organ Bach played. (It is still being played when performing Baroque music). Towards the front of the church there is",
          "We called in here twice, once as part of a private party listening to both organs being played, and once as general tourists. As well as being a living church it is, of course, famous for its connection with J S Bach. To be in the same building in which he worked and, indeed,",
          "What a great experience being in the church where J.S. Bach did so much of his work and music-making. We heard both organs being played which was wonderful. The acoustics were a perfect match! There is so much going on here that there is hardly a day that goes by without",

          "This is a beautiful Lutheran Gothic/Romanesque church with loads of history, but most famously the tomb of Bach. His grave is beneath the floor of the choir sanctuary. It is a very serene and peaceful place to visit. There are curiously two organs. The older one built 1884-1889",
          "Johann Sebastian Bach was such a brilliant composer and being in Leipzig meant I just had to visit this church, which was his workplace and where he is buried. The church itself is not so impressive, but you can see the tomb of Bach and on certain days you can attend music",

          "This great church in Leipzig has a statue of JS Bach outside and he is reported to be buried inside. Certainly there is a slab of stone near the altar bearing his name One of Leipzig's two great churches which is a must to see on a visit. The organ looks terrific and the",
          "We attended a one hour performance of the boys' choir plus orchestra on a lovely Saturday afternoon. It was a truly heavenly experience for only 2 Euros featuring some of the works of John Sebastian Bach, whose house and museum is just around the corner. This is such a lovely",
          "A very nice church, as European churches go, but of course the draw was Bach's tomb. A big metal slab in the ground, but still.... We did stumble upon Organ music being played live, that was a bonus. The museum is just across the street. If you have time to listen to all the",
          "One of our reasons for coming to Leipzig was to visit this church and final buriel place of the great composer and music director Bach. Around noon we sat in the pews and enjoyed listening to the organ music played for the enjoyment of visitors to the church. We found the church",

          "The Thomaskirche was very high on my list of reasons for visiting Leipzig. We attended a concert, featuring the famous choir, which was wonderful. JS Bach's presence, including his resting place, is felt throughout the church and the city.",
          "This was an outstanding experience for a couple of travelers passing through town. Johann Sebastian Bach was the Music Director here for 27 years. So of course, we heard music from Bach played on the organ. The boys choir did an outstanding job. They even threw in an orchestra",
          "Our primary reason for visiting Leipzig on a Friday was that the Thomaskirche has a 6 p.m. Vespers service during which the famous boys' choir sings a number of motets, many of them with a direct connection to the church's history. None of them was by Bach, but the organ prelude",
          "Nice Church. Has a nice presentation and looks good. was there for a quick walk through. not a place to spent a lot of time",

          "We came here on a Reformation tour. I did not know Bach was such an admirer of Luther. Check out the plaque in the back of the church music leaders. A Bach served here for 4 generations and 150 years, just a little pressure on the current music leader!",
          "What a lovely church! Be sure to note the ceiling. They like it so much, they put it on a pin. Bach is buried in front of the altar, although this is not the first place he was buried. Expect crowds. Roam through the church and you'll find a plaque in German about Luther. There",
          "This church has 2 organs, one located to the side, the other at the back. It has undergone restoration& has a beautiful vaulted ceiling. Interestingly after the eastern portico was renovated it was named the Mendelssohn Portico honouring the Jewish composer whose memorial was",
          "If you can visit when they have organ music, it is absolutely wonderful. I was here months ago and unfortunately missed the Bach concert they were holding. A very pretty church and a must if you are in Leipzig.",
          "We managed to attend one of the many concerts held in churches in Leipzig. It was breath-taking to hear Bach's music in the church for which he wrote it. He is buried near the altar which attends yet another dimension to your visit. The gift-shop is a bit dear, but has a good",
          "Of course, Mendelssohn played a role too, and there is Martin Luther, but I came for Bach. I had to stay and look at his tomb for a while... And yes, it is a great church to look and explore. The location is excellent, too. Right in the centre and with the Bach museum outside",
          "St Thomas Church is a beautiful place of worship, music and history. Although the Church has gone through many changes over the years it is still steeped in history and if you venture into the sacristy you will also see a display of musical instruments from the Baroque period.",

          "We missed our walking tour, so we decided to see the church where JS Bach worked and the museum dedicated to him and his family. What a beautiful and fascinating place. The museum was easy to navigate with audio-tour ipods. Quite a nice collection. The church was beautiful",
          "This church is a must see for any classical music lover. Bach is buried in the church and to stand near his grave was an inspiring experience. This is the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, and many visitors will view this church during 2017.",
          "We were here on a Sunday so our group was able to attend a service. The church was beautiful and the service was impressive, but too long for my taste. The music was inspiring. The service was two hours long! Most people, including me, left toward the end before communion.",
          "The Chorus of Westerly, Rhode Island went on tour and sang at the high mass on Sunday July 9, 2017 while the boy's choir was engaged elsewhere. The group of 110 singers, sang portions of Bach's B minor mass during the service. The church is not only beautiful it has great",
          "This wonderful church is historic and worth seeing without the history attached to it as Bach's church and the fact that it contains his tomb. (His house is just across the street from the entrance door.) Inside the ceiling is unique. I believe they ask a donation but no",
          "If you are a JS Bach fan, this is the place for you! He is buried in the Chancel and there is a large statue outside for the photographs. Try and get to a concert - fabulous!",
          "We went for the Bach Festival this June and it was so fabulous that we're going to go again next June 2018! The concerts in this venue were so special because we knew J.S. Bach himself had been there conducting, teaching and playing the organ. There is a replica of the organ",
          "The most important, really beautiful Gothic church in town, where J.S. Bach performed regularly. Beautifully renovated, with the colors in the ceiling just brilliant. Almost too new for my taste. Great vault ceiling. Windows have images of Bach and Luther. If you can catch a",
          "A statute of Bach is at the side of the church and inside is his final resting place. He was cantor there from 1723 until his death in 1750. St Thomas Boys Choir has been in existence since 1212. Martin Luther preached there on Pentecost Sunday in 1539. The church has 2 organs",
          "This is (obviously) a must see for any Bach fan. The church where he spent so much time as cantor and also where he is buried. It is free to visit, although I believe there is a charge when concerts are happening. I wasn't able to catch a concert, but based on the organ",
          "Surprising visit to Bach's grave and a little exhibition. Bach story nicely displayed and described. There are concerts there almost everyday. Must see.",
          "Beautiful interior - we were there to attend a concert but it was a bit of a Gottesdienst (service) with a sermon, hymn by Martin Luther and prayers including the Lord's Prayer in German - acoustics very good, and enjoyed the Bach pieces played by an accomplished organist. A",
          "Next door to the Bach Museum, you can't miss the church. When my father and I visited, someone was playing Bach on the organ. The sound filled the church and it was truly a magical moment.",
          "This is J.S. Bach's home church, and twice a week they do a musical service featuring Bach (and others) with orchestra and choir. And it's only 2 Euros! Just beautiful to sit in that historic church and hear the fantastic choir perform some of Bach's best.",
          "The church of St Thomas is well worth a look. Revered particularly as the workplace- and burial site, of the monumental JSBach. Free entry, and someone was even playing (one of) the organs.",

          "I visited this wonderful church and could learn a lot about all the great musicians working here. Also about the latest stars of the Thomaner choir ! If you have the chance to take the tower tour it is highly recommended as you hear further information and have a great view over",
          "2 organs, plenty of recitals and you don't always have to book but just turn up in good time. The Thomaner Boys Choir have holidays from time to time but a local girls choir took over when we were there, and they were very good. Closed for an hour in the afternoon I believe, but",
          "This is the famous church, where Johan Sebastian Bach was buried. The tomb was inside the church near to the altar. Overall, the architecture and decorations of the church was rather simple. I was not able to catch the St Thomas boys' choir perform. It is known to be one",
          "Easter 2017 - and we had Holy Communion by the tomb of Johan Sebastian Bach - I'll never forget this!",
          "The church by itself was a let down. However, it did contain Bach's grave and there was a lady playing the organ in the church. There is stained glass artwork on one side of the church. If I was to do it again, I would try and attend a concert here.",
          "Thechoir of this church is world- renowned and can be heard at concerts and most Sunday morning services. Famous as the church where J S Bach was cantor.",
          "This is a very important church with historical significance related to the fall of the Berlin Wall, as it is where the peaceful protest against it started in 1989. Unfortunately if you come here as a tourist without knowing much about it, you will probably miss most of it as",
          "Sparse, clean church with excellent choir and organ with a great sense of history. We attended a concert of JS Bach's ST John Passion - excellent!",
          "If Leipzig is the holy city of German music, Thomaskirche is its shrine (sorry, Gewandhaus #3). There are more ornate, visually, and historically interesting churches throughout Europe and, indeed, the rest of the world, but if you are a musician invested in Bach (I am an",
          "A nice church,where Bach lead the Thomaner chorus many years ago,also where he's resting now. Nice and you gotta listen to a performance!",
          "The church is simple but with some highlights! There was a marble \"altarpiece\", hope is the right word, that took all my attention as well the roof. Sebastian Bach is buried there and the history is very interesting! A friend of mine, who is a musician, was SO happy to be there",
          "The church, situated in the city center, is beautiful. I enjoyed the museum and the giftshop,too. It\u00b4s the burial place of Johann Sebastian Bach, so a must see for every Bach music lover.",
          "This was the second time I visited it with the first time when it was communist East Germany so it was nice to visit it and see how much the area and church as changed over the years. It was the first time for my wife visiting it and we both thoroughly enjoyed our self guided",
          "The Thomas Church Boys Choir's Conserts on Friday and Saturday afternoon / evenings is a once in a lifetime experience.",
          "We were lucky enough to be able to get seats for this wonderful performance. Thank you. The Bach museum is across the road from the church and we were helped by very pleasant and helpful staff at the museum.",
          "Beautiful and well kept church. We were visiting leipzig with a project choir. And we were given th opportunity to sing a couple of Bach's chorales while gathered around the tombstone. Thrilling at least.",
          "After having read the Bach biography by John Eliot Gardner, the Thomas Kirche is a must see. It is as if the Leipzig cantates are coming alive. Especially when you're fortunate to also attend a concert (on Friday and/or Saturday). You should combine it with a visit to the Bach",
          "Wonderful church in architecture and for its' musical history. If you're a music lover this is a 'mecca' for Bach fans and other great musicians of that time period.",
          "Visited this church where JS Bach is buried and where Martin Luther preached. Beautiful architecture and well maintained.",
          "A wonderful urban Gothic hall church very well restored. Although not initially buried here, JS Bach's remains are now in the choir of the church in which he was choirmaster for over 20 years.",
          "Such a beautiful and historical church that I had the great privilege of playing in a few times too. Incredible that the great J.S. Bach was buried there!",
          "This cathedral is lovely in its own right, but what makes it special is the fact J.S. Bach directed and composed worship music there for so long. His grave is positioned in the center of the chancel, appropriately adorned with fresh flowers and pilgrims who stare in quiet awe",
          "As the church where J. S. Bach was musical director from 1723 - 1750 and the place where his mortal remains are interred, this is a must see for classical music lovers.",
          "This is the church, where J.S. Bach was the Music Director from 1723 - 1750. It is very impressive, all the more so, when you think about all of the music that Bach composed and first played on Sunday's here. There has been a church here since the 12th Century. Exterior and",
          "Went to hear the Christmas Oratorio in Bach's church. The place is like a temple to Bach, who was its cantor for many years until his death in 1750. It is a typical church, but with Bach buried where the alter usually is, it is anything but typical. I did not like the",
          "A concert at St. Thomas Church with boy's choir, full orchestra, organs and choir is heaven on earth. Choose a seat under the balcony with the sound circling in the air over your head and no visual distractions. Of course, a stop at Bach's tomb and the small museum is",

          "Went to hear the Choir one night! awesome experience! they sang veru nice and the church its very nice as well",
          "We visited Thomas kirche in October 2016 - to pay a visit to the church that was the home of JS Bach as cantor from 1723 - 1750. His grave is located in the church - altar section but if you read the history of the church his remains were only interred in the church in 1950",
          "The church is beautiful and there is no cost for entry. There is a small book store for those wishing to learn more about Martin Luther and the Boys choir. Concert schedules are also available",
          "The Thomaskirche is something of a shrine for lovers of classical music, located centrally in Leipzig just across from the market. The statue of Bach outside the main door makes it clear why this is important, for the composer not only worked at the church but his remains are",

          "Most people will visit this church, not only for its architectural merits, but also because of its historical association with J.S Bach. It is, therefore, self recommending. I am writing this revue to draw to your attention that on Friday and Saturday afternoons there is a",
          "This is a very old church in the historic centre of Leipzig, widely famous for the fact that Bach was working in it for many years, and Bach's tomb is in the church. Very close to it is Bach's museum, and many places around the church have the name of Bach in their namings. The",
          "The home of the famous boys choir (110 boys in the school). A beautiful church with two organs, and Bachs tombstone. The sign insider says that there isn't a steady congregation, and it relies on music to give the visitors Gods message.",
          "You know the famous Johan Sebastian Bach?! It's his church, he is buried here! When you're in leipzig down town, you should go here and make some pictures. Beautiful church and statue outside...",
          "From the outside this doesn't appear to be the large parish church that it is. It is clearly trying to balance its heritage and its ongoing life as a vibrant place of worship. It is thrilling to have seen where JS Bach's tomb has been related to and the restored Bach organ. A",
          "It was a dream come true to visit this church - where Martin Luther had preached and Bach had been for 27 years. Overwhelming to consider. The Bach organ sounded magnificent. The church was bigger than I expected, and more beautiful, and more a place of worship than touristy.",
          "Not as dominant or architecturally interesting as the Altes Rathaus, its association with Bach and the Thomanerchor though means this is clearly the most important building in the great City of Leipzig. Musicians often play Bach outside, there are occasional concerts inside and",
          "Johann Sebastian Bach was a cantor here and is buried at this church. What really blows my mind is the roof on the church appears to be a 10/12 or even 11/12 pitch which is incredibly steep. Constructing a roof like that or even repairing it is a dangerous operation for workers.",
          "A beautiful old church with a strong connection to Johann Sebastian Bach. Beautiful interiors with an amazing altar. Bach's burial plot is inside the church.",
          "Try to visit the accompanying school. Bach taught and worked in the church for almost 30 years. They have celebrated over 800 years. Good luck and enjoy.",
          "A beautifully renovated church which still shows its strong connections with Bach. The decor is simple but very striking and much has been done to incorporate elements of the church that survived the war. It really is a must see when in Leipzig.",
          "We visited this church to enjoy the 'Motette'. But after having paid the entry fee (only \u20ac2, fortunately), the program revealed there were no Motets at all. We were more or less trapped into a Lutherian service, complete with sermon and prayer. Some people walked off after",
          "We attended a Bach concert at this church organised by the Weimarer Bachkantaten-Akademie - part of an international summer school run by Helmuth Rilling. Really excellent music. Well done to everybody concerned!",
          "Having played classical piano, I wanted to see where J.S. Bach was buried. This is also the church where he was the musical director. It is pretty, but not nearly as ornate as some of the Baroque churches in the south part of Germany. Also charming was the fact that a trio",
          "If you are a lover of the music of Bach, this is the place to go. His remains are in the nave of the church. There are numerous opportunities I hear the music of Bach in the context of liturgical services. Fridays are at Nicholaikirche, a 5 minute walk. Saturday is at",
          "Quiet, bright and peaceful. A place to relax, if you will, and get in touch with a greater spirit, if you believe. Architecture outside is astonishing; inside, not much (it seemed very modern and renewed to me). Worth the visit inside because of J.S. Bach's tomb, if you're",

          "During my 3-day visit in Leipzig, I visited this place almost 4 times!! My main reason of visiting this church was because of Bach's final resting place, and if you are interested about history then here we go: Bach and Anna Magdelina both were buried in St John's Church",
          "Bach was here! Enough said. lol Not only did he work here and live here, but he remains here to this day. His body is buried under the church. It is free and there are fascinating history facts about the church on the wall just inside the door of the church. Martin Luther and",
          "Bach is the beginning and end of music (Reger), and he's right. This is not just a beautiful church, but the place where Bach was active. We experienced a service on Sunday (I am not a Christian), and it was impressive, as I think would have happened when Bach was in charge.",
          "If you love Bach you must go to Thomaskirche! It is large, beautiful, has great acoustics. We heard the opeing concert of the Bach Festival 2016 there.",

          "Worth a visit. Bach worked here and his remains are here. There is a small museum which had music and instruments when we visited. Also lovely to hear a choir perform if possible.",
          "A typical Lutheran church (not a bad thing, just nothing special). It's only claim for fame is to be the place where J. S. Bach worked for almost 30 years and his remains were transferred here after renovation. If you lucky to be there for a concert or practice, the acoustic is",
          "The Thomas Kirche is quite a special place, with the remains of Johan Sebastian Bach inside. We were very lucky that the Thomaner Chor were rehearsing for a performance, magical to listen to. Be aware that booking a ticket for a concert there, might mean that you won't actually",
          "Bach was the Choirmaster here for many years. There are several musical instruments on display but has a feeling of being quite austere. In fact a typical Lutheran Church. We did here a little bit from the Organ and the sound was beautiful.",
          "This 800 year old church is famous for being the employer of Johann Sebastian Bach for the last 27 years of his life. So many of his great organ and vocal works were first performed in this mostly austere but also beautiful church. If you are in Leipzig on at 3pm on a Saturday",
          "Historically, one of the most significant spots in Leipzig and in Saxony in general, as this is a prime Bach site (buried here), the church where he was choirmaster for 27 years of the Thomas Choir, originally formed in the 1200's! Interesting architecture--also try to attend",

          "Went to the church during the Bach Fest but could not get any tickets for the opening concert. You need to book with the Bach Society months in advance for tickets.",
          "This church is not large but is a pleasure to visit and because of its connections with Bach is much visited. It is situated opposite the Bach Museum, with its small caf\u00e9 next to it and a gift shop next to the church. Before you enter, you will find a life-size statue of Bach",
          "Lovely church. It was free to enter although it seems on some days there is a fee of 1 euro. The architecture inside ans outside is beautiful. Worth a visit. Also there are a few very old string instruments inside which if you are a classical music lover are worth seeing.",
          "Thomskirche feels alive and not because it is the leading tourist attraction in Leipzig. It is also very well cared for. It is quite accessible for an old building, with a walk-in, roll-in entrance. But mainly it feels alive because it is a working Lutheran church with an active",
          "This church survived the war intact, and one presumes that what you see is pretty much what Bach would have seen every day for the 27 years that he toiled here. We attended a free concert which was packed (Leipziggers like a bargain) so we were glad we got there early. Well",
          "Afternoon concert in the austere but refined surroundings of the Thomaskirche. Beautiful music sung and played with great refinement. An integral part of a short religious service which reminds us why the music was made and the true nature of the venue. Bach's tomb in the",

          "...obviously anything connected to Bach should be a major site /shrine to musical history and evolution. Excellent information, in English and German. Obviously a must visit for those interested in why Leipzig is this powerhouse of culture",
          "Our bus stopped opposite and we used the pay toilets outside below the church. The interior is beautiful in an understated protestant way. The organ / loft is amazing. Just wish I could have heard a concert.",
          "If you are in Leipzig on Saturday do not miss the Mottet in this church at 3pm. It is a religious service, with sermon and prayer (all in German), but centred around the music of Bach and his contemporaries sung by a first class choir and organist. To hear this music used in",

          "It's a beautiful building in its own way, and the interior is beautiful too (even if the pews are hard). Go there for the love of Bach. Put money, lots of it, in the offertory. This is a memorial as well as a functioning church, but the upkeep is costly.",
          "Came here because pf Bach and the choir. It's a typical and beautiful church. Luckily I could joined the Easter worship and heard the amazing choir. Worth to visit!",

          "We went to a beautiful concert here, where we heard a choir and the reconstruction of Bach's organ. Afterwards we got to see Bach's grave, and left some flowers. The church itself may not be worth it if you are not there for Bach's grave.",
          "Exquisite church where JS Bach was cantor for over 20 years. Amazing church in city center. You can feel the musical electricity still in the city. There was a wedding the day we went but there was an organ concert that night. Every Saturday at 3pm they performed an organ",
          "St. Thomas Church is an absolute must visit if you love Bach. This is one of the two churches Bach worked in during his tenure in Leipzig. Of course much of it has been rebuilt but still it is a wonderful and historic spot. Right across the way is the amazing Bach museum.",

          "Thomaskirche is one of the most interesting in Leipzig and has a firm connection with J S Bach who was organist here for a time. This is of course Bach country and so has many connections with the city. The church is beautifully maintained and is attractively decorated. It has",
          "It was awesome being able to see where this musical genius was laid to rest. It is free to get into the church and centrally located. Make sure to check out the stained-glass window with Bach's image in the center of it as you walk up to his tomb. It is located on the right hand",
          "Bach's associations are critical here but its a fine church with a long history. Very central and a key site to visit when walking around Leipzig",

          "J.S. Bach's Church in Leipzig is the only location where I observed parties of foreign tourists being led round and I wondered why the tourist firms bother as there is not much to see. True, there is Bach's grave in the chancel but the chancel is roped off so you cannot approach",
          "Gorgeous church with wonderful artifacts and an incredible musical heritage. It's very popular, was busy on a mid-week afternoon with tours, and is very well kept.",
          "The church itself is beautifully restored, very plain in white, red and grey. But the main reason to visit is in memory of J.S. Bach and his decades of service as Cantor there. After several moves, his remains found their final resting place in front of the altar and any lover",
          "St Thomas's church is beautiful - it is the burial place of Johann Sebastian Bach, although Bach was not originally buried there. His remains were exhumed from their original burial place and there is a simple tomb marked in the floor near the alter where he is now laid to",
          "i went to Leipzig only to go to Thomaskirche - Bach's church. Friday afternoon is weekly rehearsal time - two hours of sheer musical delight to the ear and to the heart. The rehearsal included the Boy's Choir, orchestra and soloists. Friday evening was a performance with the",

Bach has always captivated me, not principally",

          "It is simple and it is small and you would not remember it if Johan Sebastian Bach was not reburried here (that is: if it really is Bach). Nice for a short stop if you are there",
          "After visiting St. Nicholas Church earlier, St. Thomas Church was 'very plain' in comparison. Worth popping in for a look if walking past.",
          "Superb acoustic for classical concert in this church where Bach studied and performed few of his pieces. I was able to attend the finale of summer Bach concert in Thomaskirche and I must say it was indeed a splendid event. Bach \"cantata\" was executed brilliantly and the acoustic",
          "As a church there is not much to see since it's a pretty simple church! BUT!!! This is the church that J.S.Bach worked as an organist and had many more duties. He is also burried in there! In there you can see 2 church organs and an exposition of musical instruments and sheets!",

          "This is a truly beautiful church. This is the second time I have visited the church. The organist was practicing with a soloist and the sound was just wonderful. Also, Joh. Seb. Bach. Is buried there. Another church of interest if in Leipzig is the Nikolaikirche.",

          "Bachs remains were interred here in 1949 having been shifted from their original burial site. Lovely simple gravestone in front of the alter. The church is simple, however its association with Bach as Choir Master and the St Thomas Choir remains as a draw card. If you are not",
          "A 'must see; in Leipzig if you are interested in music. This is the home of Bach, Martin Luther and the famous St Thomas Boys Choir. Sadly the choir was not performing, this being the summer recess However we were able to here an accomplished organist from Boston play Bach",
          "Free to enter, nice place to sit for a while and enjoy the ambience and quiet. Beautiful altar area is roped off from the public due to Bach's grave/tombstone. And of course there ar the organs! They do have several Bach concerts, choir performances, each year but we were not at",

          "We stopped specifically in Leipzig to see this church and the statue of Bach outside and we were not disappointed. It is only 1 Euro for a guided tour. We were glad we took a detour from our travels and stopped here since it was worth the visit. I wish we had time to hear a",
          "We went in here several times in our 3 day stay, once for a concert to mark Bach's 265th anniversary of his death. We'd booked the tickets online before we came which was just as well as only limited view seats available. On our fist visit they were setting up for the concert so",

          "I didn't plan anything for Leipzig so when I ran across this church I realized it was one of the main attractions of Leipzig; and justifiably so. It isn't just the beauty of the church (I have seen much more beautiful ones) but rather the religious, musical, and political",
          "This is the church where Johann Sebastian Bach is buried. I was privileged to attend a mass of Bach's in this church, which made the experience almost surreal. Great visit for the church-history student.",
          "Home of the St. Thomas Boys Choir and a place of musical creativity; it is also the final resting place of the famous St. Thomas Cantor, Johann Sebastian Bach. Organ concerts are held regularly",
          "The look of this church is not very impressive, but it is well known by Johann Sebastian Bach who had worked for several years in this church and he was also buried here. When we entered into the church we could here the organs playing some Bach's works and the chorus singing",

          "My husband and I were in Leipzig for one day, and we made it our goal to see a concert at this famous church. Being musicians, we were awed by the importance of this church in the life of JS Bach, but we also enjoyed the architecture and design of the church itself. We",
          "We travelled from Australia and went to five concerts at various venues in Leipzig during the Bach Festival (Bachfest) in June 2015. One of the venues was this church. I feel that I must tell non-Europeans about what they can expect. You will be unlikely to catch more than a",

          "Inside the church is very beautiful and amazing. I took part in motets on Friday and Saturday. I was very moved by the voices of boys and girls. I am afraid that I was not able to go to the concert here, but I want to go in the future. You can know the day of the concerts on the",
          "This was the goal of a lifetime of loving J. S. Bach's music. Just great being there. Climbing the tower was also terrific. I am grateful to have been in this church and to have heard a concert of Bach's cantatas. Thrill of a lifetime!",
          "This is a beautiful church, best known for being the church where Bach worked during his tenure in Leipzig. We attended an evening service there, which was very moving since we got to hear the organ (though not original) and imagine how it might have sounded in Bach's time.",
          "The atmosphere in the Thomaskirche is wonderful. We attended an evening service here in June which was very moving. We received a very warm welcome and whilst waiting for the service to commence we took in the loveliness yet simplicity of the building. Unfortunately we could not",
          "It is a very pretty church and the history is great because it is where Bach spent his time teaching Latin and singing. I really enjoyed it",

          "The church is painted in soft colors and this makes the interior very cosy. At 5 pm there was a concert for 2\u20ac. It was a nice program. They start selling the tickets at 4.30 pm just inside the church. It was a nice experience.",

          "Just in front of the church you see the statue of Johan Sebastien Bach. In the church on the left hand side you see the organ of Bach and just in front of it on the right hand side there is his portrait in the glass work, the current organ used in the church is over the west",

          "Performed various JS Bach's music on and off for many years and it's a wonderful moment coming to the place where he produced and performed some of his music. Compared to the nearby Nikolaikirche (where St John Passion was premiered) - the modest nature of the interior somehow",
          "This is the Church closely associated with Bach, and with the St Thomas's singers, dating both from the 13thC. Take a look at the outside with one of the steepest gabled roofs in Germany. Having had your photo taken by Bach's statue you can then see the tomb inside the church",

          "We went for a motette (concert plus sermon) on Saturday afternoon. The place was very crowded - I guess many tourists used the chance to hear some of the Gewandhaus Orchester and Thomaner choir singers. We were not sure what to expect, but the sermon was very short (in German).",

          "We were there for the Bach Festival. The music was performed above the main seating area and we couldn't see the musicians but the sound was excellent. Seats were reasonably comfortable.",
          "Whether you're a fan of Johann Sebastian Bach or not, you should definitely duck in to this small but pretty church. If you're lucky like we were you might get to hear excerpts of Bach music being played on the church organs which gave me goosebumps and made us sit down and",
          "I had the pleasure to attend a Sunday evening service in the St. Thomas Church. The organ music was beautiful and the service was quite moving. In addition, the church is lovely. There are some very unusual stained glass windows, look for one with Bach in the center and another",
          "Worth a visit to understand the history behind classical music and its advocates through the ages (from about 1100 AD)!",
          "This church used to use as a music academy when Bach was teaching students. They served also as dormitory for the students. It is located just opposite side of Bach museum, better to visit Bach Museum together. Because you can see some stories of the church in Bach museum, it is",
          "For obvious reasons (J S Bach's connections) the church is a popular tourist venue so it was quite busy when we visited. This makes it tricky to enjoy any kind of contemplative or meditative atmosphere - probably better to attend a concert or service for this. Nevertheless, it",
          "Went as tourists and for a service - low key displays and signage. Helpful people. Traditional service with printed words and music; which was of high standard.",
          "Beautiful church with a nice giftshop. Attended the Sunday concert by the Thomasanchor, which was amazing.",
          "Lovely church with Bach's burial place. Peaceful although lots of tourists. Coffee shops around church worth a visit for their cakes!",
          "The church is nice enough, not as impressive as other churches I've visited however the draw card here is the relationship of the church with Bach. Just inside the church to the right of the foyer, is a small room with an exhibition of Bach items as they relate to the church.",
          "A fairly spartan church with an amazing musical history. Bach and Mendelssohn spent significant periods of time here and their impact resonates to this day.",
          "If one loves classical music, this church is a must-go attraction. If you are luck enough to be able to listen to choir in the church, you will find how amazing, how well the sound system of the church. Just being depressed by not being able to join any classical music concert",
          "Try to visit this church on a Saturday. At 15 hrs choir, solists and orchestra present a string of Bach cantatas etc. Very impressive! The entrance fee is a mere EUR 2, but do arrive early as it tends to be most crowded.",
          "It just had JS Bach all over it. The organ, his tomb and the statues out front of Bach and his great re-discoverer, Mendelssohn. Try and catch the Thomanerchor if you can. I did twice, and it's just vital to hear them as Bach himself may have done.",
          "Quite something being a classical music lover, to be in the church where Bach worked for many years and is indeed buried there.",
          "I recommend you visit the church where J.S. Bach (1685\u201350) wrote many masterpieces. A choir director until his death in 1750 many instruments van be seen in a side room along with a copy of the Luther bible. Even Mozart visited in 1789. In 1843 there was a dedication of",
          "I went to the Matthews passion performance on Good friday. I still had a look round before the concert, and it is simply amazing. The area which contains Bach`s grave cannot be entered, however it is clearly noticeable due to the presence of fresh, beautiful flowers. There is an",

          "Ah, to visit the church where Bach (1685\u201350) composed so many masterpieces. He was choir director from 1723 until his death in 1750. Even Mozart was there in 1789. 1843 dedication of the Bach Memorial; built under Mendelssohn\u2019s direction. One may pay homage to Bach at his",
          "We attended a concert of Gewandehaus Orchester and Thomaskirche boy\u00b4s choir. It was amazing and so exciting to see and hear that music in Bach\u00b4s Church. Absolutey recomend a visit! There are so many charming bars and restaurants nearby. Bach\u00b4s Museum is across the street.",
          "Right out of the centre of Leipzig and difficult to miss right off the shopping street. Well worth a visit!",
          "As a musician, this church holds special meaning for me. Listening to a Bach Cantata in the church where Bach worked and was laid to rest was a deeply meaningful experience. I highly recommend visiting if you get the chance.",
          "An easy must see while in Leipzig, the old school designs and character would make you appreciate the building styles back in the day. A popular spot for tourist, its a hit or miss on whether you can view whole interior due to planned events. There are parts that are roped off",
          "A wonderful church which is in the typical baroque style. In addition to the regularly services, there are two weekly services that include a Bach Cantata or a Motet. These are worth attending, especially if you love to hear his music. Hidden in an anti-room by the entrance is a",
          "The church where Bach's remains lay. Bach was the cantor in this church. It has great history. Mozart play the organ in this church too. A nice walk from the train station.",
          "After the disappointment of listening to a service standing at the back of the church and not being able to hear much, it was doubly disappointing not be able to get a closer look at the altar (which is said to be extremely beautiful) because of the crush of tourists in front of",
          "Bach's home church until his death, the Thomaskirche was the highlight of my trip to Germany. My choir sang an afternoon concert surrounding Bach's grave at the front of the church and then performed in service on Sunday. The only downside for the non-performing tourist is that",
          "Visited while staying in leipzig , enjoyed a recital while we were there ,it was a very moving experience .",
          "Go just to bask in the atmosphere, and see what the Master saw! There's a small exhibit with musical instruments. What I didn't like: Bach's grave is inside, but roped off, so you can't stand and have a contemplative moment with him.",
          "The church is not only beautiful, but has also wonderful motets and concerts. A visit is extraordinarily important if you are interested in the history of music, since Bach was a Kapellmeister there. The motets happens on Fridays and Saturdays and you should arrive at least 30",
          "We both love Bach's music so were delighted to find that this church is where he was choirmaster and where he is buried. The church has an interesting little museum inside, with some of the musical instruments and sheet music. It is a large and rather lovely church, and concerts",
          "St. Thomas Church is an outstanding religious center. However, it is best know for its tradition of music. Both Bach and Mendelssohn were active in the musical life of the City of Leipzig and were part of the regular life of this church. J.S. Bach is buried in the nave. If",
          "Went to visit this church after having been to the beautiful Nikolai Church and only because we know about the famous Choir. Should have gone to one of the choir concerts instead, as this church is not very remarkable.",
          "Having watched a program on TV about this choir this was our main aim in Leipzig. Unfortunately they had started their summer holiday during our stay, but we went to an evening service. Then a choir from London was singing, which gave us a good indication of the acoustics. The",
          "This is the church where Johann Sebastian Bach spent his last 28 years. He trained and directed the choir, played the organ and directed the orchestra. The church dates back to the 12th Century. Martin Luther preached here in 1539. Highly recommend a visit to this church and",
          "Interesting old church, but not overly embellished. For \u20ac2 (or more if you're generous) I caught a 3PM Saturday performance of the Thomanenchor (world renown St. Thomas Boy's Choir). Lovely organ, small orchestra, and boys choir was a simply perfect way to sit and relax for an",
          "Our visit was special as organist was practicing. The church is spare, but very interesting. it is in beautiful small square. An easy rewarding visit.",
          "For lovers of Bach this is a very special place. To stand by his tomb, on which a rose is placed every day, was very special. Sadly our visit did not coincide with any live music, but this did not detract from our visit.",
          "I was lucky enough to visit and hear the famous choir on my recent trip. You can feel the vibe that this is a special place. Bach is up front on the alter and the place is marked with flowers and a plaque. There is a mini museum inside. Outside there is statue of Bach.",
          "J.S. Bach was organist here for almost thirty years and his spirit still pervades this beautiful church. Bach's grave-stone lies before the high altar and his organ (on the right-hand side) is graced with a medallion of his image. Unfortunately the boy's choir was not in",
          "Enjoyed Organ recital and service here, both including Bach. Service was friendly and Anglicans can cope, despite German language. Acoustics are wonderful so ensure you attend when you can here Bach's music in the place it was created for.",

          "We came to a motet concert here. The music was top quality of course, but what was surprising to me who has heard the boys in Westminster Abbey and Kings College Cambridge singing, was the fact that music you normally would hear sung by an adult soprano soloist was sung by boys",
          "If you are in Leipzig only an hour, don't miss this. Look it up on the web before you go because they have hundreds of musical performances each year. This is J.S. Bach's church and the boy's choir is the choir he taught(well, not the same kids!). I was there for",
          "This is the church in which Bach played and organised concerts for his last 27 years. It has his tomb and a nice Bach window and the Bach Monument outside. People go because of Bach connection, but this is an impressive church and well worth a wander around.",
          "The Church that has Bach's tomp inside, as a great honour to the great composer, who was a choirmaster there..The church is small but very impressive and in my opinion is a Must for Leipzig's visitors. Also inside the church there is a small, but interesting museum, kept Bachs",
          "The greatest composer who ever lived was organist, cantor and much more here. The church is lovely with its one wall of plain glass and the opposite one with a series of stainglass windows as well as behind the altar. If you are lucky enough to be there when there is an organ",
          "It is definitely an interesting place to see during your visit to Leipzig. I was surprised to see the actual resting place of classical composer Johann Bach inside the church. There was a small exhibit of musical instruments and some of Bach's work on display. It's worth seeing.",
          "The Bach \"Motettes\" are on Fridays and Saturdays. Even in January the Saturday event was jammed! The church is jammed with pews in every nook and cranny. The actual choir is in that most of us would know as the \"choir loft\" at the back of the church. So if you can get there",

With a population of 600,000 inhabitants as of 2019 (1.1 million residents in the larger urban zone), it is Germany's eighth most populous city as well as the second most populous city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin. Together with Halle (Saale), the largest city of the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt, the city forms the polycentric conurbation of Leipzig-Halle. Between the two cities (in Schkeuditz) lies Leipzig/Halle International Airport.\nLeipzig is located about 160 kilometres (99 mi) southwest of Berlin in the Leipzig Bay, which constitutes the southernmost part of the North German Plain, at the confluence of the White Elster River (progression: Saale\u2192 Elbe\u2192 North Sea) and two of its tributaries: the Plei\u00dfe and the Parthe. The name of the city as well as the names of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.\nLeipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire. The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes. Leipzig was once one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing. After the  Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East German terms, but its cultural and economic importance declined. Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy, which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry, severe unemployment, and urban blight. Starting around 2000, however, decline was first arrested and then reversed. Leipzig has undergone significant change with the restoration of major historical buildings, the demolition of derelict properties of little historical value, and the development of new industries and a modern transport infrastructure.Leipzig today is an economic centre, the most livable city in Germany, according to the GfK marketing research institution and has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, according to HWWI and Berenberg Bank. The city is one of two seats of the German National Library (together with Frankfurt), as well as the seat of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and ranks first in Germany and second in Europe according to Anthony Sheridan. Since the opening of the Leipzig City Tunnel in 2013, Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system. Leipzig is currently listed as a Gamma World City, Germany's \"Boomtown\" and as the European City of the Year 2019.Leipzig has long been a major centre for music, both classical as well as modern \"dark alternative music\" or darkwave genres. The Oper Leipzig is one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany. Leipzig is also home to the University of Music and Theatre \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\". It was during a stay in this city that Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem \"Ode to Joy\". The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Johann Sebastian Bach is one among many major composers who lived and worked in Leipzig.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Name ===\n\nThe name Leipzig is derived from the Slavic word Lipsk, which means \"settlement where the linden trees (British English: lime trees; U.S. English: basswood trees) stand\". An older spelling of the name in English is Leipsic. The Latin name Lipsia was also used. The name is cognate with Lipetsk (\u041b\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043a) in Russia and Liep\u0101ja in Latvia.\n\nIn 1937 the Nazi government officially renamed the city Reichsmessestadt Leipzig (Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig).Since 1989 Leipzig has been informally dubbed \"Hero City\" (Heldenstadt), in recognition of the role that the Monday demonstrations there played in the fall of the East German regime \u2013 the name alludes to the honorary title awarded in the former Soviet Union to certain cities that played a key role in the victory of the Allies during the Second World War. The common usage of this nickname for Leipzig up until the present is reflected, for example, in the name of a blog for local arts and culture, Heldenstadt.de.More recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\", \"Hypezig\" or \"The better Berlin\" for being celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for the vital lifestyle and creative scene with many startups.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nLeipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as urbs Libzi (Chronikon VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by Otto the Rich. Leipzig Trade Fair, started in the Middle Ages, has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world.\nThere are records of commercial fishing operations on the river Plei\u00dfe in Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the Margrave Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.There were a number of monasteries in and around the city, including a Franciscan monastery after which the Barfu\u00dfg\u00e4\u00dfchen (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks (Jacobskirche, destroyed in 1544) near the present day Ranst\u00e4dter Steinweg (the old Via Regia).\nThe foundation of the University of Leipzig in 1409 initiated the city's development into a centre of German law and the publishing industry, and towards being the location of the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) and the German National Library (founded in 1912).\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, two battles took place in Breitenfeld, about 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) outside Leipzig city walls. The first Battle of Breitenfeld took place in 1631 and the second in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.\nOn 24 December 1701, an oil-fueled street lighting system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig between Napoleonic France and an allied coalition of Prussia, Russia, Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended Napoleon's presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on Elba. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.When it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the Royal Saxon State Railways and the western one for the Prussian state railways.\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German labor party, the General German Workers' Association (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein, ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge Gr\u00fcnderzeit areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei became the largest cotton mill company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Daily production surpassed 5 million kilograms of yarn.During the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to World War II. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.\nOn 22 May 1930, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was elected mayor of Leipzig. He was well known as an opponent of the Nazi regime. He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of Felix Mendelssohn. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue, one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. Goerdeler was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.\n\nSeveral thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.\nBeginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the Gemeinde, a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.Like all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to aryanisation. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenh\u00e4user, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.As with other cities in Europe during the Holocaust, the Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the Nuremberg Laws. However, due to the Leipzig Trade Fair and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures. Shortly before Kristallnacht, Polish Jews living in the city were expelled.On 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the \"Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig\". In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in Zionism through Jewish citizens. Many of these Zionists attempted to flee before deportations began. On 28 October 1938, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of Polish Jews from Leipzig to Poland.On 9 November 1938, as part of Kristallnacht, in Gottschedstrasse (German: Gottschedstra\u00dfe), now a popular dining and nightlife area in Leipzig, synagogues and businesses were set on fire. Only a couple of days later, on 11 November 1938, many Jews in the Leipzig area were deported to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. As World War II came to an end, much of Leipzig was destroyed. Following the war, the Communist Party of Germany (German: Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, KPD) provided aid for the reconstruction of the city.In 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported. On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors. According to records of the Theresienstadt deportation, only 53 Jews survived.Until late 1943, there was little threat of aerial bombings to the city. However, on the morning of 4 December 1943, the British Royal Air Force dropped over 1,000 tons of explosives, resulting in the death of nearly 1,000 civilians. This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, the storm was too overwhelming for them. Unlike its neighbouring city of Dresden, this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945. In April 1945 the SS Gruppehfuhrer/Mayor of Leipzig Bruno Erich Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter; the Deputy Mayor/Treasurer of Leipzig, Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter, and a Volkssturm Major Walter D\u00f6nicke committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\nThe United States turned the city over to the Red Army as it pulled back from the line of contact with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city.In the mid-20th century, the city's trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the Comecon Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which East Germany was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the Monument to the Battle of the Nations.\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in. Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.In October 1989, after prayers for peace at St. Nicholas Church, established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the Monday demonstrations started as the most prominent mass protest against the East German government. The reunification of Germany, however, was at first not good for Leipzig. The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city's speciality was, in terms of the advanced economy of  reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished. As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunificaiton, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.Starting in 2000, an ambitious (and subsequently much-praised) urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig's decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving as much as possible of the city's urban structure, especially its attractive historic center and various architectural gems, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nNowadays, Leipzig is an important economic center in Germany. Since the 2010s, the city has been celebrated by the media as a hip urban center with a very high quality of living. It is often called \"The new Berlin\". Leipzig is also Germany's fastest growing city. Leipzig was the German candidate for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful. After ten years of construction, the Leipzig City Tunnel opened on 14 December 2013. Leipzig forms the centerpiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system, which operates in the four German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLeipzig lies at the confluence of the rivers White Elster, Plei\u00dfe and Parthe, in the Leipzig Bay, on the most southerly part of the North German Plain, which is the part of the North European Plain in Germany. The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the Leipzig Riverside Forest, though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat though there is also some evidence of moraine and drumlins.\nAlthough there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-cast mines in the region, many of which are being converted to use as lakes. Also see: Neuseenland\nLeipzig is also situated at the intersection of the ancient roads known as the Via Regia (King's highway), which traversed Germany in an east\u2013west direction, and the Via Imperii (Imperial Highway), a north\u2013south road.\nLeipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and the current \"ring\" road around the historic centre of the city follows the line of the old city walls.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nSince 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten districts, which in turn contain a total of 63 subdistricts. Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike many places located in Eastern parts of Germany, Leipzig has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb close to a Dfb [0 \u00b0C US isotherm]) with significant continental influences due to inland location. Winters are cool to cold, with an average of around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F). Summers are generally warm, averaging at 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) with daytime temperatures of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours a day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours a day).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nLeipzig has a population of about 570,000. In 1930, the population reached its historical peak of over 700,000. It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation. After almost doubling the city area by incorporation of surrounding towns in 1999, the number stabilised and started to rise again, with an increase of 1,000 in 2000. As of 2015, Leipzig is the fastest-growing city in Germany with over 500,000 inhabitants.\nThe growth of the past 10\u201315 years has mostly been due to inward migration. In recent years, inward migration accelerated, reaching an increase of 12,917 in 2014.In the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates. Births dropped from 7,000 in 1988 to less than 3,000 in 1994. However, the number of children born in Leipzig has risen since the late 1990s. In 2011, it reached 5,490 births resulting in a RNI of \u221217.7 (\u2212393.7 in 1995).The unemployment rate decreased from 18.2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2014 and 7.6% in June 2017.The percentage of the population from an immigrant background is low compared with other German cities. As of 2012, only 5.6% of the population were foreigners, compared to the German national average of 7.7%.The number of people with an immigrant background (immigrants and their children) grew from 49,323 in 2012 to 77,559 in 2016, making them 13.3% of the city's population (Leipzig's population 579,530 in 2016).The largest minorities (first and second generation) in Leipzig by country of origin as of 31.12.2018 are:\n\n\n== Culture, sights and cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe historic central area of Leipzig features a Renaissance-style ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several baroque period trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the historicist style representative of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The new city hall, completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\nSome 64,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in Plattenbau buildings during Communist rule in East Germany. and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, at least 10% of Leipzig's population (50,000 people) are still living in Plattenbau accommodation. Gr\u00fcnau, for example, has approximately 40,000 people living in this sort of accommodation.The St. Paul's Church was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called Paulinum, which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings and structures ===\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of 205 metres (673 feet). With 142 metres (466 feet), the City-Hochhaus Leipzig is the tallest high-rise building in Leipzig. From 1972 to 1973 it was Germany's tallest building.\n\n\n=== Museums and the arts ===\nOne of the highlights of the city's contemporary arts was the Neo Rauch retrospective opening in April 2010 at the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts. This is a show devoted to the father of the New Leipzig School of artists. According to The New York Times, this scene \"has been the toast of the contemporary art world\" for the past decade. In addition, there are eleven galleries in the so-called Spinnerei.The Grassi Museum complex contains three more of Leipzig's major collections: the Ethnography Museum, Applied Arts Museum and Musical Instrument Museum (the last of which is run by the University of Leipzig). The university also runs the Museum of Antiquities.Founded in March 2015, the G2 Kunsthalle houses the Hildebrand Collection. This private collection focuses on the so-called New Leipzig School. Leipzig's first private museum dedicated to contemporary art in Leipzig after the turn of the millennium is located in the city centre close to the famous St. Thomas Church on the third floor of the former GDR processing centre.Other museums in Leipzig include the following:\n\nThe German Museum of Books and Writing is the world's oldest museum of its kind, founded in 1884.\nThe Egyptian Museum of the University of Leipzig comprises a collection of about 7,000 artefacts from several millennia.\nThe Schillerhaus is the house where Schiller lived in summer 1785.\nThe Zeitgeschichtliches Forum Leipzig (Forum of Contemporary History) shows the history of the German division and the everyday life in the socialist German Democratic Republic.\nNaturkundemuseum Leipzig is the city's natural history museum.\nThe Leipzig Panometer is a visual panorama displayed inside a former gasometer, accompanied by a thematic exhibition.\nThe \"Museum in der Runden Ecke\" is the best known museum in the city.

The composer Richard Wagner was born in Leipzig in 1813, in the Br\u00fchl. Robert Schumann was also active in Leipzig music, having been invited by Felix Mendelssohn when the latter established Germany's first musical conservatoire in the city in 1843. Gustav Mahler was second conductor (working under Artur Nikisch) at the Leipzig Opera from June 1886 until May 1888, and achieved his first significant recognition while there by completing and publishing Carl Maria von Weber's opera Die Drei Pintos. Mahler also completed his own 1st Symphony while living in Leipzig.\nToday the conservatory is the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig. A broad range of subjects are taught, including artistic and teacher training in all orchestral instruments, voice, interpretation, coaching, piano chamber music, orchestral conducting, choir conducting and musical composition in various musical styles. The drama departments teach acting and scriptwriting.\nThe Bach-Archiv Leipzig, an institution for the documentation and research of the life and work of Bach (and also of the Bach family), was founded in Leipzig in 1950 by Werner Neumann. The Bach-Archiv organizes the prestigious International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition, initiated in 1950 as part of a music festival marking the bicentennial of Bach's death. The competition is now held every two years in three changing categories. The Bach-Archiv also organizes performances, especially the international festival Bachfest Leipzig (de) and runs the Bach-Museum.\nThe city's musical tradition is also reflected in the worldwide fame of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, under its chief conductor Andris Nelsons, and the Thomanerchor.\nThe MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra is Leipzig's second largest symphony orchestra. Its current chief conductor is Kristjan J\u00e4rvi. Both the Gewandhausorchester and the MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra make use of in the Gewandhaus concert hall.\nFor over sixty years Leipzig has been offering a \"school concert\" programme for children in Germany, with over 140 concerts every year in venues such as the Gewandhaus and over 40,000 children attending.\nAs for contemporary music, Leipzig is known for its independent music scene and subcultural events. Leipzig has for twenty years been home to the world's largest Gothic festival, the annual Wave-Gotik-Treffen (WGT), where thousands of fans of gothic and dark styled music from across Europe and the world gather in the early summer. The first Wave Gotik Treffen was held at the Eiskeller club, today known as Conne Island, in the Connewitz district. Mayhem's notorious album Live in Leipzig was also recorded at the Eiskeller club. Leipzig Pop Up is an annual music trade fair for the independent music scene as well as a music festival taking place on Pentecost weekend.

The University of Leipzig attracts millions of euros of investment yearly and is in the middle of a massive construction and refurbishment to celebrate its 600th anniversary.\nLeipzig also benefits from world leading medical research (Leipzig Heart Centre) and a growing biotechnology industry.Many bars, restaurants and stores found in the downtown area are patronized by German and foreign tourists. Leipzig Hauptbahnhof itself is the location of a shopping mall. Leipzig is one of Germany's most visited cities with over 3 million overnight stays in 2017.In 2010, Leipzig was included in the top 10 cities to visit by The New York Times, and ranked 39th globally out of 289 cities for innovation in the 4th Innovation Cities Index published by Australian agency 2thinknow.

It provides programmes to various TV and radio networks and has its own symphony orchestra, choir and a ballet.\nLeipziger Volkszeitung (LVZ) is the city's only daily newspaper. Founded in 1894, it has published under several different forms of government. The monthly magazine Kreuzer specializes in culture, festivities and the arts in Leipzig. Leipzig was also home to the world's first daily newspaper in modern times. The \"Einkommende Zeitungen\" were first published in 1650.\nLeipzig has one daily or semi-daily English-language publication, The Leipzig Glocal. It is an online-based magazine and blog that caters to an international as well as local audience. Besides publishing pages on jobs, doctors and movies available in English and other languages, the site's team of authors writes articles about lifestyle, arts & culture, politics, entertainment, Leipzig events, etc.\nOnce known for its large number of publishing houses, Leipzig had been called Buch-Stadt (book city), the most notable of them being branches of Brockhaus and Insel Verlag. Few are left after the years of economic decline during the German Democratic Republic, during which time Frankfurt developed as a much more important publishing center. Reclam, founded in 1828, was one of the large publishing houses to move away. Leipzig still has a book fair, but Frankfurt's is far bigger.\nThe German Library (Deutsche B\u00fccherei) in Leipzig is part of Germany's National Library. Its task is to collect a copy of every book published in German.\n\n\n== Quality of life ==\n\nIn December 2013, according to a study by GfK, Leipzig was ranked as the most livable city in Germany.In 2015/2016, Leipzig was named the second-best city for students in Germany (after Munich).In a 2017 study, the Leipzig inner city ranked first among all large cities in Germany due to its urban aesthetics, gastronomy, and shopping opportunities.Since 2018 it also has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, only surpassed by Munich in 2018 and Berlin in 2019.According to the 2017 Global Least & Most Stressful Cities Ranking, Leipzig was one of the least stressful cities in the World. It was ranked 25th out of 150 cities worldwide and above Dortmund, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Berlin.In 2018, Leipzig won the European Cities of Future prize in the category of \"Best Large City for Human Capital & Lifestyle\".Leipzig was named European City of the Year at the 2019 Urbanism Awards.According to the 2019 study by Forschungsinstitut Prognos, Leipzig is the most dynamic region in Germany. Within 15 years, the city climbed 230 places and occupied in 2019 rank 104 of all 401 German regions.Leipzig is one of 52 places to go in 2020 by The New York Times and the highest-ranking German destination.Leipzig Hauptbahnhof is the best railway station in Germany and the third-best in Europe (only surpassed by St Pancras railway station and Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof).\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFounded at the crossing of Via Regia and Via Imperii, Leipzig has been a major interchange of inter-European traffic and commerce since medieval times. After the Reunification of Germany, immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nOpened in 1915, Leipzig Central Station is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the ICE and Intercity network of the Deutsche Bahn as well as a connection point for S-Bahn and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\nIn Leipzig, the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg-)Berlin-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Munich and Dresden-Leipzig-Erfurt-Frankfurt am Main-(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. After completion of the high-speed line to Erfurt, the ICE will run on both lines via Leipzig/Halle Airport and Erfurt. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)-Magdeburg-Braunschweig-Hannover-Dortmund-K\u00f6ln and -Bremen-Oldenburg(-Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via two S-Bahn lines, one of which runs hourly via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200 km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300 km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg is scheduled for completion in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network will considerably reduce the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200 km/h. The ICE will also be able to operate from Leipzig to Dresden in the near future. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long City Tunnel, which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a large freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\n\n=== Suburban train ===\n\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and Bayerischer Bahnhof leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n\n=== Tramway and Buses ===\n\nThe Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe, existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\nThe total length of the tram network is 149.9 km (93.1 mi), making it the largest in Saxony ahead of Dresden (130.2 km (80.9 mi)) and the second largest in Germany after Berlin (193.6 km (120.3 mi)).\nThe longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be bicycle-friendly. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\nSince 2004 there is a bicycle-sharing system. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the A 14 in the north, the A 9 in the west and the A 38 in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the A 72 is also partly under construction or being planned.\nThe federal roads B 2, B 6, B 87, B 181, B 184 and B 186 lead through the city area.\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\nLeipzig has a dense network of carsharing stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a ridesharing provider. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n\n=== Long-distance buses ===\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5 million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and Leipziger Messe for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLeipzig/Halle Airport is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). DHL uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines Aerologic and European Air Transport Leipzig.\nThe former military airport near Altenburg, Thuringia called Leipzig-Altenburg Airport about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by Ryanair until 2010.\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the Elster-Saale canal, White Elster and Saale was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of forced labor. The Lindenauer port was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and Karl-Heine canal respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, New Luppe, Plei\u00dfe, and Parthe) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing mill races and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused open cast mines, the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the Elbe from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Quotations ==\nMein Leipzig lob' ich mir!

          "I visited this house and only viewed it from the outside due to time constraints. Most reviews are either four or five stars as its obviously a lot better inside than out. You have to pay to enter the building but the garden is free to wander around. Its exterior is very plain",
          "Quite interesting, Everything is written in German, and you can get headphones to hear English. Quite informative, especially concerning the Gewandhaus.",
          "This museum is maintained with carefully sparing the authentic building. Excellent way to see, hear and try how a conductor works. A very interesting small museum. Small cafe and souvenir store inside the museum.",
          "This is how you do a composer's museum/house! (See my review of the Schumann House) It's brightly lit and the displays were well laid out. A magnificent computer controlled room lets you control an orchestra playing Felix M's music - speed, style, acoustics and even the room's",
          "An excellent example of intelligent museum creation for those interested in classical music. An easy walk from Leipzig\u2019s central station.",
          "I had the worst time finding this place. There are signs all over encouraging a visit, but none to point out where it is. However, it is worth searching for! Besides the apartment where Felix lived and died, there is a wonderful conducting room where you can conduct an",

          "There is a rather interesting electronic conducting game in one room, which I suggest you have a go with. But more importantly, there is a lot to learn about Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn is one of my favourite composers and if you're interested in his life and works too, I highly",

          "Quite small museum close to the Central Market. You can get free audio pens to listen to an explanation of each room. Was there at the right time to be treated so live music from a small quartet. He is not one of the classical artists I knew much about, but he was an",

          "Mendelssohn lived in this house until his death. This is a very simple museum allowing to see how famous composer and conductor lived and worked there in the first half of XIX century. There is a room where one can actually choose the score and conduct (very smart). Also, on",

          "The House is only 100m from the Gewandhaus and is the last address of Mendelssohn. There is a lot of information about the composer and a reconstruction of his study as he left it. You can try your hand at conducting his music (not as easy as one might think), and there is a",

        "wiki": "Leipzig University (German: Universit\u00e4t Leipzig), in Leipzig in the Free State of Saxony, Germany, is one of the world's oldest universities and the second-oldest university (by consecutive years of existence) in Germany. The university was founded on December 2, 1409 by Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and his brother William II, Margrave of Meissen, and originally comprised the four scholastic faculties. Since its inception, the university has engaged in teaching and research for over 600 years without interruption.\nFamous alumni include Leibniz, Goethe, Leopold von Ranke, Friedrich Nietzsche, Robert Schumann, Richard Wagner, Tycho Brahe, Georgius Agricola, Angela Merkel and the nine Nobel laureates associated with the university.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding and development until 1900 ===\n\nThe university was modelled on the University of Prague, from which the German-speaking faculty members withdrew to Leipzig after the Jan Hus crisis and the Decree of Kutn\u00e1 Hora. The Alma mater Lipsiensis opened in 1409, after it had been officially endorsed by Pope Alexander V in his Bull of Acknowledgment on (September 9 of that year). Its first rector was Johann von M\u00fcnsterberg. From its foundation, the Paulinerkirche served as the university church. After the Reformation, the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544. In order to secure independent and sustainable funding, the university was endowed with the lordship over nine villages east of Leipzig (university villages). It kept this status for nearly 400 years until land reforms were carried out in the 19th century. During the decline and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th and first decade of 20th century together with some other German universities Leipzig University turned into one of the centers of higher education for state administrations and elites of newly independent Balkan states (Romania, Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia) educating over 5,500 students from the region in 1859-1909 period.As many European universities, the University of Leipzig was structured into colleges (collegia) responsible for organising accommodation and collegiate lecturing. Among the colleges of Leipzig were the Small College, the Large College, the Red College (also known as the New College), the College of our Lady and the Pauliner-College. There were also private residential halls (bursen, see English 'bursaries'). The colleges had jurisdiction over their members. The college structure was abandoned later and today only the names survive.\nDuring the first centuries, the university grew slowly and was a rather regional institution. This changed, however, during the 19th century when the university became a world-class institution of higher education and research. At the end of the 19th century, important scholars such as Bernhard Windscheid (one of the fathers of the German Civil Code) and Wilhelm Ostwald (viewed as a founder of modern physical chemistry) taught at Leipzig.\n\nLeipzig University was one of the first German universities to allow women to register as \"guest students\". At its general assembly in 1873, the Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein thanked the University of Leipzig and Prague for allowing women to attend as guest students. This was the year that the first woman in Germany obtained her JD, Johanna von Evreinov.\nUntil the beginning of the Second World War, Leipzig University attracted a number of renowned scholars and later Nobel Prize laureates, including Paul Ehrlich, Felix Bloch, Werner Heisenberg and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. Many of the university's alumni became important scientists.\n\n\n=== Nazi period ===\nUnder Nazi rule many Jews' degrees were cancelled; some were later reinstated as Karl-Marx University degrees by the GDR. Noteworthy Nazis, such as Max Clara (chair of anatomy) taught at the university and were appointed to positions with great authority.\nThe university was kept open throughout World War II, even after the destruction of its buildings. During the war the acting rector, Erich Maschke, described the continuation of the university in a memo on May 11, 1945, announcing the vote for a new rector:\n\nSince 4 December 1943 a fixed determination not to abandon the Leipzig University in the most difficult hour of its more than five-hundred-year history has bonded the professors with each other and with the students. The special task of repairing the damage caused by air attacks has now broadened out to the more general duty to save the continuity of our university and preserve its substance, at the very least its indestructible kernel, through the crisis that has now reached its fullest stage. After the destruction of most of the buildings and the majority of its libraries, this kernel is represented by the professoriate alone. This is what must be preserved as the great repository of value in the university.\nBy the end of the war 60 per cent of the university's buildings and 70 per cent of its books had been destroyed.\n\n\n=== The university under the German Democratic Republic ===\nThe university reopened after the war on February 5, 1946, but it was affected by the uniformity imposed on social institutions in the Soviet occupation zone. In 1948 the freely elected student council was disbanded and replaced by Free German Youth members. The chairman of the Student Council, Wolfgang Natonek, and other members were arrested and imprisoned, but the university was also a nucleus of resistance. Thus began the Belter group, with flyers for free elections. The head of the group, Herbert Belter, was executed in 1951 in Moscow. The German Democratic Republic was created in 1949, and in 1953 for Karl Marx Year the university was renamed by its government the Karl Marx University, Leipzig after Karl Marx. In 1968, the partly damaged Augusteum, including Johanneum and Albertinum and the intact Paulinerkirche, were demolished to make way for a redevelopment of the university, carried out between 1973 and 1978. The dominant building of the university was the University Tower (now City-Hochhaus Leipzig), built between 1968 and 1972 in the form of an open book.\n\n\n=== After the reunification of Germany ===\n\nIn 1991, following the reunification of Germany, the university's name was restored to the original Leipzig University (Alma mater lipsiensis). The reconstruction of the University Library, which was heavily damaged during the war and in the GDR barely secured, was completed in 2002.\nWith the delivery of the University Tower to a private user, the university was forced to spread some faculties over several locations in the city. It controversially redesigned its historical centre at the Augustusplatz. In 2002, Behet Bonzio received the second prize in the architectural competition; a first prize was not awarded by the jury. A lobby with partial support of the provincial government called for the rebuilding of St. Paul's Church and Augusteum. This caused the resistance of the university leadership, the majority of the students and population of Leipzig. On March 24, 2004 a jury chose a design by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat, which was well received by almost all parties. He recalls the outer form of the St. Paul's Church (today called Paulinum) and Augusteum, and abstracted the original building complex. Renovations began in the summer of 2005.\nIn 2008 the university was able to prevail in the nationwide \"Initiative of Excellence\" of Germany and it was granted the graduate school \"BuildMoNa: Leipzig School of Natural Sciences \u2013 Building with Molecules and Nano-objects\". In addition, the university was able to receive grants from the Saxon excellence initiative for the \"Life\" project \u2013 a project that tries to explore common diseases more effectively. Also in 2008 the \"Bach Archive\" was associated with the university. In 2009, the Leipzig University celebrated its 600th anniversary with over 300 scientific and cultural lectures and exhibitions, reflecting the role of the university's research and teaching from its beginning.\n\n\n== Campus ==\nThe university's urban campus comprises several locations. All in all, the university is spread across 38 locations in Leipzig. The main buildings in the city center are still located on the same land plots as the earliest university buildings in 1409. The university's buildings in the center of Leipzig underwent substantial reconstruction from 2005, the new university's main building being drafted by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat. The estimated total cost for the renovation project is 140 million euros. The new buildings were scheduled to be completed in 2009/2010, in time for the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.\nBesides the faculties and other teaching institutions, several other bodies serve the university: the University Library, a university archive and administration, numerous museums (e.g. the Museum for Music Instruments and the Museum of Ancient Egypt) and the university hospital. The university's Leipzig Botanical Garden, the second-oldest botanical garden in Europe. was established in 1542.\nThe University's Musical Instrument Museum includes one of the world's three surviving pianos built by Bartolomeo Cristofori, the piano's inventor. Five other Cristofori instruments are included in the Museum's collections.Key Central institutions of the university are\n\n\n== Library ==\nThe University Library of Leipzig was established in 1543. It is one of the oldest German university libraries and it serves as a source of literature and information for the Leipzig University as well as the general public in the region. Its extensive historical and special collections are nationally and internationally recognized. The library consists of the main building \"Bibliotheca Albertina\" and forty branches situated near their respective academic institutions. The current stock comprises 5 million volumes and about 7,700 periodicals. Collections range from important medieval and modern manuscripts to incunabula, papyri, autographs, ostraka and coins. The Apel Codex, a manuscript of 16th century music, is housed in the Leipzig University library, as well as the Papyrus Ebers.\nThe Leipzig University Library also owns parts of the Codex Sinaiticus, a Bible manuscript from the 4th century, brought from Sinai in 1843 by Constantin von Tischendorf. Papyrus Ebers is the longest and oldest surviving medical manuscript from ancient Egypt, dated to around 1600 BC. The Codex contains large parts of the Old Testament and a complete New Testament in ancient Greek, and is one of the most important known manuscripts of the Greek Old Testament and the New Testament. It is the oldest fully preserved copy of the New Testament.\nSome of the University Library locations  in Leipzig are:\n\nBibliotheca Albertina at Beethovenstra\u00dfe 6\nCampus Library at Universit\u00e4tsstr. 3\nLibrary of Deutsches Literaturinstitut at W\u00e4chterstr. 34\nLibrary of Arts at Dittrichring 18\u201320\nLibrary of Musicology at Neumarkt 9\u201319\nLibrary of Law at Burgstr. 27\nLibrary of Medicine at Johannisallee 34\nLibrary of Medicine at K\u00e4the-Kollwitz-Str. 82\nLibrary of Veterinary Medicine at the Tierkliniken 5\nLibrary of Biosciences at Talstr. 35\nLibrary of Chemistry and Physics at Johannisallee 29\nLibrary of Earth Sciences at Talstr. 35\nLibrary of Geography at Johannisallee 19\nLibrary of Archaeology, Prehistory and Ancient History at Ritterstr. 14\nLibrary of Oriental Studies at Schillerstr. 6\nLibrary of Sports Science at Jahnallee 59In addition to the university library, one of the two centers of the German National Library is based at Leipzig, the collections of which are open to use for academic research.\n\n\n== Faculties ==\nThe original four facilities were the Faculty of Arts, Theology, Medicine, and Law.

Erasmus Mundus Global Studies is an interdisciplinary, research-based Master offered by a consortium of five European universities: Leipzig University, the London School of Economics, University of Vienna, University of Wroclaw and Roskilde University. In the field of anthropology, the university is cooperating with the Leipzig Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. In 1995, the Leibniz-Institute for Jewish History and Culture named after Simon Dubnow was formed as a research institution related to the university. Since 2008 the university is also home to one of Germany's few Confucius Institutes. The Institute is based on an agreement of June 2006 between the university administration and representatives of the Chinese Embassy to establish a Confucius Institute in cooperation with the Renmin University and the \"National Office for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language\". Leipzig University has been the home of the first German chair for Chinese and East Asian Languages in the 19th century, which later became the Institute of East Asian Studies, which still exists today (see Georg von der Gabelentz).\n\n\n=== Rankings ===\nThe university is ranked 18th in Germany, 98th in Europe, and 264th in the world by the web-based Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, a ranking evaluating universities' scientific online publications.

        "wiki": "The Grassi Museum is a building complex in Leipzig, Germany, home to three museums: the Ethnography Museum, Musical Instruments Museum, and Applied Arts Museum.\nIt is sometimes known as the \"Museums in the Grassi\", or as the \"New\" Grassi Museum (to distinguish it from the older building with this name, now home to the municipal library).\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe museum is named after Franz Dominic Grassi, a Leipzig businessman of Italian descent, who bequeathed over two million marks to the city upon his death in 1880. This helped pay for a number of new constructions, including the Gewandhaus and the Mende Fountain, as well as the \"Old Grassi Museum\".  Built from 1892-95 on the K\u00f6nigsplatz (now Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz), this originally housed the Museum of Ethnography and the Museum of Arts and Crafts, and is now the municipal library.\n\n\n== New building ==\nThe old museum became too small for the collections, prompting its director to call for an architecture competition to design a new building, to be paid for with the Grassi bequest.  The winning firm designed a building with elements of New Objectivity and Art Deco, based around several courtyards.  It was built from 1925-29 (one of the few new museums of the Weimar Era), on the site of the old Johannis Hospital.  The urban planner Hubert Ritter had intended for it to be the starting point of an eastward expansion of the city.  It contained originally the Johannis Church, demolished in 1963.The New Grassi Museum was severely bombed in 1943, with the loss of tens of thousands of items.  Rebuilding began in 1947, with the first exhibitions in 1954.  It was closed from 1981-85 due to a problem with the heating system.  It was completely renovated from 2001-05, including the removal of some of the front windows.  It reopened partly in 2005, though the Museum of Applied Arts did not reopen until 2007.It is a historically preserved building, and is one of around 20 so-called \"Cultural Lighthouses\" in the German government's Blue Book of culturally significant sites in the former East Germany.  As such, it is a member of the Konferenz Nationaler Kultureinrichtungen.\n\n\n== Trade fair ==\nThe Grassi Museum hosts an annual trade fair in October, the Grassimesse, whose origins go back to 1920.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Grassi Museum\nThe Grassimesse\nGrassi-Museum: Der ganze Reichtum unseres Kontinents Andreas Platthaus, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 30 November 2007.

          "With Leipzig having such a history in the arts and commerce, you'd expect their big art museum to have some major pieces. But it's not so. I found their few really interesting pieces were by largely unknown artists. With a loathsome special exhibit of the \"works\" of Yoko Ono, we",

          "A bit mixed up about the art, but this is so personal. We went in more because of the architecture and this was worthwhile.",
          "The architecture is monumental and tends to overpower the visitor. Still, the collection is a very good one, with special strengths in 17th Dutch art, 19th century German Romanticism, and 20th century art. Among my favourites are works by Frans Hals, Caspar David Friedrich,",

          "We did not have enough time to go through the whole museum, so maybe this review is biassed. The top floor had a strange mixture of very new stuff, with classic collections. The new stuff was very angry art - maybe reflecting the recent past of the DDR. Disturbing, without being",
          "At first I wasn't impressed- the collections aren't even arranged chronologically! But I walked around... and around... and became more captivated the more I walked around- following the winding paths through the galleries. The neat thing is, they mix everything from old masters",
          "The new Museum, built at a cost of 74.5 million Euros, opened in 2004. A huge glass-clad cube, for the moment it seems to have not enough contents to justify its scale. The staircases and circulation spaces are monumental - even the doors are twice the height one would expect.",

          "The most impressive thing about this museum is the actual building. The design is breathtaking. The permanent collection is good and you are able to get an audiobook as a tour. It was slightly disappointing in the sense that only a very select few pieces had any audio",

        "wiki": "The Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei (Leipzig Cotton Mill) is an industrial site in Leipzig, Germany.  Parts of this 10-hectare site in the district of Lindenau are used today by art galleries, studios and restaurants.\nFounded in 1884, the business developed into the largest cotton mill in continental Europe over the next quarter century.  During this time, an entire industrial town with over 20 factories, workers' housing, kindergartens and a recreational area, grew in western Leipzig.  The mill reached its maximum extent in 1907, with 240,000 spindles processing cotton across a working area of about 25 acres (100,000 m2).  Up to 4,000 people worked there, until production of thread was halted in 1993 following the reunification of Germany several years earlier.\nSubsequently, the area was repopulated by a mixture of people including craftsmen, self-employed, and above all artists, many belonging to the so-called \"New Leipzig School\".  More than half of the available space has since been rented out again for new purposes.\nTen galleries, a communal arts center (Halle 14), and around 100 artists (including Neo Rauch, Jim Whiting, Hans Aichinger, and Matthias Weischer) have all settled at the site, as well as restaurants, fashion designers, architects, printers, a goldsmith, a pottery, a film club, a porcelain manufacturer, and an arts supply store.\nThe site contained several platform interchanges from a now-disused railway between Lindenau and Plagwitz.  Parts of the platforms are still intact.\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page in English, including history.\nPinsel statt Spule Nina Apin, Die Tageszeitung, 6 April 2005.

        "wiki": "Leipzig (, also , , German: [\u02c8la\u026apts\u026a\u00e7] (listen);; Upper Saxon: Leibzsch) is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. With a population of 600,000 inhabitants as of 2019 (1.1 million residents in the larger urban zone), it is Germany's eighth most populous city as well as the second most populous city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin. Together with Halle (Saale), the largest city of the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt, the city forms the polycentric conurbation of Leipzig-Halle. Between the two cities (in Schkeuditz) lies Leipzig/Halle International Airport.\nLeipzig is located about 160 kilometres (99 mi) southwest of Berlin in the Leipzig Bay, which constitutes the southernmost part of the North German Plain, at the confluence of the White Elster River (progression: Saale\u2192 Elbe\u2192 North Sea) and two of its tributaries: the Plei\u00dfe and the Parthe. The name of the city as well as the names of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.\nLeipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire. The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes. Leipzig was once one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing. After the  Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East German terms, but its cultural and economic importance declined. Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy, which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry, severe unemployment, and urban blight. Starting around 2000, however, decline was first arrested and then reversed. Leipzig has undergone significant change with the restoration of major historical buildings, the demolition of derelict properties of little historical value, and the development of new industries and a modern transport infrastructure.Leipzig today is an economic centre, the most livable city in Germany, according to the GfK marketing research institution and has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, according to HWWI and Berenberg Bank. The city is one of two seats of the German National Library (together with Frankfurt), as well as the seat of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and ranks first in Germany and second in Europe according to Anthony Sheridan. Since the opening of the Leipzig City Tunnel in 2013, Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system. Leipzig is currently listed as a Gamma World City, Germany's \"Boomtown\" and as the European City of the Year 2019.Leipzig has long been a major centre for music, both classical as well as modern \"dark alternative music\" or darkwave genres. The Oper Leipzig is one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany. Leipzig is also home to the University of Music and Theatre \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\". It was during a stay in this city that Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem \"Ode to Joy\". The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Johann Sebastian Bach is one among many major composers who lived and worked in Leipzig.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Name ===\n\nThe name Leipzig is derived from the Slavic word Lipsk, which means \"settlement where the linden trees (British English: lime trees; U.S. English: basswood trees) stand\". An older spelling of the name in English is Leipsic. The Latin name Lipsia was also used. The name is cognate with Lipetsk (\u041b\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043a) in Russia and Liep\u0101ja in Latvia.\n\nIn 1937 the Nazi government officially renamed the city Reichsmessestadt Leipzig (Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig).Since 1989 Leipzig has been informally dubbed \"Hero City\" (Heldenstadt), in recognition of the role that the Monday demonstrations there played in the fall of the East German regime \u2013 the name alludes to the honorary title awarded in the former Soviet Union to certain cities that played a key role in the victory of the Allies during the Second World War. The common usage of this nickname for Leipzig up until the present is reflected, for example, in the name of a blog for local arts and culture, Heldenstadt.de.More recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\", \"Hypezig\" or \"The better Berlin\" for being celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for the vital lifestyle and creative scene with many startups.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nLeipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as urbs Libzi (Chronikon VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by Otto the Rich. Leipzig Trade Fair, started in the Middle Ages, has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world.\nThere are records of commercial fishing operations on the river Plei\u00dfe in Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the Margrave Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.There were a number of monasteries in and around the city, including a Franciscan monastery after which the Barfu\u00dfg\u00e4\u00dfchen (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks (Jacobskirche, destroyed in 1544) near the present day Ranst\u00e4dter Steinweg (the old Via Regia).\nThe foundation of the University of Leipzig in 1409 initiated the city's development into a centre of German law and the publishing industry, and towards being the location of the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) and the German National Library (founded in 1912).\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, two battles took place in Breitenfeld, about 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) outside Leipzig city walls. The first Battle of Breitenfeld took place in 1631 and the second in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.\nOn 24 December 1701, an oil-fueled street lighting system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig between Napoleonic France and an allied coalition of Prussia, Russia, Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended Napoleon's presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on Elba. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.When it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the Royal Saxon State Railways and the western one for the Prussian state railways.\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German labor party, the General German Workers' Association (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein, ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge Gr\u00fcnderzeit areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei became the largest cotton mill company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Daily production surpassed 5 million kilograms of yarn.During the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to World War II. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.\nOn 22 May 1930, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was elected mayor of Leipzig. He was well known as an opponent of the Nazi regime. He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of Felix Mendelssohn. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue, one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. Goerdeler was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.\n\nSeveral thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.\nBeginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the Gemeinde, a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.Like all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to aryanisation. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenh\u00e4user, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.As with other cities in Europe during the Holocaust, the Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the Nuremberg Laws. However, due to the Leipzig Trade Fair and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures. Shortly before Kristallnacht, Polish Jews living in the city were expelled.On 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the \"Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig\". In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in Zionism through Jewish citizens. Many of these Zionists attempted to flee before deportations began. On 28 October 1938, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of Polish Jews from Leipzig to Poland.On 9 November 1938, as part of Kristallnacht, in Gottschedstrasse (German: Gottschedstra\u00dfe), now a popular dining and nightlife area in Leipzig, synagogues and businesses were set on fire. Only a couple of days later, on 11 November 1938, many Jews in the Leipzig area were deported to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. As World War II came to an end, much of Leipzig was destroyed. Following the war, the Communist Party of Germany (German: Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, KPD) provided aid for the reconstruction of the city.In 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported. On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors. According to records of the Theresienstadt deportation, only 53 Jews survived.Until late 1943, there was little threat of aerial bombings to the city. However, on the morning of 4 December 1943, the British Royal Air Force dropped over 1,000 tons of explosives, resulting in the death of nearly 1,000 civilians. This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, the storm was too overwhelming for them. Unlike its neighbouring city of Dresden, this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945. In April 1945 the SS Gruppehfuhrer/Mayor of Leipzig Bruno Erich Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter; the Deputy Mayor/Treasurer of Leipzig, Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter, and a Volkssturm Major Walter D\u00f6nicke committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\nThe United States turned the city over to the Red Army as it pulled back from the line of contact with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city.In the mid-20th century, the city's trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the Comecon Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which East Germany was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the Monument to the Battle of the Nations.\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in. Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.In October 1989, after prayers for peace at St. Nicholas Church, established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the Monday demonstrations started as the most prominent mass protest against the East German government. The reunification of Germany, however, was at first not good for Leipzig. The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city's speciality was, in terms of the advanced economy of  reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished. As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunificaiton, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.Starting in 2000, an ambitious (and subsequently much-praised) urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig's decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving as much as possible of the city's urban structure, especially its attractive historic center and various architectural gems, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nNowadays, Leipzig is an important economic center in Germany. Since the 2010s, the city has been celebrated by the media as a hip urban center with a very high quality of living. It is often called \"The new Berlin\". Leipzig is also Germany's fastest growing city. Leipzig was the German candidate for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful. After ten years of construction, the Leipzig City Tunnel opened on 14 December 2013. Leipzig forms the centerpiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system, which operates in the four German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLeipzig lies at the confluence of the rivers White Elster, Plei\u00dfe and Parthe, in the Leipzig Bay, on the most southerly part of the North German Plain, which is the part of the North European Plain in Germany. The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the Leipzig Riverside Forest, though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat though there is also some evidence of moraine and drumlins.\nAlthough there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-cast mines in the region, many of which are being converted to use as lakes. Also see: Neuseenland\nLeipzig is also situated at the intersection of the ancient roads known as the Via Regia (King's highway), which traversed Germany in an east\u2013west direction, and the Via Imperii (Imperial Highway), a north\u2013south road.\nLeipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and the current \"ring\" road around the historic centre of the city follows the line of the old city walls.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nSince 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten districts, which in turn contain a total of 63 subdistricts. Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike many places located in Eastern parts of Germany, Leipzig has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb close to a Dfb [0 \u00b0C US isotherm]) with significant continental influences due to inland location. Winters are cool to cold, with an average of around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F). Summers are generally warm, averaging at 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) with daytime temperatures of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours a day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours a day).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nLeipzig has a population of about 570,000. In 1930, the population reached its historical peak of over 700,000. It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation. After almost doubling the city area by incorporation of surrounding towns in 1999, the number stabilised and started to rise again, with an increase of 1,000 in 2000. As of 2015, Leipzig is the fastest-growing city in Germany with over 500,000 inhabitants.\nThe growth of the past 10\u201315 years has mostly been due to inward migration. In recent years, inward migration accelerated, reaching an increase of 12,917 in 2014.In the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates. Births dropped from 7,000 in 1988 to less than 3,000 in 1994. However, the number of children born in Leipzig has risen since the late 1990s. In 2011, it reached 5,490 births resulting in a RNI of \u221217.7 (\u2212393.7 in 1995).The unemployment rate decreased from 18.2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2014 and 7.6% in June 2017.The percentage of the population from an immigrant background is low compared with other German cities. As of 2012, only 5.6% of the population were foreigners, compared to the German national average of 7.7%.The number of people with an immigrant background (immigrants and their children) grew from 49,323 in 2012 to 77,559 in 2016, making them 13.3% of the city's population (Leipzig's population 579,530 in 2016).The largest minorities (first and second generation) in Leipzig by country of origin as of 31.12.2018 are:\n\n\n== Culture, sights and cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe historic central area of Leipzig features a Renaissance-style ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several baroque period trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the historicist style representative of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The new city hall, completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\nSome 64,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in Plattenbau buildings during Communist rule in East Germany. and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, at least 10% of Leipzig's population (50,000 people) are still living in Plattenbau accommodation. Gr\u00fcnau, for example, has approximately 40,000 people living in this sort of accommodation.The St. Paul's Church was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called Paulinum, which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings and structures ===\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of 205 metres (673 feet). With 142 metres (466 feet), the City-Hochhaus Leipzig is the tallest high-rise building in Leipzig. From 1972 to 1973 it was Germany's tallest building.\n\n\n=== Museums and the arts ===\nOne of the highlights of the city's contemporary arts was the Neo Rauch retrospective opening in April 2010 at the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts. This is a show devoted to the father of the New Leipzig School of artists. According to The New York Times, this scene \"has been the toast of the contemporary art world\" for the past decade. In addition, there are eleven galleries in the so-called Spinnerei.The Grassi Museum complex contains three more of Leipzig's major collections: the Ethnography Museum, Applied Arts Museum and Musical Instrument Museum (the last of which is run by the University of Leipzig). The university also runs the Museum of Antiquities.Founded in March 2015, the G2 Kunsthalle houses the Hildebrand Collection. This private collection focuses on the so-called New Leipzig School. Leipzig's first private museum dedicated to contemporary art in Leipzig after the turn of the millennium is located in the city centre close to the famous St. Thomas Church on the third floor of the former GDR processing centre.Other museums in Leipzig include the following:\n\nThe German Museum of Books and Writing is the world's oldest museum of its kind, founded in 1884.\nThe Egyptian Museum of the University of Leipzig comprises a collection of about 7,000 artefacts from several millennia.\nThe Schillerhaus is the house where Schiller lived in summer 1785.\nThe Zeitgeschichtliches Forum Leipzig (Forum of Contemporary History) shows the history of the German division and the everyday life in the socialist German Democratic Republic.\nNaturkundemuseum Leipzig is the city's natural history museum.\nThe Leipzig Panometer is a visual panorama displayed inside a former gasometer, accompanied by a thematic exhibition.\nThe \"Museum in der Runden Ecke\" is the best known museum in the city.

On its southeastern shore is Germany's only pump-powered artificial whitewater slalom course, Markkleeberg Canoe Park (Kanupark Markkleeberg), a venue which rivals the Eiskanal in Augsburg for training and international canoe/kayak competition.\nLeipzig Rugby Club competes in the German Rugby Bundesliga but finished at the bottom of their group in 2013.\n\n\n=== Food and drink ===\nAn all-season local dish is Leipziger Allerlei, a stew consisting of seasonal vegetables and crayfish.\nLeipziger Lerche is a shortcrust pastry dish filled with crushed almonds, nuts and strawberry jam; the name (\"Leipzig lark\") comes from a lark p\u00e2t\u00e9 which was a Leipzig speciality until the banning of songbird hunting in Saxony in 1876.\nGose is a locally brewed top-fermenting sour beer that originated in the Goslar region and in the 18th century became popular in Leipzig.\n\t\t\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== University ===\nLeipzig University, founded 1409, is one of Europe's oldest universities. The philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was born in Leipzig in 1646, and attended the university from 1661 to 1666. Nobel Prize laureate Werner Heisenberg worked here as a physics professor (from 1927 to 1942), as did Nobel Prize laureates Gustav Ludwig Hertz (physics), Wilhelm Ostwald (chemistry) and Theodor Mommsen (Nobel Prize in literature). Other former staff of faculty include mineralogist Georg Agricola, writer Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, philosopher Ernst Bloch, eccentric founder of psychophysics Gustav Theodor Fechner, and psychologist Wilhelm Wundt. Among the university's many noteworthy students were writers Johann Wolfgang Goethe and Erich K\u00e4stner, and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, political activist Karl Liebknecht, and composer Richard Wagner. Germany's chancellor since 2006, Angela Merkel, studied physics at Leipzig University. The university has about 30,000 students.\nA part of Leipzig University is the German Institute for Literature which was founded in 1955 under the name \"Johannes R. Becher-Institut\". Many noted writers have graduated from this school, including Heinz Czechowski, Kurt Drawert, Adolf Endler, Ralph Giordano, Kerstin Hensel, Sarah and Rainer Kirsch, Angela Krau\u00df, Erich Loest, Fred Wander. After its closure in 1990 the institute was refounded in 1995 with new teachers.\n\n\n=== Visual arts and theatre ===\nThe Academy of Visual Arts (Hochschule f\u00fcr Grafik und Buchkunst) was established in 1764.

It was founded in 1992, merging several older schools. As a university of applied sciences (German: Fachhochschule) its status is slightly below that of a university, with more emphasis on the practical part of the education. The HTWK offers many engineering courses, as well as courses in computer science, mathematics, business administration, librarianship, museum studies and social work. It is mainly located in the south of the city.\n\n\n=== Leipzig Graduate School ===\nThe private Leipzig Graduate School of Management, (in German Handelshochschule Leipzig (HHL)), is the oldest business school in Germany. According to The Economist, HHL is one of the best schools in the world, rankend at number six overall.\n\n\n=== Research Institutes ===\n\nLeipzig is currently the home of twelve research institutes and the Saxon Academy of Sciences and Humanities.\nMax Planck Society: Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, and Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.\nFraunhofer Society institutes: Fraunhofer IZI and Fraunhofer IMW.\nHelmholtz Association of German Research Centres: Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research\nDeutsches Biomasseforschungszentrum \u2013 DBFZ\nLeibniz Association: Leibniz-Institute for Tropospheric Research, Leibniz-Institute IOM, Leibniz-Institute for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe, Leibniz-Institute IfL, Leibniz-Institute Jewish history.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nLeipzig is home to one of the world's oldest schools Thomasschule zu Leipzig (St. Thomas' School, Leipzig), which gained fame for its long association with the Bach family of musicians and composers.\nThe Lutheran Theological Seminary is a seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Free Church in Leipzig. The seminary trains students to become pastors for the Evangelical Lutheran Free Church or for member church bodies of the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is a location for automobile manufacturing by BMW and Porsche in large plants north of the city. In 2011 and 2012 DHL transferred the bulk of its European air operations from Brussels Airport to Leipzig/Halle Airport. Kirow Ardelt AG, the world market leader in breakdown cranes, is based in Leipzig. The city also houses the European Energy Exchange, the leading energy exchange in Central Europe. With VNG \u2013 Verbundnetz Gas AG, one of Germany's large natural gas suppliers is headquartered at Leipzig. In addition, inside its larger metropolitan area, Leipzig has developed an important petrochemical center.\nSome of the largest employers in the area (outside of manufacturing) include software companies such as Spreadshirt and the various schools and universities in and around the Leipzig/Halle region. The University of Leipzig attracts millions of euros of investment yearly and is in the middle of a massive construction and refurbishment to celebrate its 600th anniversary.\nLeipzig also benefits from world leading medical research (Leipzig Heart Centre) and a growing biotechnology industry.Many bars, restaurants and stores found in the downtown area are patronized by German and foreign tourists. Leipzig Hauptbahnhof itself is the location of a shopping mall. Leipzig is one of Germany's most visited cities with over 3 million overnight stays in 2017.In 2010, Leipzig was included in the top 10 cities to visit by The New York Times, and ranked 39th globally out of 289 cities for innovation in the 4th Innovation Cities Index published by Australian agency 2thinknow. In 2015, Leipzig have among the 30 largest German cities the third best prospects for the future. In recent years Leipzig has often been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\" or \"Hypezig\". As of 2013 it had the highest rate of population growth of any German city.Companies with operations in or around Leipzig include:\n\nAmazon\nBl\u00fcthner: piano-manufacturing\nBMW\nDHL\nPorsche\nSiemens\nFuture Electronics\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nMDR, one of Germany's public broadcasters, has its headquarters and main television studios in the city. It provides programmes to various TV and radio networks and has its own symphony orchestra, choir and a ballet.\nLeipziger Volkszeitung (LVZ) is the city's only daily newspaper. Founded in 1894, it has published under several different forms of government. The monthly magazine Kreuzer specializes in culture, festivities and the arts in Leipzig. Leipzig was also home to the world's first daily newspaper in modern times. The \"Einkommende Zeitungen\" were first published in 1650.\nLeipzig has one daily or semi-daily English-language publication, The Leipzig Glocal. It is an online-based magazine and blog that caters to an international as well as local audience. Besides publishing pages on jobs, doctors and movies available in English and other languages, the site's team of authors writes articles about lifestyle, arts & culture, politics, entertainment, Leipzig events, etc.\nOnce known for its large number of publishing houses, Leipzig had been called Buch-Stadt (book city), the most notable of them being branches of Brockhaus and Insel Verlag. Few are left after the years of economic decline during the German Democratic Republic, during which time Frankfurt developed as a much more important publishing center. Reclam, founded in 1828, was one of the large publishing houses to move away. Leipzig still has a book fair, but Frankfurt's is far bigger.\nThe German Library (Deutsche B\u00fccherei) in Leipzig is part of Germany's National Library. Its task is to collect a copy of every book published in German.\n\n\n== Quality of life ==\n\nIn December 2013, according to a study by GfK, Leipzig was ranked as the most livable city in Germany.In 2015/2016, Leipzig was named the second-best city for students in Germany (after Munich).In a 2017 study, the Leipzig inner city ranked first among all large cities in Germany due to its urban aesthetics, gastronomy, and shopping opportunities.Since 2018 it also has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, only surpassed by Munich in 2018 and Berlin in 2019.According to the 2017 Global Least & Most Stressful Cities Ranking, Leipzig was one of the least stressful cities in the World. It was ranked 25th out of 150 cities worldwide and above Dortmund, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Berlin.In 2018, Leipzig won the European Cities of Future prize in the category of \"Best Large City for Human Capital & Lifestyle\".Leipzig was named European City of the Year at the 2019 Urbanism Awards.According to the 2019 study by Forschungsinstitut Prognos, Leipzig is the most dynamic region in Germany. Within 15 years, the city climbed 230 places and occupied in 2019 rank 104 of all 401 German regions.Leipzig is one of 52 places to go in 2020 by The New York Times and the highest-ranking German destination.Leipzig Hauptbahnhof is the best railway station in Germany and the third-best in Europe (only surpassed by St Pancras railway station and Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof).\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFounded at the crossing of Via Regia and Via Imperii, Leipzig has been a major interchange of inter-European traffic and commerce since medieval times. After the Reunification of Germany, immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nOpened in 1915, Leipzig Central Station is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the ICE and Intercity network of the Deutsche Bahn as well as a connection point for S-Bahn and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\nIn Leipzig, the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg-)Berlin-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Munich and Dresden-Leipzig-Erfurt-Frankfurt am Main-(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. After completion of the high-speed line to Erfurt, the ICE will run on both lines via Leipzig/Halle Airport and Erfurt. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)-Magdeburg-Braunschweig-Hannover-Dortmund-K\u00f6ln and -Bremen-Oldenburg(-Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via two S-Bahn lines, one of which runs hourly via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200 km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300 km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg is scheduled for completion in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network will considerably reduce the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200 km/h. The ICE will also be able to operate from Leipzig to Dresden in the near future. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long City Tunnel, which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a large freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\n\n=== Suburban train ===\n\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and Bayerischer Bahnhof leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n\n=== Tramway and Buses ===\n\nThe Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe, existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\nThe total length of the tram network is 149.9 km (93.1 mi), making it the largest in Saxony ahead of Dresden (130.2 km (80.9 mi)) and the second largest in Germany after Berlin (193.6 km (120.3 mi)).\nThe longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be bicycle-friendly. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\nSince 2004 there is a bicycle-sharing system. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the A 14 in the north, the A 9 in the west and the A 38 in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the A 72 is also partly under construction or being planned.\nThe federal roads B 2, B 6, B 87, B 181, B 184 and B 186 lead through the city area.\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\nLeipzig has a dense network of carsharing stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a ridesharing provider. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n\n=== Long-distance buses ===\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5 million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and Leipziger Messe for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLeipzig/Halle Airport is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). DHL uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines Aerologic and European Air Transport Leipzig.\nThe former military airport near Altenburg, Thuringia called Leipzig-Altenburg Airport about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by Ryanair until 2010.\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the Elster-Saale canal, White Elster and Saale was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of forced labor. The Lindenauer port was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and Karl-Heine canal respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, New Luppe, Plei\u00dfe, and Parthe) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing mill races and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused open cast mines, the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the Elbe from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Quotations ==\nMein Leipzig lob' ich mir!

          "We came here but unfortunately they closed the aquarium and we didn\u2019t see the penguins \ud83d\ude22. Then we thought we\u2019d see the little new elephant but no. So I was disappointed but the kids still had fun and enjoyed all other animals. The zoo itself is very nicely laid out and has a",
          "Zoo Leipzig has always been one of my favorites. It is impressive to see how much investment is flowing back into developing the zoo! At times, the intense renovation becomes obvious. Yet, not only does the zoo manage to navigate its visitors around the major inconveniences,",
          "We have visited with my family many zoos already and this one is a bit of special. They have a big parking lot for cars, but better to be early. We cam at 10:00 and we had to wait more than 20 minutes to even park the car. So be prepared as there is many people there. Rest was",
          "21 euros to get in (adult), you given a map but everything is signposted,, don't worry if you can't read German, as there is English and pictures to help you out. There were a few enclosures, that were empty but overall you can see most of the animals. I spent around two hours",
          "Coming from a city with a great zoo, this zoo took me by surprise and far exceeded my exceptions. It is large and clean. They have a domed area with tropical plants, bridges and even a Disney-like boat ride that takes you through the earths life cycle. I went with a friend,",
          "Especially interesting is the tropical Gondwanaland. When you enter the temperature controlled building, you immediately feel like being in the tropical rain forest! Definitely one of the must during your Leipzig visit. Walking distance from the Centre of town/Railway station!",
          "This is definitely the best zoo I've ever been to. It's divided into themed areas such as Asia, Africa, Pongoland (home of the apes), and Gondwanaland (tropical rainforests from 3 continents), etc. Most enclosures resemble natural habitats where you can see different species",
          "We visited many zoos across Europe and Asia. This is the no. One in our ranking far beyond London zoo, Berlin zoo and other big famous names. Lots of good explanation and simple comparison signs for kids. Rare animals so close to observe and make you stay in a spot longer than",
          "Very big zoo with many animals! Unfortunately many of the animals are stuck in way to small enclosures and does not appear to be very happy. The monkeys and savanna animals had abit more space but some of the big cats looked really sad in their small cages..",
          "If you or your kids are at all interested in animals, this is the best zoo I've been to. For about 20 years they've been investing heavily in converting old enclosures, adding new areas, and greatly improving animal welfare. If you've young kids and live in or near Leipzig, a",
          "Amazing zoo in the middle of the city. Leipzig zoo is something special, not only for the visitors but also for the animals. The enclosures here are great and you can see that the majority of the animals are completely at home in their habitat. Gondwana land is a beautiful",
          "What a wonderful and wide open zoo this is in the middle of the city. But you forget that. It\u2019s a lot of wide open spaces. They are building a new site and the aquarium is under construction and all the animals in Africa seemed to be on safari. Yet we saw a lot of animals here",
          "What a beautiful zoo with several very special species. They definitely are aware of the evolution of zoos in the future. You can spend ours of watching the apes in pongoland or the birds in gondwanaland.",
          "Definitely the best zoo I've been to, just for the range of animals. There is an amazing aquarium and a huge rainforest enclosure with lots of birds and bats! You could spend all day here and it wouldn't be enough!",
          "Great theme-oriented zoo with large areas for the animals. Fantastic tropical hall \u201aGondwana Land\u2018. And attractive Caf\u00e9s and Restaurants. Very well worth a visit!",
          "I have been to Leipzig Zoo many times, alone and also with my family. The Zoo itself is spread out on a huge area. It is well organised. There are ample rest spots and Restaurants where you get continent specific cuisines. The entry fee is little high.",
          "My wife and I visited the zoo predominantly to see the two Formosan (Chinese) Pangolins that are resident, the only two Pangolins in the whole of Europe. The Pangolins are in a small enclosure in the elephant house, and we were delighted to see them being very active. The best",

          "One of the best zoos in Europe, specifically the newly designed animal worlds - you need some time and a bit of luck to spot the animals in the large and green areas. There are usually several viewing spots that enable the search from different perspecitves.",
          "I think one of the most beautiful zoo I have ever visited. The animals are well fed and seem to be happy with the zoo. There are many options for children and the greenhouse for the animals to stay in the winter is great, Not to mention the fantastic structure \"greenhouse\" where",
          "I went to this zoo after reading that was one of kind, modern and unique. Unfortunately there was some unpleasant situations that I did not expect when you visit a zoo. The worst was that everywhere I went there was people smoking! I can not understand how is this allowed at the",
          "The zoo was divided by regions. The amazon rainforest was my favorite with the monkeys park. It is a must go, you can spend an entire day there and will still missed things to do or see. They have restaurants in every area. Service is excellent, though some of the staff didn't",
          "Didn't expect the place is so huge! We spend there ~4 hours and see less than half of the zoo. One of the biggest Leipzig's attractions. Good access by any means of transportation. When tired there are many possibilities to rest and eat. Lots of attractions for big and small",
          "Very nice zoo, little bit expensive, but with nice atmosphere. I can recomand this place with o\u0159 without children.",
          "One of the best laid out zoo's I have been to, animals all looked in tip top condition. The enclosures are large and nice to see a mixture of animals together. Spent 3.5 hours there including a snack. Would recommend for 21 Euro entrance fee per person as you could stay longer",
          "The Bear Pit play area was a huge hit with my teenage daughters. There are mazes and things to discover everywhere. There is something anarchic to it.The zoo is very good also.",
          "One of the best zoos I've ever seen. Staff friendly, lots of activities for kids (not so much for toddlers though).",
          "Animals seem happy in wide, full of nature enclosures. Unfortunately I could stay only 2 hours and could not see all. I especially love Pongoland where I could see gorillas, chimps, and orangutans with their children and babies,",
          "The Leipzig Zoo is exceptional for its enclosures and great ability to house different animals together. Gondwanaland is amazing..loved the boat ride and the great scale. Pongoland was the best habitat I have seen for apes..well designed both inside and outside spaces.",
          "You'll need the whole day to truly enjoy it! Make sure you'll do the boat trip throught ,,Gondwanaland'' !!!",
          "To enjoy the Leipzig Zoo you will need a day time if you are planing to visit it with kids and without any rush. It is highly recommended to start with it in the mornings so that you can join the feedings of the animals - ask for it at the to ticket office.",
          "We visited the Zoo in a very warm day... May be that's the reason we simple didn't find many animals in the cages - seems like they hided somewhere in a shade. Actually I can understand them because we also felt not comfortable in such a weather. So the only recommendation I",
          "Very nice zoo that is easy to get around and can be completed in less than a day. We spent five hours and had a long lunch with the Giraffes. There is a new dome exhibit that is focused on South American animals. I recommend watching the elephants swim and eating lunch in the",
          "It was pleasant experience for me in roaming around the different environments that the zoo had. Right from African forests to Asian elephants, it is worth going. Good place to spend the day.",
          "Zoo OK if animals at risk but otherwise not my thing. Small enclosure for seals awful. Gwondala land hot, plant filled and thin on creatures.",
          "This was a lovely quiet area so close to the city centre. Plenty of animals to visit with a great boat ride in the bio dome. Plenty of places to eat and drink too.",
          "This is a place that my 8 yr nephew really enjoyed!! I noticed many adults without kids .... very clean and well kept . Highly recommended if you are going to Leipzig with kids.",
          "You can experience around 850 animal species living in habitats created close to their natural ones within six exciting theme worlds.",
          "We visited Gondwanaland at night with a included dinner. The boattour tried to offer relevant information about evolution but they could just as well skip that because it would be far nicer to spend that time observing the real forrest. The rest of the rainforest exhibit is",
          "Really enjoyed this zoo. Easy walk from city centre. Lots to see in nice enclosures and good walkways with plenty of view points. Animals looked well cared for. We spent 3 hours there but really needed more time so hopefully go back if we visit Leipzig again.",
          "I've visited over 200 zoos internationally and Leipzig would definitely rate as an amazing experience, and not just for zoo nerds like myself. The Great Ape complex is the best I've seen anywhere and the collection successfully exhibits and breeds Gorillas, Orangs, Chimpanzees",
          "Great experience for all ages. Huge range of animals in interesting and visitor friendly settings. Enough of the exhibitions and animals are indoors to make the zoo an all weather option. Staff friendly, prices reasonable. If visiting towards the end of the day, you can purchase",
          "The zoo well maintained. The zoo has a tropical theme inside, and as an Indonesian, I was surprised how their plan the interior for a tropical theme. When I went inside, I felt like I was in my home country hehe. The zoo is lovely, and the animals are taking care well in there.",
          "Unfortunately the winter is not the best season to visit zoo's because most animals are in their holes or inside. Also in this zoo. But I think that in the summer it is great here. Gondwanaland is beautiful and the aquarium too.",
          "Real lovely Zoo with a lot of animals and attractions. Take your time to see everything. You'll need the whole day.",
          "I was sceptical about this zoo visit as I love all wildlife and animals in pens it doesn't sit easy with me. However my wife was keen to visit and it is very accessible being very close to the city centre (within walking distance of the Seaside Park Hotel). It was a revelation,",
          "What can I say about this place it was brilliant!!! Very clean all the animals looked to be happy in large enclosures. For me the best part was under the dome in the tropical forest the boat ride and rope bridges were fab.I would highly recommend this for anybody to visit.",
          "Me and my wife both loved the zoo. Place is clean, animals look happy, and when you think tbat you visited all, you find more stuff to see. We've been whole day there and definately will come again, with childrens next time",
          "We visit this zoo for first time and marking of the zoo is great and animals are beautiful and clean...",
          "This is I think this the best zoo I have ever visited. There are no cages and the animals live in their normal habitat, they have a lot of room and the parks are very interesting and they have a lot for kids",
          "Animals looked content nice spaces and survival better than in wild. Good programmes. Visitors could be more respectful.",
          "Great place with a large selection of animals for all the family. Great for an entire day out with friends and family. If you don\u2019t mind be overrun with kids and large families, then it\u2019s fine. The only downside is the lion who is on his own, which is sad and the elephants are",
          "The zoo is very big and there is so much to see! We spent about 3 hours and the anumals were out, there is a great playground, lots of places to stop and rest. I wish we could go back!",
          "I always try to make sure the animals are ok. They seemed great there and I even got a special dance from one of the little birds. He liked my colourful dress :)",
          "One of the best zoos I have been to (eg. Sydney and Singapore which are both great) plus it's directly in the city. Large areas for the animals especially the elephant, primates and African areas. It takes a good day to explore all of it. Worth doing with and without kids.",
          "It is very rare to have a zoo 10 mins walk from a city centre, so that's why i went. It is v pleasant,relaxed zoo, highlights were seeing a snow leopard & komodo dragons. If u don't have kids & you want to save 6euro, you could go for last 3 hours of the day",
          "This is a super zoo with good enclosures for the animals and good walk around. Set off the hole day for this visit",
          "Zoos around the world should take note. This is a great model for what a zoo should be! Wagons and blankets for the kid, playgrounds at every station, arts and crafts, and always staff around to answer questions. I was impressed.",
          "One of the most popular family attractions in Leipzig, it is best to get there as early as possible. Although a bit pricey (21Euro per adult for a day ticket) it is worth every cent. The zoo is huge and one day is hardly enough to see everything! The map and layout is very",
          "I see a lot of positive reviews for this zoo and I hate to soil the party but I did not enjoy it at all. It is expensive and the staff are not very friendly. It is old-fashioned, and although I liked some of the quaint architectural details, I don't think the animals are well",
          "This zoo is widely regarded as one of the best in the world and we would not disagree with that assessment. It is well set out, with a wonderful aquarium and a variety of animals and birds easy to see and watch in comfort, especially the big cats, the orang-utans and the chimps.",
          "The best zoo I visited so far... it seems they though about all the small details. don't miss the Kuala :)",
          "Kids were very excited about our trip to zoo and they were not disappointed, they really enjoyed the full day. Walked for miles and saw so many different animals in lovely conditions and habitats Enjoyed learning about the animals and listening this the keeper talks during the",
          "It was a saturaday and packed with people reflecting its popularity with locals and visitors. So many people it was hard to walk sometimes hard to see exhibits. Convenient to tram 12. Most people on tram were going to zoo. All the exhibits, Gondwanaland, Africa, etc.. wonderful.",
          "This is rather pricey, but when you go inside and realise how vast the space is, and how many animals are present, you realise it is good value for money. In particular, very impressed at the indoor tropical environment that was bigger than I could ever imagine. A well",
          "The Leipzig Zoo is truly outstanding, especially Gondwana Land. It is in walking distance fron the central station. Highly recommended!",
          "We spent a whole day out yesterday at the Leipzig Zoo. It opens at 9am but we are not such early birds on a day off and arrived around 10.30am, eventually leaving around 5.15pm - so a big day out! The entrance ticket isn't cheap (\u20ac21 per adult) so as a short term visitor we",

          "Weekend away in Leipzig? Do not miss spending a day at this zoo, it is brilliant, really set out well, animals clearly visible, plenty of places to stop and rest for a drink or bite to eat (you will need to rest your feet). Best place to eat was the place by the zebras and",
          "20.000 sqm tropical garden under one roof - a wow. Paired with great restaurants it's a must. Going back to the rest of the zoo you'll be impressed by the really large lions area (with restaurant to view the animals) and a great zone for the meerkats. Enjoy the big ape's house",
          "This zoo is a very special one with all its attractions - especially Gondwanaland which brings the visitor to the rainforest in a boat and Pongoland where monkeys live in a surrounding close to their natural habitats. Bring enough time!!!!",
          "My husband and I did the evening tickets (15\u20ac for 16:00-19:00). It took us 3 hours and 15 minutes to walk the whole zoo at a semi-leisurely pace. They did not rush us out right at 7:00, but let us leave at our pace. Very few zoo employees spoke any English, but that was not a",
          "We visited just after Christmas there where a lot off visitors to the zoo and a lack of animals. Some of the animals where kept in small areas and where pacing up and down a little upsetting. Not the best zoo we have visited.",
          "Although I always feel sorry for the wild animals locked up, this zoo has more space for most of them than ordinary zoos. Our visit was in cold weather, so the monkeys of all kinds where not able to be outside in their garden and therefore looked rather depressed. The 8",

          "Leipzig Zoo has changed into one of the most modern of its kind in europe. Absolutely attractive are the the centre for Big apes (greatest in Europe) and the trpical giant hall \"Gondwanaland\". In summertime the Africa Savannah too, where you can abserve animals from this",
          "The Leipzig Zoo was a very pleasant surprise. There was lots to see with lots of eating areas. The aquarium is quite nice, with a 360 degree tank on the 2nd floor that has sharks, eels and some of the larger fish. The first floor tanks contained small and medium sized fish.",
          "It's supposed to be one of GDR's show- pieces, but I just can't find a sence in looking at locked up wild animals, since I believe that they belong in their own habitat....",
          "Modern zoo with huge variety of animals. We liked the multimedia enriched information about the animals. A boat trip through Gondwanna-Land was the highlight.",
          "I absolutely loved the experience! Leipzig Zoo is a state-of-the-art animal park with loads of interactive features. You learn a lot about the animals, the environment they live in, and you can get really up-close. I especially loved the new Gondwana-Land exhibition. Great fun",

          "This zoo is really beautiful and full of different sceneries! Indoor and outdoor, there is so much to see! Definitely there is something for every taste, literally cauze also the restaurant is really good. I really enjoyed the day there and I recommend it for everyone! You",
          "I visited here on my own whilst visiting the city. The zoo is quite large and I would advise using the map to ensure you don't miss anything. It is very hot and cold going in and out of buildings so be prepared to take coats off and on a lot. There are lots of animals to see",
          "Yet another, typical zoo. If it wasn't for Gondwanaland dome (which in fact has nothing in common with Gondwana, more like with Nicaragua), I would classify it is as boring. Be prepared to stay in a line at the cashbox for some time, especially on sunny weekends.",
          "Still innovating and adding new enclosures . The walks are very nice with plenty to see. Kids can have their fun in a dragon park, a former bear enclosure. A visit worthwhile and a year card for the ones living in Leipzig is recommended.",
          "We visited as a large party (around 15 of us, with 3 children under 11) in December. The highlight of the visit was Gondwanaland, a large indoor part of the zoo. You can take a short boat trip around the inside, it costs an extra \u20ac1.50 and it was okay, good for historical facts",

          "We really enjoyed out trip to the Leipzig Zoo. Highlights for kids were the large indoor tropical area, the gorillas and the amazing playground",
          "You can spend hours here and we don't even have kids. I just enjoy visiting the zoo in any city I go to. This zoo is better than I expected and I went in the winter. Definitely make a stop here, it was thoroughly enjoying and tons of animals!!",
          "I went here several times, which is necessary because you cannot see it all in one day. The ape house is brilliant, one can observe the apes up close. The diversity of animals that one can see is brilliant.",
          "I bought a yearly pass because I loved this zoo so much and went many times. The enclosures are really big for most animals and the visibility is really good- here are quite a few up close viewing punts where you can see the elephants bathe, orangutans play and hippos swim..",

          "Looks like a large and well organized zoo, with a lot of animals and great spaces for animals. Unfortunattely, in the winter many animals were not available to see...not a good season to visit....",
          "Even on a freezing December day it did not disappoint. Really well-designed zoo with loads to do. We spent a whole day there. We especially enjoyed the tropical rainforest area called Gondwanaland. It's enclosed In a giant conservatory (so nice and warm on a cold day..) with a",

          "Visited the zoo on a frosty December weekday, and it was brilliant! We pretty much had the place to ourselves, so we really got close to the animals. It is a beautiful place with loads to see - we were there for hours. The greenhouse area with boat trip was especially good. Not",
          "The day I went to Leipzig zoo it poured with rain, however there is plenty of things to see that are indoors so this wasn't a problem. The aquarium and reptile building has an impressive collection, with many animals I've never seen in UK zoos. The gondwanaland exhibit is good",
          "An excellent place to spend a few hours. However I missed the 2 lions that were shot the week before I arrived.",
          "It is a nice zoo, located in central Leipzig and accessible by public transport. There is a huge car park across the road. The zoo is beautifully arranged and very well maintained. There is a nice cafe as well.",
          "We spend an afternoon at the Zoo. It's one of the nicest zoo that I have ever seen. The primate area is the best (but that is a well known fact). Terrarium is fairly small and as expected, animals are difficult to see. It would be nice to have more descriptions (in English) and",
          "The place its Huge!! and amazing! the variety of animals its just crazy! I liked to see the zebras together with other animals in huge open environments! just as if you took a safari! also the Hyenas! ... Lions! and tigers were awesome too!!",

          "Leipzig is by far the nicest zoo I have ever visited. It is well spread out so that the wide variety of animals have plenty of space, and it also mean that you get to spend a decent amount of time looking around. It does not feel crowded due to the amount of space, and we",
          "You can spend a few hours or a whole day here. Walking paths are wide, lots of shade, plenty of washroom facilities and a lot of places to sit, to have lunch or.snacks. The animal enclosures are large and.viewing areas are good for the smallest of children and tallest of adults.",
          "Had a day out at the zoo today, quite expensive to get in and restaurant was pricey too. Had to pay to park and had to queue for a table in the restaurant , not all the animals were out and a lot of cages were empty.",
          "It is the best so I have ever been!Huge range of animal,clean,modern and green. The entrence costs 18,50Eur but it worths. It is a good program for everybody (from 0 to 100years old).You can spend here min. 4-5 hours or all day.My favorite place was Bongoireland:)Check it and",
          "With a student ID the discounted entry is \u20ac14, not bad for a packed day of entertainment. Our group spent a good five hours walking through the zoo seeing as much of it as possible. We went on a Monday afternoon so it was not busy at all but I've heard it can get crowded on",
          "Though the price isn't low budget, if you can afford it, you should definitely go there. Reserve a whole day or at least 4-5 hours for a visit, then that money (18.50) is well invested. Make sure you are present at at least one or two \"events\" like feeding the monkeys. This is",
          "This ZOO is really something! You should not miss a koala bear and a tropical world! The restaurant in the ZOO is great as well. All very friendly and nice :)",
          "You could spend a whole day here easily. Loads of places to eat. Animals seemed well cared for with plenty of space for them. Tropical fish tanks truly amazing and well kept. Zoo map not very good - go online first and plan your visit",
          "I literally can't tell you how awesome this zoo is. There are lions and tigers and bears! (Oh my!) The aquarium is really cool, the monkey pen is amazing, the tropical rainforest thing is epic. Seriously. Go. To. The. Zoo!",
          "Tropical place and aquarium is so beautiful. But misses some animal like polar bear or panda. African animals are so near as if they can reach you",
          "The varieties of animals here are rich. The tropical house really made us feel like we were on a quick trip back to our tropical homeland (Vietnam). I also find the short boat tour quite nice.",
          "We enjoyed exploring the zoo even in a rainy day. Especially the tropical house is unique and realy worth a visit even there are not so many animals around. But we felt like visitng a jungle! Well kept, orginized, lots of space for animals....",
          "Spent the full afternoon. Primates area is the best (feeding time is great). The aquarium is nice, terrarium is small. All explanations are in German (downside), and one can only pay with cash inside. On the otherside, you can bring in your own food and drinks. If we were from",

          "Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this excellent zoo where it is clear that there has been huge investment in recent years. Only problem was that we did not give it enough time as it takes at least half a day to look around and longer would be better. The zoo is easily reached",

          "Wow, this was really one of the best zoos we've been to. Huge place, and it really feels like you're visiting the animals on their turf. Savanna with zebras, rhinos and giraffes really nice, and the monkey section phenomenal. Could not recommend it more, to fully appreciate you",
          "This was a really pleasant time spent at the zoo in Liepzig. Nothing spectacular, but all the animals shown had something special. Our favorites were the Meekats (Erdm\u00e4nnchen), they are really cude. The zoo is very clean and well organized. don't miss the Aquarium.",

          "This is fine zoo but not as great as Berlin or Prague. The best parts are big area with giraffes and zebras and especially the safari-type restaurant in the middle. Also everything related to apes are very good. Bad part is that there is way too much walking even with big kids.",

          "I read the review here before going to the zoo and I thank this person who told me to wear comfortable shoes. This zoo is simply big and has many things so you will walk fair bit and therefore you need the comfy shoes. There are many places for sitting down and eating so no",

          "Attended an evening event, approx 100 people, food was good, venue exciting, entering through the zoo or the center area for drinks and dinner, and walking out amongst the animals, was a memorable evening. Sadly, didn't see the zoo in day light, but I have heard it's a must do",

          "I think this is a good zoo for family and children. There are so many animals that the children may love, e.g., elephants and camel. The area is large, so prepare yourselves to stay there for 2 hours or more. Bring your umbrella or rain coat if the weather seems not good!",
          "Large enclosure which is good for the animal but means you migth miss some of the animals. there are some quite rare speciies e.g. Amur tigers and snow lepards. Itbwas great and very interesting, you better take your time and if possible go week days less people and more",

          "This is a rather humdrum affair. The most entertaining thing about it is the maze-like layout. We repeatedly found ourselves back at the flamingo compound. I'm not a big zoo fan but this was a convenient way of idling away a few hours. Many of the big attractions were in hiding",
          "Gondwanaland is without question one of the top 100 things to see in the world. So many impressive exhibits. Be sure to watch the elephants swimming from the underwater glass viewing at 10. Also be sure to see the pangolin feeding at noon. This is one of the most heavily",

          "Although the ticket was really expensive, but the zoo(over 100 years old) itself was really amazingly fun and interesting. It took as about 6 hours to finish seeing all the animals and sights. Must go to the big greenhouse, it's one of the \u2026",

          "This is an awesome zoo. The last years they rebuilt nearly every compound. And they still rebuild new one. The price is quite high. For citizens I recommend an annual card. It also gives you discount on food and zoo shops. You will find the \u2026",

          "An extremely nice zoo, one of the few where u actually see the animals and they have quite a reasonable space. The only bad bit was the tigers and in general the felines area: contrary to what said earlier, here spaces for the animals are very small and they are not happy. Shame!",

          "Wonderful place for relax and entertaining",
          "First time there and got really impressed. Huge sweeping area for many animals that mostly looked \"happy\". Yet, sometimes the typical \"Zoo\" feeling came up, i.e. cages seemed to be too small, animals showed abnormal behavior. Nevertheless, I can recommended this charmingly arranged place, especially the \"Gondwanaland\".",
          "Who doesn't like zoos amirite?",
          "My absolute favorite zoo in Germany. Great collection, great enclosures and really nice staff. The Gondwanahalle is one of the most amazing tropical halls in the world. Definitely one of the top zoos in Europe.",

          "Amazing zoo. I think it definitely belongs to the top 5 in Europe.",
          "One of the best I have visited. The self propagating boat ride inside the Gondwanaland was the highlight for me. It felt like, I am in amazon forest. The ticket price is bit on the higher side but its worth it. Also, its good to see special temperature zones for the comfort of the animals.",
          "We've been in many zoos. This has to be one of the best. Entertaining.",
          "It is really cheap compare to all you can see i spend 5 hours there. It has sections from different part of the world. And their animals well take cared of",
          "Such a large area with biodiversity of fauna and flora",
          "Nice place. But n\u00fcrnberg aquarium is better. Gondvanaland is worth visiting",

          "Had en excellent day here, highly recommended. Reasonable ticket price.",
          "It's a nice place to spend time with family, friends or couple couple. Just a bit expensive for a student like me. One day won't be enough to explore everything",
          "Is beautifully very very very good",
          "The Giraffes and tigers were kept in the most suitable locations to enjoy the beauty of their natural habitat and the elephants made my day. \nIn India, it is becoming quite rare to afford these huge, all the time hungry species but they are \u2026",

It was destroyed in the fire-bombings of World War II between 1943 and 1944.\nThe third Gewandhaus on Augustusplatz opened on 8 October 1981, two hundred years after the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra moved into the original hall.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe hall contains a concert organ: Schuke, Potsdam  IV-92-6638.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of concert halls\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nLeo Beranek, Concert Halls and Opera Houses: Musics, Acoustics, and Architecture, Springer, 2004, page 280.

        "wiki": "Leipzig (, also , , German: [\u02c8la\u026apts\u026a\u00e7] (listen);; Upper Saxon: Leibzsch) is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. With a population of 600,000 inhabitants as of 2019 (1.1 million residents in the larger urban zone), it is Germany's eighth most populous city as well as the second most populous city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin. Together with Halle (Saale), the largest city of the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt, the city forms the polycentric conurbation of Leipzig-Halle. Between the two cities (in Schkeuditz) lies Leipzig/Halle International Airport.\nLeipzig is located about 160 kilometres (99 mi) southwest of Berlin in the Leipzig Bay, which constitutes the southernmost part of the North German Plain, at the confluence of the White Elster River (progression: Saale\u2192 Elbe\u2192 North Sea) and two of its tributaries: the Plei\u00dfe and the Parthe. The name of the city as well as the names of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.\nLeipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire. The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes. Leipzig was once one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing. After the  Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East German terms, but its cultural and economic importance declined. Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy, which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry, severe unemployment, and urban blight. Starting around 2000, however, decline was first arrested and then reversed. Leipzig has undergone significant change with the restoration of major historical buildings, the demolition of derelict properties of little historical value, and the development of new industries and a modern transport infrastructure.Leipzig today is an economic centre, the most livable city in Germany, according to the GfK marketing research institution and has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, according to HWWI and Berenberg Bank. The city is one of two seats of the German National Library (together with Frankfurt), as well as the seat of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and ranks first in Germany and second in Europe according to Anthony Sheridan. Since the opening of the Leipzig City Tunnel in 2013, Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system. Leipzig is currently listed as a Gamma World City, Germany's \"Boomtown\" and as the European City of the Year 2019.Leipzig has long been a major centre for music, both classical as well as modern \"dark alternative music\" or darkwave genres. The Oper Leipzig is one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany. Leipzig is also home to the University of Music and Theatre \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\". It was during a stay in this city that Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem \"Ode to Joy\". The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Johann Sebastian Bach is one among many major composers who lived and worked in Leipzig.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Name ===\n\nThe name Leipzig is derived from the Slavic word Lipsk, which means \"settlement where the linden trees (British English: lime trees; U.S. English: basswood trees) stand\". An older spelling of the name in English is Leipsic. The Latin name Lipsia was also used. The name is cognate with Lipetsk (\u041b\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043a) in Russia and Liep\u0101ja in Latvia.\n\nIn 1937 the Nazi government officially renamed the city Reichsmessestadt Leipzig (Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig).Since 1989 Leipzig has been informally dubbed \"Hero City\" (Heldenstadt), in recognition of the role that the Monday demonstrations there played in the fall of the East German regime \u2013 the name alludes to the honorary title awarded in the former Soviet Union to certain cities that played a key role in the victory of the Allies during the Second World War. The common usage of this nickname for Leipzig up until the present is reflected, for example, in the name of a blog for local arts and culture, Heldenstadt.de.More recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\", \"Hypezig\" or \"The better Berlin\" for being celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for the vital lifestyle and creative scene with many startups.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nLeipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as urbs Libzi (Chronikon VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by Otto the Rich. Leipzig Trade Fair, started in the Middle Ages, has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world.\nThere are records of commercial fishing operations on the river Plei\u00dfe in Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the Margrave Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.There were a number of monasteries in and around the city, including a Franciscan monastery after which the Barfu\u00dfg\u00e4\u00dfchen (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks (Jacobskirche, destroyed in 1544) near the present day Ranst\u00e4dter Steinweg (the old Via Regia).\nThe foundation of the University of Leipzig in 1409 initiated the city's development into a centre of German law and the publishing industry, and towards being the location of the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) and the German National Library (founded in 1912).\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, two battles took place in Breitenfeld, about 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) outside Leipzig city walls. The first Battle of Breitenfeld took place in 1631 and the second in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.\nOn 24 December 1701, an oil-fueled street lighting system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig between Napoleonic France and an allied coalition of Prussia, Russia, Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended Napoleon's presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on Elba. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.When it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the Royal Saxon State Railways and the western one for the Prussian state railways.\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German labor party, the General German Workers' Association (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein, ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge Gr\u00fcnderzeit areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei became the largest cotton mill company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Daily production surpassed 5 million kilograms of yarn.During the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to World War II. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.\nOn 22 May 1930, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was elected mayor of Leipzig. He was well known as an opponent of the Nazi regime. He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of Felix Mendelssohn. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue, one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. Goerdeler was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.\n\nSeveral thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.\nBeginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the Gemeinde, a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.Like all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to aryanisation. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenh\u00e4user, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.As with other cities in Europe during the Holocaust, the Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the Nuremberg Laws. However, due to the Leipzig Trade Fair and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures. Shortly before Kristallnacht, Polish Jews living in the city were expelled.On 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the \"Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig\". In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in Zionism through Jewish citizens. Many of these Zionists attempted to flee before deportations began. On 28 October 1938, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of Polish Jews from Leipzig to Poland.On 9 November 1938, as part of Kristallnacht, in Gottschedstrasse (German: Gottschedstra\u00dfe), now a popular dining and nightlife area in Leipzig, synagogues and businesses were set on fire. Only a couple of days later, on 11 November 1938, many Jews in the Leipzig area were deported to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. As World War II came to an end, much of Leipzig was destroyed. Following the war, the Communist Party of Germany (German: Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, KPD) provided aid for the reconstruction of the city.In 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported. On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors. According to records of the Theresienstadt deportation, only 53 Jews survived.Until late 1943, there was little threat of aerial bombings to the city. However, on the morning of 4 December 1943, the British Royal Air Force dropped over 1,000 tons of explosives, resulting in the death of nearly 1,000 civilians. This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, the storm was too overwhelming for them. Unlike its neighbouring city of Dresden, this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945. In April 1945 the SS Gruppehfuhrer/Mayor of Leipzig Bruno Erich Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter; the Deputy Mayor/Treasurer of Leipzig, Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter, and a Volkssturm Major Walter D\u00f6nicke committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\nThe United States turned the city over to the Red Army as it pulled back from the line of contact with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city.In the mid-20th century, the city's trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the Comecon Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which East Germany was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the Monument to the Battle of the Nations.\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in. Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.In October 1989, after prayers for peace at St. Nicholas Church, established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the Monday demonstrations started as the most prominent mass protest against the East German government. The reunification of Germany, however, was at first not good for Leipzig. The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city's speciality was, in terms of the advanced economy of  reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished. As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunificaiton, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.Starting in 2000, an ambitious (and subsequently much-praised) urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig's decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving as much as possible of the city's urban structure, especially its attractive historic center and various architectural gems, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nNowadays, Leipzig is an important economic center in Germany. Since the 2010s, the city has been celebrated by the media as a hip urban center with a very high quality of living. It is often called \"The new Berlin\". Leipzig is also Germany's fastest growing city. Leipzig was the German candidate for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful. After ten years of construction, the Leipzig City Tunnel opened on 14 December 2013. Leipzig forms the centerpiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system, which operates in the four German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLeipzig lies at the confluence of the rivers White Elster, Plei\u00dfe and Parthe, in the Leipzig Bay, on the most southerly part of the North German Plain, which is the part of the North European Plain in Germany. The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the Leipzig Riverside Forest, though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat though there is also some evidence of moraine and drumlins.\nAlthough there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-cast mines in the region, many of which are being converted to use as lakes. Also see: Neuseenland\nLeipzig is also situated at the intersection of the ancient roads known as the Via Regia (King's highway), which traversed Germany in an east\u2013west direction, and the Via Imperii (Imperial Highway), a north\u2013south road.\nLeipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and the current \"ring\" road around the historic centre of the city follows the line of the old city walls.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nSince 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten districts, which in turn contain a total of 63 subdistricts. Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike many places located in Eastern parts of Germany, Leipzig has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb close to a Dfb [0 \u00b0C US isotherm]) with significant continental influences due to inland location. Winters are cool to cold, with an average of around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F). Summers are generally warm, averaging at 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) with daytime temperatures of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours a day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours a day).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nLeipzig has a population of about 570,000. In 1930, the population reached its historical peak of over 700,000. It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation. After almost doubling the city area by incorporation of surrounding towns in 1999, the number stabilised and started to rise again, with an increase of 1,000 in 2000. As of 2015, Leipzig is the fastest-growing city in Germany with over 500,000 inhabitants.\nThe growth of the past 10\u201315 years has mostly been due to inward migration. In recent years, inward migration accelerated, reaching an increase of 12,917 in 2014.In the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates. Births dropped from 7,000 in 1988 to less than 3,000 in 1994. However, the number of children born in Leipzig has risen since the late 1990s. In 2011, it reached 5,490 births resulting in a RNI of \u221217.7 (\u2212393.7 in 1995).The unemployment rate decreased from 18.2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2014 and 7.6% in June 2017.The percentage of the population from an immigrant background is low compared with other German cities. As of 2012, only 5.6% of the population were foreigners, compared to the German national average of 7.7%.The number of people with an immigrant background (immigrants and their children) grew from 49,323 in 2012 to 77,559 in 2016, making them 13.3% of the city's population (Leipzig's population 579,530 in 2016).The largest minorities (first and second generation) in Leipzig by country of origin as of 31.12.2018 are:\n\n\n== Culture, sights and cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe historic central area of Leipzig features a Renaissance-style ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several baroque period trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the historicist style representative of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The new city hall, completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\nSome 64,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in Plattenbau buildings during Communist rule in East Germany. and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, at least 10% of Leipzig's population (50,000 people) are still living in Plattenbau accommodation. Gr\u00fcnau, for example, has approximately 40,000 people living in this sort of accommodation.The St. Paul's Church was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called Paulinum, which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings and structures ===\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of 205 metres (673 feet). With 142 metres (466 feet), the City-Hochhaus Leipzig is the tallest high-rise building in Leipzig. From 1972 to 1973 it was Germany's tallest building.\n\n\n=== Museums and the arts ===\nOne of the highlights of the city's contemporary arts was the Neo Rauch retrospective opening in April 2010 at the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts. This is a show devoted to the father of the New Leipzig School of artists. According to The New York Times, this scene \"has been the toast of the contemporary art world\" for the past decade. In addition, there are eleven galleries in the so-called Spinnerei.The Grassi Museum complex contains three more of Leipzig's major collections: the Ethnography Museum, Applied Arts Museum and Musical Instrument Museum (the last of which is run by the University of Leipzig). The university also runs the Museum of Antiquities.Founded in March 2015, the G2 Kunsthalle houses the Hildebrand Collection. This private collection focuses on the so-called New Leipzig School. Leipzig's first private museum dedicated to contemporary art in Leipzig after the turn of the millennium is located in the city centre close to the famous St. Thomas Church on the third floor of the former GDR processing centre.Other museums in Leipzig include the following:\n\nThe German Museum of Books and Writing is the world's oldest museum of its kind, founded in 1884.\nThe Egyptian Museum of the University of Leipzig comprises a collection of about 7,000 artefacts from several millennia.\nThe Schillerhaus is the house where Schiller lived in summer 1785.\nThe Zeitgeschichtliches Forum Leipzig (Forum of Contemporary History) shows the history of the German division and the everyday life in the socialist German Democratic Republic.\nNaturkundemuseum Leipzig is the city's natural history museum.\nThe Leipzig Panometer is a visual panorama displayed inside a former gasometer, accompanied by a thematic exhibition.\nThe \"Museum in der Runden Ecke\" is the best known museum in the city.

The composer Richard Wagner was born in Leipzig in 1813, in the Br\u00fchl.

It provides programmes to various TV and radio networks and has its own symphony orchestra, choir and a ballet.\nLeipziger Volkszeitung (LVZ) is the city's only daily newspaper. Founded in 1894, it has published under several different forms of government. The monthly magazine Kreuzer specializes in culture, festivities and the arts in Leipzig. Leipzig was also home to the world's first daily newspaper in modern times. The \"Einkommende Zeitungen\" were first published in 1650.\nLeipzig has one daily or semi-daily English-language publication, The Leipzig Glocal. It is an online-based magazine and blog that caters to an international as well as local audience. Besides publishing pages on jobs, doctors and movies available in English and other languages, the site's team of authors writes articles about lifestyle, arts & culture, politics, entertainment, Leipzig events, etc.\nOnce known for its large number of publishing houses, Leipzig had been called Buch-Stadt (book city), the most notable of them being branches of Brockhaus and Insel Verlag. Few are left after the years of economic decline during the German Democratic Republic, during which time Frankfurt developed as a much more important publishing center. Reclam, founded in 1828, was one of the large publishing houses to move away. Leipzig still has a book fair, but Frankfurt's is far bigger.\nThe German Library (Deutsche B\u00fccherei) in Leipzig is part of Germany's National Library. Its task is to collect a copy of every book published in German.\n\n\n== Quality of life ==\n\nIn December 2013, according to a study by GfK, Leipzig was ranked as the most livable city in Germany.In 2015/2016, Leipzig was named the second-best city for students in Germany (after Munich).In a 2017 study, the Leipzig inner city ranked first among all large cities in Germany due to its urban aesthetics, gastronomy, and shopping opportunities.Since 2018 it also has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, only surpassed by Munich in 2018 and Berlin in 2019.According to the 2017 Global Least & Most Stressful Cities Ranking, Leipzig was one of the least stressful cities in the World. It was ranked 25th out of 150 cities worldwide and above Dortmund, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Berlin.In 2018, Leipzig won the European Cities of Future prize in the category of \"Best Large City for Human Capital & Lifestyle\".Leipzig was named European City of the Year at the 2019 Urbanism Awards.According to the 2019 study by Forschungsinstitut Prognos, Leipzig is the most dynamic region in Germany. Within 15 years, the city climbed 230 places and occupied in 2019 rank 104 of all 401 German regions.Leipzig is one of 52 places to go in 2020 by The New York Times and the highest-ranking German destination.Leipzig Hauptbahnhof is the best railway station in Germany and the third-best in Europe (only surpassed by St Pancras railway station and Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof).\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFounded at the crossing of Via Regia and Via Imperii, Leipzig has been a major interchange of inter-European traffic and commerce since medieval times. After the Reunification of Germany, immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nOpened in 1915, Leipzig Central Station is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the ICE and Intercity network of the Deutsche Bahn as well as a connection point for S-Bahn and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\nIn Leipzig, the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg-)Berlin-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Munich and Dresden-Leipzig-Erfurt-Frankfurt am Main-(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. After completion of the high-speed line to Erfurt, the ICE will run on both lines via Leipzig/Halle Airport and Erfurt. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)-Magdeburg-Braunschweig-Hannover-Dortmund-K\u00f6ln and -Bremen-Oldenburg(-Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via two S-Bahn lines, one of which runs hourly via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200 km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300 km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg is scheduled for completion in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network will considerably reduce the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200 km/h. The ICE will also be able to operate from Leipzig to Dresden in the near future. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long City Tunnel, which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a large freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\n\n=== Suburban train ===\n\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and Bayerischer Bahnhof leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n\n=== Tramway and Buses ===\n\nThe Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe, existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\nThe total length of the tram network is 149.9 km (93.1 mi), making it the largest in Saxony ahead of Dresden (130.2 km (80.9 mi)) and the second largest in Germany after Berlin (193.6 km (120.3 mi)).\nThe longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be bicycle-friendly. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\nSince 2004 there is a bicycle-sharing system. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the A 14 in the north, the A 9 in the west and the A 38 in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the A 72 is also partly under construction or being planned.\nThe federal roads B 2, B 6, B 87, B 181, B 184 and B 186 lead through the city area.\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\nLeipzig has a dense network of carsharing stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a ridesharing provider. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n\n=== Long-distance buses ===\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5 million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and Leipziger Messe for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLeipzig/Halle Airport is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). DHL uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines Aerologic and European Air Transport Leipzig.\nThe former military airport near Altenburg, Thuringia called Leipzig-Altenburg Airport about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by Ryanair until 2010.\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the Elster-Saale canal, White Elster and Saale was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of forced labor. The Lindenauer port was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and Karl-Heine canal respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, New Luppe, Plei\u00dfe, and Parthe) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing mill races and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused open cast mines, the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the Elbe from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Quotations ==\nMein Leipzig lob' ich mir!

        "wiki": "Clara Zetkin (; German: [\u02c8ts\u025btki\u02d0n]; n\u00e9e Ei\u00dfner [\u02c8a\u026asn\u0250]; 5 July 1857 \u2013 20 June 1933) was a German Marxist theorist, activist, and advocate for women's rights.Until 1917, she was active in the Social Democratic Party of Germany, then she joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) and its far-left wing, the Spartacist League; this later became the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), which she represented in the Reichstag during the Weimar Republic from 1920 to 1933.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Background and education ===\nThe eldest of three children, Clara Zetkin was born Clara Josephine Eissner in Wiederau, a peasant village in Saxony, now part of the municipality K\u00f6nigshain-Wiederau. Her father, Gottfried Eissner, was a schoolmaster and church organist who was a devout Protestant, while her mother, Josephine Vitale, had French roots, came from a middle-class family from Leipzig, and was highly educated. In 1872 her family moved to Leipzig where she was educated at the Leipzig Teachers\u2019 College for Women. While in school she established contacts with the infant Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD; Social Democratic Party).\n\nBecause of the ban placed on socialist activity in Germany by Bismarck in 1878, Zetkin left for Zurich in 1882 then went into exile in Paris, where she studied to be a journalist and a translator. During her time in Paris she played an important role in the foundation of the Socialist International group. She also adopted the name of her lover, the Russian-Jewish Ossip Zetkin, a devoted Marxist, with whom she had two sons, Maxim and following two years later Konstantin (known as Kostja). Ossip Zetkin became severely ill in the early period of 1889, passing away only a few months later, in June. Following the loss of her husband, she moved to Stuttgart with her children. Zetkin was married to the artist Georg Friedrich Zundel, eighteen years her junior, from 1899 to 1928.\n\n\n=== Early engagement in the Social Democratic Party ===\nClara Zetkin's political career began after being introduced to Ossip Zetkin, who she later married. Within a few months of attending and taking part in socialist meetings, Zetkin became entirely committed to the party, offering a Marxist approach and for the demand of women's liberation. Around the time of 1880, due to the political climate in Germany, Zetkin went into exile in Switzerland and later in France. Upon her return to Germany, nearly a decade later, she became the editor of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) newspaper for women, Die Gleichheit (Equality), a post she occupied for twenty-five years.Having studied to become a teacher, Zetkin developed connections with the women's movement and the labour movement in Germany from 1874. In 1878 she joined the Socialist Workers' Party (Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei, SAP). This party had been founded in 1875 by merging two previous parties: the ADAV formed by Ferdinand Lassalle and the SDAP of August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht. In 1890 its name was changed to its modern version Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).\nIn the SPD, Zetkin, along with Rosa Luxemburg, her close friend and confidante, was one of the main figures of the far-left wing of the party. In the debate on Revisionism at the turn of the 20th century they jointly attacked the reformist theses of Eduard Bernstein, who had rejected the ideology of a revolutionary change, towards \"revolutionary socialism\".\n\n\n=== Fight for women's rights ===\nZetkin was very interested in women's politics, including the fight for equal opportunities and women's suffrage through a socialist means. She helped to develop the social-democratic women's movement in Germany; from 1891 to 1917 she edited the SPD women's newspaper Die Gleichheit (Equality). In 1907 she became the leader of the newly founded \"Women's Office\" at the SPD. She also contributed to International Women's Day (IWD). In August 1910, an International Women's Conference was organized to precede the general meeting of the Socialist Second International in Copenhagen, Denmark. Inspired in part by American socialists' actions, Zetkin, K\u00e4te Duncker and others proposed that \"a special Women's Day\" be organized annually, although no date was specified at that conference. Delegates (100 women from 17 countries) agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights including suffrage for women. The following year on 19 March 1911, IWD was marked for the first time, by over a million people in Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland.However, Zetkin was deeply opposed to the concept of \"bourgeois feminism,\" which she claimed was a tool to divide the unity of the working classes. In a speech she delivered to the Second International in 1899 she stated:\n\nThe working women, who aspire to social equality, expect nothing for their emancipation from the bourgeois women\u2019s movement, which allegedly fights for the rights of women. That edifice is built on sand and has no real basis. Working women are absolutely convinced that the question of the emancipation of women is not an isolated question which exists in itself, but part of the great social question. They realize perfectly clear that this question can never be solved in contemporary society, but only after a complete social transformation.She viewed the feminist movement as being primarily composed of upper-class and middle-class women who had their own class interests in mind, which were incompatible with the interests of working-class women. Thus, feminism and the socialist fight for women's rights were incompatible. In her mind, socialism was the only way to truly end the oppression of women. One of her primary goals was to get women out of the house and into work so that they could participate in trade unions and other workers rights organizations in order to improve conditions for themselves. While she argued that the socialist movement should fight to achieve reforms that would lessen female oppression, she was convinced that such reforms could only prevail if they were embedded into a general move towards socialism, since, otherwise, they could easily be eradicated by future legislation.\n\n\n=== Opposition to World War I ===\nDuring the period of the First World War, at the international women's peace conference in Switzerland, activists, revolutionaries, and supporters gathered to confront the concern for unity among workers across the battle lines. There, Zetikin spoke:\n\nWho profits from this war? Only a tiny minority in each nation: The manufacturers of rifles and cannons, of armor-plate and torpedo boats, the shipyard owners and the suppliers of the armed forces' needs. In the interests of their profits, they have fanned the hatred among the people, thus contributing to the outbreak of the war. The workers have nothing to gain from this war, but they stand to lose everything that is dear to them.Around that time Zetkin, along with Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Luise K\u00e4hler and other influential SPD politicians, rejected the party's policy of Burgfrieden (a truce with the government, promising to refrain from any strikes during the war). Among other anti-war activities, Zetkin organized an international socialist women's anti-war conference in Berlin in 1915. Because of her anti-war opinions, she was arrested several times during the war, and in 1916 taken into \"protective custody\" (from which she was later released on account of illness).\n\n\n=== Becoming a member of the Communist Party ===\nIn 1916 Zetkin was one of the co-founders of the Spartacist League and the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) which had split off in 1917 from its mother party, the SPD, in protest at its pro-war stance.In January 1919, after the German Revolution in November of the previous year, the KPD (Communist Party of Germany) was founded; Zetkin also joined this and represented the party from 1920 to 1933 in the Reichstag. She interviewed Lenin on \"The Women's Question\" in 1920.\n\nUntil 1924 Zetkin was a member of the KPD's central office; from 1927 to 1929 she was a member of the party's central committee. She was also a member of the executive committee of the Communist International (Comintern) from 1921 to 1933. She also presided over an international secretariat for women, which was created by the Communist International in October 1920. In June 1921, the Second International Conference of Communist Women, which was held in Moscow and was chaired by Clara Zetkin changed the date of the International Women's Day to 8 March. This remains the date of the IWD until today. In 1925 she was elected president of the German left-wing solidarity organisation Rote Hilfe. In August 1932, as the chairwoman of the Reichstag by seniority, she was entitled to give the opening address, and used it to call for workers to unite in the struggle against fascism, stating:\n\nThe most important immediate task is the formation of a United Front of all workers in order to turn back fascism [..] in order to preserve for the enslaved and exploited, the force and power of their organization as well as to maintain their own physical existence. Before this compelling historical necessity, all inhibiting and dividing political, trade union, religious and ideological opinions must take a back seat. All those who feel themselves threatened, all those who suffer and all those who long for liberation must belong to the United Front against fascism and its representatives in government.She was a recipient of the Order of Lenin (1932) and the Order of the Red Banner (1927).\n\n\n=== Exile and death ===\nWhen Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party took over power, the Communist Party of Germany was banned, following the Reichstag fire in 1933. Zetkin went into exile for the last time, this time to the Soviet Union. She died there, at Arkhangelskoye, near Moscow, in 1933, aged nearly 76. Her ashes were placed in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, by the Moscow Kremlin Wall, near the Red Square. The funeral was attended by leading communists from all over Europe, including Joseph Stalin and Nadezhda Krupskaya (Lenin's widow).After 1949, Zetkin became a much-celebrated heroine in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), and every major city had a street named after her. Her name can still be found on the maps of the former lands of the GDR.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n== Posthumous honors ==\nZetkin was memorialized on the ten mark banknote and twenty mark coin of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (East Germany).\nAfter 1949, every major city in the GDR had a street named after her.\nIn 1954, the GDR established the Clara Zetkin Medal (Clara-Zetkin-Medaille).\nIn 1955, the city council of Leipzig established a new recreation area near the city center called \"Clara-Zetkin-Park\"\nIn 1967, a statue of Clara Zetkin, sculpted by GDR artist Walter Arnold, was erected in Johannapark, Leipzig in commemoration of her 110th birthday.\nIn 1987, the GDR issued a stamp with her picture.\nSince 2011, the German party Die Linke issues an annual \"Clara-Zetkin-Frauenpreis\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFull works of Clara Zetkin available (in English) at the Marxist Internet archive\nFull works of Clara Zetkin available (in German) at the Marxist Internet archive\nTimeline of Clara Zetkin's life (in German), at the Lebendiges Museum Online (LEMO)\nClara Zetkin, Clara Zetkin: Selected Writing, 1991, ISBN 0-7178-0611-1.\nDorothea Reetz, Clara Zetkin as a Socialist Speaker, Intl.

        "wiki": "The Museum of Applied Arts (German: Museum f\u00fcr Angewandte Kunst) is a museum in Leipzig, Germany.  It is the second oldest museum of decorative arts in the country, founded just six years after the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin.  Today it is part of the Grassi Museum, an institution which also includes the Museum of Ethnography and the Museum of Musical Instruments, based in a large building on the Johannisplatz.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\nThe museum owns around 90,000 items, of European and non-European origin, featuring decorative art from all eras since antiquity.  The collection is particularly strong on exhibits from the 1920s and '30s.  The items include ceramics, textiles, glassware, metalwork, sculpture, furniture and coinage.More than 2,000 items are on permanent display, currently split between two exhibitions: \"From Antiquity to Historism\" and \"Asian Art\". A third exhibition, \"From Art Nouveau to the Present Day\", is scheduled to open in late 2011.  There are also special temporary exhibitions.\nOne highlight of the museum is the \"Roman Hall\", with panels salvaged from a palace in Eythra, near Leipzig, which was demolished to make way for coal mining.There is also a graphics collection with over 50,000 works, a photographic archive of 75,000 items, and a library with around 60,000 titles.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum was founded in 1874 as the Kunstgewerbemuseum (Museum of Arts and Crafts).  It moved into its present location, the New Grassi Building, in 1926. Numerous exhibits were destroyed by bombs during World War II.Between 1981 and 1994, no permanent exhibition was possible because of damage to the building.  The Grassi Museum was refurbished from 2001 to 2006.  The Museum of Applied Arts received its present name in 2005, and the new permanent exhibition opened in 2007.The museum is one of around 20 so-called \"Cultural Lighthouses\" in the German government's Blue Book of culturally significant sites in the former East Germany.  As such, it is a member of the Konferenz Nationaler Kultureinrichtungen.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page in English",

        "wiki": "The Monument to the Battle of the Nations (German: V\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal, sometimes shortened to V\u00f6lki) is a monument in Leipzig, Germany, to the 1813 Battle of Leipzig, also known as the Battle of the Nations. Paid for mostly by donations and the city of Leipzig, it was completed in 1913 for the 100th anniversary of the battle at a cost of six million goldmarks.\nThe monument commemorates Napoleon's defeat at Leipzig, a crucial step towards the end of hostilities in the War of the Sixth Coalition. The coalition armies of Russia, Prussia, Austria and Sweden were led by Tsar Alexander I of Russia and Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. There were Germans fighting on both sides, as Napoleon's troops also included conscripted Germans from the left bank of the Rhine annexed by France, as well as troops from his German allies of the Confederation of the Rhine.\nThe structure is 91 metres (299 ft) tall. It contains over 500 steps to a viewing platform at the top, from which there are views across the city and environs.  The structure makes extensive use of concrete, and the facings are of granite. It is widely regarded as one of the best examples of Wilhelmine architecture. The monument is said to stand on the spot of some of the bloodiest fighting, from where Napoleon ordered the retreat of his army. It was also the scene of fighting in World War II, when Nazi forces in Leipzig made their last stand against U.S. troops.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nBetween 16\u201319 October 1813, the Battle of the Nations was fought by the coalition armies of Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Sweden against the French army of Napoleon aided by Polish and Italian troops as well as Germans from the Confederation of the Rhine and German lands west of the Rhine directly annexed into France. Napoleon's army was defeated and compelled to return to France while the Allies invaded France early the next year. Napoleon was forced to abdicate and was exiled to Elba in May 1814.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nIn 1814 proposals to build a monument to commemorate the battle were made. Among the supporters of the project, author Ernst Moritz Arndt called for the construction of \"a large and magnificent (monument), like a colossus, a pyramid, or the cathedral of Cologne\". Architect Friedrich Weinbrenner created a design for the monument that ultimately was not used.In 1863, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the battle, a foundation stone was placed, but the memorial was not built. Clemens Thieme, a member of the Verein f\u00fcr die Geschichte Leipzigs (Association for the History of Leipzig) learned during a meeting of the association about the past plans to build a monument. Interested in resuming the project, Thieme, who was also a member of the Apollo masonic lodge, proposed the project during a meeting and gained the support of his fellow masons. In 1894, he founded the Deutsche Patriotenbund (Association of German Patriots) which raised, by means of donations and a lottery, the funds necessary to construct the monument for the 100th anniversary . The following year, the city of Leipzig donated a 40,000-square-metre (9.9-acre) site for the construction. The project was commissioned to Bruno Schmitz, due to his previous works at the Kyffh\u00e4user. The construction began in 1898. The chosen construction site was the spot where Napoleon ordered the retreat of his army. Thieme financed part of the construction as well, and for his complete dedication to the project, he was named an Honorary Citizen of Leipzig.In 1898, the construction started. 82,000 cubic metres (107,000 cu yd) of earth was moved; 26,500 granite blocks were used and the project resulted in a total cost of 6,000,000\u2133 (27,886,558\u20ac in 2020), the monument was finished in 1913. On the 18th of October 1913 the V\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal was inaugurated in the presence of about 100 000 people including the emperor Wilhelm II, and all the reigning sovereign rulers of the German states.\n\n\n== Design and concept ==\nInspired by Weinbrenner's early project, Schmitz constructed the monument over an artificial hill, and selected a pyramidal shape for a clear view of the surroundings. The base is 124 metres (407 ft) square. The main structure, at 91 metres (299 ft), is one of the tallest monuments in Europe. It is composed of two storeys. On the first story, a crypt is adorned by eight large statues of fallen warriors, each one next to smaller statues called the Totenw\u00e4chter (Guardians of the Dead). On the second story, the Ruhmeshalle (Hall of Fame) features four statues, each 9.5 metres (31 ft) tall, representing the four legendary historic qualities ascribed to the German people: bravery, faith, sacrifice, and fertility. The statues of the monument were sculpted by Christian Behrens and his apprentice Franz Metzner, who finished the remaining statues after Behrens's death in 1905. Metzner worked on the sculptures at the top and inside the memorial.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe memorial is constructed in granite and sandstone. The cupola is decorated with primitive Germanic shapes, inspired by Egyptian and Assyrian sculpture. Schmitz also planned to create an accompanying complex for ceremonies that would include a court, a stadium and parade grounds. However, only a reflecting pool and two processional avenues were ultimately completed. Surrounding the monument are oaks, a symbol of masculine strength and endurance to the Germanic people of antiquity. The oaks are complemented by evergreens, symbolising feminine fecundity, and they are located in a subordinate position to the oaks. The 12 metres (39 ft) main figure on the front of the memorial represents the archangel Michael, considered the \"War god of Germans\".The design of the monument was intended to commemorate the spirit of the German folk. Unlike previous monuments that commemorated the achievements of the monarchy, this one was created to commemorate the end of the battle in 1813, the establishment of a German community, and the maturation of the Germans as an organised ethnic group.\n\n\n== From the Nazi Third Reich through the Communist GDR to the present ==\n\nDuring the Third Reich, Hitler frequently used the monument as a venue for his meetings in Leipzig. During WW2, an anti-aircraft gun (Flak) position was established on top of the monument. When the US Army captured Leipzig on April 18, 1945, the monument was the last stronghold in the city to surrender. 300 soldiers, men of the Volkssturm and boys of the Hitler Youth under the command of Oberst Hans von Poncet, were holding out in the monument, but after a direct artillery hit inside the structure, von Poncet was convinced to surrender following long negotiations.During the period of Communist rule in East Germany from 1949 to 1989, the government of the GDR was unsure whether it should allow the monument to stand, since it was considered to represent the steadfast nationalism of the period of the German Empire. Eventually, it was decided that the monument be allowed to remain, since it represented a battle in which Russian and German soldiers had fought together against a common enemy, and was therefore representative of Deutsch-russische Waffenbr\u00fcderschaft (Russo-German brotherhood-in-arms) (although some Germans fought on the other side in the battle).\nIn 1956, the opening ceremony of the Gymnastics and Sports Festival took place in the memorial complex; the authorities stated that the monument could be interpreted as a symbol of \"long-standing German-Russian friendship\". The festival planners focused the spirit of the celebrations on German history, and the ceremony as a symbol of the desired German union.Restoration of the monument started in 2003, and is expected to be completed in 2019. The Monument of the Battle of Nations is located in the southeast of Leipzig and can be reached by tram lines 15 and 2 at V\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal.\n\n\n== Later structures inspired by the Monument ==\nVoortrekker Monument\nShipka Monument\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHoffmann, Stefan-Ludwig (2007).

          "We took the S-Bahn to the Denkmal station and walked about 10 minutes to get there. The monument is imposing. It cost \u20ac8 for adults and my Australian student card gave me \u20ac2 off. Note there are a lot of steps and it can be a bit claustrophobic in places. We loved the view from",
          "I think this was one of my favorite places in town. Whenever we had time we would go there. The place is beautiful and worth knowing in various seasons of the year. The museum is also very good and I won't even talk about the view.",
          "To commemorate the many victims of large 1813 battle near Leipzig, lost by Napoleon against Austria, Russia, Germany, Wilhelm organized a large (91 m high) memorial. Inside stern, sombre sculptures of soldiers watch tourists. Elevators bring you halfway (to outside",
          "We caught the tram to this monument and were pleased we came. It is an impressive building in its own right and if you stand at the far end of the water you can get a super photo with the reflection of the monument in the water, a bit like at the Taj Mahal. We went up in the",
          "An impressive monument. You can walk round the outside for free; it's \u20ac8 to go inside and to the museum. There's an interesting audio guide for \u20ac1 extra. All well worth it. There's a lift quite a long way up for those less able to walk the stairs but the top platform is only",
          "We visited as my better half enjoys these historical monuments. The kids were surprisingly fine to come along. Maybe because of the enormous size. The site has elevators almost to the top so even our 3year old managed the final stairs. Great view around Leipzig. The museum has a",
          "I\u2019d never heard of this enormous structure (with accompanying museum) until I researched for my visit to Leipzig. If you don\u2019t have a car, get there on a hop on/hop off round city bus.",
          "There is a bit of walking, but this was the highlight of my week. With the audio guide it was like re experiencing a history I knew little about. I usually avoid war memorials, but this one seemed so appropriate. It is hard to believe that very soon after this was erected",
          "The view at the top is well worth the climb. If you have claustrophobia, be cautious. My claustrophobia is not severe, but I had to stop and ask people to pass so as not to feel like all exits are blocked. I climbed to the top viewing deck and it was truly beautiful to see 360",
          "This monument is massive and almost overwhelming. There is a lift but about 300 more steps to get to the top. It is easy to get to on the tram, and is an important historic marker. I recommend a visit.",
          "You can just stop and take a pic or go in and learn more. Currently in a heat wave so my daughter and I stayed back but the guys went up to the second level and found it worth it and very interesting. Incredibly colossal in size.",
          "It is an imponent construction, with an artificial lake in front. It is not exactly beautiful, but representative of the victory against Napoleon. If you are in Leipzig you need to see",
          "Very impressive monument and the displays were well set up. The views from the top was breathtaking. However, the steps going up was totally worth it. The halls within the building were really like what Lord of the Rings\u2019 sets.",
          "Highly recommend visiting.. information available in various languages.. 2/3rds is accessible via a lift .. note: bottom to top is 500 steps.. great views",
          "It was super for who love histori, it costit only 8 euro too see everything, the view from the top was super. And I like a lot the museum too",
          "We loved visiting this site. It was breathtaking in both size and scale, especially the monumental sculptures and carvings which were quite moving in their themes of loss. The walk to the very top was more challenging than l anticipated (especially when the staircase became",
          "Apart from providing an interesting museum related to the decisive battle of the Napoleonic wars it is also an unaoidable insight into the Germanic imperial mindset of 1913, when the memorial was created",

          "Very interesting building from an architectural point of view. Nice view from the rooftop. A nice place to discover",
          "Well worth a visit to see and find out about one of the largest battles in European history. It\u2019s also a very impressive monument in its own right and a climb to the top (2/3rds of which can be done in the lift) is well worth it for the views of Leipzig and the surrounding",
          "Do not miss this if you\u2019re in Leipzig! It is an amazing sight and totally worth the \u20ac8 to enter. Watch the film too, it is without narration and tells the story of why the monument was built and it\u2019s uses and restoration very effectively. The views from the top are worth it too",
          "You can pay to go inside (we didn\u2019t) but the otherwise free approach past flower-bordered banks is impressive enough. Good that it survived the DDR iconoclasts as it was politically expedient to record a joint Russian-German military victory.",
          "It's one of the places I read about. The four legendary historic qualities ascribed to the German people: bravery, faith, sacrifice, and fertility. The structure is 91 metres (299 ft) tall. One of the tallest monuments in Europe. It contains over 500 steps to a viewing platform",
          "Eight euros for an adult to get in. There is a souvenir shop and a museum at the base of the monument, you buy your tickets at the souvenir shop. Be prepared for plenty of walking up stairs but there is a lift once you're inside the monument. There are good views once you",
          "It is quite an eerie remnder of history and makes you hope there is never ever again such an event. The monumental architecture kind of \"celebrates\" this event, no wonder the Nazis as well as the DDR (mis)used the monument for their own purposes. I left the site wih ambiguous",
          "An awesome structure holding so much beauty inside. Truly stunning. The 15min film is worth watching to understand better the background and history. The accompanying music selection is inspired, each reprise representing a time/event. Made my history studies of this period come",
          "Not far from city center is this impressive monument which was built 1913 to remind the \"V\u00f6lkerschlacht\" 100 years before and telling the story about the massive impact the war had on the people back then (and to remind the impact war still has on people).",
          "We had visited The Monument of Battle of Nations on Saturday May 25th. We came after 4pm and went to the monument, which was monumental. Then we went to the museum where we were explaining to our children what happened, what\u00b4s the whole thing about. The man (guard) in museum was",

          "Much bigger than the photos show when you are there in person. Audio guide is essential and only \u20ac1 extra. View from top well worth the climb.",
          "Huge monument in beautiful green surroundings. Didn't go in so I cant say anything about the museum, but its definitely worth a visit if you are in Leipzig",
          "The monument is easy to get to by tram from the main train station in Leipzig. It is a huge and impressive monument in size. We walked around and on it so get a better sense of its size. It got us to read and learn about the battle that took place here. It is worth a short",
          "On your way to the monster building there were signs.. please pay at the reception ( 8 euros each!) we did as we visited the museum as well, but not everyone did ss you can climb the building from the outside to the first floor for free. You can even go inside without being",
          "Colossal piece of stone just outside central Leipzig. Worth climbing the stairs all the way to the top and get a good view of the city.",
          "Having been there twice now, this monument is really impressive. especially, if you are into history. going up is no pain either as there is a lift and the view from the top is outstanding. not sure about people who work there are as interested in the whole thing as we are and",
          "Didn't really expect too much despite a previous TripAdvisor review but we concur this is a real treat. First it meant we walked out of town (although you could take public transport easily) and so saw something other than city centre. Then monument itself incredibly",
          "Definitely worth visiting. A must see of Leipzig with great views and breathtaking statues. Be aware that some of the staircases are very narrow especially the ones to the very top. The staircases in between can be avoided by taking the elevator. It's. Definitely worth the \u20ac8",
          "Very nice pleace and view. Better to have with a bottle of water in summer :D When is windy weather I think is better go another day.",
          "The massive monument is a great way to commemorate the epic battle nearby, very nice architecture and a nice view across the water channel in front of the monument. The price for the museum is a bit steep, but you can see the essentials from the outside.",
          "When they say this is the Largest Monument in Europe, they aren't kidding. It is very large and impressive. Built in 1913 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the battle of Leipzig during the Napoleonic wars, it covers quite a bit of ground and provides an enjoyable",
          "Visited with 3 friends - two military historians, who managed to have researched this monument. This enabled us to enjoy the visit and to then look at photos from decades ago- through conflict A worthwhile visit",
          "Monument has a Reasonalble entry fee. Outside there is lots of space to go for a walk or for a picnic. Inside There are elevators to some level. Above that one can reach only by stairs to the topmost viewing platform. The view from the top viewing platform is really nice if the",

          "was part of a business trip, you climb a lot of stairs, some elevators are not working so you have to climb it yourself, in the end you will get a nice view from the top.",
          "Sadly, I didn't have the time to actually go inside, but as a student of the Napoleonic Wars, this was amazing to see in person, especially on a hot, clear day. If I returned to Leipzig I would love to go inside and to the top.",
          "Well worth a visit. The building is stunning and full of interesting details and its size is incredible. The stairs are tough work but there is a lift to three floors although not the roof. Every floor has great views and the hall of fame is a definite must see.",
          "The story of Napoleons defeat is the most important reason to go. The structure is stunning and the view from the top is worth the climb. There are 500 steps to the viewing platform. You can get to some of it by elevators, so go even if you cannot climb stairs. I don't think",
          "We got the tram to Meusdorf and took a short walk to Sud Friedhof to visit the monument. It is a very reasonable entrance fee which takes you right inside. There are lifts to the different levels which not give you great views of the internal architecture but also outside with",
          "You have to see this amazing sight of the city! Build after the war with Napoleon it is a landmark of the city and you gonna be struck by the architecture of it. You have a chance to get up on top of the building and enjoy the marvelous and breathtaking view ofer the city. dont",
          "Beautiful, historic and with a great view. It is well worth knowing. It has a small museum on the inside and it is possible to climb and have a fantastic view of the city. Even if you just go and not get in it's still worth the visit and the photo.",
          "View is amazing, it is worth it going up walking, it is not that hard, though it takes about 20 minutes or less. There is also the option to go by elevator to almost the top. The view is great and the sunset from their is amazing!",
          "This a monument on a gigantic scale.It stands 91 metres high. The interior is like something out of a fantasy film set.There is a very good audio tour available which gives the background to why it was built and how it was built. There is also a museum here about the battle of",
          "Impressive history and monument. It is huge and interesting on the inside with views of city and area. This may make some eyes roll, but it looks like the pedistal without a statue on it.",
          "Certainly a wow factor. The immense scale of the place is breathtaking - as are the 500 steps to the top although you can appreciate the spectacle of the monument without going right to the top. Museum very interesting. There are vending machines but no cafe, not even anywhere",
          "At 91m high the \"V\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal\" is one of the biggest in Europe and a must-see in Leipzig. It's a very unique piece of art reflective of the Zeitgeist at the time of its construction: giant sculptures glorifying war, nationalism and sacrifice in the name of the nation",
          "Just outside of Leipzig, it's an easy tram (#15) ride. You know which stop to get off, because it's massive. In theory, there is a lift (actually two lifts) that can get you most of the way up. But, the first lift was broken, and we were not told about the second one. The",

Do hire the audio guide but don\u2019t listen when he tells you to walk to the top. We did and enjoyed ourselves immensely. The building is",

          "We went here on by chance while riding trams in Leipzig. If you are into European history you will enjoy this. Fascinating. If you like views of city's you will also like this but perhaps not the 500 steps. There is a list some of the way.",
          "An impressive and large building. It is worthwhile to enter the building, even inside it is beautiful and impressive. The climb up can be difficult, with a beautiful view",
          "This is a stunningly large monument with an interesting history of its own. It was a great way to introduce Napoleon to our teenagers. The introductory film is well done and does not rely upon language to tell the story of the battle or the history of the monument. Highly",
          "It has a lot of stairs, and some small path but it values! The view is amazing. It is the memory for the Soldiers died in the National War. The huge statues inside are amazing!",
          "Large and very moving. The size really hits you as do the amazing views. Even with the lifts there are quite a few stairs so be mindful of that. Note there is little in the area services wise and no services apart from vending though excellent toilets. Worth a visit in the area",
          "In our group we had mixed feelings about this site. My husband and son liked it; I did not. The outside is hard to miss with a large base and massive soldier statues adorning the top with a reflecting pool in front. A little creepy and ominous with music and dark interior.",
          "An easy tram ride from the city center this monument represents an important but sometimes forgotten element of history of the area. The small museum is informative and the monument is impressive both inside and out. Plus there are great views from the upper levels. There are",

          "If you visit Leipzig, that's a place were you have to go! Great view over Leipzig. You have an elevator to the middle of the monument. But nothing for people with claustrophobia!",
          "This is an amazing monument to visit and will test your stamina and claustrophobia if you decide to climb all the way to the top. It is well worth it to get the 360 degree view around Leipzig.",
          "The monument of one of the biggest battles in Europe is so impressive and amazing! Definitly a piece of European History you have to see and visit!",
          "The immense size of this monument is striking. The monument is in honor of the first time Napoleon was defeated in battle, and this monument really portrays how much the defeat meant to the people. This was the highlight of our family's day in Leipzig. We all enjoyed climbing",
          "A monument of monumental proportions. Well worth the quick S bahn ride from the city center. Climb the 500 steps to reach an incredible view from the platform at the top. The monument itself has a rich and fascinating history, it's well worth reading about in advance. The",
          "It's difficult to adequately describe this outstanding historical monument (actually, it's a building), which is huge and such a surprise inside! The carvings inside and the views are superb. It's worth going to Leipzig just to see this monument that was built more than 100",
          "The lady in the box office had attitude. She denied speaking English (in a tourist attraction?), but then went on to ask for payment and give change in perfect English. The man in the lobby told us the elevator \"was kaput\", but we found it to be working fine. They seem to",
          "Primarily a monument associated with napoleonic conflict but what is more evident is the extensive scarring from the last stand of a ss unit here in 1945. Bit of Web research and some photos of the aftermath of the action in 45 make the visit much more worth while. The small",
          "You must have read about this place before coming there - very easy to google it. So big and so powerful. There are some construction at moment there.",
          "The scale of this place blew me away. I couldn't believe it was real as I approached , seems like straight out of a sci-fi or fantasy movie. Well worth the visit to get out of the city and see the suburbs too",
          "This was truly a highlight of our visit to Leipzig! Rode the Hopon/Hopoff bus there and spent about an hour climbing the 484 winding stairs to the top! Well worth the effort! The scale of the statues is unbelievable and the story around how and why it was built is so",
          "Last month when I visited Leipzig, my friends had taken me to this location, which is a memorial. I was taken aback by the sheer size of the place, as well as the lake in front if it. It is also a good place to have a stroll. Just impressive.",
          "If you are in Leipzig and have an interest in history or culture or art, you should see this. Initially it appears as a huge reddish truncated column of sandstone. Closer and you see the enormous knights ringing the top, the huge angel at the base. Inside, there are giant,",

          "Very impressive building. We didn't visit the inside, but it's allready impressive to watch the outside and walk around it. Don't forgot to bring a visit to the beautiful (and big) cemetary next to it.",
          "The enormity of this memorial stands out. Made of concrete, it's size and grandeur both inside and out are impressive. The climb to the top allows you to feel how large this is, and gives excellent panoramic views. The statues inside (representing faith, bravery, fertility",

          "This is slightly out of the centre of Leipzig but easily reached by taking trams 15 or 2. It is very impressive at 91 metres high. Unfortunately it was still under restoration and the central pond was dry, which will continue until 2019, but you can still go inside. It is",
          "This must be the biggest monument anywhere. It commemorates the Battle of the nations in 1812 when the combined force of Germans, Russians and Swedes beat Napoleons French Army. In the UK this is hardly mentioned, but it must have helped when it came to Waterloo 3 years later.",
          "Site was unfortunately under construction when I visited. Can imagine the surrounding to be much nicer once finished. The monument itself is an impressive construction towering over the park with huge slabs of concrete. Takes some climbing stairs and narrow pathways to reach the",
          "The Battle of the Nations in 1813 was the defeat of Napoleon which led to his first exile to Elba. Huge numbers of soldiers died, from all sides. This monument was built about 100 years later and is a massive construction. I found the sculptures very interesting and impressive",

          "We came here on an ice-cold and cloudy winter day. very impressive memorial! Very worthy to take the elevator and climb to the very top. Lots of steps and very narrow! You better are used to use your feet. Lots of history from a battle which took place more than 200 years ago!",
          "The lake is under works, but you can still see some of it's majestuosity. You can enter and have a look inside, tickets on the right, they close at 4pm so be there early. On summer months they close at 6pm.",

          "This is the tallest monument in Europe. I climbed the 360+ steps to the top and got an amazing panorama of Leipzig and the surrounding area where the big battle in 1813 was fought. The stairs are organised as one-way routes so that you don't get stuck with a large person coming",

          "This monument to the War of the Nations (Napolean's time) was indeed a BIG surprise! Worth seeing just to go inside and experience the HUGE-ness of the statues and grasp the intention of the monument. They are working on the long fountain in front but that does not detract",

          "They say it is the biggest monument in Europe.... and when we were climbing up to the top we did believe it. Great journey with several impressive stops on the way up. And as a super bonus we got beutifull view over the city of Leipzig and sorroundings. We were under some time",
          "This could be easily missed if you never venture outside the city center, but it is definitely worth visiting. It's a fairly short (15 minutes or so) ride on the 15 tram from the center. There is an entrance fee, but nothing huge. The exterior is impressive to say the least.",

          "I am a fun of history and large scale monuments, so being for half a day in Leibzig would mean that I would definitely go and visit the place. I was not disappointed. The view from the top is a amazing. There some elevators to reach some levels but if someone wants to go all the",

          "A monument to a critical battle in world history, yet one I frankly didn't know much about. This attraction provides amazing views from its top viewing platform. Architecture, preservation efforts and history are a 'Must See' if you are in Leipzig for any length of time.",
          "You can tour this monument in 2-4 hours. If the weather is nice there are great views from the top. The self guided tour could have been a little more complete, and nothing seems to mention the fact the NAZI SS took over the monument in WWII and were ousted by coalition",
          "A monument to a battle which I, shamefully, wasn't aware of. Without it Napoleon probably wouldn't have met his Waterloo. We saw it in the snow & it was very impressive. It doesn't pull any punches with its subject matter-slaughter. Really worth a look & the view over the city",

          "This monument is so omnipotent! It's definitely worth a visit. Make your way to the top and enjoy the view of Leipzig. Beware that to reach to the very top there is no lift and the stairs are very narrow. So if you're claustrophobic or not very fit then maybe think it twice",
          "It is a monument dedicated to the Battle of the Nations which was fought near Leipzig in 1813. The monument is impressive. It is a building with several levels and viewing platforms. The passages leading to the upper levels are somewhat narrow and steep, some people may feel",

          "We visited here yesterday . It's only \u20ac8 each to go in and well worth the experience. You have to go inside. We spent an hour and a half inside viewing the stone wonderful statues, and climbed the 500 steps to the top viewing tower. Spectacular views are to be seen from here.",
          "The monument is truly monumental in scale, situated on top of an artificial mound to commemorate the 1813 battle of Leipzig, where tens of thousands were slaughtered to satisfy Napoleon's lust for conquest. The figures of warriors are on a vast scale and very impressive and",
          "I loved it, first i thought it was built hundred of years ago, but in fact it was built 1913. You have to be in a good health to go up by stairs, its too narrow and over 500 steps to a viewing platform at the top. Still there is elevator for other floors inside. There is a",
          "The monument is huge. There's no other word to describe the 26.000 granite blocks and 130.000 tons of concrete. Put in the mix a lot statues twenty meters tall all under a dome of ninety meters and if that's not enough you also enjoy climbing a spiral staircase that brings you",
          "This monument is very unique to Leipzig. You can spend easily 2 hours here including the climb to the top. However, since it does close early evening, I also recommend a night time visit. The way the lighting portrays the monument, gives it a different perspective.",
          "The V\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal fascinates my children and was the only think I remembered from my first time visit to from Leipzig as four or five years old toddler. Decades later I lived next to it and we found a perfect weekend destination for walks with the entire family. While",
          "When you think about something to be monumental, well, this is, it's really impressive, very interesting to visit and to climb (or to use the lift) to the top to see the landscape over the city. It is easy to reach from the old town y public transports, but if you don't mind a",
          "The sheer size of this thing continued to amaze me. We went on a guided tour, which I believe was free with the purchase of the entrance ticket - but this only happens at certain times a week so check ahead. Also, the free tour was in German so if you don't speak German you",
          "The monument is an impressive building. Worth a visit, since it is easily accessable by public transportation. The views from the top are nice, but not spectacular. I was there late in the afternoon and they were just about to close the building. When I got out on the top",
          "It is seriously just such an eyesore. Ugly statue in the middle of a boring neighbourhood. Doesn't worth the time going there.",
          "Great view inside out. The only minus point is for the stairs, especially the stair up to the top level, which was extremely narrow and spiral, kind of difficult even for us young healthy people.",

          "The enormous dimensions of this dark reddish monument make it overbearing. The first impression is almost scary. However, knowing that 130 000 soldiers fell in the battle near this place this memorial is justified. It is impressive with the huge figure of St. Michael at the",
          "It has been an unbelievable performance of Neil Young at this location. Very unique and perhaps one of the most beautiful venues right after Berliner Waldb\u00fchne! Must visit during the day to see the beauty of the monument, however the full moon night performance at",
          "We went to the Monument of the Battle of the Nations ( I think that is the correct name). It was unbelievable. After you park and start to walk towards it, it seems like it is not really that large. Then you realize the little specks you see are the people getting ready to go",

          "Well, neither any description, nor photos and videos can beat the personal feeling... It's huge. It's gargantuous (do you remember Kill Bill?). It's the biggest German monument. No wonder, that Adolf Hitler used it as a background to his speeches... Visit to",

          "This monument reminds its visitors of the horrendous battle of 1813 in which Napoleon was defeated and over 90,000 soldiers were wounded or killed. It is grand without being patriotic. If you manage to climb to the top via a dizzyingly steep winding staircase, you will be",

          "Apart from the claustrophobic spiral stairs, it's worth the visit for the amazing view and the museum inside. I felt a lack of information in English in many pieces which made it very difficult to understand the whole history behind the articles, so I recommend to grab an audio",
          "I really loved Leipzig! and this place was amazing, huge monument and pretty interesting, I spend all the time contemplating this master piece, we got a tour for all the most important spots and we were explained more about this one, defenitily I'll be back to this place.",
          "I took the opportunity to visit this land mark during in business visit to Leipzig. The climb to the top is breath taking ,it took mine there are a lot of steps but it is worth it when you get there. The views of Leipzig are spectacular. The internal caverns in the structure",

          "I'm glad I went, but would have really appreciated a bit of history. The amazing things is that they have a second floor marked \"information\" where they're a slide show / film that leaves you less informed than when you arrive. A big gap.",
          "It takes 20 minutes by bus from the center of Leipzig. This is an architectural marvel. There is elevator with some expense to go to the top. The beautiful skyline of the Leipzig city can be observed from the top.",
          "This must be one of the biggest war memorials in the world. But it's far from being the most beautiful. In fact, it's as ugly as sin. So why go? Why indeed? Well, if you want to get fit, there are lots of stairs to climb. And if you want a view, it offers excellent views",
          "Amazing views, and the inside of the building is also awe-inspiring - but do be prepared to climb a LOT of stairs!",
          "Spent hours climbing in and around this massive memorial, one of the largest in Europe. It's free to check it out",
          "Worth a visit and if you like going to heights for super 360 deg views of Leipzig city. Do not forget to visit the museum after you exit the monument on the left side. This is included in the ticket price. Audio guide was well detailed.",
          "The building feels and looks like a decor of Tolkiens' works. Great panoramic views at the top but mind the stairs: very demanding for your legs!",
          "This is probably the best example of the just-pre-First-World-War Mighty Ziggurat school of architecture. At 90 metres high and on a hill, it towers over whole districts of Leipzig. I was there for a concert so only got up to the inside and first-gallery level; it is a",
          "I had an amazing time here, This place was absolutely full of beauty and peace. Historical place and really gives an amazing feeling when visiting.",
          "Quite a feat to build this before WW1. Inside there are several spaces including a crypt. Good views from several of the levels, some of which can be reached by lift.",
          "I would recommend heading here as early as possible to avoid the large amounts of people but this was an amazing experience great views of the surrounding area and the museum is also pretty cool. There are a lot of stairs and it is very cramped in places probably would not",
          "A must see if you going to Leipzig! Be aware though, the gift shop does not take any credit cards, which is ridiculous considering it's a tourist attraction... Also if you opt to walk the stairs up from the crypt area it's a LONG way up, with no way to turn around and you'll get",
          "We were pleasantly surprised by this monument. It was much bigger and more impressive than we expected and our young son enjoyed the challenge of climbing all the way to the top. We would recommend this to anyone visiting Leipzig.",
          "Made with 26500 blocks of pink granite the monument relates to the battle with Napoleon by a combined force of various nationalities. The sombre figures inside the monument contrast to the magnificent views to the city and beyond from several levels.Part of the climb can be done",
          "Its an intersting place to visit in Leipzig. The monument itself is huge and intersting inside but you also get a great view of the city from the top of the monument. There are elevators and also stairs but very narrow. Recommend...",
          "People either love it or hate it. I am in the first group, possibly because I live close by. If you climb all the way to the top, you will have a lovely view over Leipzig. Do not foget to make a stroll over the S\u00fcdfriedhof towards the south. Lovely park-like cemetary worth a",
          "this a massive structure and will overwhelm you by its sheer size. you need to get tickets to enter the structure and definitely do buy the tickets. the view from the top floor and the roof is mind blowing. i visited in the month of January and there was a lot of cold winter",
          "This has to be one of the most unusual places i've visited. We got off a tram, rounded a corner and there in front of us on the outskirts of the city was what looked at first glance to be an Aztec monument. It is in fact a monument to the Battle of the Nations, and commemorates",
          "It is very impressive and worth while making the effort to go to see it, best way with the hop on hop off bus tour from opposite the main railway station. I suggest at least one hour to walk up to the memorial and explore what the interior has to offer.",
          "6E entry, 4E for students - very nice view of the city of Leipzig. Very friendly staff and an incredible monument.",
          "Walking all these stairs till reaching the very top was challenging but worth the pay of. An amazing view of Leipzig and a fresh breeze. It will challenge you as the staircase is extremely narrow and nothing for the faint of heart. My all time fav. was the five metres tall",
          "Dont think I've seen a more impressive monument to a war, well a peace. At least for one hundred years. Kind of ironic it actually wasn't finished till 100 years after that famous defeat of Napoleon just as 'The Great War' or the War to End all wars began. And then one hundred",
          "The huge V\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal is awesome! The imposing structure is fascinating to admire with its many statues and carvings. The interior is atmospheric and peaceful. The history behind the monument and the 1813 battle against Napoleon is also interesting. From the top you can",
          "Wow, interesting to know that this monument was build years after the \"V\u00f6lkerschlacht\" and of course it is not a place that supports \"peace keeping\" per se. Nevertheless you can learn a lot about history and how important a unified Europe is in our days.",
          "This is a great place to go and visit. There are quite a few stairs to climb to get to the top of the monument but it is worth it.",
          "Learned a lot about the battle and the history of why this monument is here. Nice view from the top and about 160 steps to the top. Definitely recommend the visit",
          "Coming originally from Leipzig, I couldn't miss taking my boyfriend to this historical place. Entrance fee is \u20ac8 which is think is fair compared to the work the work the monument had been done. Inside you can watch a movie which explain what the monument stands for. The stairs",
          "You should definitely spend some time there and check this gorgeous monument both from inside and outside.",
          "We arrived very early on a drizzling morning, and were too early to enter, Regardless, this was an amazing experience... the monument is beautiful and grandiose. We walked around the huge body of water in front of the monument and took in the scenery. Apparently there are over",
          "Spend some time with friends. Nice architecture. People interested in Napoleonic wars will find it interesting.",
          "The battle of the nations between napoleon and the Russians in 1813 was surely one of a kind in those days. This is the tallest monument in Europe and a special one. If you're not blown away by its outside appearance then go inside where the stairs are fit within the legs of",
          "The Volkerschlachtdenkmal serves supposedly two purposes. Firstly, it stands as a memorial to the fallen soldiers of the 1813 Battle of the Nations - the largest battle in europe until a century later, and a decisive defeat of Napoleon's Grande Arm\u00e9e. Secondly, its interior",
          "I love this place, i used to go there with my friends and enjoy the view over Leipzig. It used to be Germany's hightest building. Leipzig is simply one of the best cities i lived in :)",
          "This is a monument to celebrate the victory of the allies, Prussian, Austrian, Swedes and Russian against Napoleon army. The battle which occurred 200 years ago was one of the larges in european history, lasted several days and involved more than 600 thousand soldiers. Napoleon",
          "Impressive building and views! Walk the long, long steps and see how Leipzig is situated. As it was December, we enjoyed a most beautiful sunset from above!",
          "We have visited this monument a few times and our experience has improved every time, especially after its restoration in 2013. I've never seen another monument like this one. It's size alone makes it impressive and in addition to that it has many unique design features. The",
          "I recommend visiting the monument with the audio guide which costs only one Euro. The audio guide is lively and sometimes humorous. The statue at the entrance is really impressive and very cool! Be prepared to climb up to the top 'cause it may take some effort. This monument is",
          "This is a must visit when in Leipzig - the history is fascinating in itself but the grandness really impacts at nightime - highly recommended.",
          "While visiting Leipzig you should make a stop at one of it's iconic buildings which is a reminder of our past. Located around 10km outside from Leipzig city center it can be reached easily with tram and car. It takes you approx. 15mins, car park available and 2 tram stops which",
          "It's really huge and may be interesting not only for those who like historical sights. Its size makes quite an impression. Inside has very church - like feel to it, somber and reflective. It's far from the city center so view from the top doesn't allow to admire the details of",
          "I didnt know about this monument, and even why it was there. It was really interesting and impressive. Great film about the history of the War of Nations 1813, where Napoleon got a kicking. Largest Monument in Europe by all accounts",
          "This 299 feet (91 meters) tall monument of the 1813 battle of the Nations is a must for Leipzig visitors. It conmemorates Napoleon's defeat. There's an elevator for the first short part, but to reach its top one has to climb 500 steps in a very narrow passage way,-nothing for",
          "Huge memorial to Battle of Leipzig 1813 involving 600,000 men when the Central European armies defeated Napoleon's Grande Armee. Biggest battle in Europe till WW1. Direct tram ride out of the city.",
          "Its Cooll, its buig, the audioguide is funny. But, its work. Lots of stairs and not impressive when you find out its only 100 years old. However if you have the time i still reccomend a visit.",
          "A Huge beautiful monument , Stairs are very narrow and get narrower the higher to get ,but on top , you can have a great view of Leipzig If you are going to Leipzig or somewhere close ,you have to go there",
          "This monument was the most fun part of my trip to Leipzig, Germany. For a fee, you can climb your way all the way to the top and you get an amazing view of the city and all the greenery surrounding you. It was really beautiful, and a nice activity to do in the summer. Very",
          "Another must see for Leipzig. It commemorates the 1813 battle of the nations where Napoleon was defeated, one of the events settling the fate of Europe for the next 100 years. It is amazingly monumental. There is nothing subtle here. Go as far as the lifts take you. The trudge",
          "Monstrous monument commemorating the Battle of Nations where Napoleon was defetead by the allied armies. It's designed in a style you will not find anywhere in the world so if one likes strange architecture it's worth a visit.",
          "This monument was constructed between 1900 and 1913 to commemorate the Battle of the Nations in October 1813 when Napoleon's military stranglehold over Europe was broken by the combined Prussian, Russian and Austrian armies. However, this massive edifice seems to me to be more",
          "This is a fascinating memorial to the battle of Lepzig in 1813; heavy in style but very visible from around. Worth going out to see",
          "I walked here from Leipzig city centre, a journey which took around 30-40 minutes. Once I got there, the sheer size of this monument took my breath away. It's huge! If your in Leipzig for a day or two, visiting this monument should be number 1 on your list. On a nice day there",
          "Enjoyed very much. 500 stairs to the top but the views are well worth it. I think you can take a lift part of the way if you want too.",
          "Another historical event that means a bit more to the Europeans than it does to us in the UK. Commemorates the Battle of Leipzig October 1813 -look it up for more. Built in 1913 and stands 190m on a slight hill. Use tram 15 to access. Cost 8 euros or 7 if in a group. There",
          "This a huge monument commemmorating the war of 1813 with Napoleon in Leipzig .It is most interesting and worth the trouble of climbing the numerouos stairs.",
          "If tou make a monument about the Leipzig battle of Napoleon, why not give a popular and detail explanation of what happened and why. It is a long climb up, the earphone comment is useless but the view is nice on a clear day. In total highly overrated and sonewhat a",
          "Very nice attraction...from far it looks small and when u go near its very tall....u can see almost whole city from top....great construction representing old history....dont miss it if u visit Leipzig",
          "This monument to commemorate the great Battle of Nations is accessible with a city tour bus trip, they usually let you take a few pictures at this point. The colossal solid stone monument is impressive even in a distance, you may also climb to the top inside. The history around",
          "This enormous structure was built to commemorate the Prussian Russian Austrian and Swedish coalition victory against Napoleon's forces in 1813 which marked the beginning of the end for him. As well as the sheer scale of the exterior, the interior is similarly breathtaking in a",
          "If you want a change of Leipzig historical old town, I totally recommend a visit to this place. Build at the beginning of the XX century, but in a style that tries to imitate the Romanic of the middle ages, has an esthetic that seems borrowed for the Lord of the Rings movie.",
          "This monument to the Battle of the Nations in 1813 when Napoloean was defeated, is amazingly interesting and absolutely huge. Don't miss it.",
          "The interest factor just wasn't there for me. We had seen so many monuments and structures in Europe that this one was just one more offering no unique qualities.",
          "I really didn't expect to be this big/grandiose. It is fascinating; not just the outside but also the inside part of the monument. A must see in Leipzig.",
          "If you want to see all of Leipzig, this is a great viewpoint. Moreover, this is a great educational visit of a monument to one of the pivotal battles in the Napoleonic era in Europe. Being a military history fan, this was a must-see in Sachsen!",
          "Really nice place, a huge monument with a lot of history behind. It worths to go up the building and have a panoramic sight from Leipzig.",
          "Very cool and enriched with history. This monument is definitely worth a trip to the top and is a great place for history lovers.",
          "I've been there for a concert with \"Sunrise Avenue\" and it was just a highlight of our trip. Go there an d enjoy it!",
          "We definitely recommend visiting this in conjunction with the Panometer as both give an amazing insight into the turning point in Napoleon's campaign's in Europe. The building is a stunning stone fortress, built like a cathedral inside, with so much detail in the statues and",
          "We were directed by the hotel to take the tram to this monument, and it turned out to be well worth it. Taller than the statue of Liberty and a masterpiece of sculptures and carving. There are a lot of steps, but most of the it can be done by lift, and the views are good. Glad",
          "Newly renovated, the V\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal offers a nice view. Really interesting exhibition. The park and the lake are nice to just sit and relax.",
          "Nice little museum but go inside the memorial (it is awesome) and take the elevator to the top. (or walk the 500 stairs!) The view of Leipzig is fantastic!",
          "If you are in the city you should visit it. Probably it's not the most beautiful but the history behind it is quite important. If the weather is nice you would be able to go to the top of it! And you will enjoy a 360 degrees view, which is really nice and worthy. I hope you",
          "This building, inside as well as outside with its museum and shop, is REAllY very impressive! One expects this kind of building in Laos or Cambodia, kind of, so finding this not very far from the centre of Leipzig, is quite incredible. It can be seen from wide around even from",
          "An amazing momument that was so picturesque in the Winter and snow! You can walk to the top inside and look down onto the floor below. We didnt walk up inside as it was for a fee, but it would have given a good view of Leipzig.",
          "This is not only a monument, it is a tribute for all those who lost their lives in the \"battle of nations\". From Napoleon to Hitler, there is much history on this place making it a real site of remembrance. Getting here from Leipzig's Hauptbahnhof is an easy ride on the Tram #15",
          "I reviewed this under its English name. This is the monument for the Battle of Nations. This was a terrible battle, a terrible war, the first modern battle, according to some. It is not beautiful. It is not peaceful. It IS there to remind us of what happened on this spot.",
          "It is not the monument that is so interesting. It is the battle that it memorializes. This was the first battle of modern warfare: mass killing, senseless combinations of armies, destructions of civilian life. Now it is all a peaceful suburb of Leipzig, where the S-bahn goes,",
          "wonderful monument. when you travel to Leipzig, you definitely must visit that monument. surely you do not want to leave there.",
          "I'd put this as number 1 thing to do to leipzig. Incredible monument. so high and magnificent inside. Do not miss if you come to leipzig",
          "Wonderfull monument. Gives Leipzig nice authentic look. There are also a lot of parks near by, its definitely worth to get lost in there. Its sort of tourism meets chillin and nature kind of place",
          "A huge monument commemorating the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, during which over 100,000 people died in the defeat of Napoleon. Great statues and views of the city. They even have an elevator, in case you don't want to take the stairs. Well worth a visit!",
          "Do not miss this monument to nations. It is truly amazing. A train ride and walk with a local to get there so I can't give directions but I was gobsmacked to stand in front of its pyramid like proportions. We walked and walked through its interior which was somewhat of a cross",
          "very interesting tour. taking back in history shows the hardship of the people during the war. I went back the next day by bus to see leibzig from the top of the Denkmal. it was very cold but worth the efford.",
          "We took tram 15 out to the monument around dusk on a clear day. The views of the reflecting pond and the lights on the monument were stunning. Not crowded at all at that time of day. We did not climb it but walked around the two levels of paths encircling the pond. We got some",
          "The proportions of this structure are striking but the irony of completing in 1913 should not be lost.",
          "...not at least because of the gigantic proportions. One could quote the writer Joseph Roth (\"Radetzky March\"): \"A meaningless giant, built to impress the watcher, but due to its share size impossible to watch!\"",
          "The Volkerschlachtdenkmal (monument of the war of nation) is a breathtaking architecture. Although built by Germans but it has a clear Egyptian architectural influence. Situated 5/6 tram stations away from the central station, this place is a must watch for anyone visiting",
          "Huge monument, impressive just by its size, but also nice in terms of architecture. Worth a short visit if your near...",
          "I went in winter and the surroundings looked very nice with all the snow. The view was amazing and the size of it it's impressive. The fact that was done by Napoleon... I think it's a muss see if you are in the city.",
          "Huge monument with lot's of stairs to the top! If you are claustrophobic don't go there - at the top the stairs are just too tight. For everyone else - stunning views over the city, piece of history",
          "We stopped by the monument on New Year's Eve, so it was closed for holiday, but we were able to walk around! It's and enormous and beautiful structure, worth a quick stop if you're in Leipzig.",
          "one of the worste monument I've ever seen in my life... too imposing and massive... on the other hand, Leipzig is just beautiful!",
          "Beside the tragic story behind the monument, you'll feel taken by the Spirit of the space it self! The music inside really helps you to go deep inside your mind and relax with the overwhelming wonderful experience! Make sure you take a banana with you Cuz you'll need the",
          "It takes quite a climb to get to the top of the momument. It is a sad story behind the war. Thousands of soldiers died in the 1813 battle in Leipzig. However, I can't deny that the panorama view on the top is quite beautiful. I can directly see the achitectures in the",
          "Each time I visit Leipzig, I'm drawn to the Battle of the Nations Monument. It's easy to get to by either Tram 15 or by car/motorbike (there's a large parking area close by). It's the sheer scale of the venue that you will be struck by. It's massive!! You won't quite realise",
          "Knew very little about this before visiting. Arriving in Leipzig you can't help but notice this very impressive monument as it towers above anything near it. We didn't have a lot of time to spend in Leipzig but decided such an enormous structure deserved a visit, and I must say",
          "This monument is breathtaking in its size. It is well worth a visit and climb to the top. There are lifts to access much of it, but the last section to the top is via narrow stairs. Would suggest some of the stair wells at the top are a little narrow and confined for anyone",
          "I was not prepared for just how vast this monument is. Short tram trip from the city centre. Small fee to enter. Lots of stairs to climb (there is a lift to some levels). Great views of Leipzig from the top.",
          "The 1st thing that struck me about the monument to the Battle of nations was the sheer size of it. It's massive. Defo worth paying the ,oney to go inside and have a look around and going to the roof and seeing Leipzig from up top.",
          "I wasn't expecting much from this monument and it totally blew my expectations away! It looked majestic from the outside but the crypt and hall inside were even more captivating with the giant statues. Climb all the way up( its a lityle challenging) you'll get a nice view of",
          "We visited this during the \"Stadtrundfahrt\". The Volkerschlagdenmal is huge, really enormous statue located not far fom the city center.",
          "We saw this monument in the distance on our visit to Leipzig last year so it was on the list for this years visit. Walking to it from the former Trade Fair area, it dominates the view but only once you are standing at one end of the lake do you realise just how huge it is! The",
          "What an impressive monument! I'd have loved to see it also in the night with the lights but being summer, it's not dark even until 9 PM! May be some other time :-). I was a bit tired so didn't venture climbing up. The sculptures are pretty impressive and it was nice to see them",
          "The monument itself is more large than pretty, but offers nice views from the top (take the elevator!). Interesting short movie. The small museum on the right hand side of the entrance is quite interesting and should not be missed. Renovation of the surroundings is needed, but",
          "We were there last year, it was impressive and massive. The inside is like going into another world. If you go up the tower make sure you are not afraid of heights, the inside is hollow and you look straight down. A bit unnverving for me but the rest of the family loved it. Well",
          "This monument is seriously the biggest monument I have ever seen (80m tall). I think it's really cool by itself (the outside and also the inside) and the view from the top is worth climbing all those stairs (The stairs are very steep and very very narrow). adult ticket is 6EUR",
          "Have actually visited this before, back in 1997. Now, a year after it's centennial spruce up, the monument is looking pretty tidy as it's rid of its 20th century grime. The improvements are more than skin deep with the addition of a lift, that'll get you to almost the top. The",
          "This was by far the biggest surprise of our trip to Leipzig. The other things we had come to see, however impressive, were much as expected. We came here just to fill in a couple of hours on a Sunday afternoon and were quite amazed. Beautiful it's not, but impressive it",
          "Do this when you are in Leipzig its worth it. A few stairs to climb but nothing to hard unless you are afraid of small spaces as it gets a bit tight at the top. The view is great. This truly a remarkable piece of engineering and a must to experience.",
          "Impressive, Inspiring & thought evoking, what more can you say about to the monument to a battle which occurred two centuries ago & cost seven nations over 100, 000 lives",
          "An impressive piece of history which is well worth the short trip (15 minutes by tram) from the city centre.",
          "I didn't expect much from this when my friend told me about it but I am so glad I went to see it. The sheer size of the monument surprised me - I don't really know what I expected to be honest - and it was tranquil to look at with the water in front of it. I climbed up the",
          "We only heard of this monument from the staff in the Kildare pub and, my brother being a Napoleonic war buff, we decided to visit it. It is easily accessible by tram. The approach to the monument is impressive with the pool in front of it. There is a viewing platform inside the",
          "It might not be a nice story behind it, but still it is an impressive building with a nice with and usually not too crowded. It is in the southern part of the city, parking space is available.",
          "I'm not really into history but I was really glad we decided to buy tickets (6 Euros for an adult). The sheer scale of this monument is awesome and entry is very well organised. You buy tickets from the office beside the Denkmal (it's busy at weekends - better to go during the",
          "An impressive sight, even if it is not exactly beautiful. The view across the water in later afternoon is particularly impressive with the full effect of sunlight striking the front of the structure. Admission currently costs six euros for adults, including both the monument",
          "I think this place is simply incredible, the pure essence of majesty. The huge statues looks mighty and peaceful at the same time, like charming giants, especially the big Archangel Michael that dominates the main entrance.",
          "Easy to get to the monument is impossible to miss! While it is large there is a mirror lake in front that offers a nice reflection early in the morning. Additional work for a platform is currently on going but the structure is stll interesting to see and anyone who has",
          "This is my favourite place in Leipzig, it's a must if you visit the city. It is quite different from the typical German monument, that's part of its charm. You can visit the grounds for free, but you'll need a ticket to enter it. The views from the top are incredible.",
          "Monument to the 1813 battle of Leipzig it is a truly massive structure. The views from the top of the monument are excellent. You can save yourself quite a bit of puff by paying the extra and catching a lift to 2/3 of the way up so you only have to climb the last 150 or so",
          "A very imposing sight to see. Renovations were almost done when I visited. It might be a good idea to go early, before it gets crowded, especially to experience the atmosphere in the central hall of the monument. A great view over the city from the top, if you are OK with",
          "A fascinating place. First, the monument deserves nothing more than a giant neon swastika rotating on top of it - May have been dedicated before WWII, but it's the German version of Soviet Heroic architecture - Teutonic Heroic, perhaps, but definitely the type of thing the",
          "This is one of the places in the world where a photo will not do justice to the sheer scale of the monument. Happened on this almost by accident on the way out of Leipzig. So happy I did, absolutely amazing place.",
          "If you see it in real life you can't imagine how big the statues on this monument are. It is an interesting place to see and the view is nice. However it is far away from the city centre if you walk it.",
          "It is a nice monument to visit in Leipzig. Nothing special but not bad. You can climb up to the top where there is a nice view.",
          "I visited the Volkerschlachtdenkmal in January 2014. The monument is dedicated to the Battle of the Nations that took place in 1813, in which Napoleon was defeated. The monument is accessible by trams 15, 2 from the central station (HBF), get off at the \"Volkerschlachtdenkmal\"",
          "I think it is the most ugly monument i ever saw but when you \" travel \" inside by elevators and stairs its impressive. You will pay extra 1 euro to take the second elevator to the top and you have to climb up 200 stairs to the top. The view off course is fantastic.",

          "Very impressive Monument, well worth visiting if you're in Leipzig. You need a head for heights though! And it's a bit of a climb if using the steps. There is a lift up some of the way, and steps for the last bit (which get a big narrow). \u2026",

          "The architecture of the building is very captivating, and it has a large artificial sort of lake in front of it. Not something you are likely to spend too much time on, but at least the outside area of the building is free to explore and it is nice to look at.",

          "The place is magnificent but I think that it lacks information that explains the beautiful sculptures inside. However, the view at the very top of the monument is breath taking.

          "Real monument! You can see it from far distance and therefore, it is also a good spot for an overview of the city panorama. So, the view is worth the stairs (but you can partly use a lift too \ud83d\ude42). Also, nice stone giants (statues). Interesting to visit!",

          "This is an insane structure!  Its like straight out of Lord of the Rings or something.  Its cool to look at from far away, but as you walk closer and closer, its awe inspiring!  Why can't we have structures like this everywhere???",

          "This place was nice, but unfortunately it was still in construction while I was there. So I think it was not as pretty as it will be in the future. However, the view of the city of Leipzig that you got from the top of the monument is pretty breathtaking.",

The tickets are quite cheap. You can get to the top of the building with an elevator but there are also stairs available, the stairs are quite tiresome though.",
          "At least an interesting experience. Not recommended for claustrophobic people since the stairways are insanely small and not well ventilated. Also the fact that you have pedestrian lights for a stairway, tells a lot. But overall a nice monument. The view from top is outstanding as well.",

          "In my view this is the third of Leipzig's \"must see's\" (after the Grassi Musical Instruments and the \"Stasi\" museums).\nBut visiting is an awkward experience because of its monstrous scale and style : and because the interior, though vast, \u2026",

        "wiki": "Leipzig (, also , , German: [\u02c8la\u026apts\u026a\u00e7] (listen);; Upper Saxon: Leibzsch) is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. With a population of 600,000 inhabitants as of 2019 (1.1 million residents in the larger urban zone), it is Germany's eighth most populous city as well as the second most populous city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin. Together with Halle (Saale), the largest city of the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt, the city forms the polycentric conurbation of Leipzig-Halle. Between the two cities (in Schkeuditz) lies Leipzig/Halle International Airport.\nLeipzig is located about 160 kilometres (99 mi) southwest of Berlin in the Leipzig Bay, which constitutes the southernmost part of the North German Plain, at the confluence of the White Elster River (progression: Saale\u2192 Elbe\u2192 North Sea) and two of its tributaries: the Plei\u00dfe and the Parthe. The name of the city as well as the names of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.\nLeipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire. The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes. Leipzig was once one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing. After the  Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East German terms, but its cultural and economic importance declined. Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy, which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry, severe unemployment, and urban blight. Starting around 2000, however, decline was first arrested and then reversed. Leipzig has undergone significant change with the restoration of major historical buildings, the demolition of derelict properties of little historical value, and the development of new industries and a modern transport infrastructure.Leipzig today is an economic centre, the most livable city in Germany, according to the GfK marketing research institution and has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, according to HWWI and Berenberg Bank. The city is one of two seats of the German National Library (together with Frankfurt), as well as the seat of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and ranks first in Germany and second in Europe according to Anthony Sheridan. Since the opening of the Leipzig City Tunnel in 2013, Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system. Leipzig is currently listed as a Gamma World City, Germany's \"Boomtown\" and as the European City of the Year 2019.Leipzig has long been a major centre for music, both classical as well as modern \"dark alternative music\" or darkwave genres. The Oper Leipzig is one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany. Leipzig is also home to the University of Music and Theatre \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\". It was during a stay in this city that Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem \"Ode to Joy\". The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Johann Sebastian Bach is one among many major composers who lived and worked in Leipzig.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Name ===\n\nThe name Leipzig is derived from the Slavic word Lipsk, which means \"settlement where the linden trees (British English: lime trees; U.S. English: basswood trees) stand\". An older spelling of the name in English is Leipsic. The Latin name Lipsia was also used. The name is cognate with Lipetsk (\u041b\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043a) in Russia and Liep\u0101ja in Latvia.\n\nIn 1937 the Nazi government officially renamed the city Reichsmessestadt Leipzig (Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig).Since 1989 Leipzig has been informally dubbed \"Hero City\" (Heldenstadt), in recognition of the role that the Monday demonstrations there played in the fall of the East German regime \u2013 the name alludes to the honorary title awarded in the former Soviet Union to certain cities that played a key role in the victory of the Allies during the Second World War. The common usage of this nickname for Leipzig up until the present is reflected, for example, in the name of a blog for local arts and culture, Heldenstadt.de.More recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\", \"Hypezig\" or \"The better Berlin\" for being celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for the vital lifestyle and creative scene with many startups.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nLeipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as urbs Libzi (Chronikon VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by Otto the Rich. Leipzig Trade Fair, started in the Middle Ages, has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world.\nThere are records of commercial fishing operations on the river Plei\u00dfe in Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the Margrave Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.There were a number of monasteries in and around the city, including a Franciscan monastery after which the Barfu\u00dfg\u00e4\u00dfchen (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks (Jacobskirche, destroyed in 1544) near the present day Ranst\u00e4dter Steinweg (the old Via Regia).\nThe foundation of the University of Leipzig in 1409 initiated the city's development into a centre of German law and the publishing industry, and towards being the location of the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) and the German National Library (founded in 1912).\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, two battles took place in Breitenfeld, about 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) outside Leipzig city walls. The first Battle of Breitenfeld took place in 1631 and the second in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.\nOn 24 December 1701, an oil-fueled street lighting system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig between Napoleonic France and an allied coalition of Prussia, Russia, Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended Napoleon's presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on Elba. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.When it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the Royal Saxon State Railways and the western one for the Prussian state railways.\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German labor party, the General German Workers' Association (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein, ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge Gr\u00fcnderzeit areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei became the largest cotton mill company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Daily production surpassed 5 million kilograms of yarn.During the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to World War II. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.\nOn 22 May 1930, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was elected mayor of Leipzig. He was well known as an opponent of the Nazi regime. He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of Felix Mendelssohn. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue, one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. Goerdeler was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.\n\nSeveral thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.\nBeginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the Gemeinde, a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.Like all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to aryanisation. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenh\u00e4user, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.As with other cities in Europe during the Holocaust, the Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the Nuremberg Laws. However, due to the Leipzig Trade Fair and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures. Shortly before Kristallnacht, Polish Jews living in the city were expelled.On 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the \"Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig\". In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in Zionism through Jewish citizens. Many of these Zionists attempted to flee before deportations began. On 28 October 1938, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of Polish Jews from Leipzig to Poland.On 9 November 1938, as part of Kristallnacht, in Gottschedstrasse (German: Gottschedstra\u00dfe), now a popular dining and nightlife area in Leipzig, synagogues and businesses were set on fire. Only a couple of days later, on 11 November 1938, many Jews in the Leipzig area were deported to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. As World War II came to an end, much of Leipzig was destroyed. Following the war, the Communist Party of Germany (German: Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, KPD) provided aid for the reconstruction of the city.In 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported. On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors. According to records of the Theresienstadt deportation, only 53 Jews survived.Until late 1943, there was little threat of aerial bombings to the city. However, on the morning of 4 December 1943, the British Royal Air Force dropped over 1,000 tons of explosives, resulting in the death of nearly 1,000 civilians. This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, the storm was too overwhelming for them. Unlike its neighbouring city of Dresden, this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945. In April 1945 the SS Gruppehfuhrer/Mayor of Leipzig Bruno Erich Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter; the Deputy Mayor/Treasurer of Leipzig, Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter, and a Volkssturm Major Walter D\u00f6nicke committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\nThe United States turned the city over to the Red Army as it pulled back from the line of contact with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city.In the mid-20th century, the city's trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the Comecon Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which East Germany was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the Monument to the Battle of the Nations.\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in. Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.In October 1989, after prayers for peace at St. Nicholas Church, established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the Monday demonstrations started as the most prominent mass protest against the East German government. The reunification of Germany, however, was at first not good for Leipzig. The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city's speciality was, in terms of the advanced economy of  reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished. As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunificaiton, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.Starting in 2000, an ambitious (and subsequently much-praised) urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig's decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving as much as possible of the city's urban structure, especially its attractive historic center and various architectural gems, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nNowadays, Leipzig is an important economic center in Germany. Since the 2010s, the city has been celebrated by the media as a hip urban center with a very high quality of living. It is often called \"The new Berlin\". Leipzig is also Germany's fastest growing city. Leipzig was the German candidate for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful. After ten years of construction, the Leipzig City Tunnel opened on 14 December 2013. Leipzig forms the centerpiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system, which operates in the four German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLeipzig lies at the confluence of the rivers White Elster, Plei\u00dfe and Parthe, in the Leipzig Bay, on the most southerly part of the North German Plain, which is the part of the North European Plain in Germany. The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the Leipzig Riverside Forest, though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat though there is also some evidence of moraine and drumlins.\nAlthough there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-cast mines in the region, many of which are being converted to use as lakes. Also see: Neuseenland\nLeipzig is also situated at the intersection of the ancient roads known as the Via Regia (King's highway), which traversed Germany in an east\u2013west direction, and the Via Imperii (Imperial Highway), a north\u2013south road.\nLeipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and the current \"ring\" road around the historic centre of the city follows the line of the old city walls.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nSince 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten districts, which in turn contain a total of 63 subdistricts. Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike many places located in Eastern parts of Germany, Leipzig has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb close to a Dfb [0 \u00b0C US isotherm]) with significant continental influences due to inland location. Winters are cool to cold, with an average of around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F). Summers are generally warm, averaging at 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) with daytime temperatures of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours a day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours a day).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nLeipzig has a population of about 570,000. In 1930, the population reached its historical peak of over 700,000. It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation. After almost doubling the city area by incorporation of surrounding towns in 1999, the number stabilised and started to rise again, with an increase of 1,000 in 2000. As of 2015, Leipzig is the fastest-growing city in Germany with over 500,000 inhabitants.\nThe growth of the past 10\u201315 years has mostly been due to inward migration. In recent years, inward migration accelerated, reaching an increase of 12,917 in 2014.In the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates. Births dropped from 7,000 in 1988 to less than 3,000 in 1994. However, the number of children born in Leipzig has risen since the late 1990s. In 2011, it reached 5,490 births resulting in a RNI of \u221217.7 (\u2212393.7 in 1995).The unemployment rate decreased from 18.2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2014 and 7.6% in June 2017.The percentage of the population from an immigrant background is low compared with other German cities. As of 2012, only 5.6% of the population were foreigners, compared to the German national average of 7.7%.The number of people with an immigrant background (immigrants and their children) grew from 49,323 in 2012 to 77,559 in 2016, making them 13.3% of the city's population (Leipzig's population 579,530 in 2016).The largest minorities (first and second generation) in Leipzig by country of origin as of 31.12.2018 are:\n\n\n== Culture, sights and cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe historic central area of Leipzig features a Renaissance-style ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several baroque period trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the historicist style representative of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The new city hall, completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\nSome 64,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in Plattenbau buildings during Communist rule in East Germany. and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, at least 10% of Leipzig's population (50,000 people) are still living in Plattenbau accommodation. Gr\u00fcnau, for example, has approximately 40,000 people living in this sort of accommodation.The St. Paul's Church was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called Paulinum, which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings and structures ===\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of 205 metres (673 feet).

It was ranked 25th out of 150 cities worldwide and above Dortmund, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Berlin.In 2018, Leipzig won the European Cities of Future prize in the category of \"Best Large City for Human Capital & Lifestyle\".Leipzig was named European City of the Year at the 2019 Urbanism Awards.According to the 2019 study by Forschungsinstitut Prognos, Leipzig is the most dynamic region in Germany. Within 15 years, the city climbed 230 places and occupied in 2019 rank 104 of all 401 German regions.Leipzig is one of 52 places to go in 2020 by The New York Times and the highest-ranking German destination.Leipzig Hauptbahnhof is the best railway station in Germany and the third-best in Europe (only surpassed by St Pancras railway station and Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof).\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFounded at the crossing of Via Regia and Via Imperii, Leipzig has been a major interchange of inter-European traffic and commerce since medieval times. After the Reunification of Germany, immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nOpened in 1915, Leipzig Central Station is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the ICE and Intercity network of the Deutsche Bahn as well as a connection point for S-Bahn and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\nIn Leipzig, the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg-)Berlin-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Munich and Dresden-Leipzig-Erfurt-Frankfurt am Main-(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. After completion of the high-speed line to Erfurt, the ICE will run on both lines via Leipzig/Halle Airport and Erfurt. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)-Magdeburg-Braunschweig-Hannover-Dortmund-K\u00f6ln and -Bremen-Oldenburg(-Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via two S-Bahn lines, one of which runs hourly via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200 km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300 km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg is scheduled for completion in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network will considerably reduce the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200 km/h. The ICE will also be able to operate from Leipzig to Dresden in the near future. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long City Tunnel, which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a large freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\n\n=== Suburban train ===\n\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and Bayerischer Bahnhof leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n\n=== Tramway and Buses ===\n\nThe Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe, existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\nThe total length of the tram network is 149.9 km (93.1 mi), making it the largest in Saxony ahead of Dresden (130.2 km (80.9 mi)) and the second largest in Germany after Berlin (193.6 km (120.3 mi)).\nThe longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be bicycle-friendly. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\nSince 2004 there is a bicycle-sharing system. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the A 14 in the north, the A 9 in the west and the A 38 in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the A 72 is also partly under construction or being planned.\nThe federal roads B 2, B 6, B 87, B 181, B 184 and B 186 lead through the city area.\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\nLeipzig has a dense network of carsharing stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a ridesharing provider. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n\n=== Long-distance buses ===\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5 million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and Leipziger Messe for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLeipzig/Halle Airport is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). DHL uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines Aerologic and European Air Transport Leipzig.\nThe former military airport near Altenburg, Thuringia called Leipzig-Altenburg Airport about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by Ryanair until 2010.\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the Elster-Saale canal, White Elster and Saale was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of forced labor. The Lindenauer port was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and Karl-Heine canal respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, New Luppe, Plei\u00dfe, and Parthe) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing mill races and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused open cast mines, the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the Elbe from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Quotations ==\nMein Leipzig lob' ich mir!

        "wiki": "S\u00fcdfriedhof (German: South Cemetery) is, with an area of 82 hectares, the largest cemetery in Leipzig. It is located in the south of Leipzig in the immediate vicinity of the V\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal. The S\u00fcdfriedhof is, along with the Ohlsdorf Cemetery in Hamburg and the S\u00fcdwestkirchfriedhof Stahnsdorf in Berlin, the largest park-like cemetery in Germany.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe plans for the cemetery began in 1879. Initially it was created on an area of 54 hectares under the direction of horticultural director of Leipzig, Otto Wittenberg and the architect Hugh Licht. The conduct of ways is in form of a linden leaf, which reflects the Slavic name of Leipzig \"The Town of the Linden\", and fulfil the aims of Art Nouveau as a Gesamtkunstwerk.\nWith the rapid development of the city during its industrialisation, incorporation of nearby settlements and the consequent steady population growth a new cemetery was needed. On 1 June 1886 the S\u00fcdfriedhof was opened by Mayor Otto Robert Georgi after the Nordfriedhof (North Cemetery) was opened in 1881. Shortly after, the first burial was made and the grave is still preserved in the I. Division. However, this burial ground was very unpopular at first. Many citizens of Leipzig chose to be buried at the Neuer Johannisfriedhof (New St. John's Cemetery) but this changed when it began to fill up and the trees on the S\u00fcdfriedhof became greater and the proposed park character was recognisable.\nVisitors to the nearby V\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal notice at first the chapel with its 60 meter high bell tower, which was opened in 1910. The Neo-Romanesque building ensemble, was built on a filled-up plateau and under the direction of Leipzig's building director Otto Wilhelm Scharenberg. It had the Romanesque Maria Laach Abbey in the Eifel region as a model and is the largest cemetery monument in Germany. The symmetrical complex of chapel facilities, crematorium and columbarium blends inconspicuously into the overall picture and is justified to the main north\u2013south axis of the cemetery. Until 1924 the cemetery was enlarged to 63 hectares. During World War II the most recent cemetery extension was made to the present area of 82 hectares. They buried the 3474 victims of the World War II bombing of Leipzig in today's XXVIII. Division.\nParticularly noteworthy are the historical monuments, some of which were by artists such as Max Klinger, Fritz Behn, Max Lange or Carl Seffner created in various styles.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nDue to the park-like character of the cemetery you find several kinds of trees, such as sweetgum, Mahonia, Metasequoia, Kentucky coffeetree, ginkgo and several kinds of Tilia. Furthermore, you can find about 9,000 Rhododendrons, which are up to four meters high. At the cemetery 60 nesting bird species are listed. There are numerous red squirrel and in the quiet morning and evening hours rabbits or foxes can be seen.\n\n\n== Notable Persons ==\n\nAlbrecht Alt, theologian\nFritz Baedeker, publisher\nJulius Bl\u00fcthner, piano maker, entrepreneur\nMax B\u00fcrger, medical doctor\nFranz Delitzsch, theologian and Hebraist\nFred Delmare, actor\nPaul Flechsig, neuroanatomist, psychiatrist and neuropathologist\nChristian F\u00fcrchtegott Gellert, poet\nSamuel Heinicke, originator in Germany of systematic education for the deaf\nJohannes Hertel, Indologist\nArthur Hoffmann, politician and resistance fighter\nSigfrid Karg-Elert, composer\nAlfred K\u00e4stner, politician and resistance fighter\nOskar Kellner, agricultural scientist, chemist, animal psychologist\nRudolf Kittel, theologist and editor of the Biblia Hebraica\nHugo Licht, architect of numerous buildings in Leipzig\nJulius Lips, ethnologist\nHans Meyer, geographer and first man on Mount Kilimanjaro\nHerrmann Julius Meyer, publisher\nErwin Payr, surgeon\nMax Robitzsch, meteorological scientist and arctic researcher\nRenate and Roger R\u00f6ssing, photographers\nCarl Seffner, sculptor, (e.g. Johann Sebastian Bach monument in front of thomaskirche)\nGeorg Schumann, politician and resistance fighter\nKarl Sudhoff, historian on medicine\nGeorg Thieme, publisher and founder of Thieme Medical Publishers\nStanislaw Trabalski, politician\nWerner T\u00fcbke, painter\nMarinus van der Lubbe, Dutch council communist accused of, and eventually executed for, setting fire to the German Reichstag building on February 27, 1933, an event known as the Reichstag fire.\nWilhelm Wundt, medical doctor, psychologist, physiologist, philosopher, known today as one of the founding figures of modern psychology\nErich Zeigner, politician\n\n\n== External links ==\nWebsite (German)\nMap with prominent graves on S\u00fcdfriedhof (German)\nDetailed essay on the history of the S\u00fcdfriedhof (German)",

        "wiki": "East Germany, officially the German Democratic Republic (GDR; German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik [\u02c8d\u0254\u028ft\u0283\u0259 demo\u02c8k\u0281a\u02d0t\u026a\u0283\u0259 \u0281epu\u02c8bli\u02d0k], DDR), was a state that existed from 1949 to 1990, the period when the eastern portion of Germany was part of the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. Commonly described as a communist state in English usage, it described itself as a socialist \"workers' and peasants' state\". It consisted of territory that was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the end of World War II\u2014the Soviet occupation zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the Oder\u2013Neisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin but did not include it and West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR.\nThe GDR was established in the Soviet zone while the Federal Republic of Germany, commonly referred to as West Germany, was established in the three western zones. A satellite state of the Soviet Union, Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948 and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. However, Soviet forces remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), although other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of the German Democratic Republic. The SED made the teaching of Marxism\u2013Leninism and the Russian language compulsory in schools.The economy was centrally planned and increasingly state-owned. Prices of housing, basic goods and services were heavily subsidised and set by central government planners rather than rising and falling through supply and demand. Although the GDR had to pay substantial war reparations to the Soviets, it became the most successful economy in the Eastern Bloc. Emigration to the West was a significant problem as many of the emigrants were well-educated young people and weakened the state economically. The government fortified its western borders and built the Berlin Wall in 1961. Many people attempting to flee were killed by border guards or booby traps such as landmines. Many others spent large amounts of time imprisoned for attempting to escape.In 1989, numerous social, economic and political forces in the GDR and abroad led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the establishment of a government committed to liberalisation. The following year, free and fair elections were held and international negotiations led to the signing of the Final Settlement treaty on the status and borders of Germany. The GDR dissolved itself and Germany was reunified on 3 October 1990, becoming a fully sovereign state in the reunified Federal Republic of Germany. Several of the GDR's leaders, notably its last communist leader Egon Krenz, were prosecuted after reunification for crimes committed during the Cold War.\nGeographically, the GDR bordered the Baltic Sea to the north, Poland to the east, Czechoslovakia to the southeast and West Germany to the southwest and west. Internally, the GDR also bordered the Soviet sector of Allied-occupied Berlin, known as East Berlin, which was also administered as the state's de facto capital. It also bordered the three sectors occupied by the United States, United Kingdom and France known collectively as West Berlin. The three sectors occupied by the Western nations were sealed off from the GDR by the Berlin Wall from its construction in 1961 until it was brought down in 1989.\n\n\n== Naming conventions ==\nThe official name was Deutsche Demokratische Republik (German Democratic Republic), usually abbreviated to DDR (GDR). Both terms were used in East Germany, with increasing usage of the abbreviated form, especially since East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners to be foreigners following the promulgation of its second constitution in 1968. West Germans, the western media and statesmen initially avoided the official name and its abbreviation, instead using terms like Ostzone (Eastern Zone), Sowjetische Besatzungszone (Soviet Occupation Zone; often abbreviated to SBZ) and sogenannte DDR or \"so-called GDR\".The centre of political power in East Berlin was referred to as Pankow (the seat of command of the Soviet forces in East Germany was referred to as Karlshorst). Over time, however, the abbreviation DDR was also increasingly used colloquially by West Germans and West German media.When used by West Germans, Westdeutschland (West Germany) was a term almost always in reference to the geographic region of Western Germany and not to the area within the boundaries of the Federal Republic of Germany. However, this use was not always consistent and West Berliners frequently used the term Westdeutschland to denote the Federal Republic. Before World War II, Ostdeutschland (eastern Germany) was used to describe all the territories east of the Elbe (East Elbia), as reflected in the works of sociologist Max Weber and political theorist Carl Schmitt.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nExplaining the internal impact of the GDR regime from the perspective of German history in the long term, historian Gerhard A. Ritter (2002) has argued that the East German state was defined by two dominant forces \u2013 Soviet communism on the one hand, and German traditions filtered through the interwar experiences of German communists on the other. It always was constrained by the powerful example of the increasingly prosperous West, to which East Germans compared their nation. The changes wrought by the communists were most apparent in ending capitalism and transforming industry and agriculture, in the militarization of society, and in the political thrust of the educational system and the media. On the other hand, there was relatively little change made in the historically independent domains of the sciences, the engineering professions, the Protestant churches, and in many bourgeois lifestyles. Social policy, says Ritter, became a critical legitimization tool in the last decades and mixed socialist and traditional elements about equally.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nAt the Yalta Conference during World War II, the Allies (the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union) agreed on dividing a defeated Nazi Germany into occupation zones, and on dividing Berlin, the German capital, among the Allied powers as well. Initially this meant the construction of three zones of occupation, i.e., American, British, and Soviet. Later, a French zone was carved out of the US and British zones.\n\n\n=== 1949 establishment ===\nThe ruling communist party, known as the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), was formed in April 1946 from the merger between the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) by mandate of Joseph Stalin. The two former parties were notorious rivals when they were active before the Nazis consolidated all power and criminalised them. The unification of the two parties was symbolic of the new friendship of German socialists in defeating their common enemy; however, the communists, who held a majority, had virtually total control over policy. The SED was the ruling party for the entire duration of the East German state. It had close ties with the Soviets, which maintained military forces in East Germany until its dissolution in 1991 (the Russian Federation continued to maintain forces in what had been East Germany until 1994), with the stated purpose of countering NATO bases in West Germany.\nAs West Germany was reorganized and gained independence from its occupiers, the GDR was established in East Germany in 1949. The creation of the two states solidified the 1945 division of Germany. On 10 March 1952, (in what would become known as the \"Stalin Note\") Stalin put forth a proposal to reunify Germany with a policy of neutrality, with no conditions on economic policies and with guarantees for \"the rights of man and basic freedoms, including freedom of speech, press, religious persuasion, political conviction, and assembly\" and free activity of democratic parties and organizations. This was turned down; reunification was not a priority for the leadership of West Germany, and the NATO powers declined the proposal, asserting that Germany should be able to join NATO and that such a negotiation with the Soviet Union would be seen as a capitulation. There have been several debates about whether a real chance for reunification had been missed in 1952.\nIn 1949, the Soviets turned control of East Germany over to the SED, headed by Wilhelm Pieck (1876\u20131960), who became president of the GDR and held the office until his death, while most executive authority was assumed by SED General Secretary Walter Ulbricht. Socialist leader Otto Grotewohl (1894\u20131964) became prime minister until his death.The government of East Germany denounced West German failures in accomplishing denazification and renounced ties to the Nazi past, imprisoning many former Nazis and preventing them from holding government positions. The SED set a primary goal of ridding East Germany of all traces of Nazism.\n\n\n=== Zones of occupation ===\n\nIn the Yalta and Potsdam conferences, the Allies established their joint military occupation and administration of Germany via the Allied Control Council (ACC), a four-power (US, UK, USSR, France) military government effective until the restoration of German sovereignty. In eastern Germany, the Soviet Occupation Zone (SBZ \u2013 Sowjetische Besatzungszone) comprised the five states (L\u00e4nder) of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia. Disagreements over the policies to be followed in the occupied zones quickly led to a breakdown in cooperation between the four powers, and the Soviets administered their zone without regard to the policies implemented in the other zones. The Soviets withdrew from the ACC in 1948; subsequently as the other three zones were increasingly unified and granted self-government, the Soviet administration instituted a separate socialist government in its zone.\n\nYet, seven years after the Allies' Potsdam Agreement to a unified Germany, the USSR via the Stalin Note (10 March 1952) proposed German reunification and superpower disengagement from Central Europe, which the three Western Allies (the United States, France, the United Kingdom) rejected. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, a Communist proponent of reunification, died in early March 1953. Similarly, Lavrenty Beria, the First Deputy Prime Minister of the USSR, pursued German reunification, but he was removed from power that same year before he could act on the matter. His successor, Nikita Khrushchev, rejected reunification as equivalent to returning East Germany for annexation to the West; hence reunification went unconsidered until 1989.\n\nEast Germany considered East Berlin to be its capital, and the Soviet Union and the rest of the Eastern Bloc diplomatically recognized East Berlin as the capital. However, the Western Allies disputed this recognition, considering the entire city of Berlin to be occupied territory governed by the Allied Control Council. According to Margarete Feinstein, East Berlin's status as the capital was largely unrecognized by the West and most Third World countries. In practice, the ACC's authority was rendered moot by the Cold War, and East Berlin's status as occupied territory largely became a legal fiction, and the Soviet sector became fully integrated into the GDR.The deepening Cold War conflict between the Western Powers and the Soviet Union over the unresolved status of West Berlin led to the Berlin Blockade (24 June 1948 \u2013 12 May 1949). The Soviet army initiated the blockade by halting all Allied rail, road, and water traffic to and from West Berlin. The Allies countered the Soviets with the Berlin Airlift (1948\u201349) of food, fuel, and supplies to West Berlin.\n\n\n=== Partition ===\nOn 21 April 1946, the Communist Party of Germany (Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands \u2013 KPD) and the part of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands \u2013 SPD) in the Soviet zone merged to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED \u2013 Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands), which then won the elections of 1946. The SED's government nationalised infrastructure and industrial plants.\n\nIn 1948, the German Economic Commission (Deutsche Wirtschaftskomission\u2014DWK) under its chairman Heinrich Rau assumed administrative authority in the Soviet occupation zone, thus becoming the predecessor of an East German government.On 7 October 1949, the SED established the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (German Democratic Republic \u2013 GDR), based on a socialist political constitution establishing its control of the Anti-Fascist National Front of the German Democratic Republic (NF, Nationale Front der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik), an omnibus alliance of every party and mass organisation in East Germany. The NF was established to stand for election to the Volkskammer (People's Chamber), the East German parliament. The first and only president of the German Democratic Republic was Wilhelm Pieck. However, after 1950, political power in East Germany was held by the First Secretary of the SED, Walter Ulbricht.\n\nOn 16 June 1953, workers constructing the new Stalinallee boulevard in East Berlin, according to The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design, rioted against a 10% production quota increase. Initially a labour protest, it soon included the general populace, and on 17 June similar protests occurred throughout the GDR, with more than a million people striking in some 700 cities and towns. Fearing anti-communist counter-revolution on 18 June 1953, the government of the GDR enlisted the Soviet Occupation Forces to aid the police in ending the riot; some fifty people were killed and 10,000 were jailed. (See Uprising of 1953 in East Germany.)\nThe German war reparations owed to the Soviets impoverished the Soviet Zone of Occupation and severely weakened the East German economy. In the 1945\u201346 period, the Soviets confiscated and transported to the USSR approximately 33% of the industrial plant and by the early 1950s had extracted some US$10 billion in reparations in agricultural and industrial products. The poverty of East Germany induced by reparations provoked the Republikflucht (\"desertion from the republic\") to West Germany, further weakening the GDR's economy. Western economic opportunities induced a brain drain. In response, the GDR closed the Inner German Border, and on the night of 12 August 1961, East German soldiers began erecting the Berlin Wall.\n\nIn 1971, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev had Ulbricht removed; Erich Honecker replaced him. While the Ulbricht government had experimented with liberal reforms, the Honecker government reversed them. The new government introduced a new East German Constitution which defined the German Democratic Republic as a \"republic of workers and peasants\".Initially, East Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany, a claim supported by most of the Communist bloc. It claimed that West Germany was an illegally-constituted NATO puppet state. However, from the 1960s onward, East Germany began recognizing itself as a separate country from West Germany, and shared the legacy of the united German state of 1871\u20131945. This was formalized in 1974, when the reunification clause was removed from the revised East German constitution. West Germany, in contrast, maintained that it was the only legitimate government of Germany. From 1949 to the early 1970s, West Germany maintained that East Germany was an illegally constituted state. It argued that the GDR was a Soviet puppet state, and frequently referred to it as the \"Soviet occupation zone\". This position was shared by West Germany's allies as well until 1973. East Germany was recognized primarily by Communist countries and the Arab bloc, along with some \"scattered sympathizers\". According to the Hallstein Doctrine (1955), West Germany also did not establish (formal) diplomatic ties with any country \u2013 except the Soviets \u2013 that recognized East German sovereignty.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Ostpolitik (\"Eastern Policy\") of \"Change Through Rapprochement\" of the pragmatic government of FRG Chancellor Willy Brandt, established normal diplomatic relations with the East Bloc states. This policy saw the Treaty of Moscow (August 1970), the Treaty of Warsaw (December 1970), the Four Power Agreement on Berlin (September 1971), the Transit Agreement (May 1972), and the Basic Treaty (December 1972), which relinquished any claims to an exclusive mandate over Germany as a whole and established normal relations between the two Germanys. Both countries were admitted into the United Nations on 18 September 1973. This also increased the number of countries recognizing East Germany to 55, including the US, UK and France, though these three still refused to recognize East Berlin as the capital, and insisted on a specific provision in the UN resolution accepting the two Germanys into the UN to that effect.  Following the Ostpolitik the West German view was that East Germany was a de facto government within a single German nation and a de jure state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognize the GDR de jure as a sovereign state under international law; but it fully acknowledged that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state. By distinction, West Germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the de facto and de jure government, but also the sole de jure legitimate representative of a dormant \"Germany as whole\".  The two Germanys relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally; which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations de jure in participating in international bodies and agreements, such as the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act.\nThis assessment of the Basic Treaty was confirmed in a decision of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1973;\nthe German Democratic Republic is in the international-law sense a State and as such a subject of international law. This finding is independent of recognition in international law of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal Republic of Germany. Such recognition has not only never been formally pronounced by the Federal Republic of Germany but on the contrary repeatedly explicitly rejected. If the conduct of the Federal Republic of Germany towards the German Democratic Republic is assessed in the light of its d\u00e9tente policy, in particular the conclusion of the Treaty as de facto recognition, then it can only be understood as de facto recognition of a special kind. The special feature of this Treaty is that while it is a bilateral Treaty between two States, to which the rules of international law apply and which like any other international treaty possesses validity, it is between two States that are parts of a still existing, albeit incapable of action as not being reorganized, comprehensive State of the Whole of Germany with a single body politic.\nTravel between the GDR and Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary became visa-free from 1972.\n\n\n=== GDR identity ===\n\nFrom the beginning, the newly formed GDR tried to establish its own separate identity. Because of the imperial and military legacy of Prussia, the SED repudiated continuity between Prussia and the GDR. The SED destroyed a number of symbolic relics of the former Prussian aristocracy: the Junker manor houses were torn down, the Berliner Stadtschlo\u00df was razed, and the equestrian statue of Frederick the Great was removed from East Berlin. Instead the SED focused on the progressive heritage of German history, including Thomas M\u00fcntzer's role in the German Peasants' War and the role played by the heroes of the class struggle during Prussia's industrialization.\nEspecially after the Ninth Party Congress in 1976, East Germany upheld historical reformers such as Karl Freiherr vom Stein, Karl August von Hardenberg, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and Gerhard von Scharnhorst as examples and role models.\n\n\n=== Die Wende (German reunification) ===\n\nIn May 1989, following widespread public anger over the faking of results of local government elections, many citizens applied for exit visas or left the country contrary to GDR laws. The impetus for this exodus of East Germans was the removal of the electrified fence along Hungary's border with Austria on 2 May. Although formally the Hungarian frontier was still closed, many East Germans took the opportunity to enter the country via Czechoslovakia, and then make the illegal crossing from Hungary into Austria and West Germany beyond. By July, 25,000 East Germans had crossed into Hungary, most of whom did not attempt the risky crossing into Austria but remained instead in Hungary or claimed asylum in West German embassies in Prague or Budapest.\n\nThe opening of a border gate between Austria and Hungary at the Pan-European Picnic on August 19, 1989 then set in motion a chain reaction, at the end of which there was no longer a GDR and the Eastern Bloc had disintegrated. It was the largest escape movement from East Germany since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. The idea of opening the border at a ceremony came from Otto von Habsburg and was brought up by him to Mikl\u00f3s N\u00e9meth, the then Hungarian Prime Minister, who promoted the idea. The patrons of the picnic, Habsburg and the Hungarian Minister of State Imre Pozsgay, who were not present at the event, saw the planned event as an opportunity to test Mikhail Gorbachev`s reaction to an opening of the border on the Iron Curtain. In particular, it was examined whether Moscow would give the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary the command to intervene. Extensive advertising for the planned picnic was made by posters and flyers among the GDR holidaymakers in Hungary. The Austrian branch of the Paneuropean Union, which was then headed by Karl von Habsburg, distributed thousands of brochures inviting them to a picnic near the border at Sopron. The local Sopron organizers knew nothing of possible GDR refugees, but thought of a local party with Austrian and Hungarian participation.  But with the mass exodus at the Pan-European Picnic, the subsequent hesitant behavior of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the non-intervention of the Soviet Union broke the dams. Thus the bracket of the Eastern Bloc was broken. The reaction to this from Erich Honecker in the \"Daily Mirror\" of August 19, 1989 was too late and showed the current loss of power: \u201cHabsburg distributed leaflets far into Poland, on which the East German holidaymakers were invited to a picnic. When they came to the picnic, they were given gifts, food and Deutsche Mark, and then they were persuaded to come to the West.\u201d Now tens of thousands of the media-informed East Germans made their way to Hungary, which was no longer ready to keep its borders completely closed or to oblige its border troops to use force of arms. The leadership of the GDR in East Berlin did not dare to completely lock the borders of their own country.The next major turning point in the exodus came on 10 September, when the Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn announced that his country would no longer restrict movement from Hungary into Austria. Within two days 22,000 East Germans crossed into Austria, with tens of thousands following in the coming weeks.Many others demonstrated against the ruling party, especially in the city of Leipzig. The Leipzig demonstrations became a weekly occurrence, showing a turnout of 10,000 people at the first demonstration on 2 October and peaking at an estimated 300,000 by the end of the month. The protests were surpassed in East Berlin, where half a million demonstrators turned out against the regime on 4 November. Kurt Masur, the conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, led local negotiations with the government and held town meetings in the concert hall. The demonstrations eventually led Erich Honecker to resign in October, and he was replaced by a slightly more moderate communist, Egon Krenz.\n\nThe massive demonstration in East Berlin on 4 November coincided with Czechoslovakia formally opening its border into West Germany. With the West more accessible than ever before, 30,000 East Germans made the crossing via Czechoslovakia in the first two days alone. To try to stem the outward flow of the population, the SED proposed a concessionary law loosening restrictions on travel. When this was rejected in the Volkskammer on 5 November, the Cabinet and the Politburo of the GDR resigned. It left only one avenue open for Krenz and the SED, that of completely abolishing travel restrictions between East and West.\nOn 9 November 1989, a few sections of the Berlin Wall were opened, resulting in thousands of East Germans crossing freely into West Berlin and West Germany for the first time in nearly 30 years. Krenz resigned a month later, and the SED opened negotiations with the leaders of the incipient Democratic movement, Neues Forum, to schedule free elections and begin the process of democratization. As part of this, the SED eliminated the clause in the East German constitution guaranteeing the Communists leadership of the state. This was approved in the Volkskammer on 1 December 1989 by a vote of 420 to 0.\n\nEast Germany held its last elections in March 1990. The winner was a coalition headed by the East German branch of West Germany's Christian Democratic Union, which advocated speedy reunification. Negotiations (2+4 Talks) were held involving the two German states and the former Allies which led to agreement on the conditions for German unification. By a two-thirds vote in the Volkskammer on 23 August 1990, the German Democratic Republic declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany. The five original East German states that had been abolished in the 1952 redistricting were restored. On 3 October 1990, the five states officially joined the Federal Republic of Germany, while East and West Berlin united as a third city-state (in the same manner as Bremen and Hamburg). On 1 July a currency union preceded the political union: the \"Ostmark\" was abolished, and the Western German \"Deutsche Mark\" became common currency.\nAlthough the Volkskammer's declaration of accession to the Federal Republic had initiated the process of reunification; the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms, conditions and qualifications; some of which involved amendments to the West German Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic now recognising each other as separate sovereign states in international law. This treaty was then voted into effect prior to the agreed date for Unification by both the Volkskammer and the Bundestag by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR, and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic.\nThe great economic and socio-political inequalities between the former Germanies required government subsidy for the full integration of the German Democratic Republic into the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of the resulting deindustrialization in the former East Germany, the causes of the failure of this integration continue to be debated. Some western commentators claim that the depressed eastern economy is a natural aftereffect of a demonstrably inefficient command economy. But many East German critics contend that the shock-therapy style of privatization, the artificially high rate of exchange offered for the Ostmark, and the speed with which the entire process was implemented did not leave room for East German enterprises to adapt.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThere were four periods in East German political history. These included: 1949\u201361, which saw the building of socialism; 1961\u20131970 after the Berlin Wall closed off escape was a period of stability and consolidation; 1971\u201385 was termed the Honecker Era, and saw closer ties with West Germany; and 1985\u201389 saw the decline and extinction of East Germany.\n\n\n=== Organization ===\n\nThe ruling political party in East Germany was the Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands (Socialist Unity Party of Germany, SED). It was created in 1946 through the Soviet-directed merger of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in the Soviet controlled zone. However, the SED quickly transformed into a full-fledged Communist party as the more independent-minded Social Democrats were pushed out.The Potsdam Agreement committed the Soviets to supporting a democratic form of government in Germany, though the Soviets' understanding of democracy was radically different from that of the West. As in other Soviet-bloc countries, non-communist political parties were allowed. Nevertheless, every political party in the GDR was forced to join the National Front of Democratic Germany, a broad coalition of parties and mass political organisations, including:\n\nChristlich-Demokratische Union Deutschlands (Christian Democratic Union of Germany, CDU), which merged with the West German CDU after reunification.\nDemokratische Bauernpartei Deutschlands (Democratic Farmers' Party of Germany, DBD). The party merged with the West German CDU after reunification.\nLiberal-Demokratische Partei Deutschlands (Liberal Democratic Party of Germany, LDPD), merged with the West German FDP after reunification.\nNationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (National Democratic Party of Germany, NDPD), merged with the West German FDP after reunification.\n\nThe member parties were almost completely subservient to the SED, and had to accept its \"leading role\" as a condition of their existence. However, the parties did have representation in the Volkskammer and received some posts in the government.\nThe Volkskammer also included representatives from the mass organisations like the Free German Youth (Freie Deutsche Jugend or FDJ), or the Free German Trade Union Federation. There was also a Democratic Women's Federation of Germany, with seats in the Volkskammer.\nImportant non-parliamentary mass organisations in East German society included the German Gymnastics and Sports Association (Deutscher Turn- und Sportbund or DTSB), and People's Solidarity (Volkssolidarit\u00e4t), an organisation for the elderly. Another society of note was the Society for German-Soviet Friendship.\nAfter the fall of Communism, the SED was renamed the \"Party of Democratic Socialism\" (PDS) which continued for a decade after reunification before merging with the West German WASG to form the Left Party (Die Linke). The Left Party continues to be a political force in many parts of Germany, albeit drastically less powerful than the SED.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\nThe East German population declined by three million people throughout its forty-one year history, from 19 million in 1948 to 16 million in 1990; of the 1948 population, some 4 million were deported from the lands east of the Oder-Neisse line, which made the home of millions of Germans part of Poland and the Soviet Union. This was a stark contrast from Poland, which increased during that time; from 24 million in 1950 (a little more than East Germany) to 38 million (more than twice of East Germany's population). This was primarily a result of emigration\u2014about one quarter of East Germans left the country before the Berlin Wall was completed in 1961, and after that time, East Germany had very low birth rates, except for a recovery in the 1980s when the birth rate in East Germany was considerably higher than in West Germany.\n\n\n=== Vital statistics ===\n\n\n=== Major cities ===\n(1988 populations)\n\nEast Berlin (1,200,000)\nLeipzig (556,000)\nDresden (520,000)\nKarl-Marx-Stadt (317,000) (Chemnitz until 1953, reverted to original name in 1990)\nMagdeburg (290,000)\nRostock (250,000)\nHalle (Saale) (236,000)\nErfurt (215,000)\nPotsdam (140,000)\nGera (131,000)\nSchwerin (130,000)\nCottbus (125,000)\nZwickau (120,000)\nJena (107,000)\nDessau (105,000)\n\n\n== Administrative districts ==\n\nUntil 1952, East Germany comprised the capital, East Berlin (though legally it was not fully part of the GDR's territory), and the five German states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (in 1947 renamed Mecklenburg), Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, and Saxony, their post-war territorial demarcations approximating the pre-war German demarcations of the Middle German L\u00e4nder (states) and Provinzen (provinces of Prussia). The western parts of two provinces, Pomerania and Lower Silesia, the remainder of which were annexed by Poland, remained in the GDR and were attached to Mecklenburg and Saxony, respectively.\nThe East German Administrative Reform of 1952 established 14 Bezirke (districts) and de facto disestablished the five L\u00e4nder. The new Bezirke, named after their district centres, were as follows: (i) Rostock, (ii) Neubrandenburg, and (iii) Schwerin created from the Land (state) of Mecklenburg; (iv) Potsdam, (v) Frankfurt (Oder), and (vii) Cottbus from Brandenburg; (vi) Magdeburg and (viii) Halle from Saxony-Anhalt; (ix) Leipzig, (xi) Dresden, and (xii) Karl-Marx-Stadt (Chemnitz until 1953 and again from 1990) from Saxony; and (x) Erfurt, (xiii) Gera, and (xiv) Suhl from Thuringia.\nEast Berlin was made the country's 15th Bezirk in 1961 but retained special legal status until 1968, when the residents approved the new (draft) constitution. Despite the city as a whole being legally under the control of the Allied Control Council, and diplomatic objections of the Allied governments, the GDR administered the Bezirk of Berlin as part of its territory.\n\n\n== Military ==\n\nThe government of East Germany had control over a large number of military and paramilitary organisations through various ministries. Chief among these was the Ministry of National Defence. Because of East Germany's proximity to the West during the Cold War (1945\u201392), its military forces were among the most advanced of the Warsaw Pact. Defining what was a military force and what was not is a matter of some dispute.\n\n\n=== National People's Army ===\n\nThe Nationale Volksarmee (NVA) was the largest military organisation in East Germany. It was formed in 1956 from the Kasernierte Volkspolizei (Barracked People's Police), the military units of the regular police (Volkspolizei), when East Germany joined the Warsaw Pact. From its creation, it was controlled by the Ministry of National Defence (East Germany). It was an all volunteer force until an eighteen-month conscription period was introduced in 1962.\nIt was regarded by NATO officers as the best military in the Warsaw Pact.\nThe NVA consisted of the following branches:\n\nArmy (Landstreitkr\u00e4fte)\nNavy (Volksmarine \u2013 People's Navy)\nAir Force (Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte/Luftverteidigung)\n\n\n=== Border troops ===\n\nThe border troops of the Eastern sector were originally organised as a police force, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei, similar to the Bundesgrenzschutz in West Germany. It was controlled by the Ministry of the Interior. Following the remilitarisation of East Germany in 1956, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei was transformed into a military force in 1961, modeled after the Soviet Border Troops, and transferred to the Ministry of National Defense, as part of the National People's Army. In 1973, it was separated from the NVA, but it remained under the same ministry. At its peak, it numbered approximately 47,000 men.\n\n\n=== Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft ===\n\nAfter the NVA was separated from the Volkspolizei in 1956, the Ministry of the Interior maintained its own public order barracked reserve, known as the Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften (VPB). These units were, like the Kasernierte Volkspolizei, equipped as motorised infantry, and they numbered between 12,000 and 15,000 men.\n\n\n=== Stasi ===\n\nThe Ministry of State Security (Stasi) included the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment, which was mainly involved with facilities security and plain clothes events security. They were the only part of the feared Stasi that was visible to the public, and so were very unpopular within the population. The Stasi numbered around 90,000 men, the Guards Regiment around 11,000-12,000 men.\n\n\n=== Combat groups of the working class ===\nThe Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse (combat groups of the working class) numbered around 400,000 for much of their existence, and were organised around factories. The KdA was the political-military instrument of the SED; it was essentially a \"party Army\". All KdA directives and decisions were made by the ZK's Politb\u00fcro. They received their training from the Volkspolizei and the Ministry of the Interior. Membership was voluntary, but SED members were required to join as part of their membership obligation.\n\n\n=== Conscientious objection ===\n\nEvery man was required to serve eighteen months of compulsory military service; for the medically unqualified and conscientious objector, there were the Baueinheiten (construction units), established in 1964, two years after the introduction of conscription, in response to political pressure by the national Lutheran Protestant Church upon the GDR's government. In the 1970s, East German leaders acknowledged that former construction soldiers were at a disadvantage when they rejoined the civilian sphere.\n\n\n== Foreign policy ==\n\n\n=== United States as primary threat ===\n\nThe East German state promoted an \"anti-imperialist\" line that was reflected in all its media and all the schools.  This line followed Lenin's theory of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and Dimitrov's theory of fascism as the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of financial capitalism. Popular reaction to these measures was mixed, and Western media penetrated the country both through cross-border television and radio broadcasts from West Germany and from the U.S. propaganda network Radio Free Europe. Dissidents, particularly professionals, sometimes fled to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961.\n\n\n=== Support of Third World socialist countries ===\n\nAfter receiving wider international diplomatic recognition in 1972\u201373, the GDR began active cooperation with Third World socialist governments and national liberation movements. While the USSR was in control of the overall strategy and Cuban armed forces were involved in the actual combat (mostly in the People's Republic of Angola and socialist Ethiopia), the GDR provided experts for military hardware maintenance and personnel training, and oversaw creation of secret security agencies based on its own Stasi model.\nAlready in the 1960s contacts were established with Angola's MPLA, Mozambique's FRELIMO and the PAIGC in Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. In the 1970s official cooperation was established with other self-proclaimed socialist governments and people's republics: People's Republic of the Congo, People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Somali Democratic Republic, Libya, and the People's Republic of Benin.\nThe first military agreement was signed in 1973 with the People's Republic of the Congo. In 1979 friendship treaties were signed with Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia.\nIt was estimated that altogether, 2000\u20134000 DDR military and security experts were dispatched to Africa. In addition, representatives from African and Arab countries and liberation movements underwent military training in the GDR.\n\n\n=== East Germany and the Middle East conflict ===\nEast Germany pursued an anti-Zionist policy; Jeffrey Herf argues that East Germany was waging an undeclared war on Israel. According to Herf, \"the Middle East was one of the crucial battlefields of the global Cold War between the Soviet Union and the West; it was also a region in which East Germany played a salient role in the Soviet bloc\u2019s antagonism toward Israel.\" While East Germany saw itself as an \"anti-fascist state\", it regarded Israel as a \"fascist state\" and East Germany strongly supported the Palestine Liberation Organization in its armed struggle against Israel. In 1974, the GDR government recognized the PLO as the \"sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people\". The PLO declared the Palestinian state on 15 November 1988 during the First Intifada and the GDR recognized the state prior to reunification. After becoming a member of the UN, East Germany \"made excellent use of the UN to wage political warfare against Israel [and was] an enthusiastic, high-profile, and vigorous member\" of the anti-Israeli majority of the General Assembly.\n\n\n=== Soviet military occupation ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe East German economy began poorly because of the devastation caused by the Second World War; the loss of so many young soldiers, the disruption of business and transportation, the allied bombing campaigns that decimated cities, and reparations owed to the USSR. The Red Army dismantled and transported to Russia the infrastructure and industrial plants of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. By the early 1950s, the reparations were paid in agricultural and industrial products; and Lower Silesia, with its coal mines and Szczecin, an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision of Stalin and in accordance with Potsdam Agreement.The socialist centrally planned economy of the German Democratic Republic was like that of the USSR. In 1950, the GDR joined the COMECON trade bloc. In 1985, collective (state) enterprises earned 96.7% of the net national income. To ensure stable prices for goods and services, the state paid 80% of basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita income was $9,800 ($22,600 in 2015 dollars). In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was approximately five percent. This made East German economy the richest in all of the Soviet Bloc until reunification in 1990.Notable East German exports were photographic cameras, under the Praktica brand; automobiles under the Trabant, Wartburg, and the IFA brands; hunting rifles, sextants, typewriters and wristwatches.\nUntil the 1960s, East Germans endured shortages of basic foodstuffs such as sugar and coffee. East Germans with friends or relatives in the West (or with any access to a hard currency) and the necessary Staatsbank foreign currency account could afford Western products and export-quality East German products via Intershop. Consumer goods also were available, by post, from the Danish Jauerfood, and Genex companies.\nThe government used money and prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised prices for a wide range of basic goods and services, in what was known as \"the second pay packet\".  At the production level, artificial prices made for a system of semi-barter and resource hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR money with time, barter, and hard currencies. The socialist economy became steadily more dependent on financial infusions from hard-currency loans from West Germany. East Germans, meanwhile, came to see their soft currency as worthless relative to the Deutsche Mark (DM). \nEconomic issues would also persist in the east of Germany after the reunification of the west and the east, James Hawes in his book 'the shortest history of Germany'. Quotes from the federal office of political education (23 June 2009) 'In 1991 alone, 153 billion Deutschmarks had to be transferred to eastern Germany to secure incomes, support businesses and improve infrastructure... by 1999 the total had amounted to 1.634 trillion Marks net... The sums were so large that public debt in Germany more than doubled.'\n\n\n=== Consumption and jobs ===\nMany western commentators have maintained that loyalty to the SED was a primary criterion for getting a good job, and that professionalism was secondary to political criteria in personnel recruitment and development.Beginning in 1963 with a series of secret international agreements, East Germany recruited workers from Poland, Hungary, Cuba, Albania, Mozambique, Angola and North Vietnam. They numbered more than 100,000 by 1989. Many, such as future politician Zeca Schall (who emigrated from Angola in 1988 as a contract worker) stayed in Germany after the Wende.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nReligion became contested ground in the GDR, with the governing Communists promoting state atheism, although some people remained loyal to Christian communities. In 1957 the State authorities established a State Secretariat for Church Affairs to handle the government's contact with churches and with religious groups; the SED remained officially atheist.In 1950, 85% of the GDR citizens were Protestants, while 10% were Catholics. In 1961, the renowned philosophical theologian Paul Tillich claimed that the Protestant population in East Germany had the most admirable Church in Protestantism, because the Communists there had not been able to win a spiritual victory over them. By 1989, membership in the Christian churches dropped significantly. Protestants constituted 25% of the population, Catholics 5%. The share of people who considered themselves non-religious rose from 5% in 1950 to 70% in 1989.\n\n\n=== State atheism ===\n\nWhen it first came to power, the Communist party asserted the compatibility of Christianity and Marxism and sought Christian participation in the building of socialism. At first the promotion of Marxist-Leninist atheism received little official attention. In the mid-1950s, as the Cold War heated up, atheism became a topic of major interest for the state, in both domestic and foreign contexts. University chairs and departments devoted to the study of scientific atheism were founded and much literature (scholarly and popular) on the subject was produced. This activity subsided in the late 1960s amid perceptions that it had started to become counterproductive. Official and scholarly attention to atheism renewed beginning in 1973, though this time with more emphasis on scholarship and on the training of cadres than on propaganda. Throughout, the attention paid to atheism in East Germany was never intended to jeopardise the cooperation that was desired from those East Germans who were religious.\n\n\n=== Protestantism ===\n\nEast Germany, historically, was majority Protestant (primarily Lutheran) from the early stages of the Protestant Reformation onwards. In 1948, freed from the influence of the Nazi-oriented German Christians, Lutheran, Reformed and United churches from most parts of Germany came together as the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) at the Conference of Eisenach (Kirchenversammlung von Eisenach).\nIn 1969 the regional Protestant churches in East Germany and East Berlin broke away from the EKD and formed the Federation of Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic (German: Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR, BEK), in 1970 also joined by the Moravian Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeine. In June 1991, following the German reunification, the BEK churches again merged with the EKD ones.\nBetween 1956 and 1971 the leadership of the East German Lutheran churches gradually changed its relations with the state from hostility to cooperation. From the founding of the GDR in 1949, the Socialist Unity Party sought to weaken the influence of the church on the rising generation. The church adopted an attitude of confrontation and distance toward the state. Around 1956 this began to develop into a more neutral stance accommodating conditional loyalty. The government was no longer regarded as illegitimate; instead, the church leaders started viewing the authorities as installed by God and, therefore, deserving of obedience by Christians. But on matters where the state demanded something which the churches felt was not in accordance with the will of God, the churches reserved their right to say no. There were both structural and intentional causes behind this development. Structural causes included the hardening of Cold War tensions in Europe in the mid-1950s, which made it clear that the East German state was not temporary. The loss of church members also made it clear to the leaders of the church that they had to come into some kind of dialogue with the state. The intentions behind the change of attitude varied from a traditional liberal Lutheran acceptance of secular power to a positive attitude toward socialist ideas.Manfred Stolpe became a lawyer for the Brandenburg Protestant Church in 1959 before taking up a position at church headquarters in Berlin. In 1969 he helped found the Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR (BEK), where he negotiated with the government while at the same time working within the institutions of this Protestant body. He won the regional elections for the Brandenburg state assembly at the head of the SPD list in 1990. Stolpe remained in the Brandenburg government until he joined the federal government in 2002.\nApart from the Protestant state churches (German: Landeskirchen) united in the EKD/BEK and the Catholic Church there was a number of smaller Protestant bodies, including Protestant Free Churches (German: Evangelische Freikirchen) united in the Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic and the Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in Germany, as well as the Free Lutheran Church, the Old Lutheran Church and Federation of the Reformed Churches in the German Democratic Republic. The Moravian Church also had its presence as the Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeine. There were also other Protestants such as Methodists, Adventists, Mennonites and Quakers.\n\n\n=== Catholicism ===\n\nThe smaller Catholic Church in eastern Germany had a fully functioning episcopal hierarchy that was in full accord with the Vatican. During the early postwar years, tensions were high. The Catholic Church as a whole (and particularly the bishops) resisted both the East German state and Marxist ideology. The state allowed the bishops to lodge protests, which they did on issues such as abortion.After 1945 the Church did fairly well in integrating Catholic exiles from lands to the east (which mostly became part of Poland) and in adjusting its institutional structures to meet the needs of a church within an officially atheist society. This meant an increasingly hierarchical church structure, whereas in the area of religious education, press, and youth organisations, a system of temporary staff was developed, one that took into account the special situation of Caritas, a Catholic charity organisation. By 1950, therefore, there existed a Catholic subsociety that was well adjusted to prevailing specific conditions and capable of maintaining Catholic identity.With a generational change in the episcopacy taking place in the early 1980s, the state hoped for better relations with the new bishops, but the new bishops instead began holding unauthorised mass meetings, promoting international ties in discussions with theologians abroad, and hosting ecumenical conferences. The new bishops became less politically oriented and more involved in pastoral care and attention to spiritual concerns. The government responded by limiting international contacts for bishops.List of apostolic administrators:\n\nErfurt-Meiningen\nG\u00f6rlitz\nMagdeburg\nSchwerin\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nEast Germany's culture was strongly influenced by communist thought and was marked by an attempt to define itself in opposition to the west, particularly West Germany and the United States. Critics of the East German state have claimed that the state's commitment to Communism was a hollow and cynical tool, Machiavellian in nature, but this assertion has been challenged by studies that have found that the East German leadership was genuinely committed to the advance of scientific knowledge, economic development, and social progress. However, Pence and Betts argue, the majority of East Germans over time increasingly regarded the state's ideals to be hollow, though there was also a substantial number of East Germans who regarded their culture as having a healthier, more authentic mentality than that of West Germany.GDR culture and politics were limited by the harsh censorship.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe Puhdys and Karat were some of the most popular mainstream bands in East Germany. Like most mainstream acts, they appeared in popular youth magazines such as Neues Leben and Magazin. Other popular rock bands were Wir, City, Silly and Pankow. Most of these artists recorded on the state-owned AMIGA label.Schlager, which was very popular in the west, also gained a foothold early on in East Germany, and numerous musicians, such as Gerd Christian, Uwe Jensen, and Hartmut Schulze-Gerlach gained national fame. From 1962 to 1976, an international schlager festival was held in Rostock, garnering participants from between 18 and 22 countries each year. The city of Dresden held a similar international festival for schlager musicians from 1971 until shortly before reunification. There was a national schlager contest hosted yearly in Magdeburg from 1966 to 1971 as well.Bands and singers from other Communist countries were popular, e.g. Czerwone Gitary from Poland known as the Rote Gitarren. Czech Karel Gott, the Golden Voice from Prague, was beloved in both German states. Hungarian band Omega performed in both German states, and Yugoslavian band Korni Grupa toured East Germany in the 1970s.West German television and radio could be received in many parts of the East. The Western influence led to the formation of more \"underground\" groups with a decisively western-oriented sound. A few of these bands \u2013 the so-called Die anderen Bands (\"the other bands\") \u2013 were Die Skeptiker, Die Art and Feeling B. Additionally, hip hop culture reached the ears of the East German youth. With videos such as Beat Street and Wild Style, young East Germans were able to develop a hip hop culture of their own. East Germans accepted hip hop as more than just a music form. The entire street culture surrounding rap entered the region and became an outlet for oppressed youth.The government of the GDR was invested in both promoting the tradition of German classical music, and in supporting composers to write new works in that tradition. Notable East German composers include Hanns Eisler, Paul Dessau, Ernst Hermann Meyer, Rudolf Wagner-R\u00e9geny, and Kurt Schwaen.\nThe birthplace of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685\u20131750), Eisenach, was rendered as a museum about him, featuring more than three hundred instruments, which, in 1980, received some 70,000 visitors. In Leipzig, the Bach archive contains his compositions and correspondence and recordings of his music.Governmental support of classical music maintained some fifty symphony orchestras, such as Gewandhausorchester and Thomanerchor in Leipzig; S\u00e4chsische Staatskapelle in Dresden; and Berliner Sinfonie Orchester and Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin. Kurt Masur was their prominent conductor.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nEast German theatre was originally dominated by Bertolt Brecht, who brought back many artists out of exile and reopened the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm with his Berliner Ensemble. Alternatively, other influences tried to establish a \"Working Class Theatre\", played for the working class by the working class.After Brecht's death, conflicts began to arise between his family (around Helene Weigel) and other artists about Brecht's legacy, including Slatan Dudow, Erwin Geschonneck, Erwin Strittmatter, Peter Hacks, Benno Besson, Peter Palitzsch and Ekkehard Schall.In the 1950s the Swiss director Benno Besson with the Deutsches Theater successfully toured Europe and Asia including Japan with The Dragon by Evgeny Schwarz. In the 1960s, he became the Intendant of the Volksb\u00fchne often working with Heiner M\u00fcller.In the 1970s, a parallel theatre scene sprung up, creating theatre \"outside of Berlin\" in which artists played at provincial theatres. For example, Peter Sodann founded the Neues Theater in Halle/Saale and Frank Castorf at the theater Anklam.Theatre and cabaret had high status in the GDR, which allowed it to be very proactive. This often brought it into confrontation with the state. Benno Besson once said, \"In contrast to artists in the west, they took us seriously, we had a bearing.\"The Friedrichstadt-Palast in Berlin is the last major building erected by the GDR, making it an exceptional architectural testimony to how Germany overcame of its former division. Here, Berlin's great revue tradition lives on, today bringing viewers state-of-the-art shows.\n\nImportant theatres include the Berliner Ensemble, the Deutsches Theater, the Maxim Gorki Theater, and the Volksb\u00fchne.\n\n\n=== Cinema ===\nThe prolific cinema of East Germany was headed by the DEFA, Deutsche Film AG, which was subdivided in different local groups, for example Gruppe Berlin, Gruppe Babelsberg or Gruppe Johannisthal, where the local teams shot and produced films. The East German industry became known worldwide for its productions, especially children's movies (Das kalte Herz, film versions of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales and modern productions such as Das Schulgespenst).Frank Beyer's Jakob der L\u00fcgner (Jacob the Liar), about the Holocaust, and F\u00fcnf Patronenh\u00fclsen (Five Cartridges), about resistance against fascism, became internationally famous.Films about daily life, such as Die Legende von Paul und Paula, by Heiner Carow, and Solo Sunny, directed by Konrad Wolf and Wolfgang Kohlhaase, were very popular.The film industry was remarkable for its production of Ostern, or Western-like movies. Amerindians in these films often took the role of displaced people who fight for their rights, in contrast to the North American westerns of the time, where they were often either not mentioned at all or are portrayed as the villains. Yugoslavs were often cast as Native Americans because of the small number of Native Americans in Europe. Gojko Miti\u0107 was well known in these roles, often playing the righteous, kindhearted and charming chief (Die S\u00f6hne der gro\u00dfen B\u00e4rin directed by Josef Mach). He became an honorary Sioux chief when he visited the United States in the 1990s, and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his movies. American actor and singer Dean Reed, an expatriate who lived in East Germany, also starred in several films. These films were part of the phenomenon of Europe producing alternative films about the colonization of the Americas.Cinemas in the GDR also showed foreign films. Czechoslovak and Polish productions were more common, but certain western movies were shown, though the numbers of these were limited because it cost foreign exchange to buy the licences. Further, films representing or glorifying what the state viewed as capitalist ideology were not bought. Comedies enjoyed great popularity, such as the Danish Olsen Gang or movies with the French comedian Louis de Fun\u00e8s.Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, several films depicting life in the GDR have been critically acclaimed. Some of the most notable were Good Bye Lenin! by Wolfgang Becker, Das Leben der Anderen (The Lives of Others) by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (won the Academy Award for best Film in a Foreign Language) in 2006,  and Alles auf Zucker! (Go for Zucker) by Dani Levi. Each film is heavily infused with cultural nuances unique to life in the GDR.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\nEast Germany was very successful in the sports of cycling, weight-lifting, swimming, gymnastics, track and field, boxing, ice skating, and winter sports. The success is largely attributed to doping under the direction of Manfred H\u00f6ppner, a sports doctor, described as the architect of East Germany's state-sponsored drug program.\n \nAnabolic steroids were the most detected doping substances in IOC-accredited laboratories for many years. The development and implementation of a state-supported sports doping program helped East Germany, with its small population, to become a world leader in sport during the 1970s and 1980s, winning a large number of Olympic and world gold medals and records. Another factor for success was the furtherance system for young people in GDR. Sport teachers at school were encouraged to look for certain talents in children ages 6 to 10 years old. For older pupils it was possible to attend grammar schools with a focus on sports (for example sailing, football and swimming). This policy was also used for talented pupils with regard to music or mathematics.\n\nSports clubs were highly subsidized, especially sports in which it was possible to get international fame. For example, the major leagues for ice hockey and basketball just included 2 teams each. Football was the most popular sport. Club football teams such as Dynamo Dresden, 1. FC Magdeburg, FC Carl Zeiss Jena, 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo had successes in European competition. Many East German players such as Matthias Sammer and Ulf Kirsten became integral parts of the reunified national football team.\n\nSuccessful sportspeople\nWaldemar Cierpinski, athlete\nErnst Degner, racing motorcyclist\nHeike Drechsler, athlete\nMaxi Gnauck, gymnast\nLutz He\u00dflich, track cyclist\nFalk Hoffmann, diver\nJan Hoffmann, figure skater\nUwe Hohn, athlete\nKarin Janz, gymnast\nKarin Kania, speed skater\nMarita Koch, athlete\nChrista Luding-Rothenburger, speed skater and track cyclist\nOlaf Ludwig, road cyclist\nHenry Maske, boxer\nHeinz Melkus, auto racing driver\nMeinhard Nehmer, bobsledder\nGunda Niemann-Stirnemann, speed skater\nFrank-Peter Roetsch, biathlete\nGustav-Adolf Schur, road cyclist\nGaby Seyfert, ice skater\nJ\u00fcrgen Sparwasser, footballer\nUwe R\u00f6sler, footballer\nJens Wei\u00dfflog, ski jumper\nKatarina Witt, figure skaterThe East and the West also competed via sport; GDR athletes dominated several Olympic sports. Of special interest was the only football match between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, a first-round match during the 1974 FIFA World Cup, which the East won 1\u20130; but West Germany, the host, went on to win the World Cup.\n\n\n=== Television and radio ===\nTelevision and radio in East Germany were state-run industries; the Rundfunk der DDR was the official radio broadcasting organisation from 1952 until unification. The organization was based in the Funkhaus Nalepastra\u00dfe in East Berlin. Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF), from 1972 to 1990 known as Fernsehen der DDR or DDR-FS, was the state television broadcaster from 1952. Reception of Western broadcasts was widespread.\n\n\n=== Sex ===\nThe sexual culture of both German districts was different. East Germany had a cultural acceptance of birth control and premarital sex, in contrast to the West. As a result of this East Germans had sex earlier and more often. Scholars such as Kristen Ghodsee have attributed the higher women orgasm rate (80%) and higher sex satisfaction rate among women in East Germany to economics. Ghodsee writes that in East Germany women did not have to marry men for money which she attributes as the cause of this. Historian Dagmar Herzog, who has researched sexuality in Germany, recalls \"the women of the former GDR told me with gentile pity how much better they'd had it in the East.\" The differences between the two sides were discussed in the documentary Do Communists Have Better Sex?.\n\n\n== Industry ==\n\n\n=== Telecommunications ===\n\nBy the mid-1980s, East Germany possessed a well-developed communications system. There were approximately 3.6 million telephones in usage (21.8 for every 100 inhabitants), and 16,476 Telex stations. Both of these networks were run by the Deutsche Post der DDR (East German Post Office). East Germany was assigned telephone country code +37; in 1991, several months after reunification, East German telephone exchanges were incorporated into country code +49.\nAn unusual feature of the telephone network was that, in most cases, direct distance dialing for long-distance calls was not possible. Although area codes were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of dialing codes with shorter codes for local calls and longer codes for long-distance calls. After unification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area codes and dialing became standardised.\nIn 1976 East Germany inaugurated the operation of a ground-based radio station at F\u00fcrstenwalde for the purpose of relaying and receiving communications from Soviet satellites and to serve as a participant in the international telecommunications organization established by the Soviet government, Intersputnik.\n\n\n== Official and public holidays ==\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMargot Honecker, former Minister for Education of East Germany, said:\n\nIn this state, each person had a place. All children could attend school free of charge, they received vocational training or studied, and were guaranteed a job after training. Work was more than just a means to earn money. Men and women received equal pay for equal work and performance. Equality for women was not just on paper. Care for children and the elderly was the law. Medical care was free, cultural and leisure activities affordable. Social security was a matter of course. We knew no beggars or homelessness. There was a sense of solidarity. People felt responsible not only for themselves, but worked in various democratic bodies on the basis of common interests.\nIn contrast, German historian J\u00fcrgen Kocka in 2010 summarized the consensus of most recent scholarship:\n\nConceptualizing the GDR as a dictatorship has become widely accepted, while the meaning of the concept dictatorship varies. Massive evidence has been collected that proves the repressive, undemocratic, illiberal, nonpluralistic character of the GDR regime and its ruling party.\n\n\n== Ostalgie ==\n\nMany East Germans initially regarded the dissolution of the GDR positively. But this reaction soon turned sour. West Germans often acted as if they had \"won\" and East Germans had \"lost\" in unification, leading many East Germans (Ossis) to resent West Germans (Wessis). In 2004, Ascher Barnstone wrote, \"East Germans resent the wealth possessed by West Germans; West Germans see the East Germans as lazy opportunists who want something for nothing. East Germans find 'Wessis' arrogant and pushy, West Germans think the 'Ossis' are lazy good-for-nothings.\"Unification and subsequent federal policies led to serious economic hardships for many East Germans that had not existed before the Wende. Unemployment and homelessness, which had been minimal during the communist era, grew and quickly became widespread; this, as well as the closures of countless factories and other workplaces in the east, fostered a growing sense that East Germans were being ignored or neglected by the federal government.\nIn addition, many east German women found the west more appealing, and left the region never to return, leaving behind an underclass of poorly educated and jobless men.These and other effects of unification led many East Germans to begin to think of themselves more strongly as \"East\" Germans rather than as simply \"Germans\". In many former GDR citizens this produced a longing for some aspects of the former East Germany, such as full employment and other perceived benefits of the GDR state, termed \"Ostalgie\" (a blend of Ost \"east\" and Nostalgie \"nostalgia\") and depicted in the Wolfgang Becker film Goodbye Lenin!.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n=== Historiography and memory ===\nBridge, Helen.

          "A very nice example how creatively artists over circumnavigated censorship during the socialism. The modified description of the four \u201eprofessions\u201c is just amazing",
          "It was created by Bernd Goebel with caricaturical meaning. The artist was apparently unhappy with the hypocrisy of the Communist East Germany and put his frustration about DDR on figures into this piece of art.",

          "There are five sculptures standing on a cross. Looks very interesting. Unfortunately, the descriptions are written in German, so I do not have any idea what it means. Anyway, it is a nice photographic spot as it is standing in the middle of a busy and lively walking street.",
          "Your first reaction to this large sculpture of five nudes in different poses and trades on a cross is of astonishment. What is it and why pit it there? It's in the walking path between August plats and St Nicholas church. It holds your path and attention but the inscription is",
          "This sculpture is prominent and beguiling, but you do need to understand German to get why it is there (unless you have a guidebook). It is largely about brutalism, injustice and the abuse of human intelligence with regard to others' views. A fine example of how Germans have",
          "It's a really nice statue near the saint Nicolas church, but unfortunately it's only in German, wich I don't speak fluently so I couldn't understand the sign. There are a lot of shops in this street so you will probably stop by!",
          "Located at the start of a beautifully busy and active pedestrian street, great location for such a quirky work of art. It's pretty impressive.",

        "wiki": "Gohlis is an area in the north-west of the city of Leipzig, Germany. Only in 1890 was it absorbed into the city. It is known as the place where Friedrich Schiller worked on the second act of Don Carlos and wrote his first edition of the famous Ode to Joy.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe original settlement was located on the north east edge of the rivers Elster-Luppen-Aue, north of where the N\u00f6rdlichen Rietzschke flows from the north east into the Parthe, and south of the old Schkeuditzer Landstra\u00dfe (today's Georg-Schumann-Stra\u00dfe) between the city of Leipzig in the south east and the village M\u00f6ckern in the north west.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe village Gohlis was probably founded by Slavic Sorbs in the 7th Century. Early forms of the name were  Golitz, Goliz or Golis. The old Sorbian root gol meant bare, barren and is possibly a description of the unforested immediate hinterland of the village. The ending -its/-itz is typical for Slavic villages.\nIn the course of the German expansion to the east, Flemish settlers established themselves in the region. The first documented mention is in the year 1317, in which the village grant of land to the Cistercian monastery of St. George is mentioned.\nThe rulers of Gohlis were the Margraves of Meissen or rather, Landsberg  and later the Ernestine Electors of Saxony (1423\u20131485), the Albertine Dukes, Electors and Kings of Saxony. Within Saxony, the village Gohlis belonged to the municipality of Leipzig.\nThe village Gohlis belonged to the seigneury (lordship) of the manor Gohlis, by which it was subject to patrimonial law. In 1659 the Leipzig Professor f\u00fcr Medizin Michael Heinrich Horn (\u20201681) acquired the manor and the seigneury of Gohlis. Since 1973, when the city of Leipzig became the owner of the manor, the underlying seigneury rests with the city, as it was not retained when the manor was sold in 1832.\nSchiller worked on the second act of his play Don Carlos in Gohlis, edited the \"Fiesco\" and wrote the first version of Ode to Joy. The farmhouse in which Schiller lived is the oldest house standing in Gohlis. It was built in 1700 and has hardly changed since the 18th Century. In 1841 the Leipzig Schiller Society erected a memorial site which is  now the \"Schillerhaus\" (Schiller house) museum.\nIn 1755/1756, the Leipzig Alderman Johann Caspar Richter (1708\u20131770) built a summer residence in rococo style in Gohlis. The so-called Gohliser Palace is nowadays used as restaurant and for cultural events.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Gohlis at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "The Leipzig Museum of Ethnography (German: Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde zu Leipzig) is a large ethnographic museum in Leipzig, Germany, also known as the Grassi Museum of Ethnology.  Today it is part of the Grassi Museum, an institution which also includes the Museum of Applied Arts and the Museum of Musical Instruments, based in a large building on the Johannisplatz.\nThe Leipzig Museum of Ethnography is one of three museums in the Saxon State Ethnographical Collections which belong to the Dresden State Art Collections.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum traces its origins to the historian, librarian and court counsellor Gustav Klemm, whose cultural historical collection found a permanent home in the newly founded museum in 1869, shortly after his death.  At first it was provisionally kept in former chemical laboratories in Leipzig.  The collection was expanded in the following decades, and exhibitions were held in various buildings across the city, organised by the Association of the Museum of Ethnography.  In 1895 the collection moved into the Old Grassi Museum on the K\u00f6nigsplatz, built over three years specifically for this purpose, though now home to the municipal library.  The city of Leipzig took over the museum in 1904.  In 1929 it moved into the New Grassi Museum on the Johannisplatz, whose construction had begun in 1925.The museum closed at the outbreak of World War II.  The building was severely hit by a bombing raid in 1943 which destroyed 30,000 objects.  Rebuilding began in 1947, with the first permanent exhibitions reopened in 1954.  Damage to the central heating forced the closure of the museum from 1981-85.  Since 1991 the museum has been run by the Saxon State Ministry of Science and Art.  In 1994 the German postal service issued a memorial stamp to commemorate the museum's 125th anniversary.  The New Grassi Museum was renovated from 2000\u201305, necessitating the closure of the main Ethnography Museum during that time, though a small exhibition was held elsewhere.  The museum was gradually reopened from 2005-09.The museum is a member of the Konferenz Nationaler Kultureinrichtungen, a union of more than twenty cultural institutions in the former East Germany.\nIn 2004 the museum formed the Saxon State Ethnographical Collections in partnership with the ethnological museums of Dresden and Herrnhut.In the 21st century, the museum is often referred to as the Grassi Museum of Ethnology in English.\n\n\n== Collection ==\n\nWith over 200,000 objects it is among the largest ethnographic collections in Germany.  Items include:\nEast Asia\nOver 30,000 objects, such as:\n\nThe Japanese collection of Karl Rathgen, including tsubas and Japanese woodcuts;\nThe collection of Hermann Speck von Sternburg, with Tibetan thangkas and religious sculptures, and Chinese \"dragon robes\";\nA Taiwanese collection with over 300 artefacts from the island's early inhabitants.Southeast Asia\n11,000 objects, mostly from Indonesia, Thailand and Burma, also including 169 Malaysian artefacts of the Semang and Senoi people; Batak items from Sumatra; Kalimantan and Philippine objects once owned by the Meyer family.South Asia\nDomestic, agricultural and artistic objects from what are now Kerala and Tamil Nadu in south India; Sinhalese items from the east coast and central highlands of Sri Lanka; over 100 theatrical masks (mostly kolam) from the island's south-west coast.  Also included are the findings of the explorer Egon Freiherr von Eickstedt, who encountered the Vedda of Sri Lanka, the Sora of east-central India (Orissa), the Andamanese, and the Nicobarese.Oceania\nAround 20,000 objects from Melanesia, including the former German South Sea Protectorate; Fijian objects purchased in 1885 from the Museum Godeffroy.Australia\nItems from the east coast of Queensland; a collection of shields from a rainforest region near a goldfield, assembled in the 19th century during the start of the Gold Rush; Arrernte and Loritja items from Central Australia; a Tiwi collection; some stone artefacts from Tasmania.\n\nOthers\nOne highlight from Northern Asia is a complete Evenk shaman's costume.  There are also large African, American, Near Eastern and European collections.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page in English",

        "wiki": "Leipzig (, also , , German: [\u02c8la\u026apts\u026a\u00e7] (listen);; Upper Saxon: Leibzsch) is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. With a population of 600,000 inhabitants as of 2019 (1.1 million residents in the larger urban zone), it is Germany's eighth most populous city as well as the second most populous city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin. Together with Halle (Saale), the largest city of the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt, the city forms the polycentric conurbation of Leipzig-Halle. Between the two cities (in Schkeuditz) lies Leipzig/Halle International Airport.\nLeipzig is located about 160 kilometres (99 mi) southwest of Berlin in the Leipzig Bay, which constitutes the southernmost part of the North German Plain, at the confluence of the White Elster River (progression: Saale\u2192 Elbe\u2192 North Sea) and two of its tributaries: the Plei\u00dfe and the Parthe. The name of the city as well as the names of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.\nLeipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire. The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes. Leipzig was once one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing. After the  Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East German terms, but its cultural and economic importance declined. Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy, which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry, severe unemployment, and urban blight. Starting around 2000, however, decline was first arrested and then reversed. Leipzig has undergone significant change with the restoration of major historical buildings, the demolition of derelict properties of little historical value, and the development of new industries and a modern transport infrastructure.Leipzig today is an economic centre, the most livable city in Germany, according to the GfK marketing research institution and has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, according to HWWI and Berenberg Bank. The city is one of two seats of the German National Library (together with Frankfurt), as well as the seat of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and ranks first in Germany and second in Europe according to Anthony Sheridan. Since the opening of the Leipzig City Tunnel in 2013, Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system. Leipzig is currently listed as a Gamma World City, Germany's \"Boomtown\" and as the European City of the Year 2019.Leipzig has long been a major centre for music, both classical as well as modern \"dark alternative music\" or darkwave genres. The Oper Leipzig is one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany. Leipzig is also home to the University of Music and Theatre \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\". It was during a stay in this city that Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem \"Ode to Joy\". The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Johann Sebastian Bach is one among many major composers who lived and worked in Leipzig.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Name ===\n\nThe name Leipzig is derived from the Slavic word Lipsk, which means \"settlement where the linden trees (British English: lime trees; U.S. English: basswood trees) stand\". An older spelling of the name in English is Leipsic. The Latin name Lipsia was also used. The name is cognate with Lipetsk (\u041b\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043a) in Russia and Liep\u0101ja in Latvia.\n\nIn 1937 the Nazi government officially renamed the city Reichsmessestadt Leipzig (Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig).Since 1989 Leipzig has been informally dubbed \"Hero City\" (Heldenstadt), in recognition of the role that the Monday demonstrations there played in the fall of the East German regime \u2013 the name alludes to the honorary title awarded in the former Soviet Union to certain cities that played a key role in the victory of the Allies during the Second World War. The common usage of this nickname for Leipzig up until the present is reflected, for example, in the name of a blog for local arts and culture, Heldenstadt.de.More recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\", \"Hypezig\" or \"The better Berlin\" for being celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for the vital lifestyle and creative scene with many startups.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nLeipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as urbs Libzi (Chronikon VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by Otto the Rich. Leipzig Trade Fair, started in the Middle Ages, has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world.\nThere are records of commercial fishing operations on the river Plei\u00dfe in Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the Margrave Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.There were a number of monasteries in and around the city, including a Franciscan monastery after which the Barfu\u00dfg\u00e4\u00dfchen (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks (Jacobskirche, destroyed in 1544) near the present day Ranst\u00e4dter Steinweg (the old Via Regia).\nThe foundation of the University of Leipzig in 1409 initiated the city's development into a centre of German law and the publishing industry, and towards being the location of the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) and the German National Library (founded in 1912).\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, two battles took place in Breitenfeld, about 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) outside Leipzig city walls. The first Battle of Breitenfeld took place in 1631 and the second in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.\nOn 24 December 1701, an oil-fueled street lighting system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig between Napoleonic France and an allied coalition of Prussia, Russia, Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended Napoleon's presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on Elba. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.When it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the Royal Saxon State Railways and the western one for the Prussian state railways.\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German labor party, the General German Workers' Association (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein, ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge Gr\u00fcnderzeit areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei became the largest cotton mill company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Daily production surpassed 5 million kilograms of yarn.During the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to World War II. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.\nOn 22 May 1930, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was elected mayor of Leipzig. He was well known as an opponent of the Nazi regime. He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of Felix Mendelssohn. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue, one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. Goerdeler was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.\n\nSeveral thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.\nBeginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the Gemeinde, a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.Like all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to aryanisation. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenh\u00e4user, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.As with other cities in Europe during the Holocaust, the Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the Nuremberg Laws. However, due to the Leipzig Trade Fair and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures. Shortly before Kristallnacht, Polish Jews living in the city were expelled.On 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the \"Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig\". In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in Zionism through Jewish citizens. Many of these Zionists attempted to flee before deportations began. On 28 October 1938, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of Polish Jews from Leipzig to Poland.On 9 November 1938, as part of Kristallnacht, in Gottschedstrasse (German: Gottschedstra\u00dfe), now a popular dining and nightlife area in Leipzig, synagogues and businesses were set on fire. Only a couple of days later, on 11 November 1938, many Jews in the Leipzig area were deported to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. As World War II came to an end, much of Leipzig was destroyed. Following the war, the Communist Party of Germany (German: Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, KPD) provided aid for the reconstruction of the city.In 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported. On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors. According to records of the Theresienstadt deportation, only 53 Jews survived.Until late 1943, there was little threat of aerial bombings to the city. However, on the morning of 4 December 1943, the British Royal Air Force dropped over 1,000 tons of explosives, resulting in the death of nearly 1,000 civilians. This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, the storm was too overwhelming for them. Unlike its neighbouring city of Dresden, this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945. In April 1945 the SS Gruppehfuhrer/Mayor of Leipzig Bruno Erich Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter; the Deputy Mayor/Treasurer of Leipzig, Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter, and a Volkssturm Major Walter D\u00f6nicke committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\nThe United States turned the city over to the Red Army as it pulled back from the line of contact with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city.In the mid-20th century, the city's trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the Comecon Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which East Germany was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the Monument to the Battle of the Nations.\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in. Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.In October 1989, after prayers for peace at St. Nicholas Church, established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the Monday demonstrations started as the most prominent mass protest against the East German government. The reunification of Germany, however, was at first not good for Leipzig. The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city's speciality was, in terms of the advanced economy of  reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished. As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunificaiton, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.Starting in 2000, an ambitious (and subsequently much-praised) urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig's decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving as much as possible of the city's urban structure, especially its attractive historic center and various architectural gems, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nNowadays, Leipzig is an important economic center in Germany. Since the 2010s, the city has been celebrated by the media as a hip urban center with a very high quality of living. It is often called \"The new Berlin\". Leipzig is also Germany's fastest growing city. Leipzig was the German candidate for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful. After ten years of construction, the Leipzig City Tunnel opened on 14 December 2013. Leipzig forms the centerpiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system, which operates in the four German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLeipzig lies at the confluence of the rivers White Elster, Plei\u00dfe and Parthe, in the Leipzig Bay, on the most southerly part of the North German Plain, which is the part of the North European Plain in Germany. The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the Leipzig Riverside Forest, though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat though there is also some evidence of moraine and drumlins.\nAlthough there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-cast mines in the region, many of which are being converted to use as lakes. Also see: Neuseenland\nLeipzig is also situated at the intersection of the ancient roads known as the Via Regia (King's highway), which traversed Germany in an east\u2013west direction, and the Via Imperii (Imperial Highway), a north\u2013south road.\nLeipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and the current \"ring\" road around the historic centre of the city follows the line of the old city walls.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nSince 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten districts, which in turn contain a total of 63 subdistricts. Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike many places located in Eastern parts of Germany, Leipzig has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb close to a Dfb [0 \u00b0C US isotherm]) with significant continental influences due to inland location. Winters are cool to cold, with an average of around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F). Summers are generally warm, averaging at 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) with daytime temperatures of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours a day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours a day).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nLeipzig has a population of about 570,000. In 1930, the population reached its historical peak of over 700,000. It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation. After almost doubling the city area by incorporation of surrounding towns in 1999, the number stabilised and started to rise again, with an increase of 1,000 in 2000. As of 2015, Leipzig is the fastest-growing city in Germany with over 500,000 inhabitants.\nThe growth of the past 10\u201315 years has mostly been due to inward migration. In recent years, inward migration accelerated, reaching an increase of 12,917 in 2014.In the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates. Births dropped from 7,000 in 1988 to less than 3,000 in 1994. However, the number of children born in Leipzig has risen since the late 1990s. In 2011, it reached 5,490 births resulting in a RNI of \u221217.7 (\u2212393.7 in 1995).The unemployment rate decreased from 18.2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2014 and 7.6% in June 2017.The percentage of the population from an immigrant background is low compared with other German cities. As of 2012, only 5.6% of the population were foreigners, compared to the German national average of 7.7%.The number of people with an immigrant background (immigrants and their children) grew from 49,323 in 2012 to 77,559 in 2016, making them 13.3% of the city's population (Leipzig's population 579,530 in 2016).The largest minorities (first and second generation) in Leipzig by country of origin as of 31.12.2018 are:\n\n\n== Culture, sights and cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe historic central area of Leipzig features a Renaissance-style ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several baroque period trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the historicist style representative of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The new city hall, completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\nSome 64,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in Plattenbau buildings during Communist rule in East Germany. and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, at least 10% of Leipzig's population (50,000 people) are still living in Plattenbau accommodation. Gr\u00fcnau, for example, has approximately 40,000 people living in this sort of accommodation.The St. Paul's Church was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called Paulinum, which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings and structures ===\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of 205 metres (673 feet). With 142 metres (466 feet), the City-Hochhaus Leipzig is the tallest high-rise building in Leipzig. From 1972 to 1973 it was Germany's tallest building.\n\n\n=== Museums and the arts ===\nOne of the highlights of the city's contemporary arts was the Neo Rauch retrospective opening in April 2010 at the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts.

The University of Leipzig attracts millions of euros of investment yearly and is in the middle of a massive construction and refurbishment to celebrate its 600th anniversary.\nLeipzig also benefits from world leading medical research (Leipzig Heart Centre) and a growing biotechnology industry.Many bars, restaurants and stores found in the downtown area are patronized by German and foreign tourists. Leipzig Hauptbahnhof itself is the location of a shopping mall. Leipzig is one of Germany's most visited cities with over 3 million overnight stays in 2017.In 2010, Leipzig was included in the top 10 cities to visit by The New York Times, and ranked 39th globally out of 289 cities for innovation in the 4th Innovation Cities Index published by Australian agency 2thinknow. In 2015, Leipzig have among the 30 largest German cities the third best prospects for the future. In recent years Leipzig has often been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\" or \"Hypezig\". As of 2013 it had the highest rate of population growth of any German city.Companies with operations in or around Leipzig include:\n\nAmazon\nBl\u00fcthner: piano-manufacturing\nBMW\nDHL\nPorsche\nSiemens\nFuture Electronics\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nMDR, one of Germany's public broadcasters, has its headquarters and main television studios in the city. It provides programmes to various TV and radio networks and has its own symphony orchestra, choir and a ballet.\nLeipziger Volkszeitung (LVZ) is the city's only daily newspaper. Founded in 1894, it has published under several different forms of government. The monthly magazine Kreuzer specializes in culture, festivities and the arts in Leipzig. Leipzig was also home to the world's first daily newspaper in modern times. The \"Einkommende Zeitungen\" were first published in 1650.\nLeipzig has one daily or semi-daily English-language publication, The Leipzig Glocal. It is an online-based magazine and blog that caters to an international as well as local audience. Besides publishing pages on jobs, doctors and movies available in English and other languages, the site's team of authors writes articles about lifestyle, arts & culture, politics, entertainment, Leipzig events, etc.\nOnce known for its large number of publishing houses, Leipzig had been called Buch-Stadt (book city), the most notable of them being branches of Brockhaus and Insel Verlag. Few are left after the years of economic decline during the German Democratic Republic, during which time Frankfurt developed as a much more important publishing center. Reclam, founded in 1828, was one of the large publishing houses to move away. Leipzig still has a book fair, but Frankfurt's is far bigger.\nThe German Library (Deutsche B\u00fccherei) in Leipzig is part of Germany's National Library. Its task is to collect a copy of every book published in German.\n\n\n== Quality of life ==\n\nIn December 2013, according to a study by GfK, Leipzig was ranked as the most livable city in Germany.In 2015/2016, Leipzig was named the second-best city for students in Germany (after Munich).In a 2017 study, the Leipzig inner city ranked first among all large cities in Germany due to its urban aesthetics, gastronomy, and shopping opportunities.Since 2018 it also has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, only surpassed by Munich in 2018 and Berlin in 2019.According to the 2017 Global Least & Most Stressful Cities Ranking, Leipzig was one of the least stressful cities in the World. It was ranked 25th out of 150 cities worldwide and above Dortmund, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Berlin.In 2018, Leipzig won the European Cities of Future prize in the category of \"Best Large City for Human Capital & Lifestyle\".Leipzig was named European City of the Year at the 2019 Urbanism Awards.According to the 2019 study by Forschungsinstitut Prognos, Leipzig is the most dynamic region in Germany. Within 15 years, the city climbed 230 places and occupied in 2019 rank 104 of all 401 German regions.Leipzig is one of 52 places to go in 2020 by The New York Times and the highest-ranking German destination.Leipzig Hauptbahnhof is the best railway station in Germany and the third-best in Europe (only surpassed by St Pancras railway station and Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof).\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFounded at the crossing of Via Regia and Via Imperii, Leipzig has been a major interchange of inter-European traffic and commerce since medieval times. After the Reunification of Germany, immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nOpened in 1915, Leipzig Central Station is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the ICE and Intercity network of the Deutsche Bahn as well as a connection point for S-Bahn and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\nIn Leipzig, the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg-)Berlin-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Munich and Dresden-Leipzig-Erfurt-Frankfurt am Main-(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. After completion of the high-speed line to Erfurt, the ICE will run on both lines via Leipzig/Halle Airport and Erfurt. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)-Magdeburg-Braunschweig-Hannover-Dortmund-K\u00f6ln and -Bremen-Oldenburg(-Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via two S-Bahn lines, one of which runs hourly via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200 km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300 km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg is scheduled for completion in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network will considerably reduce the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200 km/h. The ICE will also be able to operate from Leipzig to Dresden in the near future. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long City Tunnel, which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a large freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\n\n=== Suburban train ===\n\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and Bayerischer Bahnhof leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n\n=== Tramway and Buses ===\n\nThe Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe, existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\nThe total length of the tram network is 149.9 km (93.1 mi), making it the largest in Saxony ahead of Dresden (130.2 km (80.9 mi)) and the second largest in Germany after Berlin (193.6 km (120.3 mi)).\nThe longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be bicycle-friendly. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\nSince 2004 there is a bicycle-sharing system. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the A 14 in the north, the A 9 in the west and the A 38 in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the A 72 is also partly under construction or being planned.\nThe federal roads B 2, B 6, B 87, B 181, B 184 and B 186 lead through the city area.\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\nLeipzig has a dense network of carsharing stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a ridesharing provider. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n\n=== Long-distance buses ===\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5 million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and Leipziger Messe for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLeipzig/Halle Airport is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). DHL uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines Aerologic and European Air Transport Leipzig.\nThe former military airport near Altenburg, Thuringia called Leipzig-Altenburg Airport about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by Ryanair until 2010.\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the Elster-Saale canal, White Elster and Saale was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of forced labor. The Lindenauer port was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and Karl-Heine canal respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, New Luppe, Plei\u00dfe, and Parthe) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing mill races and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused open cast mines, the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the Elbe from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Quotations ==\nMein Leipzig lob' ich mir!

          "This building reminded me of the old Gas Works at the Oval Cricket Ground in London and has a similar looking building next door to it called the Arena Panometer. They are both circular brick buildings with the Arena ;having a mesh glass roof and has an open gate where you could",
          "I saw the 'Carola's Garden' exhibition - the massive panorama art by Yadegar Asisi and the associated gallery were really interesting. I would love to go back and see future exhibitions at the Panometer. The entrance fee was a little pricey compared to other attractions in",
          "Fantastic art, really enjoyed the main room, it\u2019s worth spending time studying it all from the top floor and moving round the platform as the lighting changes - would definitely recommend, lovely little cafe for hot drinks too",
          "A bit of a trek from the Leipzig city centre, it takes a little time to get there and back. I did not mind the entrance fee and the Panoramic picture is impressive. The official exhibition which has toured has more information and better value for money. If you were short on",
          "\u20ac11.50 for one photo! Way overpriced and not inspiring at all. I've had much better experiences from free art galleries. Tourist trap! Es ist ganz teuer es lohnt sich nicht. \u20ac3-\u20ac4 w\u00e4ren genug zu behazhlen.",
          "It cost me 10 euro as I\u2019m a student. Was disappointed. It was cool and all but just costs too much for what it is. If money isn\u2019t an issue though and you\u2019re not on a budget then you might as well do it!",
          "Charging 11.5\u20ac for showing people a huge photo of Titanic and absolutely NOTHING else is a true roberry. Not acceptable!",
          "We went on display at the Titanic and it was very good. The place is expensive to get in, but have a bit about the Titanic's host and then we saw an amazing panorama with sounds, picture and lights that looks like we're on the spot.",
          "We went to the Titanic experience, it was really nice, though the staff didn't speak in english or spanish so it was really hard to make them understand what we were asking. The 360 picture showed the sunk titanic which was amazing.",
          "We where only around and in the second round building , not in the main one with the show, it was too much for us. Newethenless, it is pretty interesting building.",
          "The 3d exihibition being shown on our visit was of the Titanic, it was fantastic. There is a car park if travelling by car or a tram stop 5 minutes walk away, with a regular service back into the city centre .",
          "The Panometer is situated between stops on 2 tram lines going south from the city, but whichever line you take means a walk of 15-20 minutes before you get there. The Panometer changes its exhibition each year (I think) and this time it was the Titanic. It is a circular",
          "Was a 2 mile walk each way from our hotel on a warm day, which impacted our rating. Exhibit was impressive depiction of man\u2019s rapid implementation of new technology (steel) led to enormous progress and, in this case, over-confidence. Panorama is amazing. Missed the last 2",

          "This is mainly a review of the Titanic exhibition rather than the venue which was interesting with apparently good facilities (I did not use any of these). With regard to the Titanic, don't get me wrong this is an impressive work of art. The panoramic photographs projected on",

          "I was recommended by a mate to stop at the Panometer in Leipzig and see what they had on there. It turned out to be a Titanic Experience. In I went and I kind of had thought it would be a artifact exhibition but it was more the story of the introduction of steel into the world",
          "We have Seen the TITANIC exhibition at the Panometer Leipzig. The guided tour upfront gave a perfect historical and technical background but than we discovered the Indoor exhibition. Unbelievable brillant. Climb the Tower in the middle of Assis and Discover the underwater World",
          "We weren't sure what to expect, so were pleasantly surprised to enjoy it very much. You wouldn't think there was a lot to do with just one giant room, but we stayed in there for quite awhile. There was also a video showing the making which was interesting.",
          "Ive been to every single Asisi Exhibition in Leipzig and am amazed by it every time. The sheer size of it is stunning but they also have pretty cool exhibition leading up to the main 360 View. Every couple of years we get a new panorama picture and Im excited to go every single",

        "wiki": "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (, also US:  GURT-\u0259, GAYT-\u0259, -\u2060ee; German: [\u02c8jo\u02d0han \u02c8v\u0254lf\u0261a\u014b f\u0254n \u02c8\u0261\u00f8\u02d0t\u0259] (listen); 28 August 1749 \u2013 22 March 1832) was a German writer and statesman. His works include: four novels; epic and lyric poetry; prose and verse dramas; memoirs; an autobiography; literary and aesthetic criticism; and treatises on botany, anatomy, and colour. In addition, numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him have survived. He is considered the greatest German literary figure of the modern era.A literary celebrity by the age of 25, Goethe was ennobled by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Karl August, in 1782 after taking up residence in Weimar in November 1775 following the success of his first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774). He was an early participant in the Sturm und Drang literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe became a member of the Duke's privy council, sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau, and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its Ducal Palace.Goethe's first major scientific work, the Metamorphosis of Plants, was published after he returned from a 1788 tour of Italy. In 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the dramatist, historian, and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805. During this period Goethe published his second novel, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship; the verse epic Hermann and Dorothea, and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, Faust. His conversations and various shared undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Johann Gottfried Herder, Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and August and Friedrich Schlegel have come to be collectively termed Weimar Classicism.\nThe German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer named Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship one of the four greatest novels ever written, while the American philosopher and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson selected Goethe as one of six \"representative men\" in his work of the same name (along with Plato, Emanuel Swedenborg, Montaigne, Napoleon, and Shakespeare). Goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, notably Johann Peter Eckermann's Conversations with Goethe (1836).\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nGoethe's father, Johann Caspar Goethe, lived with his family in a large house (today the Goethe House) in Frankfurt, then an Imperial Free City of the Holy Roman Empire. Though he had studied law in Leipzig and had been appointed Imperial Councillor, he was not involved in the city's official affairs. Johann Caspar married Goethe's mother, Catharina Elizabeth Textor at Frankfurt on 20 August 1748, when he was 38 and she was 17. All their children, with the exception of Johann Wolfgang and his sister, Cornelia Friederica Christiana, who was born in 1750, died at early ages.\n\nHis father and private tutors gave Goethe lessons in all the common subjects of their time, especially languages (Latin, Greek, French, Italian, English and Hebrew). Goethe also received lessons in dancing, riding and fencing. Johann Caspar, feeling frustrated in his own ambitions, was determined that his children should have all those advantages that he had not.Although Goethe's great passion was drawing, he quickly became interested in literature; Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock and Homer were among his early favorites. He had a lively devotion to theater as well and was greatly fascinated by puppet shows that were annually arranged in his home; this is a recurrent theme in his literary work Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship.\nHe also took great pleasure in reading works on history and religion. He writes about this period:\n\nI had from childhood the singular habit of always learning by heart the beginnings of books, and the divisions of a work, first of the five books of Moses, and then of the 'Aeneid' and Ovid's 'Metamorphoses'. ... If an ever busy imagination, of which that tale may bear witness, led me hither and thither, if the medley of fable and history, mythology and religion, threatened to bewilder me, I readily fled to those oriental regions, plunged into the first books of Moses, and there, amid the scattered shepherd tribes, found myself at once in the greatest solitude and the greatest society.\nGoethe became also acquainted with Frankfurt actors. Among early literary attempts, he was infatuated with Gretchen, who would later reappear in his Faust and the adventures with whom he would concisely describe in Dichtung und Wahrheit. He adored Caritas Meixner (1750\u20131773), a wealthy Worms trader's daughter and friend of his sister, who would later marry the merchant G. F. Schuler.\n\n\n=== Legal career ===\n\nGoethe studied law at Leipzig University from 1765 to 1768. He detested learning age-old judicial rules by heart, preferring instead to attend the poetry lessons of Christian F\u00fcrchtegott Gellert. In Leipzig, Goethe fell in love with Anna Katharina Sch\u00f6nkopf and wrote cheerful verses about her in the Rococo genre. In 1770, he anonymously released Annette, his first collection of poems. His uncritical admiration for many contemporary poets vanished as he became interested in Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Christoph Martin Wieland. Already at this time, Goethe wrote a good deal, but he threw away nearly all of these works, except for the comedy Die Mitschuldigen. The restaurant Auerbachs Keller and its legend of Faust's 1525 barrel ride impressed him so much that Auerbachs Keller became the only real place in his closet drama Faust Part One. As his studies did not progress, Goethe was forced to return to Frankfurt at the close of August 1768.\nGoethe became severely ill in Frankfurt. During the year and a half that followed, because of several relapses, the relationship with his father worsened. During convalescence, Goethe was nursed by his mother and sister. In April 1770, Goethe left Frankfurt in order to finish his studies at the University of Strasbourg.\nIn Alsace, Goethe blossomed. No other landscape has he described as affectionately as the warm, wide Rhine area. In Strasbourg, Goethe met Johann Gottfried Herder. The two became close friends, and crucially to Goethe's intellectual development, Herder kindled his interest in Shakespeare, Ossian and in the notion of Volkspoesie (folk poetry). On 14 October 1772 Goethe held a gathering in his parental home in honour of the first German \"Shakespeare Day\". His first acquaintance with Shakespeare's works is described as his personal awakening in literature.On a trip to the village Sessenheim, Goethe fell in love with Friederike Brion, in October 1770, but, after ten months, terminated the relationship in August 1771. Several of his poems, like \"Willkommen und Abschied\", \"Sesenheimer Lieder\" and \"Heidenr\u00f6slein\", originate from this time.\nAt the end of August 1771, Goethe acquired the academic degree of the Lizenziat (Licentia docendi) in Frankfurt and established a small legal practice. Although in his academic work he had expressed the ambition to make jurisprudence progressively more humane, his inexperience led him to proceed too vigorously in his first cases, and he was reprimanded and lost further ones. This prematurely terminated his career as a lawyer after only a few months. At this time, Goethe was acquainted with the court of Darmstadt, where his inventiveness was praised. From this milieu came Johann Georg Schlosser (who was later to become his brother-in-law) and Johann Heinrich Merck. Goethe also pursued literary plans again; this time, his father did not have anything against it, and even helped. Goethe obtained a copy of the biography of a noble highwayman from the German Peasants' War. In a couple of weeks the biography was reworked into a colourful drama. Entitled G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen, the work went directly to the heart of Goethe's contemporaries.\nGoethe could not subsist on being one of the editors of a literary periodical (published by Schlosser and Merck). In May 1772 he once more began the practice of law at Wetzlar. In 1774 he wrote the book which would bring him worldwide fame, The Sorrows of Young Werther. The outer shape of the work's plot is widely taken over from what Goethe experienced during his Wetzlar time with Charlotte Buff (1753\u20131828) and her fianc\u00e9, Johann Christian Kestner (1741\u20131800), as well as from the suicide of the author's friend Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem (1747\u20131772); in it, Goethe made a desperate passion of what was in reality a hearty and relaxed friendship. Despite the immense success of Werther, it did not bring Goethe much financial gain because copyright laws at the time were essentially nonexistent. (In later years Goethe would bypass this problem by periodically authorizing \"new, revised\" editions of his Complete Works.)\n\n\n=== Early years in Weimar ===\n\nIn 1775, Goethe was invited, on the strength of his fame as the author of The Sorrows of Young Werther, to the court of Karl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, who would become Grand Duke in 1815. (The Duke at the time was 18 years of age, to Goethe's 26.) Goethe thus went to live in Weimar, where he remained for the rest of his life and where, over the course of many years, he held a succession of offices, becoming the Duke's friend and chief adviser.In 1776, Goethe formed a close relationship to Charlotte von Stein, an older, married woman. The intimate bond with von Stein lasted for ten years, after which Goethe abruptly left for Italy without giving his companion any notice. She was emotionally distraught at the time, but they were eventually reconciled.Goethe, aside from official duties, was also a friend and confidant to the Duke, and participated fully in the activities of the court. For Goethe, his first ten years at Weimar could well be described as a garnering of a degree and range of experience which perhaps could be achieved in no other way. In 1779, Goethe took on the War Commission of the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar, in addition to the Mines and Highways commissions. In 1782, when the chancellor of the Duchy's Exchequer left his office, Goethe agreed to act in his place for two and a half years; this post virtually made him prime minister and the principal representative of the Duchy. Goethe was ennobled in 1782 (this being indicated by the \"von\" in his name).\nAs head of the Saxe-Weimar War Commission, Goethe participated in the recruitment of mercenaries into the Prussian and British military during the American Revolution.  The author W. Daniel Wilson claims that Goethe engaged in negotiating the forced sale of vagabonds, criminals, and political dissidents as part of these activities.\n\n\n=== Italy ===\n\nGoethe's journey to the Italian peninsula and Sicily from 1786 to 1788 was of great significance in his aesthetic and philosophical development. His father had made a similar journey during his own youth, and his example was a major motivating factor for Goethe to make the trip. More importantly, however, the work of Johann Joachim Winckelmann had provoked a general renewed interest in the classical art of ancient Greece and Rome. Thus Goethe's journey had something of the nature of a pilgrimage to it. During the course of his trip Goethe met and befriended the artists Angelica Kauffman and Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein, as well as encountering such notable characters as Lady Hamilton and Alessandro Cagliostro (see Affair of the Diamond Necklace).\nHe also journeyed to Sicily during this time, and wrote intriguingly that \"To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is to not have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything.\" While in Southern Italy and Sicily, Goethe encountered, for the first time genuine Greek (as opposed to Roman) architecture, and was quite startled by its relative simplicity. Winckelmann had not recognized the distinctness of the two styles.\nGoethe's diaries of this period form the basis of the non-fiction Italian Journey. Italian Journey only covers the first year of Goethe's visit. The remaining year is largely undocumented, aside from the fact that he spent much of it in Venice. This \"gap in the record\" has been the source of much speculation over the years.\nIn the decades which immediately followed its publication in 1816, Italian Journey inspired countless German youths to follow Goethe's example. This is pictured, somewhat satirically, in George Eliot's Middlemarch.\n\n\n=== Weimar ===\n\nIn late 1792, Goethe took part in the Battle of Valmy against revolutionary France, assisting Duke Karl August of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach during the failed invasion of France. Again during the Siege of Mainz he assisted Carl August as a military observer. His written account of these events can be found within his Complete Works.\nIn 1794, Friedrich Schiller wrote to Goethe offering friendship; they had previously had only a mutually wary relationship ever since first becoming acquainted in 1788. This collaborative friendship lasted until Schiller's death in 1805.\n\nIn 1806, Goethe was living in Weimar with his mistress Christiane Vulpius, the sister of Christian A. Vulpius, and their son Julius August Walter von Goethe. On 13 October, Napoleon's army invaded the town. The French \"spoon guards\", the least disciplined soldiers, occupied Goethe's house: The 'spoon guards' had broken in, they had drunk wine, made a great uproar and called for the master of the house. Goethe's secretary Riemer reports: 'Although already undressed and wearing only his wide nightgown... he descended the stairs towards them and inquired what they wanted from him.... His dignified figure, commanding respect, and his spiritual mien seemed to impress even them.' But it was not to last long. Late at night they burst into his bedroom with drawn bayonets. Goethe was petrified, Christiane raised a lot of noise and even tangled with them, other people who had taken refuge in Goethe's house rushed in, and so the marauders eventually withdrew again. It was Christiane who commanded and organized the defense of the house on the Frauenplan. The barricading of the kitchen and the cellar against the wild pillaging soldiery was her work. Goethe noted in his diary: \"Fires, rapine, a frightful night... Preservation of the house through steadfastness and luck.\" The luck was Goethe's, the steadfastness was displayed by Christiane.\nDays afterward, on 19 October 1806, Goethe legitimized their 18-year relationship by marrying Christiane in a quiet marriage service at the Jakobskirche in Weimar. They had already had several children together by this time, including their son, Julius August Walter von Goethe (1789\u20131830), whose wife, Ottilie von Pogwisch (1796\u20131872), cared for the elder Goethe until his death in 1832. August and Ottilie had three children: Walther, Freiherr von Goethe (1818\u20131885), Wolfgang, Freiherr von Goethe (1820\u20131883) and Alma von Goethe (1827\u20131844). Christiane von Goethe died in 1816. Johann reflected, \"There is nothing more charming to see than a mother with her child in her arms, and there is nothing more venerable than a mother among a number of her children.\"\n\n\n=== Later life ===\nAfter 1793, Goethe devoted his endeavours primarily to literature. By 1820, Goethe was on amiable terms with Kaspar Maria von Sternberg.\nIn 1823, having recovered from a near fatal heart illness, the 74-year-old Goethe fell in love with the teenaged Ulrike von Levetzow whom he wanted to marry, but because of the opposition of her mother he never proposed. Their last meeting in Carlsbad on 5 September 1823 inspired him to the famous Marienbad Elegy which he considered one of his finest works. During that time he also developed a deep emotional bond with the Polish pianist Maria Agata Szymanowska.In 1821 Goethe's friend Carl Friedrich Zelter introduced him to the 12-year-old Felix Mendelssohn. Goethe, now in his seventies, was greatly impressed by the child, leading to perhaps the earliest confirmed comparison with Mozart in the following conversation between Goethe and Zelter:\n\n\"Musical prodigies ... are probably no longer so rare; but what this little man can do in extemporizing and playing at sight borders the miraculous, and I could not have believed it possible at so early an age.\" \"And yet you heard Mozart in his seventh year at Frankfurt?\" said Zelter. \"Yes\", answered Goethe, \"... but what your pupil already accomplishes, bears the same relation to the Mozart of that time that the cultivated talk of a grown-up person bears to the prattle of a child.\"\nMendelssohn was invited to meet Goethe on several later occasions, and set a number of Goethe's poems to music. His other compositions inspired by Goethe include the overture Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage (Op. 27, 1828), and the cantata Die erste Walpurgisnacht (The First Walpurgis Night, Op. 60, 1832).\n\n\n=== Death ===\n\nIn 1832, Goethe died in Weimar of apparent heart failure. His last words, according to his doctor Carl Vogel, were, Mehr Licht! (More light!), but this is disputed as Vogel was not in the room at the moment Goethe died. He is buried in the Ducal Vault at Weimar's Historical Cemetery.\nEckermann closes his famous work, Conversations with Goethe, with this passage:\n\nThe morning after Goethe's death, a deep desire seized me to look once again upon his earthly garment. His faithful servant, Frederick, opened for me the chamber in which he was laid out. Stretched upon his back, he reposed as if asleep; profound peace and security reigned in the features of his sublimely noble countenance. The mighty brow seemed yet to harbour thoughts. I wished for a lock of his hair; but reverence prevented me from cutting it off. The body lay naked, only wrapped in a white sheet; large pieces of ice had been placed near it, to keep it fresh as long as possible. Frederick drew aside the sheet, and I was astonished at the divine magnificence of the limbs. The breast was powerful, broad, and arched; the arms and thighs were elegant, and of the most perfect shape; nowhere, on the whole body, was there a trace of either fat or of leanness and decay. A perfect man lay in great beauty before me; and the rapture the sight caused me made me forget for a moment that the immortal spirit had left such an abode. I laid my hand on his heart \u2013 there was a deep silence \u2013 and I turned away to give free vent to my suppressed tears.\nThe first production of Richard Wagner's opera Lohengrin took place in Weimar in 1850. The conductor was Franz Liszt, who chose the date 28 August in honour of Goethe, who was born on 28 August 1749.\n\n\n== Literary work ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nThe most important of Goethe's works produced before he went to Weimar were G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen (1773), a tragedy that was the first work to bring him recognition, and the novel The Sorrows of Young Werther (German: Die Leiden des jungen Werthers) (1774), which gained him enormous fame as a writer in the Sturm und Drang period which marked the early phase of Romanticism. Indeed, Werther is often considered to be the \"spark\" which ignited the movement, and can arguably be called the world's first \"best-seller.\"  During the years at Weimar before he met Schiller he began Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, wrote the dramas Iphigenie auf Tauris (Iphigenia in Tauris), Egmont, Torquato Tasso, and the fable Reineke Fuchs.To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the conception of Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years (the continuation of Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship), the idyll of Hermann and Dorothea, the Roman Elegies  and the verse drama The Natural Daughter. In the last period, between Schiller's death, in 1805, and his own, appeared Faust Part One, Elective Affinities, the West-Eastern Diwan (a collection of poems in the Persian style, influenced by the work of Hafez), his autobiographical Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit (From My Life: Poetry and Truth) which covers his early life and ends with his departure for Weimar, his Italian Journey, and a series of treatises on art. His writings were immediately influential in literary and artistic circles.Goethe was fascinated by Kalidasa's Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam, which was one of the first works of Sanskrit literature that became known in Europe, after being translated from English to German.\n\n\n=== Details of selected works ===\nThe short epistolary novel, Die Leiden des jungen Werthers, or The Sorrows of Young Werther, published in 1774, recounts an unhappy romantic infatuation that ends in suicide. Goethe admitted that he \"shot his hero to save himself\": a reference to Goethe's own near-suicidal obsession with a young woman during this period, an obsession he quelled through the writing process. The novel remains in print in dozens of languages and its influence is undeniable; its central hero, an obsessive figure driven to despair and destruction by his unrequited love for the young Lotte, has become a pervasive literary archetype. The fact that Werther ends with the protagonist's suicide and funeral\u2014a funeral which \"no clergyman attended\"\u2014made the book deeply controversial upon its (anonymous) publication, for on the face of it, it appeared to condone and glorify suicide. Suicide is considered sinful by Christian doctrine: suicides were denied Christian burial with the bodies often mistreated and dishonoured in various ways; in corollary, the deceased's property and possessions were often confiscated by the Church. However, Goethe explained his use of Werther in his autobiography. He said he \"turned reality into poetry but his friends thought poetry should be turned into reality and the poem imitated.\" He was against this reading of poetry. Epistolary novels were common during this time, letter-writing being a primary mode of communication. What set Goethe's book apart from other such novels was its expression of unbridled longing for a joy beyond possibility, its sense of defiant rebellion against authority, and of principal importance, its total subjectivity: qualities that trailblazed the Romantic movement.\nThe next work, his epic closet drama Faust, was completed in stages. The first part was published in 1808 and created a sensation. Goethe finished Faust Part Two in the year of his death, and the work was published posthumously. Goethe's original draft of a Faust play, which probably dates from 1773\u201374, and is now known as the Urfaust, was also published after his death.The first operatic version of Goethe's Faust, by Louis Spohr, appeared in 1814. The work subsequently inspired operas and oratorios by Schumann, Berlioz, Gounod, Boito, Busoni, and Schnittke as well as symphonic works by Liszt, Wagner, and Mahler. Faust became the ur-myth of many figures in the 19th century. Later, a facet of its plot, i.e., of selling one's soul to the devil for power over the physical world, took on increasing literary importance and became a view of the victory of technology and of industrialism, along with its dubious human expenses. In 1919, the world premiere complete production of Faust was staged at the Goetheanum.\n\nGoethe's poetic work served as a model for an entire movement in German poetry termed Innerlichkeit (\"introversion\") and represented by, for example, Heine. Goethe's words inspired a number of compositions by, among others, Mozart, Beethoven (who idolised Goethe), Schubert, Berlioz and Wolf. Perhaps the single most influential piece is \"Mignon's Song\" which opens with one of the most famous lines in German poetry, an allusion to Italy: \"Kennst du das Land, wo die Zitronen bl\u00fchn?\" (\"Do you know the land where the lemon trees bloom?\").\nHe is also widely quoted. Epigrams such as \"Against criticism a man can neither protest nor defend himself; he must act in spite of it, and then it will gradually yield to him\", \"Divide and rule, a sound motto; unite and lead, a better one\", and \"Enjoy when you can, and endure when you must\", are still in usage or are often paraphrased. Lines from Faust, such as \"Das also war des Pudels Kern\", \"Das ist der Weisheit letzter Schluss\", or \"Grau ist alle Theorie\" have entered everyday German usage.\nSome well-known quotations are often incorrectly attributed to Goethe. These include Hippocrates' \"Art is long, life is short\", which is echoed in Goethe's Faust and Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship.\n\n\n== Scientific work ==\n\nAs to what I have done as a poet,... I take no pride in it... But that in my century I am the only person who knows the truth in the difficult science of colours\u2014of that, I say, I am not a little proud, and here I have a consciousness of a superiority to many.\nAlthough his literary work has attracted the greatest amount of interest, Goethe was also keenly involved in studies of natural science. He wrote several works on morphology, and colour theory. Goethe also had the largest private collection of minerals in all of Europe. By the time of his death, in order to gain a comprehensive view in geology, he had collected 17,800 rock samples.\nHis focus on morphology and what was later called homology influenced 19th century naturalists, although his ideas of transformation were about the continuous metamorphosis of living things and did not relate to contemporary ideas of \"transformisme\" or transmutation of species. Homology, or as \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire called it \"analogie\", was used by Charles Darwin as strong evidence of common descent and of laws of variation. Goethe's studies (notably with an elephant's skull lent to him by Samuel Thomas von Soemmerring) led him to independently discover the human intermaxillary bone, also known as \"Goethe's bone\", in 1784, which Broussonet (1779) and Vicq d'Azyr (1780) had (using different methods) identified several years earlier. While not the only one in his time to question the prevailing view that this bone did not exist in humans, Goethe, who believed ancient anatomists had known about this bone, was the first to prove its existence in all mammals. The elephant's skull that led Goethe to this discovery, and was subsequently named the Goethe Elephant, still exists and is displayed in the Ottoneum in Kassel, Germany.\nDuring his Italian journey, Goethe formulated a theory of plant metamorphosis in which the archetypal form of the plant is to be found in the leaf \u2013 he writes, \"from top to bottom a plant is all leaf, united so inseparably with the future bud that one cannot be imagined without the other\". In 1790, he published his Metamorphosis of Plants. As one of the many precursors in the history of evolutionary thought, Goethe wrote in Story of My Botanical Studies (1831):\n\nThe ever-changing display of plant forms, which I have followed for so many years, awakens increasingly within me the notion: The plant forms which surround us were not all created at some given point in time and then locked into the given form, they have been given... a felicitous mobility and plasticity that allows them to grow and adapt themselves to many different conditions in many different places.\nGoethe's botanical theories were partly based on his gardening in Weimar.Goethe also popularized the Goethe barometer using a principle established by Torricelli. According to Hegel, \"Goethe has occupied himself a good deal with meteorology; barometer readings interested him particularly... What he says is important: the main thing is that he gives a comparative table of barometric readings during the whole month of December 1822, at Weimar, Jena, London, Boston, Vienna, T\u00f6pel... He claims to deduce from it that the barometric level varies in the same proportion not only in each zone but that it has the same variation, too, at different altitudes above sea-level\".\n\nIn 1810, Goethe published his Theory of Colours, which he considered his most important work. In it, he contentiously characterized colour as arising from the dynamic interplay of light and darkness through the mediation of a turbid medium. In 1816, Schopenhauer went on to develop his own theory in On Vision and Colours based on the observations supplied in Goethe's book. After being translated into English by Charles Eastlake in 1840, his theory became widely adopted by the art world, most notably J. M. W. Turner. Goethe's work also inspired the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, to write his Remarks on Colour. Goethe was vehemently opposed to Newton's analytic treatment of colour, engaging instead in compiling a comprehensive rational description of a wide variety of colour phenomena. Although the accuracy of Goethe's observations does not admit a great deal of criticism, his aesthetic approach did not lend itself to the demands of analytic and mathematical analysis used ubiquitously in modern Science. Goethe was, however, the first to systematically study the physiological effects of colour, and his observations on the effect of opposed colours led him to a symmetric arrangement of his colour wheel, 'for the colours diametrically opposed to each other... are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye. (Goethe, Theory of Colours, 1810). In this, he anticipated Ewald Hering's opponent colour theory (1872).Goethe outlines his method in the essay The experiment as mediator between subject and object (1772). In the Kurschner edition of Goethe's works, the science editor, Rudolf Steiner, presents Goethe's approach to science as phenomenological. Steiner elaborated on that in the books The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception and Goethe's World View, in which he characterizes intuition as the instrument by which one grasps Goethe's biological archetype\u2014The Typus.\nNovalis, himself a geologist and mining engineer, expressed the opinion that Goethe was the first physicist of his time and 'epoch-making in the history of physics', writing that Goethe's studies of light, of the metamorphosis of plants and of insects were indications and proofs 'that the perfect educational lecture belongs in the artist's sphere of work'; and that Goethe would be surpassed 'but only in the way in which the ancients can be surpassed, in inner content and force, in variety and depth\u2014as an artist actually not, or only very little, for his rightness and intensity are perhaps already more exemplary than it would seem'.\n\n\n== Eroticism ==\nMany of Goethe's works, especially Faust, the Roman Elegies, and the Venetian Epigrams, depict erotic passions and acts. For instance, in Faust, the first use of Faust's power after signing a contract with the devil is to seduce a teenage girl. Some of the Venetian Epigrams were held back from publication due to their sexual content. Goethe clearly saw human sexuality as a topic worthy of poetic and artistic depiction, an idea that was uncommon in a time when the private nature of sexuality was rigorously normative.In a conversation on April 7, 1830 Goethe stated that pederasty is an \"aberration\" that easily leads to \"animal, roughly material\" behavior. He continued, \"Pederasty is as old as humanity itself, and one can therefore say, that it resides in nature, even if it proceeds against nature....What culture has won from nature will not be surrendered or given up at any price.\" On another occasion he wrote: \"I like boys a lot, but the girls are even nicer. If I tire of her as a girl, she'll play the boy for me as well\".\n\n\n== Religion and politics ==\nGoethe was a freethinker who believed that one could be inwardly Christian without following any of the Christian churches, many of whose central teachings he firmly opposed, sharply distinguishing between Christ and the tenets of Christian theology, and criticizing its history as a \"hodgepodge of fallacy and violence\". His own descriptions of his relationship to the Christian faith and even to the Church varied widely and have been interpreted even more widely, so that while Goethe's secretary Eckermann portrayed him as enthusiastic about Christianity, Jesus, Martin Luther, and the Protestant Reformation, even calling Christianity the \"ultimate religion,\" on one occasion Goethe described himself as \"not anti-Christian, nor un-Christian, but most decidedly non-Christian,\" and in his Venetian Epigram 66, Goethe listed the symbol of the cross among the four things that he most disliked. According to Nietzsche, Goethe had \"a kind of almost joyous and trusting fatalism\" that has \"faith that only in the totality everything redeems itself and appears good and justified.\"Born into a Lutheran family, Goethe's early faith was shaken by news of such events as the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and the Seven Years' War. Goethe's preoccupation with and reverence for Spinoza are well known and documented in the history of Western thought. He was one of the central figures in a great flowering of a highly influential Neo-Spinozism which occurred in German philosophy and literature of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.\u2014that was the first remarkable Spinoza revival in history. Like Lessing and Herder, in many respects, Goethe was a devoted Spinozist. He was also a pantheist, like some other prominent Spinozists such as Flaubert and Albert Einstein. His later spiritual perspective incorporated elements of pantheism (heavily influenced by Spinoza's thought), humanism, and various elements of Western esotericism, as seen most vividly in part 2 of Faust. Like Heinrich Heine, Nietzsche mentions in his writings frequently Goethe and Spinoza as a pair. A year before his death, in a letter to Sulpiz Boisser\u00e9e, Goethe wrote that he had the feeling that all his life he had been aspiring to qualify as one of the Hypsistarians, an ancient Jewish-pagan sect of the Black Sea region who, in his understanding, sought to reverence, as being close to the Godhead, what came to their knowledge of the best and most perfect. Goethe's unorthodox religious beliefs led him to be called \"the great heathen\" and provoked distrust among the authorities of his time, who opposed the creation of a Goethe monument on account of his offensive religious creed. August Wilhelm Schlegel considered Goethe \"a heathen who converted to Islam.\"Politically, Goethe described himself as a \"moderate liberal.\" He was critical of the radicalism of Bentham and expressed sympathy for the prudent liberalism of Fran\u00e7ois Guizot. At the time of the French Revolution, he thought the enthusiasm of the students and professors to be a perversion of their energy and remained skeptical of the ability of the masses to govern. Goethe sympathized with the American Revolution and later wrote a poem in which he declared \"America, you're better off than our continent, the old.\" He did not join in the anti-Napoleonic mood of 1812, and he distrusted the strident nationalism which started to be expressed. The medievalism of the Heidelberg Romantics was also repellent to Goethe's eighteenth-century ideal of a supra-national culture.\nGoethe was a Freemason, joining the lodge Amalia in Weimar in 1780, and frequently alluded to Masonic themes of universal brotherhood in his work, he was also attracted to the Bavarian Illuminati a secret society founded on 1 May 1776. Although often requested to write poems arousing nationalist passions, Goethe would always decline. In old age, he explained why this was so to Eckermann:How could I write songs of hatred when I felt no hate? And, between ourselves, I never hated the French, although I thanked God when we were rid of them. How could I, to whom the only significant things are civilization [Kultur] and barbarism, hate a nation which is among the most cultivated in the world, and to which I owe a great part of my own culture? In any case this business of hatred between nations is a curious thing. You will always find it more powerful and barbarous on the lowest levels of civilization. But there exists a level at which it wholly disappears, and where one stands, so to speak, above the nations, and feels the weal or woe of a neighboring people as though it were one's own.\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\nGoethe had a great effect on the nineteenth century. In many respects, he was the originator of many ideas which later became widespread. He produced volumes of poetry, essays, criticism, a theory of colours and early work on evolution and linguistics. He was fascinated by mineralogy, and the mineral goethite (iron oxide) is named after him. His non-fiction writings, most of which are philosophic and aphoristic in nature, spurred the development of many thinkers, including Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Schopenhauer, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ernst Cassirer, and Carl Jung. Along with Schiller, he was one of the leading figures of Weimar Classicism. Schopenhauer cited Goethe's novel Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship as one of the four greatest novels ever written, along with Tristram Shandy, La Nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Don Quixote. Nietzsche wrote, \"Four pairs it was that did not deny themselves to my sacrifice: Epicurus and Montaigne, Goethe and Spinoza, Plato and Rousseau, Pascal and Schopenhauer. With these I must come to terms when I have long wandered alone; they may call me right and wrong; to them will I listen when in the process they call each other right and wrong.\"Goethe embodied many of the contending strands in art over the next century: his work could be lushly emotional, and rigorously formal, brief and epigrammatic, and epic. He would argue that Classicism was the means of controlling art, and that Romanticism was a sickness, even as he penned poetry rich in memorable images, and rewrote the formal rules of German poetry. His poetry was set to music by almost every major Austrian and German composer from Mozart to Mahler, and his influence would spread to French drama and opera as well. Beethoven declared that a \"Faust\" Symphony would be the greatest thing for art. Liszt and Mahler both created symphonies in whole or in large part inspired by this seminal work, which would give the 19th century one of its most paradigmatic figures: Doctor Faustus.\n\n \nThe Faust tragedy/drama, often called Das Drama der Deutschen (the drama of the Germans), written in two parts published decades apart, would stand as his most characteristic and famous artistic creation. Followers of the twentieth century esotericist Rudolf Steiner built a theatre named the Goetheanum after him\u2014where festival performances of Faust are still performed.\nGoethe was also a cultural force. During his first meeting with Napoleon in 1808, the latter famously remarked: \"Vous \u00e9tes un homme (You are a man)!\" The two discussed politics, the writings of Voltaire, and Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther, which Napoleon had read seven times and ranked among his favorites. Goethe came away from the meeting deeply impressed with Napoleon's enlightened intellect and his efforts to build an alternative to the corrupt old regime. Goethe always spoke of Napoleon with the greatest respect, confessing that \"nothing higher and more pleasing could have happened to me in all my life\" than to have met Napoleon in person.\nGermaine de Sta\u00ebl, in De L'Allemagne (1813), presented German Classicism and Romanticism as a potential source of spiritual authority for Europe, and identified Goethe as a living classic. She praised Goethe as possessing \"the chief characteristics of the German genius\" and uniting \"all that distinguishes the German mind.\" Sta\u00ebl's portrayal helped elevate Goethe over his more famous German contemporaries and transformed him into a European cultural hero. Goethe met with her and her partner Benjamin Constant, with whom he shared a mutual admiration.In Victorian England, Goethe exerted a profound influence on George Eliot, whose partner George Henry Lewes wrote a Life of Goethe. Eliot presented Goethe as \"eminently the man who helps us to rise to a lofty point of observation\" and praised his \"large tolerance\", which \"quietly follows the stream of fact and of life\" without passing moral judgments. Matthew Arnold found in Goethe the \"Physician of the Iron Age\" and \"the clearest, the largest, the most helpful thinker of modern times\" with a \"large, liberal view of life.\"\n\nIt was to a considerable degree due to Goethe's reputation that the city of Weimar was chosen in 1919 as the venue for the national assembly, convened to draft a new constitution for what would become known as Germany's Weimar Republic. Goethe became a key reference for Thomas Mann in his speeches and essays defending the republic. He emphasized Goethe's \"cultural and self-developing individualism\", humanism, and cosmopolitanism.The Federal Republic of Germany's cultural institution, the Goethe-Institut is named after him, and promotes the study of German abroad and fosters knowledge about Germany by providing information on its culture, society and politics.\nThe literary estate of Goethe in the Goethe and Schiller Archives was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2001 in recognition of its historical significance.Goethe's influence was dramatic because he understood that there was a transition in European sensibilities, an increasing focus on sense, the indescribable, and the emotional. This is not to say that he was emotionalistic or excessive; on the contrary, he lauded personal restraint and felt that excess was a disease: \"There is nothing worse than imagination without taste\". Goethe praised Francis Bacon for his advocacy of science based on experiment and his forceful revolution in thought as one of the greatest strides forward in modern science. However, he was critical of Bacon's inductive method and approach based on pure classification. He said in Scientific Studies:\n\nWe conceive of the individual animal as a small world, existing for its own sake, by its own means. Every creature is its own reason to be. All its parts have a direct effect on one another, a relationship to one another, thereby constantly renewing the circle of life; thus we are justified in considering every animal physiologically perfect. Viewed from within, no part of the animal is a useless or arbitrary product of the formative impulse (as so often thought). Externally, some parts may seem useless because the inner coherence of the animal nature has given them this form without regard to outer circumstance. Thus...[not] the question, What are they for? but rather, Where do they come from?\n\nGoethe's scientific and aesthetic ideas have much in common with Denis Diderot, whose work he translated and studied. Both Diderot and Goethe exhibited a repugnance towards the mathematical interpretation of nature; both perceived the universe as dynamic and in constant flux; both saw \"art and science as compatible disciplines linked by common imaginative processes\"; and both grasped \"the unconscious impulses underlying mental creation in all forms.\" Goethe's Naturanschauer is in many ways a sequel to Diderot's interpr\u00e8te de la nature.His views make him, along with Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson, and Ludwig van Beethoven, a figure in two worlds: on the one hand, devoted to the sense of taste, order, and finely crafted detail, which is the hallmark of the artistic sense of the Age of Reason and the neo-classical period of architecture; on the other, seeking a personal, intuitive, and personalized form of expression and society, firmly supporting the idea of self-regulating and organic systems. George Henry Lewes celebrated Goethe's revolutionary understanding of the organism.Thinkers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson would take up many similar ideas in the 1800s. Goethe's ideas on evolution would frame the question that Darwin and Wallace would approach within the scientific paradigm. The Serbian inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla was heavily influenced by Goethe's Faust, his favorite poem, and had actually memorized the entire text. It was while reciting a certain verse that he was struck with the epiphany that would lead to the idea of the rotating magnetic field and ultimately, alternating current.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nThe Life of Goethe by George Henry Lewes\nGoethe: The History of a Man by Emil Ludwig\nGoethe by Georg Brandes.

        "wiki": "Eva Pflug ((1929-06-12)12 June 1929 \u2013 (2008-08-05)5 August 2008) was a German film and television actress, as well as a voice actress. Born in Leipzig, she was well known for her work on the first German science fiction television series, Raumpatrouille Orion,  during the 1960s.\n\n\n== Life ==\nEva Pflug was born on 12 June 1929 in Leipzig. After her first film, The Council of the Gods (1950), she worked in Helmut K\u00e4utner's Schinderhannes with Curd J\u00fcrgens. In the first Edgar-Wallace film Der Frosch mit der Maske (1959), she had a small part as a night club singer. Three years later, Pflug was to be seen in the Francis Durbridge cliffhanger Das Halstuch (1962). After that, she contributed to Tim Frazer - Der Fall Salinger (1964) and Wie ein Blitz. Her first major part on a TV series was that of secretary Steffi in Slim Callaghan greift ein alongside Viktor de Kowa.\nIn early 1966, Pflug appeared as the na\u00efve scientist Dr. Gretchen Hoffman in three episodes of the American television espionage series Blue Light; these were among four Blue Light episodes later edited together to create the American 1966 theatrical film I Deal in Danger, which included her role. After guest roles in the TV series Die f\u00fcnfte Kolonne and Das Kriminalmuseum, Pflug was offered the role which made her career: Tamara Jagellovsk in the first German science-fiction TV series, Raumpatrouille Orion, in 1966. As Jagellovsk, she would become an icon of feminism.\nAfter her role in Raumpatrouille, Pflug sporadically appeared in various television roles, such as in Graf Yoster gibt sich die Ehre, Dem T\u00e4ter auf der Spur, and Ein Fall f\u00fcr zwei. Pflug started accepting more engagements; she travelled to Basel, M\u00fcnchen, K\u00f6ln, Frankfurt, and Berlin, and festivals in Heppenheim, Jagsthausen, and Ettlingen.\nThis time, she played in more 'classical' main roles, among them Goethe's Gretchen in Faust and Martha in Kleist's Der zerbrochene Krug. For her role in Brecht's Mutter Courage in 1986, she was given the grand prize in the Bad Hersfelder Festival. Furthermore, she played Shaw's Die heilige Johanna, and Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.\nBetween 1980 and 1985, she appeared about 700 times on stage in popular comedies alongside Paul Hubschmid.\nAs a voice actress she dubbed Julie Christie (Dr. Zhivago), Ursula Andress (Casino Royale), Anne Bancroft (The Graduate), Eva Marie Saint (North by Northwest) and Susan Flannery (The Bold and the Beautiful).\nPflug died on 5 August 2008 at her home in Gr\u00fcnwald, Bavaria.\n\n\n== Selected filmography ==\nThird from the Right (1950), as Hilde\nDer Schinderhannes (1958), as Sch\u00e4fer-Ammi\nConfess, Doctor Corda (1958), as Gabriele Montag\nDer Frosch mit der Maske (1959), as Lolita\nMan on a String (1960), as Tanja Rosnova\nGirl from Hong Kong (1961), as Gudrun\nDas Halstuch (1962, TV miniseries), as Diana Winston\nTim Frazer: Der Fall Salinger (1964, TV miniseries), as Vivien Gilmore\nI Deal in Danger (1966), as Dr. Gretchen Hoffman\nRaumpatrouille Orion (1966, TV series), as Lt.

        "wiki": "Leipzig (, also , , German: [\u02c8la\u026apts\u026a\u00e7] (listen);; Upper Saxon: Leibzsch) is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. With a population of 600,000 inhabitants as of 2019 (1.1 million residents in the larger urban zone), it is Germany's eighth most populous city as well as the second most populous city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin. Together with Halle (Saale), the largest city of the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt, the city forms the polycentric conurbation of Leipzig-Halle. Between the two cities (in Schkeuditz) lies Leipzig/Halle International Airport.\nLeipzig is located about 160 kilometres (99 mi) southwest of Berlin in the Leipzig Bay, which constitutes the southernmost part of the North German Plain, at the confluence of the White Elster River (progression: Saale\u2192 Elbe\u2192 North Sea) and two of its tributaries: the Plei\u00dfe and the Parthe. The name of the city as well as the names of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.\nLeipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire. The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes. Leipzig was once one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing. After the  Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East German terms, but its cultural and economic importance declined. Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy, which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry, severe unemployment, and urban blight. Starting around 2000, however, decline was first arrested and then reversed. Leipzig has undergone significant change with the restoration of major historical buildings, the demolition of derelict properties of little historical value, and the development of new industries and a modern transport infrastructure.Leipzig today is an economic centre, the most livable city in Germany, according to the GfK marketing research institution and has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, according to HWWI and Berenberg Bank. The city is one of two seats of the German National Library (together with Frankfurt), as well as the seat of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and ranks first in Germany and second in Europe according to Anthony Sheridan. Since the opening of the Leipzig City Tunnel in 2013, Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system. Leipzig is currently listed as a Gamma World City, Germany's \"Boomtown\" and as the European City of the Year 2019.Leipzig has long been a major centre for music, both classical as well as modern \"dark alternative music\" or darkwave genres. The Oper Leipzig is one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany. Leipzig is also home to the University of Music and Theatre \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\". It was during a stay in this city that Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem \"Ode to Joy\". The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Johann Sebastian Bach is one among many major composers who lived and worked in Leipzig.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Name ===\n\nThe name Leipzig is derived from the Slavic word Lipsk, which means \"settlement where the linden trees (British English: lime trees; U.S. English: basswood trees) stand\". An older spelling of the name in English is Leipsic. The Latin name Lipsia was also used. The name is cognate with Lipetsk (\u041b\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043a) in Russia and Liep\u0101ja in Latvia.\n\nIn 1937 the Nazi government officially renamed the city Reichsmessestadt Leipzig (Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig).Since 1989 Leipzig has been informally dubbed \"Hero City\" (Heldenstadt), in recognition of the role that the Monday demonstrations there played in the fall of the East German regime \u2013 the name alludes to the honorary title awarded in the former Soviet Union to certain cities that played a key role in the victory of the Allies during the Second World War. The common usage of this nickname for Leipzig up until the present is reflected, for example, in the name of a blog for local arts and culture, Heldenstadt.de.More recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\", \"Hypezig\" or \"The better Berlin\" for being celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for the vital lifestyle and creative scene with many startups.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nLeipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as urbs Libzi (Chronikon VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by Otto the Rich. Leipzig Trade Fair, started in the Middle Ages, has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world.\nThere are records of commercial fishing operations on the river Plei\u00dfe in Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the Margrave Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.There were a number of monasteries in and around the city, including a Franciscan monastery after which the Barfu\u00dfg\u00e4\u00dfchen (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks (Jacobskirche, destroyed in 1544) near the present day Ranst\u00e4dter Steinweg (the old Via Regia).\nThe foundation of the University of Leipzig in 1409 initiated the city's development into a centre of German law and the publishing industry, and towards being the location of the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) and the German National Library (founded in 1912).\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, two battles took place in Breitenfeld, about 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) outside Leipzig city walls. The first Battle of Breitenfeld took place in 1631 and the second in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.\nOn 24 December 1701, an oil-fueled street lighting system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig between Napoleonic France and an allied coalition of Prussia, Russia, Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended Napoleon's presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on Elba. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.When it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the Royal Saxon State Railways and the western one for the Prussian state railways.\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German labor party, the General German Workers' Association (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein, ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge Gr\u00fcnderzeit areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei became the largest cotton mill company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Daily production surpassed 5 million kilograms of yarn.During the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to World War II. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.\nOn 22 May 1930, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was elected mayor of Leipzig. He was well known as an opponent of the Nazi regime. He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of Felix Mendelssohn. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue, one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. Goerdeler was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.\n\nSeveral thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.\nBeginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the Gemeinde, a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.Like all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to aryanisation. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenh\u00e4user, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.As with other cities in Europe during the Holocaust, the Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the Nuremberg Laws. However, due to the Leipzig Trade Fair and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures. Shortly before Kristallnacht, Polish Jews living in the city were expelled.On 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the \"Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig\". In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in Zionism through Jewish citizens. Many of these Zionists attempted to flee before deportations began. On 28 October 1938, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of Polish Jews from Leipzig to Poland.On 9 November 1938, as part of Kristallnacht, in Gottschedstrasse (German: Gottschedstra\u00dfe), now a popular dining and nightlife area in Leipzig, synagogues and businesses were set on fire. Only a couple of days later, on 11 November 1938, many Jews in the Leipzig area were deported to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. As World War II came to an end, much of Leipzig was destroyed. Following the war, the Communist Party of Germany (German: Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, KPD) provided aid for the reconstruction of the city.In 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported. On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors. According to records of the Theresienstadt deportation, only 53 Jews survived.Until late 1943, there was little threat of aerial bombings to the city. However, on the morning of 4 December 1943, the British Royal Air Force dropped over 1,000 tons of explosives, resulting in the death of nearly 1,000 civilians. This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, the storm was too overwhelming for them. Unlike its neighbouring city of Dresden, this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945. In April 1945 the SS Gruppehfuhrer/Mayor of Leipzig Bruno Erich Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter; the Deputy Mayor/Treasurer of Leipzig, Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter, and a Volkssturm Major Walter D\u00f6nicke committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\nThe United States turned the city over to the Red Army as it pulled back from the line of contact with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city.In the mid-20th century, the city's trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the Comecon Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which East Germany was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the Monument to the Battle of the Nations.\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in. Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.In October 1989, after prayers for peace at St. Nicholas Church, established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the Monday demonstrations started as the most prominent mass protest against the East German government. The reunification of Germany, however, was at first not good for Leipzig. The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city's speciality was, in terms of the advanced economy of  reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished. As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunificaiton, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.Starting in 2000, an ambitious (and subsequently much-praised) urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig's decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving as much as possible of the city's urban structure, especially its attractive historic center and various architectural gems, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nNowadays, Leipzig is an important economic center in Germany. Since the 2010s, the city has been celebrated by the media as a hip urban center with a very high quality of living. It is often called \"The new Berlin\". Leipzig is also Germany's fastest growing city. Leipzig was the German candidate for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful. After ten years of construction, the Leipzig City Tunnel opened on 14 December 2013. Leipzig forms the centerpiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system, which operates in the four German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLeipzig lies at the confluence of the rivers White Elster, Plei\u00dfe and Parthe, in the Leipzig Bay, on the most southerly part of the North German Plain, which is the part of the North European Plain in Germany. The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the Leipzig Riverside Forest, though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat though there is also some evidence of moraine and drumlins.\nAlthough there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-cast mines in the region, many of which are being converted to use as lakes. Also see: Neuseenland\nLeipzig is also situated at the intersection of the ancient roads known as the Via Regia (King's highway), which traversed Germany in an east\u2013west direction, and the Via Imperii (Imperial Highway), a north\u2013south road.\nLeipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and the current \"ring\" road around the historic centre of the city follows the line of the old city walls.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nSince 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten districts, which in turn contain a total of 63 subdistricts. Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike many places located in Eastern parts of Germany, Leipzig has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb close to a Dfb [0 \u00b0C US isotherm]) with significant continental influences due to inland location. Winters are cool to cold, with an average of around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F). Summers are generally warm, averaging at 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) with daytime temperatures of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours a day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours a day).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nLeipzig has a population of about 570,000. In 1930, the population reached its historical peak of over 700,000. It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation. After almost doubling the city area by incorporation of surrounding towns in 1999, the number stabilised and started to rise again, with an increase of 1,000 in 2000. As of 2015, Leipzig is the fastest-growing city in Germany with over 500,000 inhabitants.\nThe growth of the past 10\u201315 years has mostly been due to inward migration. In recent years, inward migration accelerated, reaching an increase of 12,917 in 2014.In the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates. Births dropped from 7,000 in 1988 to less than 3,000 in 1994. However, the number of children born in Leipzig has risen since the late 1990s. In 2011, it reached 5,490 births resulting in a RNI of \u221217.7 (\u2212393.7 in 1995).The unemployment rate decreased from 18.2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2014 and 7.6% in June 2017.The percentage of the population from an immigrant background is low compared with other German cities. As of 2012, only 5.6% of the population were foreigners, compared to the German national average of 7.7%.The number of people with an immigrant background (immigrants and their children) grew from 49,323 in 2012 to 77,559 in 2016, making them 13.3% of the city's population (Leipzig's population 579,530 in 2016).The largest minorities (first and second generation) in Leipzig by country of origin as of 31.12.2018 are:\n\n\n== Culture, sights and cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe historic central area of Leipzig features a Renaissance-style ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several baroque period trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the historicist style representative of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The new city hall, completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\nSome 64,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in Plattenbau buildings during Communist rule in East Germany. and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, at least 10% of Leipzig's population (50,000 people) are still living in Plattenbau accommodation. Gr\u00fcnau, for example, has approximately 40,000 people living in this sort of accommodation.The St. Paul's Church was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called Paulinum, which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings and structures ===\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of 205 metres (673 feet). With 142 metres (466 feet), the City-Hochhaus Leipzig is the tallest high-rise building in Leipzig. From 1972 to 1973 it was Germany's tallest building.\n\n\n=== Museums and the arts ===\nOne of the highlights of the city's contemporary arts was the Neo Rauch retrospective opening in April 2010 at the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts. This is a show devoted to the father of the New Leipzig School of artists. According to The New York Times, this scene \"has been the toast of the contemporary art world\" for the past decade. In addition, there are eleven galleries in the so-called Spinnerei.The Grassi Museum complex contains three more of Leipzig's major collections: the Ethnography Museum, Applied Arts Museum and Musical Instrument Museum (the last of which is run by the University of Leipzig). The university also runs the Museum of Antiquities.Founded in March 2015, the G2 Kunsthalle houses the Hildebrand Collection. This private collection focuses on the so-called New Leipzig School.

It was founded in 1992, merging several older schools. As a university of applied sciences (German: Fachhochschule) its status is slightly below that of a university, with more emphasis on the practical part of the education. The HTWK offers many engineering courses, as well as courses in computer science, mathematics, business administration, librarianship, museum studies and social work. It is mainly located in the south of the city.\n\n\n=== Leipzig Graduate School ===\nThe private Leipzig Graduate School of Management, (in German Handelshochschule Leipzig (HHL)), is the oldest business school in Germany.

The seminary trains students to become pastors for the Evangelical Lutheran Free Church or for member church bodies of the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city is a location for automobile manufacturing by BMW and Porsche in large plants north of the city. In 2011 and 2012 DHL transferred the bulk of its European air operations from Brussels Airport to Leipzig/Halle Airport. Kirow Ardelt AG, the world market leader in breakdown cranes, is based in Leipzig. The city also houses the European Energy Exchange, the leading energy exchange in Central Europe. With VNG \u2013 Verbundnetz Gas AG, one of Germany's large natural gas suppliers is headquartered at Leipzig. In addition, inside its larger metropolitan area, Leipzig has developed an important petrochemical center.\nSome of the largest employers in the area (outside of manufacturing) include software companies such as Spreadshirt and the various schools and universities in and around the Leipzig/Halle region. The University of Leipzig attracts millions of euros of investment yearly and is in the middle of a massive construction and refurbishment to celebrate its 600th anniversary.\nLeipzig also benefits from world leading medical research (Leipzig Heart Centre) and a growing biotechnology industry.Many bars, restaurants and stores found in the downtown area are patronized by German and foreign tourists. Leipzig Hauptbahnhof itself is the location of a shopping mall. Leipzig is one of Germany's most visited cities with over 3 million overnight stays in 2017.In 2010, Leipzig was included in the top 10 cities to visit by The New York Times, and ranked 39th globally out of 289 cities for innovation in the 4th Innovation Cities Index published by Australian agency 2thinknow. In 2015, Leipzig have among the 30 largest German cities the third best prospects for the future. In recent years Leipzig has often been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\" or \"Hypezig\". As of 2013 it had the highest rate of population growth of any German city.Companies with operations in or around Leipzig include:\n\nAmazon\nBl\u00fcthner: piano-manufacturing\nBMW\nDHL\nPorsche\nSiemens\nFuture Electronics\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nMDR, one of Germany's public broadcasters, has its headquarters and main television studios in the city. It provides programmes to various TV and radio networks and has its own symphony orchestra, choir and a ballet.\nLeipziger Volkszeitung (LVZ) is the city's only daily newspaper. Founded in 1894, it has published under several different forms of government. The monthly magazine Kreuzer specializes in culture, festivities and the arts in Leipzig. Leipzig was also home to the world's first daily newspaper in modern times. The \"Einkommende Zeitungen\" were first published in 1650.\nLeipzig has one daily or semi-daily English-language publication, The Leipzig Glocal. It is an online-based magazine and blog that caters to an international as well as local audience. Besides publishing pages on jobs, doctors and movies available in English and other languages, the site's team of authors writes articles about lifestyle, arts & culture, politics, entertainment, Leipzig events, etc.\nOnce known for its large number of publishing houses, Leipzig had been called Buch-Stadt (book city), the most notable of them being branches of Brockhaus and Insel Verlag. Few are left after the years of economic decline during the German Democratic Republic, during which time Frankfurt developed as a much more important publishing center. Reclam, founded in 1828, was one of the large publishing houses to move away. Leipzig still has a book fair, but Frankfurt's is far bigger.\nThe German Library (Deutsche B\u00fccherei) in Leipzig is part of Germany's National Library. Its task is to collect a copy of every book published in German.\n\n\n== Quality of life ==\n\nIn December 2013, according to a study by GfK, Leipzig was ranked as the most livable city in Germany.In 2015/2016, Leipzig was named the second-best city for students in Germany (after Munich).In a 2017 study, the Leipzig inner city ranked first among all large cities in Germany due to its urban aesthetics, gastronomy, and shopping opportunities.Since 2018 it also has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, only surpassed by Munich in 2018 and Berlin in 2019.According to the 2017 Global Least & Most Stressful Cities Ranking, Leipzig was one of the least stressful cities in the World. It was ranked 25th out of 150 cities worldwide and above Dortmund, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Berlin.In 2018, Leipzig won the European Cities of Future prize in the category of \"Best Large City for Human Capital & Lifestyle\".Leipzig was named European City of the Year at the 2019 Urbanism Awards.According to the 2019 study by Forschungsinstitut Prognos, Leipzig is the most dynamic region in Germany. Within 15 years, the city climbed 230 places and occupied in 2019 rank 104 of all 401 German regions.Leipzig is one of 52 places to go in 2020 by The New York Times and the highest-ranking German destination.Leipzig Hauptbahnhof is the best railway station in Germany and the third-best in Europe (only surpassed by St Pancras railway station and Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof).\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFounded at the crossing of Via Regia and Via Imperii, Leipzig has been a major interchange of inter-European traffic and commerce since medieval times. After the Reunification of Germany, immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nOpened in 1915, Leipzig Central Station is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the ICE and Intercity network of the Deutsche Bahn as well as a connection point for S-Bahn and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\nIn Leipzig, the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg-)Berlin-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Munich and Dresden-Leipzig-Erfurt-Frankfurt am Main-(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. After completion of the high-speed line to Erfurt, the ICE will run on both lines via Leipzig/Halle Airport and Erfurt. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)-Magdeburg-Braunschweig-Hannover-Dortmund-K\u00f6ln and -Bremen-Oldenburg(-Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via two S-Bahn lines, one of which runs hourly via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200 km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300 km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg is scheduled for completion in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network will considerably reduce the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200 km/h. The ICE will also be able to operate from Leipzig to Dresden in the near future. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long City Tunnel, which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a large freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\n\n=== Suburban train ===\n\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and Bayerischer Bahnhof leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n\n=== Tramway and Buses ===\n\nThe Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe, existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\nThe total length of the tram network is 149.9 km (93.1 mi), making it the largest in Saxony ahead of Dresden (130.2 km (80.9 mi)) and the second largest in Germany after Berlin (193.6 km (120.3 mi)).\nThe longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be bicycle-friendly. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\nSince 2004 there is a bicycle-sharing system. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the A 14 in the north, the A 9 in the west and the A 38 in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the A 72 is also partly under construction or being planned.\nThe federal roads B 2, B 6, B 87, B 181, B 184 and B 186 lead through the city area.\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\nLeipzig has a dense network of carsharing stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a ridesharing provider. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n\n=== Long-distance buses ===\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5 million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and Leipziger Messe for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLeipzig/Halle Airport is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). DHL uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines Aerologic and European Air Transport Leipzig.\nThe former military airport near Altenburg, Thuringia called Leipzig-Altenburg Airport about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by Ryanair until 2010.\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the Elster-Saale canal, White Elster and Saale was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of forced labor. The Lindenauer port was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and Karl-Heine canal respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, New Luppe, Plei\u00dfe, and Parthe) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing mill races and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused open cast mines, the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the Elbe from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Quotations ==\nMein Leipzig lob' ich mir!

        "wiki": "The Bach-Archiv Leipzig or Bach-Archiv is an institution for the documentation and research of the life and work of Johann Sebastian Bach. The Bach-Archiv also researches the Bach family, especially their music.  \nBased in Leipzig, the city where Bach lived from 1723 until his death, the Archiv is recognised by the German government as a \"cultural beacon\" of national importance.  Since 2008 the Bach-Archiv has been part of the University of Leipzig.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Bach-Archiv was founded on the occasion of the bicentennial of Bach's death in 1950 by Werner Neumann, who remained its director until 1973. It served as a central archive for manuscripts and historic documents connected to the composer and a central research center related to him and his family.\nAt the time of the institution's foundation Leipzig was in East Germany. Prior to German unification there was collaboration with Bach experts in West Germany. For example, the second edition of Bach's complete works, the Neue Bach-Ausgabe, was a joint project between the Bach-Archiv and the Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Institut in G\u00f6ttingen, West Germany.  After unification the Bach-Archiv became part of the Konferenz Nationaler Kultureinrichtungen, a union of more than twenty cultural organizations in the former East Germany which are deemed to be nationally significant. The G\u00f6ttingen Institute closed in 2006.\nSince 23 November 2008 the Bach-Archiv has been an institute of the University of Leipzig.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe Bach-Archiv has been housed in the historic Bosehaus opposite the Thomaskirche since 1985. The site was restored from 2008 to 2010 to comply with the latest safety requirements, and was opened again on 20 March 2010 by the President of Germany, Horst K\u00f6hler.\nThe Neue Bachgesellschaft shares the premises, which also houses a Bach Museum.\n\n\n== Directors ==\n1950\u20131973: Werner Neumann\n1974\u20131979: Hans-Joachim Schulze\n1979\u20131991: Werner Felix\n1992\u20132000: Hans-Joachim Schulze\n2001-2013: Christoph Wolff\n2014-2019: Peter Wollny as Director; Sir John Eliot Gardiner is installed in the new position of President\n2019\u2013present: Ton Koopman was appointed as President for a five-year term.\n\n\n== Relevance ==\nToday the Bach-Archiv is a renowned center of Bach research with a scientific library for Bach topics. There is engagement with a wider public via the Bach-Museum and via performances of Bach's music, especially the Bachfest Leipzig (an international festival) and the Internationaler Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Wettbewerb (an international music competition).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWebsite of the Bach Archive (in English)\nBach-Archiv in Leipzig Leipzig\nBach-Archiv Leipzig zieht positive Jahresbilanz 2010 Bach-Archiv, Leipzig, 23 December 2010 (in German)",

          "Right next to St Thomas's Church sits the unobtrusive but remarkable Bach Museum and Archives. It has an excellent display and perfect audio guide for international languages.",

          "The lady at the ticket office didn't speak a single word of English - literally. She was also quite abrupt and unfriendly. Quite honestly I expected better from one of the main tourist attractions in town, that can be expected to cater to foreign visitors as well as locals. I",
          "I was visiting Berlin and realized that Leipzig - the City of Music could be reached by fast train in just under 1.5 hours. My destination was the Bach Museum and it was the highlight of my trip ! I have played Bach's music on the piano for decades, and he is my favorite",

          "Used English audio guide. We spent 2 hours and didn't listen to every entry or try many of the exhibits. Enthralling! Really enjoyed the narration which was very understandable and informative on many different topics. Considerable effort has been made to get the visitor",

          "I was expecting something bigger (such as Chopin's in Warsaw). At least I visited for free because it was the 1st Tuesday of the month.",
          "As expected, the place to go for Bach information. Well laid out with some great temporary exhibitions too. Manages to have various different types of installation... mostly reading but some interactive and with listening stations too. The only reason not 5 star was that some of",
          "Interesting facts and copies of documents connected to the great composer. Many staff on hand to direct you to how some of the interactive exhibits work. For me it was lacking a good audio tour as the audio machines have photos not numbers which I found hard to match up",
          "My husband and I were traveling in Germany to see the Christmas markets and added a stop at this museum. Lockers are available for storage; clean restrooms are also available. The museum is well organized, and the handheld audio guides are helpful. I especially enjoyed the room",
          "Well laid our museum that traces Bach\u2019s life and his importance to Leipzig. Upon entering there are small storage lockers for your stuff. Pay the 8 Euro entry fee and audio tour is included in the price - highly recommended. Take your time and enjoy the history and music. A must",
          "A very interesting interactive museum, which allows the visitors to really experience Bach\u2019s time, music and personality. Reading his personal letters, seeing how Leipzig looked in his times, listening to pieces performed by musical instruments used in his time, even trying out",
          "Nice cafe to start off with. Helpful staff. Excellent audio guide. Most parts of exhibition have English text as well as German. Excellent displays - attractive and interesting. Very good interactive music items.",
          "The cost of admission is 8 euros that you pay at the small shop before entering the next building. There are free lockers where you are requested to lock your knapsacks. Definitely recommend the audio guide (also free) that is available in multiple languages. My favourite room",
          "Interesting museum where you can find out everything about the great composer. Do not expect a cosy atmosphere. It really is a museum, not his home",
          "Right across the street from St. Thomas church there is an unassuming building where Bach and his students lived. They have turned it into a museum for Bach and the current focus is his students and what we can learn about Bach from them.",
          "I worship music by Johann Sebastian Bach. So, I went to this museum. First, they took my money, and sent me to another building. There, they asked, if I speak German. After verifying that I did not, they informed me that they will NOT let me in, unless I surrender my tiny",
          "Unless you are a music historian or a passionate of JSBach, this museum is not worth your time. The museography is boring, not creative at all. Several of the stations to listen to musical excerpts were out of order when I visited. If many people are visiting, you may not even",
          "We spend an hour reading about Bachs history. The employees are very friendly and helpfull. It all lies in the city centre, which is as clean as can be. We are from south africa and we are amazed to hve not seen 1 police or 1 security guard. It is a relieve.",
          "Very interesting museum because it has a very good collection of instruments. Also has nice gardens. It\u2019s a must !",
          "This is mostly about what Bach meant to Leipzig and what he did during his Leipzig time, not about his oeuvre as such - Bach aficionados ought to visit the exquisite Bach museum in Eisenach instead. But if you are in Leipzig to visit the Thomas Church and to listen to a Bach",
          "We had limited time here, but what was most interesting were the original instruments and the autograph scores.",
          "The museum offers the visitor an invite to Bach the man and musician. The displays are interesting and stimulating for both the well-informed adult and inquisitive child. I thoroughly recommend you visit this fine museum.",
          "History of his family ancestors, Bach's own childhood to maturity and the different stages of his life and performances are on display. A quaint garden area is an added bonus.",
          "This is a must for music lovers and counts as a highlight of our visit to Leipzig. We spent a couple of hours and could have easily spent more. In addition to a history of Bach and his roles in various German churches, there is a magnificent genealogy chart prepared by Bach",
          "We easily spent almost 2 hours here. There was so much to learn about Bach. We especially enjoyed the special exhibition about his students.",
          "I am so sad to have missed the Bach museum! It was high on my list for my visit to Leipzig! I was not concentrating so I missed it. I was there on Sunday (when it is open) and Monday (when it is closed). Guess I'll have to go back! Great gift shop!",
          "So much information about Bach here - and they have the original of two paintings of him. The staff is a bit snotty. Artifacts are superb. They even go into a lot of detail about his students and some of the copyists. Pity though - they never mention his wife who did lots of",
          "Interesting mus\u00e9um with loads of technological staff that helps you to dive into the life of Bach and his family",
          "A must for anyone interested in the life and times of JSB; with so much to see and listen to it was hard to do justice to all that it had to offer.",
          "We had a guided tour with a local guide who was both knowledgeable and enthusiastic and brought the museum to life. Such wonderful artefacts including the opportunity actually to see original handwriting and music written by the Master himself. If in Leipzig, you must visit.",
          "We spent many happy hours here one day fully exploring all that this wonderful museum had to offer. It is beautifully laid out with lots of opportunity to hear samples of Bach's music. We especially enjoyed hearing highlighted examples of the sounds of the instruments from",
          "This is quite a small museum, but extremely interesting. It celebrates the composer's life by providing interactive musical displays and original manuscripts and scores. The staff are all very knowledgeable, friendly and speak excellent English if you have any questions. There",
          "This is a great museum to learn about Bach whether you are a musician or not. It is well-organized, includes a detailed audio guide, and eye-catching displays. The exhibit integrates Bach's music, family history, Leipzig history, and other related topics coherently. I'd",
          "Anyone who likes the music of J.S. Bach and his family would find this museum interesting. Information about his career and gives an insight into what was like to be a composer in the 18th century, how they earned their living etc. You can see original Bach manuscripts and learn",
          "It was pure luck that I arrived in Leipzig during Bach's 333 birthday celebration. There were endless activities and I managed to catch some of them. And I happened to also arrive on the day when there was no entrance fee. What a treat. Being a music geek, this was one of",
          "This museum, opposite St Thomas' church, is beautifully laid out in 8 rooms, covering the life and times of JSBach as well as musical instruments from the period and original manuscripts. To see the original manuscript of 'Sleepers Wake', to admire the only portrait of JSB made",
          "Definitely recommend getting the audio guide. Really great if you are interested in JSB. Lots of opportunities to sit idly and listen to some womderful music.",
          "I didn't know much about Bach but certainly do now having been in museum and learnt from exhibits etc. I recommend a visit, this museum is different and has some interesting interactions.",
          "A museum like in Germany there are several. A complex cultural phenomenon, such as the one related to J.S. Bach and his large family, illustrated by paying attention to the historical, social aspects and to the environment in which the great musician worked; a deep attention",
          "The Bach Museum is the baroque Bose House which used to be the home of the merchant family Bose who were close friends of Johann Sebastian Bach and his family. That House is one of the oldest buildings in St. Thomas Square. Some features dating back from the sixteenth century",
          "Visitors to this museum are given such a wide variety of ways to understand J S Bach's life, his family, the music and musicians of the time. We thorougly enjoyed this, and one can spend endless time listening to works,if you want.",
          "\u00cd have to confess that we were exhausted from walking, so we only had some fabulous coffee and cake at the superb cafe\u00b4with the museum. Have to go back to enjoy the museum as well. Only got to see his tombstone at the Nikolaikirche.",
          "The museum has a ton of information you could spend a few hours inside. There are interesting exhibits and cool little facts to learn about Bach's childhood.",
          "This was much more interesting and enjoyable than I expected. Lots of interesting information and huge collection of music to listen to.",
          "This is a very interesting museum with many original artefacts. Several sets of headphones so you can listen to examples of his music in high quality sound. You could easily spend a couple of hours here.",
          "If you visit Leipzig the reason is probably music. And this is the center of everything. Bach and his music has shaped the city's cultural evolution substantially. No other artist have build such an integration with a city ever. This city is actually neither the birth place nor",
          "There's a lot to see here and even more to listen to. We \"rushed\" through in about an hour and a half; we could have easily spent another hour. Lots of opportunities to listen to music. Really well done, highly recommend.",
          "It was our first visit to Leipzig. It was a good learning experience visually seeing the time he spent here and we were happy to absorb the treasures on dispay",
          "We loved the museum! Very complete exhibition also available audio guide in many languages! They have a unique audio library to hear Bach's and family's masterpieces.",
          "It's a very nice and modern museum with a lot of information. It's not as suitable for children as described",
          "Besides of the usual amount of reading on the walls of museums, this one also gives you the opportunity to have a break on the couch, pick some of the Bach's composition from an interactive list and listen to it.",
          "We are great Bach fans, so very much enjoyed seeing this small but charming museum of his life and work. We had a private guide, who took us a part of a walking tour, and that allowed us to get much more out of the visit. We particularly enjoyed getting to see his original",
          "While attending a conference in Leipzig we learned that Johannes Sebastian Bach lived and worked here and that there is a dedicated museum to him and his musical genius. We learned a great deal, heard a lot of his amazing music and saw multiple artifacts related to his life and",
          "There are some manuscripts and some instruments, well a a lot of them, but the main thing here is listening. You could spend an hour looking but 100 listening. My wife got sucked in. Wait, I think I see her now?",
          "This museum has a very extensive archive of bachs work and for that reason alone is a must visit for bach enthusiasts. I preferred the museum in eisenbach as general museum about bach.",
          "The Museum is middle in the centre of Leipzig, so if you visit the Bach Memorial or the famous Thomas-Church it is next by. Inside you come in touch with original instruments which Bach played, many old letters and original and rare music sheets and so one. You learn about his",
          "Very bright and airy and well laid out museum taking you through Bach's life. Good audio guides allowing you to take as much time as you like wandering around the exhibits.",
          "Enjoyed museum & loved the hands on interactive activities offered. Good information about bachs life & his \ud83c\udfb6!",
          "Well laid out museum with good historical facts. Take an audio guide (free), it is very informative.",
          "This museum is very well assembled with informative displays and an audio-guide. The problem is with unprofessional, under-educated and rude staff who are not capable of conversing with foreigners. The museum opened 3 minutes after its scheduled time, because a group of staff",
          "We went here after visiting the St. Thomas church next door. A great museum with a great collection of items including an original organ console. Well laid out and easy to navigate with the complimentary audio ipod. Even our older teens enjoyed it.",
          "The Bach Museum was an interesting place to visit it is a mixture of old and new. The old part includes instruments and artifacts from his life and his era. The new part includes a lot of digital recordings of his music and the music inspired by his work. It was a very hot day",
          "This is an incredible place to see. The history is wonderful. The family history, the music of the man in the listening areas and the instrument displays are all so compelling. We used the audio guides and went through at our pace. We were there on a very empty day and we",
          "...and this place really does take you back! This was one of the actual buildings frequented by Bach and the family who owned it \"bach\" in the day... Really well done and the English Tour was well worth the time and money. Very modern and tastefully exhibited artifacts and",
          "This is not a large museum, but it covers everything you might ever want to know about Bach. They do focus a little more on his time in Leipzig, but they start with his family tree and include all the highlights in between. A number of interesting displays and artifacts are",
          "My father and I LOVED the Bach Museum. We got there early, around 11am and stayed until 3pm. There is so much information, not just about Bach, but about the period, classical music, instruments, tools and techniques. We are classical music fans and I was surprised at how much",
          "This museum offered a look at Bach's time and provided a real feel as to what his daily life was like and how much work he produced. A few highlights are a room where you can see what buildings in town looked like then and now and a music room where you hear his music and can",
          "You can get an audio guide but you need to leave your passport as hostage. This is common practice we found. Highlights are the portraits of Bach and a section on forgery. You can download the audio guide from the Web onto your mobile device to get a good idea of what is on",
          "Learnt a lot about Bach from the museum plus had the chance to listen to lots of lovely Back music. There were child friendly things to do as well.",
          "Well appointed museum but staff seem to have the attitude found formerly in the Communist East German State.",
          "A trip through the museum is an excellent complement to visiting Thomaskirche across the street. It gives a very good overview of religious communities in Leipzig that may have influenced Bach, in particular, the tensions and open conflict between Catholics and Protestants. The",
          "This is a wonderful museum to see for all Bach and music lovers. With interactive parts to the exhibition and wonderful amounts of information, there was plenty to do here!",
          "The Bach museum is one of the most intimate, comprehensive museums to an individual that I have visited. Located in an elegant building opposite the choir school of the St. Thomas church, the museum seems to have everything about the great composer: his family genealogy,",
          "We were amazed at how 'new' this museum was and all the interactive elements of this museum. It was just outstanding and we really learned a lot about Bach and his music. Would really recomment this location if you like classical music.",
          "This is a wonderful museum displaying documents, instruments and other items from Bach's time. It's very close to the Thomaskirche, which you should visit as well. The museum is well worth spending 2 hours of your time.",
          "Beautiful museum of Bach and his musical family. Also contains a variety of audio clips and a number of clips taken from films about Bach. Excellent audio guide in a number of languages.",
          "The museum is by the St. Thomas Churh and is very neat. Has a good collection of Bach's story and is quite interactive. Worth it going especially if you are a lover of the classics!",
          "Big posters of Bach festival everywhere at the train station, I immediately feel the vibe in the air. St Thomaskirche and Bach museum is no doubt the highlight of our visit of Leipzig. Standing just meters from the bronze plate in front of the altar where the giant\u2019s remain",
          "A wonderful example of entertaining educational museums. We got lost following the TA map on my iPhone, but the museum is ten meters opposite the Thomas church which you can't miss! 8 euro entrance, but a free loan of the audio guide. Plan to spend an hour or two depending how",
          "A well laid out and explained museum, featuring an organ console used by J S Bach and a selection of original manuscripts.",
          "Anyone who had a modicum of knowledge about Bach would not learn much from the tour. It lacked music above all - there was nothing playing to stir the soul. There plenty of copies of things to see but, like the building in which things are housed, it is all a reconstruction.",
          "This was an wonderful and comprehensive tribute to Bach, his lufe and work. The signs were easy to read, in German and English as well as Braille. The pipes to touch & hear music were great; the instrument room where you can press a button & hear each instrument's part in a",
          "A must see in Leipzig - surprisingly the guide tried to pursuade us not to use the free head sets which are really worth getting. Students will need their uni card.",
          "Certainly, Bach lovers will appreciate this museum. Very sophisticated interactive displays; and all of them actually work! For anyone who is interested in music at all, this highly educational museum is certainly worth the time.",
          "A fascinating museum - reasonably interactive with \"sound showers\" and programmes on headphones that allowed you to listen to virtually any Bach piece you wished. Very interesting about Bach's family - they were a whole clan of musicians - and on his working life.",
          "The museum has an easy to follow layout. The audio guides are very good and easy to use (iPod). The museum is very informative with innovative ways of portraying information! This is a not to be missed attraction!",
          "Quiet museum. Helpful staff. Informative and brought history on Bach to life. Excellent. iPod tours really useful.",
          "We visited this gem of a museum today and learned a lot about Bach and his time in Leipzig. The museum was well appointed and maintained and in a lovely setting opposite the St Thomas Church where Bach worked. The exhibitions are easily accessible and most captions are",
          "Fabulous, how not. Bach is the beginning and the end of music, as Reger says. All composers know that. And those of us who can listen and absorb, regardless of background, just have to submerge ourselves into the music. It is paradise!",
          "Part of the Bachfest 2016 was a guided tour in the Bach Museum, next to the Thomas church were Bach worked and lived, all sacred ground so to speak. The Thomas school and Bach\u2019s own house don\u2019t exist anymore, but the Bose house where the museum is located nowadays, is the next",
          "This was without question the best music museum we visited in Leipzig...very interactive, very informative. Good audio guide in several languages. Lots of fun things to do, including \"remixing\" famous Bach pieces by touching plexiglass images of different players in the",
          "There is an organ console that Bach had played, many good exhibits, insluding listening staions. Well worth a visit, also there is a good gift shop and cafe.",
          "OK I hated the hour \"tour\"in English. I am one who does not like to stand in a single room for 20 minutes with 40 others when the room is tiny and windowless. There was a lot of Bach and music memorabilia and old instruments, original scores and lots of info. The building is a",
          "We have visited the museum twice now and loved it both times. It is not very big, but there are lots of different interesting items there to look at, as well as some original scores of Bach'd handwriting.",
          "This museum has a lot of detail about the Bach family and also has an interesting exhibition of old musical instruments. The audio presentation is very helpful and easy to navigate with good pictures of each topic and the facility to chose the program that you are currently",
          "Nice museum on the life of JS Bach. Not a large museum, but plenty to read in both German and English. You can also get an audio device and have the opportunity to check out his music. Interesting family tree with many organists and composers in the line. Easy to get to",
          "Having visited the Thomas Kirche, the next stop was obviously the museum opposite. It was a light and airy museum with staff on hand to guide you and answer questions. (They don't take you round). We declined the audio visual as we didn't have much time. Downstairs there were",
          "This is a very well done museum , with a variety of display types. It is set up so that it is interesting for both novice and highly knowledgeable visitors. There is a lift, interactive displays, ample opportunities for listening, well located bathrooms --in short, everything",
          "The museum gives a fine overview of Johann Sebastian Bach, his life, his works and his family in addition to describe family and political life in Leipzig and Saxony during his time there.",
          "High quality museum that is an absolute must for anyone who has ever performed Bach's works. Only 8 euros per adult, including a free, comprehensive audioguide on an iPod touch with headphones. Free lockers. Completely accessible for disabled including the hearing and vision",
          "I was disappointed of finding very few original items on display, even the walls have been covered with a flat white finish... It was nice imagining how Bach just was living in front of St. Thomas",
          "one for the music and art lovers. located near the market square it is easily accessible and definitely one of the main attractions in leipzig. Bach is really important for the city and the museum is a dedication to him.",
          "Very impressed with this museum. We did not have enough time to see and read all that was on display. I hope to revisit this museum.",
          "If you are a music lover, like me, you should definitely go to Bach museum. The museum has several different sections and one part has a theme that changes seasonally. When I went, there was exhibition about female music contributors during his time and that was interesting as",
          "This place has everything Bach. It gives a feel for what his life was like and the times he lived in. Not being a Bach fan, I found this interesting. I liked the room with the instruments. It does not take long to go through and takes just the right amount of time.",
          "Small place, a few interesting tid-bits, but it was kind of boring... There was one very fun room with instruments, in which you can see the old instruments, as well as hear them play parts of Bach's pieces (recordings). If you already know about Bach's life and works, there is",
          "We are not classical music scholars, but thought dropping into Leipzig on our way from Munich to Berlin would be a good break and this museum seemed to fit the bill for a relatively short stop over. The museum was very good at bringing music alive with interesting interactive",
          "Is a 'must' for classical lovers to spend hours of visit there! 8 euro for entrance was quite pricy, but as a classical music teacher, what I saw and learned was not the value can count!",
          "Very small place. Just a few music instruments, and his handwriting of compositions. Some old&historic pictures at the wall.",
          "The museum contained: Bach's organ, many baroque instruments, and the full works of Bach to search through. The information was well done, not too long, not too short, and I loved it along with my family.",
          "Modern, imaginatively designed museum right opposite where Bach lived and worked with interactive features. Good historical details of his positions, responsibilities, family and achievements, plus valuable manuscripts. You can listen to every work he wrote if you have time!",
          "This Museum, opposite the Thomas Kirche, is devoted to the life and work of Johann Sebastian Bach, who was Kantor or Music Director here from 1733 until his death in 1750. This is a brilliant museum, full of ingenious electronic devices which enable Museum visitors to access",
          "Since there isn't much left of JS Bacj other than his scores and music it's a very modern walkthrough his lifetime, family and the times of his activity.",
          "Fantastic museum using modern technology well to explain and present information to an international audience. The shop is excellent if you have music-lovers in your family. The information throughout is well presented and translated, and the audio tour is ace. Definitely worth",
          "You can do an easy double here. There is the Thomaskirche opposite with all the Bach associations and his grave. Then the museum, an interesting insight into Bach's life in Leipzig with much information, models and original documents.",
          "The house in which this museum is located was pleasant but the overall visit was underwhelming. There wasnt any introduction to Bach - we went straight into the family tree which seemed a very odd idea.",
          "Not too many artefacts but his life and music is exposed well enough. Modern displays, a good tale of life, times and history. His grave is in the church on the opposite of the museum.",
          "Small museum but very interactive and great audiotape explanations. It's also great that you can visit the church where Bach spent over 20 years as music director and composed cantatas for almost every weekend!",
          "Bach's museum is situated in the centre on Leipzig near the St. Thomas Church (where bach was an organist and many other things). The entrance fee is 8\u20ac for adults and 6\u20ac for students. Kids under 16 years old get in for free I think. The museum is really interesting and has many",
          "A thoughtfully constructed museum, detailing Bach's life and work in Leipzig as well as the cultural and historical influences on his work. Located directly opposite Thomaskirche, it contains numerous artefacts, manuscripts and pictures to bring Bach's personality, family and",
          "The museum shows some original manuscript, it is fascinating to see the very clean handwriting of the genius. It is not a house Bach ever lived in, but it shows the life of the great artist.",
          "Recognizing that Leipzig is as mad as a flock of rock groupies for its native son, Johann Sebastian Bach, we gave the Bach Museum a try next. Inside an old townhouse, next door to the long-since-demolished house where the composer and his family lived, this compact museum has a",
          "I agree with another reviewer. This place lacks the wow factor. My husband and I felt that this museum was overrated. Bach never lived in this house. Some of his music is shown and one can listen to his music on a loop with head phones, but there is not much substance here",
          "My 15 year old son proclaimed this museum to be \"the best museum in Germany\"! It is extremely well organized, audio guided, move at your own pace. There are separate rooms that are equipped with touchscreen devices that allow you to hear nearly any piece of music composed by any",
          "Somewhat sterile depending on the historical significance of Bach. Well described pictures and statues, but lacking a wow factor. My daughter had been there the year prior and wanted me to see it, so we traveled the thousands of miles to enjoy it together and I was",
          "This was well laid out with excellent free ( but take your passport as deposit) audio guide. Learnt a lot and enjoyed the music to listen to as well.",
          "Bach Museum is excellent, particularly for anyone interested in him and his music. Plan for one to two hours for a thorough visit. Cost is 8 Euros but includes a portable guide in a choice of languages with considerable music in addition to vocal explanation of the exhibits.",
          "No trip to Leipzig would be complete without a pilgrimage to this shrine, music lover or not. Were my joints younger I could have stayed indefinitely.",
          "If you are into classical music and are in Leipzig this is a must. It had a decent amount of historical content from Bach and was a nice tour.",
          "As a Bach lover I was a bit disappointed by this museum. The house was not Bach's which in itself wasn't a big problem. But, the interior was largely a modern display not transporting one's spirit into the time and life of the great composer. Nevertheless, if you are in",
          "Go here if you are a music lover! This was a highlight of our visit to Leipzig, rooms of detailed information on the Bach family of musicians going back several generations, details of Bach's manuscripts and how they are dated, and illustrations and details about Bach's life and",
          "Opposite St.Thomas's Church you can visit the recently renovated Bach Museum, located in a beautiful building that used to be the home of close friends to the Bach family. The museum has been arranged according to various topics concerning Bach's life and works, including",
          "Bach spent a good chunk of his life here and this town is built in his image, or so the argument can be formulated. Its a lovely place and totally worth visiting if one appreciate the baroque period.",
          "An excellent museum dedicated to Bach. If you have barely experienced this composer or if you know his works well this place is a must see. Affordable ticket prices make it accessible, and the abundant information in text and on audio guide shed light onto the composer and his",
          "It must be said that the entrance is little expensive in East German standards. But, as a very casual classical music listener, I very much enjoyed visiting this museum. Entrance is 8 Euro as of June 2015. If you are not fluent in German, dont forget to pick up the free audio",
          "Although we are not maniacal, we both like Johann Sebastian Bach's musical oeuvre a lot (we were married to the music of Bach). We loved this museum. While it definitely focuses on his years in Leipzig, it does a good job of illustrating his life and music. Good content and",
          "The Bach museum contains a beautifully conceived exhibition to show the life, works, and times of Bach. I particularly liked the \"music instruments room\" where contemporary instruments were displayed. The instruments that were used in a particular piece when it played were lit",
          "One of the best museums I've ever visited anywhere. The English audio guide is very informative, as are all the exhibits. You can listen as long as you like to selections of your choice from B's catalog.",
          "Despite Bach was not born in Leipzig, it is the place where he worked and lived a lot of years. The city is proud of that fact and the museum is an example. A must go!",
          "Museum fabulous. Well set out and interactive. Across the road from his church which had some lovely concerts. The restaurant in the open there was not so good. Better in some of the side streets.",
          "Well worth a visit to Leipzig just to see this museum alone. Really interesting displays, great audio guide, lots of music; we thought it was all excellent.",
          "This is not the house Bach lived in (which was since pulled down). There is not much documentation of Bach's life, his music, his post as choirmaster at St Thomas's church over the road, his pupils, marriage and sons. We do know about the instruments of his period and these",
          "Some parts of this are quite good, to be certain. The treasury room is wonderful, and really allows visitors to get a feel for Bach's effort. The interactive room where visitors can select which instruments play as a piece of music runs is similarly worth some time, and",
          "What a find next to the Cafe Gloria next to it. Apart from the guy o the ticket place not being welcoming the rest was brilliant. For a Bach lover to hear the music via the audio guide as well as sampling excerpts from the rest of the Bach family was wonderful. Really well set",
          "For Bach enthusiasts this is a real delight and you could stay all day. Plenty of fascinating exhibits, historical artefacts and music to listen to. Ten out of ten!",
          "Music lovers will like this museum, but you need at least two hours. The free audio guides are modern and easy to use, and add to the enjoyment.",
          "You could spend the day here, listening to Bach's music at several stations in the museum. There are period instruments on display, as well as a model of Leipzig during Bach's time, and a description of his life at the Thomas Kirche. As a boarding school teacher, I was",
          "You do need to have, at the very least, an interest in music and in Bach but even for the more casual visitor there is much here to absorb. A room of instruments as used in Bach's day with audio examples, one of his organs, copies of his music, family trees, a model of the",
          "For a real living museum, spend some time inside the church, taking in the span of history, the changes that nave has seen, the organs, the stained glass.",
          "Bach belongs to the world of music and anybody who deals with classic music, have to know Bach. This place is very good place for everyone who wants to feel and know the J.S. Bach better neither from its works. Please come and visit Mr.Bach",
          "After visiting Bach Museum, I have formed a very different view on Bach. I though he was strict and boring, but it turned out that he was very creative and had a sense of humor (as shown in his composition of the 'coffee cantata\"). I didn't understand in which circumstances had",
          "Granted, I'm a musician and really enjoy both music and history. So a museum dedicated to a musician strikes a special cord with me. I was fascinated by the history of Johann Sebastian Bach. The museum provided such a rich collection of historical facts about Bach that it was",
          "Extraordinary. It's a perfect museum if you love Bach. You leave feeling that you almost met him and his enormous family. And you learn lots about his work, the context and the instruments he used. Lots of opportunities to settle down and just listen.",
          "Very nice museum next to the church. Tons of history about Bach and great examples of his music. 6 euro per person to get in.",
          "It's in front of the church he worked, and the dormitories he, family and students lived. A lot of his instruments, and belongs are there. Interactive and instructive. My girlfriend, who is not musician, approved. Certainly a must see!!",
          "I was not sure I wanted to go to this museum. The cost is $8 Euros but that does include the audio guide. I was glad we went. It was nicely laid out with good details about his life both family and career. I liked that they had some of his pieces playing on the audio guide to",
          "A Bach historical museum. Exhibits in English and German, generally well conceived and presented. Next to St Thomas church, where Bach was the Kapellmeister.",
          "I was there during Museum night. The museum looked very maintained and layed out, but was mainly catering to people that know a lot about Bach and classical music allready. As I am a person with hardly any knowledge, I would have liked to be bedazzled. Instead, I got to see and",
          "The museum itself is good but brief. I appreciated the free audioguide. I think the main highlights are the original compositions on display in the treasure room and the listening rooms. You can hear almost anything you want to hear - the Bach music library available is",
          "We spent three hours just in four rooms. Brilliant audio guide. Fantastic displays. Almost too much to take in so give yourself lots of time. The ticket allows you to re-enter on the same day. A wonderful experience.",
          "Really very nice to see! Wonderful museum, with a lot of details. The audio explanation is clear and helpful. Combine the visit with the Thomaskirche one minut from the museum. If you are lucky (as we where) there is an organ concert in the Church.",
          "We had coffee, tea and cake. The service was good and the atmosphere excellent as it is right opposite Bach's statue!",
          "Nice mix of information on Bach. From the instrument he played, to the places he worked, both personal and professional life were included in this lovely museum. Recommend seeing it before going to the churches he played in.Nice audio accompaniment.",
          "We took a guided tour through this museum and loved it. Our guide explained so much about how Bach wrote each music composition and how others helped him by penning in many of the notes. His 2nd wife was so good at it that experts have a hard time telling which notes she wrote",
          "This small museum on 2 floors is just packed with information about the music meister & his family. An interactive museum as well. It has to do with music. Well worth a visit.",
          "I was surprised that this museum is located inside the Thomaskirche. There isn't a lot to see here \u2013 instruments from Bach's day, manuscripts, Bibles \u2013 but it is free and easy to access as you enter the church.",
          "plan to spend a couple of hours here as the hands-on interactive displays are wonderful ep if you are a classical music fan",
          "I thought this museum had a lot of interesting information about Bach's life. In particular, I thought the information about manuscript dating and the science behind music history was really interesting. It was certainly worth the price of admission. The only problems were",
          "I was looking forward to this but i found it to be rather dry and academic. It would have been nice to see some rooms furnished in the style of the time. Instead it is mostly photographs and charts. However, it is possible to hear music and watch some Bach-related videos.",
          "One for the enthusiast as it did not contain but a couple of Bach items, but a very well laid out series of rooms with displays, pictures and text in German and English along with a very effective and comprehansive audio guide (included in the admission fee). As enthusiasts we",
          "My favorite part of this museum was the Bach family tree, researched by JS Bach, of all of the musical Bachs. When a Bach family member's name on the tree was lit up, a recording of a composition by that member of the Bach family was played. There are a lot of interactive",
          "Tickets cost 8 euros each. We could have bought a book for less. There were very few actual exhibits and it mainly consisted of written summaries with pictures. The guard was also a bit over bearing. The real highlights are some manuscripts in Bach's own hand. All told - one",
          "Museum itself does not have many items form Bach. Instead, I enjoyed lots of historical stories of Bach' Music. The garden is cute and all the organization of the museum was amazing. I follwed the audio guide and its explanation was very helpful to understanding Bach. It is",
          "Just behind St Thomas,s church. Not many artifacts, but interesting displays on his life and works - some quite technical (paperwatermarks). Audioguide useful. Enormous audio archive - all known works, so you could spend a month there.",
          "As having some classical music training previously, the museum is considered to be a must go attraction. Entrance ticket as EUR8 is justified with the FOC multilingual guiding audio system and different choices of audio music selection in the museum. The museum is doing a good",
          "when my wife suggested we go to the bach museum when in leipzig, i was underwhelmed as I have little interest in classical music and expected a very dry experience. However, this is a fantastic museum, providing a huge amount of information in english and german (other languages",
          "The great museum, all the music is available to listen, a lot of materials and there are special exhibitions",
          "Even if you're not a Bach enthusiast, this museum is worth a visit. You will see many different types of instruments, hear different music, and see rooms In the style of the period.",
          "A fantastic state of the art museum, making excellent use of technology to bring Bach's life and music to life for us. Use of iPads, fantastic displays, archival manuscripts, original instruments and accompanying information makes for a wonderful museum. There is a great sound",
          "The Bach musem is NOT the house in which Bach lived, as that has been destroyed. This wonderful Museum is a delight to any musician, contatining many resources, including and organ which he has played, and interesting facts about his family. It also contains many parts of the",

          "I would highly recommend the visit to the Bach Museum. You can get to see different articles donated by several Bach colectors as well as to get to know the story behind the musician, how he raised his children, how we used to study with other musicians during his youth and his",
          "A very informative museum about the Bach family, their compositions, their lives. A pity there aren't more original artefacts, but it would seem that very few remain in existence.",
          "very pleasant visit whilst in Leipzig. Beautiful music and good insight into Bach's life, his music and influence. Bach's organ is on view in museum, good audio guide and music selection to listen to, very enjoyable visit and reccomend highly.",
          "I love that this exists, especially for those people who are not familiar with J. S. Bach. However, I felt that this small museum failed to create substantive connections between the composer and the 21st century viewer of his history. First, I expected that the Bach Museum",

          "Only a few years old, after renovations were done. Incomparable music to this genius, and so intelligently presented. NOTHING to dislike here - it will fill you with thoughts of universal love - and across the street, the very church JS Bach played organ in, and where he",
          "I love Baroque music. There is a wall with all the family member's names and music: awesome though it takes way too long before you can listen to the next short track. This museum is good if you like to read... And if you can read music. I can't. I got bored quickly due to the",
          "For anyone who loves baroque music, this museum is a treasure. One room allowed the visitor to chose which baroque instrument to highlight in the recording in order to hear the instrument's sound clearly. One could sit and listen to recorded Bach music for as long as wanted.",
          "Whether you know very little about Bach or can play all the Toccatas and Fugues from memory, you will enjoy this museum. It has a lot of high tech gadgetry which entertained my teenaged grandson and he showed me how to work some of them. It is across the street from St.",
          "This museum is one of the finest museums. For \u20ac8 the museum directly across the lane from St. Thomas Church shows you a nice overview of who J.S.Bach was, what he accomplished and how he contributed to our musical society. The displays are modern and not overwhelming in size.",
          "The museum is well presented and is much enhanced by the audio guide. Our visit coincided with a very good, live concert in the Sommer Saal which made it all just about perfect.",
          "We found our way into the Bach Museum by way of a very cold, snowy day in January. What followed was a few hours of delight. We were met by the security man who gave us instructions on how to use the audio guide and where we should go first. This museum is an interactive joy.",
          "Though no music enthusiast could afford skipping the Bach Museum while visiting Leipzig, I believe the place is not doing justice to this great musician. The master of all music masters definitely deserves a wider and deeper display, particularly in the city that have done much",
          "This was one of the few places where English commentary on headphones made it possible to follow Bach's story. And it is very clearly and graphically told here.",
          "Such a well laid-out museum, with English via headphones included in the ticket price. You can listen to anything Bach wrote, as well.",
          "Even though you can tour the museum without the guided tour material on the ipod type device they check out to you, I think it enhances the experience. It plays various compositions by Bach if you choose to listen to them. The device is free, you only need to leave your ID",
          "Easy to go through, only 2 euro at the time. Great place to step in out of the cold and admire some history.",

          "Visited both of the big churches (Nikolai and st Marien) so hoffed to the Bach Museum. I was there at the start of the big Bach festival. The museum was intersting but a bit disappointing. Seems a bit brief though I liked the interactive parts where one plays various pieces",
          "Alas, the large building which housed Johann Sebastian Bach along with his family and students, which was located across the road next to the Thomaskirche, was replaced long ago by another building. But Bach's friend and neighbor occupied the pretty little house occupied by the",
          "Takes a while to get going - even a bit boring at the start of the museum but once it gets going it's very interesting. No photography is permitted and that's fine if the gift shop had good postcards but they were pretty average. There's a section of the museum where you can sit",
          "I wish I had a longer time to spend there. So much to listen to and see. You could listen to as much music as you have time to spend. I would recommend allowing 2 to 3 hours for a thorough visit.",
          "Anyone interested in classical music will find this a wonderful experience. There is a lot about Bach's personal history - from a great audio guide in English, but there is much more about what shaped the music, what instruments were used, how influences changed baroque music.",
          "Here high-tech is incorporated to provide an enhanced exhibition in a small physical space, that of a house of a neighbor and therefore contemporaneous with Bach's residency. The museum has many different types of displays and info including much you can listen to through high",
          "The Bach Museum offers you a walk down Bach's past. The entrance was free (which really was amazing?), and the audio tour offered is very good (for free as well). The museum mainly deals with Bach's family, Bach's life, and the instruments in his pieces. Having said that, the",
          "You can see how he worked and how his works brought together. Nice to see his own hand-written notes. What I liked most was to learn that he used to cover his note papers with Ebru painting (an old special turkish style painting on paper - see the pic I uploaded). You'll get",
          "Not much to say, I don't get in to the museum, just taking photograph outside, and looking at the Bach's statue. But I guess who loves music should go in",
          "This museum, located directly next to the Thomaskirche church where Bach spent a large amount of his working life, is a wonderful testament to the life of a genius and brings him to life as a man, composer and choir master, who made an indelible impaxctz on the cultural history",
          "It is a good museum that use modern technology to display some aspects of the life and work of Bach. There is some original scores too. It is at the central area of the city, next to the thomaskirche",
          "A trip to Leipzig would not be complete without taking in this quaint attraction. Educational and interesting for young and old alike......!!!!!",
          "One of the few museums that provides audio tour in languages other than German. Interactive displays. Pretty courtyard to relax after tour",
          "Covers all aspects of Bach's career with first class use of modern technology and the chance to listen to an apparently endless supply of his music. Lots of instruments on display, some quite strange. Well worth a visit if you've the slightest interest in his music and less",
          "The Bach museum holds many treasures from the life and works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Be sure to check out a view of his private study. The walls are lined with old books and manuscripts. It looks like the kind of room one could spend many happy hours in. Also on display is",
          "If you are interested in Bach, this museum is amazing. There is so much information, and it's presented in a very interactive way. You can pick and choose what you want to see and hear. The staff is incredibly helpful, even with a German-English language barrier. The",
          "Located across the street from the church in which Bach is buried you will check you belongings in lockers and procede with head sets in (in English in my case) to go through through a series of exhibit rooms all centered around the life and music of Bach. I could have spent",
          "Wonderful museum on the site of the Bach Haus. One can spend all day here. They have all of JS Bach's music recorded and one can listen to it all if one chooses.",
          "This is one of the best museums I have ever been to. There are wonderful displays that are interactive and would appeal to all age groups. The guards really seem to love and be proud of their muesum as well. They pointed out how displays worked and helped us play with them.",
          "And across the road from the Thomas Curch where Bach was cantor. They have original manuscripts and items from the Bach family. Especially nice is it to stick your head out of the window whilst listening to the audio guide and get a real sense of life back when.",
          "This is an excellent museum and archive. There are displays using newer technology, and many examples of 'technology' and art from three centuries ago. This is a fascinating place with information of all kinds relating mostly to Bach, of course, but also about daily life and",
          "There are two major Bach museums in Germany: Eisenach (birth house) and Leipzig. The Leipzig museum was updated a couple of years ago and it is now of excellent quality. Well worth visiting, even if you aren't \"into Bach\".",
          "This was a really good museum with plenty of information on Bach, his family and where he lived. All set out very well and an audio guide went with the entry. Places to sit and listen as well.",
          "Well organized, explains his life well, and I really liked the timeline to see the connectivity. His church is right outside and his statue too. It has his left pocket inside out to show how broke he always was with his many children to support. I still have not found out though",
          "Great timeline that helps you understand Bach's life and his families contributions as well. Amazing listening stations with all of Bach's Cantatas and other great works. Cool things for kids as well.",
          "Dont get me wrong..you should go here because it is so Leipzig. Its well done and you will learn a lot about Bach. I tend to get a lot out of most museums so I gave the an average.",
          "It's a human nature to think that somehow the geniuses of the past somehow did not have the daily obstacles that we do. By going to this museum, I realized that Bach's work took place within a very turbulent environment.",
          "If you like Bach, you must go to this museum. If you don't like Bach, it's probably best to not go. Pros: Hi-tech museum. Audio guides are modified iPod touches, which are very slick. Audio guide content is informative and doesn't go on for too long. If a track says it lasts",
          "The children (even the ten year old) were not allowed audio guides. My son (6) was told HE wasn't allowed to take photos (even though photography is allowed) staff made us feel unwelcome. The children were well behaved and did nothing wrong.",
          "I really liked this museum. It is small so it is not overwhelming like some. It has some great interactive exhibits. Well worth the visit.",
          "interesting. We specially enjoyed the room where they showed the places how they were then and how they look now.",
          "The Bach Museum is first rate; interest for musicians, interest for adults and children. The audio is amazing and the exhibits on view are really interesting and well presented. if you are a Bach fan you should treat yourself to this. Take the family; they may be converted.",
          "This is a good museum with excellent audio features that enables the music to be enjoyed. However the staff did have a tendency to shepherd me around from one section to another. Choosing one's own route apparently was problematic!",
          "In addition to the museum there is a nice little store.",
          "The fact that Bach spent the last and most productive 27 years of his life in a single city is very unsual for a musician of the time who normally moved from court to court in search of sponsorship and funding. HIs post as Thomas Kantor and master of music for the churches and",
          "Very well presented. Lots of interesting stuff: eg. papermaking and ink - their problems and their uses for authentication.",

          "Our visit to the Bach Museum in Leipzig was wonderful as we saw the list of the Bach family names on the wall as we entered the upstairs rooms. It was great to see some fo the musical piece on which Bach performed. Taking time to sit and listen with the headphones, to some",
          "This is only a small museum and even though the displays are interesting, it is only worth a short visit. The best feature is a 'listening room' where you can select your favourite Bach piece from his entire repertoire and enjoy it in the company of other Bach lovers plugged",
          "The museum is located in Bach's neighbors house @ first I thought it was simply 2 rooms,but there another, not particularly well marked, upstairs section. The museum does the best job of integrating technology and content of any museum I have visited. Lots of musical samples on",
          "The museum was full of information and detail. There weren't that many genuine artifacts on display but what they did have was great to see (such as original scores). Everything was in English as well as German so all the wonderful detail was available to english-speakers. I",

          "Bach museum is the most interesting place I've been to in Leipzig. Even if you are not familier with classical music, the panels explain quite well about the history of Bach and his family so you can see how great he was. There are also music instruments such as pipe organs. I",
          "Just visited the Bach museum and archives--unbelievable. So well done. Even had a temporary exhibit of all of his cantatas, including many original manuscripts and excerpts of the cantatas. Quite an extensive two floor display. Do not miss it if you are an appreciator of J.S.",
          "Nothing to see until next year!",
          "I thought that the Bach museum was pretty interesting. While the displays were in German, they did provide headsets for English-speakers which would read you what the displays said. Took a little longer that way, but very interesting. However, there was one bit of the museum"

        "wiki": "The Friedenspark (\"Peace Park\") is an open space of about 20 hectares in the centre of Leipzig, Germany, in the district of Zentrum-S\u00fcdost, located between the Ostplatz to the north and the Russian Memorial Church (Russische Ged\u00e4chtniskirche) to the south. The park was opened in 1983, after the secularisation and clearance, under the then East German regime, of the Neuer Johannisfriedhof (\"New St. John's Cemetery\"), which is what the space used to be, and its thorough reconstruction.\n\n\n== Neuer Johannisfriedhof ==\n\nThe site of the Friedenspark used to be occupied by the Neuer Johannisfriedhof, which was opened as the second city cemetery of Leipzig in 1846, after it had proved impossible to enlarge the old cemetery, the Alter Johannisfriedhof, any further. The designs for the chapel and mortuary, built between 1881 and 1884, were by Hugo Licht (1841\u20131923). They were destroyed in World War II. During the time of the National Socialist government the remains of more than a hundred children from the Paediatrics Department of the D\u00f6sen Asylum were buried anonymously in urns in sections V 2, 3 and 5, victims of the then child euthanasia policy.On 31 December 1950 the Neuer Johannisfriedhof was closed to further burials, but remained accessible to the public up to 31 December 1970. From 1973 to 1975 the cemetery was secularised: vaults were removed, graves cleared and levelled. About 120 monuments and gravestones of civic or art-historical significance were taken to the Alter Johannisfriedhof and kept in the open air. A combination of damage during transit, theft and vandalism meant that by the early 1990s only 58 monuments remained. These were restored, and erected in the south-east of the Alter Johannisfriedhof.\n\n\n=== Burials of notable people ===\nThe locations of these burials, thanks to the clearance of the cemetery, are no longer traceable, and as above most monuments have not survived.\n\n\n=== Transferred gravestones ===\nGravestones and monuments moved from the Neuer to the Alter Johannisfriedhof:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Friedenspark ==\n\nThe general development plan of 1970 envisaged the conversion of the cemetery into a park for sport and recreation for the students of the  University of Leipzig.

        "wiki": "The Museum of Musical Instruments of the University of Leipzig (German: Museum f\u00fcr Musikinstrumente der Universit\u00e4t Leipzig) is a museum in Leipzig, Germany.  It is located on Johannisplatz, near the city centre. The museum belongs to the University of Leipzig and is also part of the Grassi Museum, whose other members are the Museum of Ethnography and the Museum of Applied Arts.\nIt is one of the largest music instrument museums in Europe, alongside those of Brussels and of Paris.  Its collection of around 10,000 objects includes valuable instruments from Europe and beyond, as well as music-related items from the Renaissance, the Baroque, and Bach's Leipzig period.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1886 the Dutchman Paul de Wit opened a museum of historic musical instruments in Leipzig, but he sold the collection to the paper merchant Wilhelm Heyer in 1905.  The \"Wilhelm Heyer Museum of Music History\" opened in 1913, containing De Wit's collection alongside that of the Florentine Baron Alessandro Kraus and keyboard instruments from the Prussian manufacturer Ibach.  The collection was bought by the University of Leipzig in 1926, paid for partly by the State of Saxony and partly by the publisher C.F. Peters, and was opened in the New Grassi Museum in 1929.Parts of the collection were removed for safekeeping during World War II, but a large number of the remaining items were destroyed during a bomb raid on the building in 1943, including the Ibach pianos, the archive and the library.  After the war it transpired that the items which had been removed were also significantly damaged or lost, owing to improper storage or theft.Starting in the 1950s, the museum was gradually rebuilt and reopened to the public.  The collection was expanded anew over the following decades, through purchases and donations.  All or part of the De Wit, Heyer, Kraus and Ibach collections still survive.The museum is a member of the Konferenz Nationaler Kultureinrichtungen, a union of more than twenty cultural institutions in the former East Germany.\n\n\n== Exhibition ==\nThe permanent exhibition presents the major eras of musical history (in particular that of Leipzig) and instrument technology.  The oldest exhibits date from the 16th century.  The exhibition is chronologically ordered and divided into 13 sections.  Besides those mentioned above, the most important collections include bowed, wind and percussion instruments, piano rolls, the collection of Friedrich von Amerling, and a 1931 theatre organ.  The museum also contains a sound laboratory where musical instruments can be tested out.\n\n\n== University connections ==\nThe museum has been part of the University of Leipzig since 1929, and includes a teaching collection and a study collection.  It also holds teaching events for students of Leipzig University and the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nEszter Fontana, Birgit Heise: F\u00fcr Aug' und Ohren gleich erfreulich.

        "wiki": "Leipzig (, also , , German: [\u02c8la\u026apts\u026a\u00e7] (listen);; Upper Saxon: Leibzsch) is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. With a population of 600,000 inhabitants as of 2019 (1.1 million residents in the larger urban zone), it is Germany's eighth most populous city as well as the second most populous city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin. Together with Halle (Saale), the largest city of the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt, the city forms the polycentric conurbation of Leipzig-Halle. Between the two cities (in Schkeuditz) lies Leipzig/Halle International Airport.\nLeipzig is located about 160 kilometres (99 mi) southwest of Berlin in the Leipzig Bay, which constitutes the southernmost part of the North German Plain, at the confluence of the White Elster River (progression: Saale\u2192 Elbe\u2192 North Sea) and two of its tributaries: the Plei\u00dfe and the Parthe. The name of the city as well as the names of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.\nLeipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire. The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes. Leipzig was once one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing. After the  Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East German terms, but its cultural and economic importance declined. Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy, which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry, severe unemployment, and urban blight. Starting around 2000, however, decline was first arrested and then reversed. Leipzig has undergone significant change with the restoration of major historical buildings, the demolition of derelict properties of little historical value, and the development of new industries and a modern transport infrastructure.Leipzig today is an economic centre, the most livable city in Germany, according to the GfK marketing research institution and has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, according to HWWI and Berenberg Bank. The city is one of two seats of the German National Library (together with Frankfurt), as well as the seat of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and ranks first in Germany and second in Europe according to Anthony Sheridan. Since the opening of the Leipzig City Tunnel in 2013, Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system. Leipzig is currently listed as a Gamma World City, Germany's \"Boomtown\" and as the European City of the Year 2019.Leipzig has long been a major centre for music, both classical as well as modern \"dark alternative music\" or darkwave genres. The Oper Leipzig is one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany. Leipzig is also home to the University of Music and Theatre \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\". It was during a stay in this city that Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem \"Ode to Joy\". The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Johann Sebastian Bach is one among many major composers who lived and worked in Leipzig.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Name ===\n\nThe name Leipzig is derived from the Slavic word Lipsk, which means \"settlement where the linden trees (British English: lime trees; U.S. English: basswood trees) stand\". An older spelling of the name in English is Leipsic. The Latin name Lipsia was also used. The name is cognate with Lipetsk (\u041b\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043a) in Russia and Liep\u0101ja in Latvia.\n\nIn 1937 the Nazi government officially renamed the city Reichsmessestadt Leipzig (Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig).Since 1989 Leipzig has been informally dubbed \"Hero City\" (Heldenstadt), in recognition of the role that the Monday demonstrations there played in the fall of the East German regime \u2013 the name alludes to the honorary title awarded in the former Soviet Union to certain cities that played a key role in the victory of the Allies during the Second World War. The common usage of this nickname for Leipzig up until the present is reflected, for example, in the name of a blog for local arts and culture, Heldenstadt.de.More recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\", \"Hypezig\" or \"The better Berlin\" for being celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for the vital lifestyle and creative scene with many startups.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nLeipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as urbs Libzi (Chronikon VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by Otto the Rich. Leipzig Trade Fair, started in the Middle Ages, has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world.\nThere are records of commercial fishing operations on the river Plei\u00dfe in Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the Margrave Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.There were a number of monasteries in and around the city, including a Franciscan monastery after which the Barfu\u00dfg\u00e4\u00dfchen (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks (Jacobskirche, destroyed in 1544) near the present day Ranst\u00e4dter Steinweg (the old Via Regia).\nThe foundation of the University of Leipzig in 1409 initiated the city's development into a centre of German law and the publishing industry, and towards being the location of the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) and the German National Library (founded in 1912).\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, two battles took place in Breitenfeld, about 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) outside Leipzig city walls. The first Battle of Breitenfeld took place in 1631 and the second in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.\nOn 24 December 1701, an oil-fueled street lighting system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig between Napoleonic France and an allied coalition of Prussia, Russia, Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended Napoleon's presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on Elba. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.When it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the Royal Saxon State Railways and the western one for the Prussian state railways.\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German labor party, the General German Workers' Association (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein, ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge Gr\u00fcnderzeit areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei became the largest cotton mill company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Daily production surpassed 5 million kilograms of yarn.During the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to World War II. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.\nOn 22 May 1930, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was elected mayor of Leipzig. He was well known as an opponent of the Nazi regime. He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of Felix Mendelssohn. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue, one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. Goerdeler was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.\n\nSeveral thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.\nBeginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the Gemeinde, a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.Like all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to aryanisation. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenh\u00e4user, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.As with other cities in Europe during the Holocaust, the Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the Nuremberg Laws. However, due to the Leipzig Trade Fair and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures. Shortly before Kristallnacht, Polish Jews living in the city were expelled.On 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the \"Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig\". In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in Zionism through Jewish citizens. Many of these Zionists attempted to flee before deportations began. On 28 October 1938, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of Polish Jews from Leipzig to Poland.On 9 November 1938, as part of Kristallnacht, in Gottschedstrasse (German: Gottschedstra\u00dfe), now a popular dining and nightlife area in Leipzig, synagogues and businesses were set on fire. Only a couple of days later, on 11 November 1938, many Jews in the Leipzig area were deported to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. As World War II came to an end, much of Leipzig was destroyed. Following the war, the Communist Party of Germany (German: Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, KPD) provided aid for the reconstruction of the city.In 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported. On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors. According to records of the Theresienstadt deportation, only 53 Jews survived.Until late 1943, there was little threat of aerial bombings to the city. However, on the morning of 4 December 1943, the British Royal Air Force dropped over 1,000 tons of explosives, resulting in the death of nearly 1,000 civilians. This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, the storm was too overwhelming for them. Unlike its neighbouring city of Dresden, this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945. In April 1945 the SS Gruppehfuhrer/Mayor of Leipzig Bruno Erich Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter; the Deputy Mayor/Treasurer of Leipzig, Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter, and a Volkssturm Major Walter D\u00f6nicke committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\nThe United States turned the city over to the Red Army as it pulled back from the line of contact with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city.In the mid-20th century, the city's trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the Comecon Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which East Germany was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the Monument to the Battle of the Nations.\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in. Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.In October 1989, after prayers for peace at St. Nicholas Church, established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the Monday demonstrations started as the most prominent mass protest against the East German government. The reunification of Germany, however, was at first not good for Leipzig. The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city's speciality was, in terms of the advanced economy of  reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished. As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunificaiton, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.Starting in 2000, an ambitious (and subsequently much-praised) urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig's decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving as much as possible of the city's urban structure, especially its attractive historic center and various architectural gems, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nNowadays, Leipzig is an important economic center in Germany. Since the 2010s, the city has been celebrated by the media as a hip urban center with a very high quality of living. It is often called \"The new Berlin\". Leipzig is also Germany's fastest growing city. Leipzig was the German candidate for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful. After ten years of construction, the Leipzig City Tunnel opened on 14 December 2013. Leipzig forms the centerpiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system, which operates in the four German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLeipzig lies at the confluence of the rivers White Elster, Plei\u00dfe and Parthe, in the Leipzig Bay, on the most southerly part of the North German Plain, which is the part of the North European Plain in Germany. The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the Leipzig Riverside Forest, though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat though there is also some evidence of moraine and drumlins.\nAlthough there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-cast mines in the region, many of which are being converted to use as lakes. Also see: Neuseenland\nLeipzig is also situated at the intersection of the ancient roads known as the Via Regia (King's highway), which traversed Germany in an east\u2013west direction, and the Via Imperii (Imperial Highway), a north\u2013south road.\nLeipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and the current \"ring\" road around the historic centre of the city follows the line of the old city walls.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nSince 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten districts, which in turn contain a total of 63 subdistricts. Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike many places located in Eastern parts of Germany, Leipzig has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb close to a Dfb [0 \u00b0C US isotherm]) with significant continental influences due to inland location. Winters are cool to cold, with an average of around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F). Summers are generally warm, averaging at 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) with daytime temperatures of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours a day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours a day).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nLeipzig has a population of about 570,000. In 1930, the population reached its historical peak of over 700,000. It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation. After almost doubling the city area by incorporation of surrounding towns in 1999, the number stabilised and started to rise again, with an increase of 1,000 in 2000. As of 2015, Leipzig is the fastest-growing city in Germany with over 500,000 inhabitants.\nThe growth of the past 10\u201315 years has mostly been due to inward migration. In recent years, inward migration accelerated, reaching an increase of 12,917 in 2014.In the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates. Births dropped from 7,000 in 1988 to less than 3,000 in 1994. However, the number of children born in Leipzig has risen since the late 1990s. In 2011, it reached 5,490 births resulting in a RNI of \u221217.7 (\u2212393.7 in 1995).The unemployment rate decreased from 18.2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2014 and 7.6% in June 2017.The percentage of the population from an immigrant background is low compared with other German cities. As of 2012, only 5.6% of the population were foreigners, compared to the German national average of 7.7%.The number of people with an immigrant background (immigrants and their children) grew from 49,323 in 2012 to 77,559 in 2016, making them 13.3% of the city's population (Leipzig's population 579,530 in 2016).The largest minorities (first and second generation) in Leipzig by country of origin as of 31.12.2018 are:\n\n\n== Culture, sights and cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe historic central area of Leipzig features a Renaissance-style ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several baroque period trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the historicist style representative of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit era.

At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the ICE and Intercity network of the Deutsche Bahn as well as a connection point for S-Bahn and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\nIn Leipzig, the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg-)Berlin-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Munich and Dresden-Leipzig-Erfurt-Frankfurt am Main-(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. After completion of the high-speed line to Erfurt, the ICE will run on both lines via Leipzig/Halle Airport and Erfurt. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)-Magdeburg-Braunschweig-Hannover-Dortmund-K\u00f6ln and -Bremen-Oldenburg(-Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via two S-Bahn lines, one of which runs hourly via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200 km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300 km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg is scheduled for completion in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network will considerably reduce the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200 km/h. The ICE will also be able to operate from Leipzig to Dresden in the near future. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long City Tunnel, which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf.

The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and Bayerischer Bahnhof leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n\n=== Tramway and Buses ===\n\nThe Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe, existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\nThe total length of the tram network is 149.9 km (93.1 mi), making it the largest in Saxony ahead of Dresden (130.2 km (80.9 mi)) and the second largest in Germany after Berlin (193.6 km (120.3 mi)).\nThe longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic.

There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\nSince 2004 there is a bicycle-sharing system. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the A 14 in the north, the A 9 in the west and the A 38 in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the A 72 is also partly under construction or being planned.\nThe federal roads B 2, B 6, B 87, B 181, B 184 and B 186 lead through the city area.\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\nLeipzig has a dense network of carsharing stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a ridesharing provider. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n\n=== Long-distance buses ===\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5 million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and Leipziger Messe for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLeipzig/Halle Airport is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). DHL uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines Aerologic and European Air Transport Leipzig.\nThe former military airport near Altenburg, Thuringia called Leipzig-Altenburg Airport about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by Ryanair until 2010.\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the Elster-Saale canal, White Elster and Saale was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of forced labor. The Lindenauer port was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and Karl-Heine canal respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, New Luppe, Plei\u00dfe, and Parthe) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing mill races and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused open cast mines, the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the Elbe from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Quotations ==\nMein Leipzig lob' ich mir!

          "This was our first time in Leipzig and as soon as we got to train station, we tried to figure out the way to our hotel and we asked a policeman standing by. He politely gave us directions and in no time we were at our hotel. That was the start of a good stay in Leipzig.",
          "The impressive Leipzig Hbf is the central railway hub of the city and Europe's largest railway station measured by floor area too. It also functions as a large shopping centre (there are 110 shops), called Promenaden Hauptbahnhof",

          "Building is very handsome, clean and light. Staff are friendly and helpful and know enough english words to help passengers. The only drawback was the lateness of the train. The Munich to Berlin fast train we were booked on to catch our flight home was over 75 minutes late to",

          "I arrived by S-bahn from Halle and all I needed to to do was change trains.I expected a train to Dresden within 20 minutes, but nothing showed up on the big board, nor was there anything showing at the expected platform. Eventually I had to ask someone and sure enough, with 5",
          "My standard of a good train station is that you get in and you get out. This station met that criteria. It was clean, and laid out well. What more could you want?",
          "While many of the main stations in European cities are large, this one seems to go on forever. It is easy to navigate your way around even if you don't speak/read German as we don't. Take your time and keep an eye on your belongings at all times.",

          "Leipzig is the world's largest railway station, as measured by floor area. Even if you aren't an architecture or railway fan, go and see it. You can't help but have a sense of occasion when arriving or departing by train from this majestic building. The scale of it is truly",
          "I rememember the Hauptbahnhof from the early 90's. First Pizza Hut, first KFC.... it's SO modern now, unbelievable. The Starbucks looks like Goethe would have had his coffee there already. Lots of different stores, too. Definitely worth a stop.",
          "Well, it\u2019s a main station with lots of trains and lots of shops... From the outside it looks quite nice. On the inside there are huge halls, but of course you\u2019ll find all the mc\u2019do and starbucks in there....",

          "Leipzig is a fair-sized town, and as I learned on my recent travels through Germany, a MAJOR rail transit hub. The station is immense, as you'll see the moment you descend from a train. Arch after arch lead the way to platforms. And this is really only the beginning. There is a",

        "wiki": "The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra (Gewandhausorchester; also previously known in German as the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig) is a German symphony orchestra based in Leipzig, Germany.  The orchestra is named after the concert hall in which it is based, the Gewandhaus (\"Garment House\").  In addition to its concert duties, the orchestra also performs frequently in the Thomaskirche and as the official opera orchestra of the Leipzig Opera.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe orchestra's origins can be traced to 1743, when a society called the Grosses Concert began performing in private homes. In 1744 the Grosses Concert moved its concerts to the \"Three Swans\" Tavern. Their concerts continued at this venue for 36 years, until 1781. In 1780, because of complaints about concert conditions and audience behavior in the tavern, the mayor and city council of Leipzig offered to renovate one story of the Gewandhaus (the building used by textile merchants) for the orchestra's use. The motto Res severa est verum gaudium (\"only a serious thing is a true joy\", or \"true joy is a serious thing\" \u2013 from the Roman author Seneca) was painted in the hall, suggesting the priorities of the sponsors. The orchestra gave its first concert in the Gewandhaus in 1781. The orchestra thus has a good claim to being the oldest continuing orchestra in Germany founded by the bourgeoisie, while older orchestras were part of royal suites.In 1835, Felix Mendelssohn became the orchestra's music director, with the traditional title of Gewandhauskapellmeister, and held the post until his death in 1847. Several other musicians shared the duties with Mendelssohn during his tenure, including Ferdinand David, Ferdinand Hiller, and Niels Gade.  In 1885, the orchestra moved into a new hall. This was destroyed by bombing in 1944. The present Gewandhaus is the third building with the name. It was opened in 1981. The large organ in the hall bears the original Gewandhaus hall's motto \"Res severa verum gaudium\" .\nLater principal conductors included Arthur Nikisch, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, Bruno Walter, and V\u00e1clav Neumann.  From 1970 to 1996, Kurt Masur was Gewandhauskapellmeister, and he and the orchestra made a number of recordings for the Philips label. From 1998 to 2005, Herbert Blomstedt held the same position, and they in turn made several recordings for the Decca label.  Blomstedt currently holds the title of conductor laureate with the orchestra, while Masur held the post jointly with Blomstedt until his death in 2015.\nIn 2005, Riccardo Chailly took over as both Gewandhauskapellmeister and music director of the Leipzig Opera, with an initial contract through 2010.  In 2008, Chailly's first contract extension occurred, through 2015.  However, he concurrently resigned as GMD of the Oper Leipzig, reportedly after conflict over the hiring of personnel without his consultation.  In June 2013, the Gewandhausorchester further extended Chailly's contract through 2020.  However, in September 2015, the orchestra announced the newly scheduled conclusion of Chailly's tenure as Gewandhauskapellmeister in June 2016, four years ahead of the previously agreed-upon contract extension, at Chailly's request.Andris Nelsons first guest-conducted the orchestra in December 2011, and returned for subsequent guest engagements in June 2013, July 2014 and December 2014.  In September 2015, the orchestra announced the appointment of Nelsons as its next Gewandhauskapellmeister, effective with the 2017\u20132018 season, with an initial contract of 5 seasons. In parallel, the orchestra announced a new artistic collaboration with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, of which Nelsons is the current music director.\n\n\n== Music directors (Gewandhauskapellmeister) ==\n\n\n== Conductors laureate ==\nKurt Masur (1996\u20132015, his death)\nHerbert Blomstedt (2005\u2013present)\n\n\n== Concertmasters (Konzertmeister) ==\n1797\u20131818: Bartolomeo Campagnoli\n1818\u20131835: Heinrich August Matth\u00e4i\n1835\u20131873: Ferdinand David\n1873\u20131897: Engelbert R\u00f6ntgen\n\n\n== Gewandhaus Composer ==\nJ\u00f6rg Widmann (2017\u20132018)\nHeinz Karl Gruber (2019\u20132020)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBowen, Jos\u00e9 Antonio (2003).

          "The variety and quality of the concerts as well as the sound make it a great experience. Nice is the option to stay in the lobby for a snack and drinks in the lobby of the Gewandhaus to reflect the concert.",
          "We attended two concerts during our stay in Leipzig and fully enjoyed the comfort and beauty of this concert space. Staff were both friendly and helpful. They even provided free cough drops for guests! This will definitely be high on our list of places to visit the next time",
          "Located at the heart of the city it was great experience to wander around to the beautiful building and attend a concert. The student ticket was very reasonable and it was a wonderful evening altogether.",
          "Try to book a seat in advance in order to enjoy a concert by the world famous Gewandhausorchester! If you have additional time, get to know the history of the Gewandhaus. The current building is now at the 3rd site since the first official location in 1781 - the orchestra itself",
          "Built in the 60-ies during the DDR-time, the brutalism of the exterior is surprisingly well balanced on the inside. Especially the public lounge/lobby areas have beautifully decorated, sweeping surfaces. The concert hall itself is more functional, but still quite beautiful if",
          "The stalinistic architecture isn\u00b4t considered to be estethically appealing, but the Gewandhaus - built during the DDR-era - certainly is an exception! The exterior might be a little bit brutal, but the interior is fantastic and the great hall is magnificent with - which is most",

          "We managed to grab a couple of tickets to one of the first concerts of the season before travelling to Leipzig and were very happy that we did. A great building with fine acoustics playing host to the excellent resident orchestra playing Philip Glass and Stravinsky's \"Firebird\".",
          "The Gewandhaus was closed when I visited Leipzig, but the architecture was impressive. The monument in the Augustusplatz was also impressive. The former concert hall was destroyed in WWII but the monument has been standing intact since the 1700s.",
          "We went here to one of the Bach Festival concerts and we were definitely NOT disappointed! The \"new\" building/architecture was amazing and bold and the acoustics inside the performance hall rival that of the Concertgebow (sp) in Amsterdam. Very modern in a very ancient city...",

          "The Gewandhaus is a spectacular building, constructed in the late 1970s during the GDR era. The original concrete structure is now reclad in brown tiles and makes a striking foil to the Opernhaus at the other end of the Augustusplatz, with the dramatic new University buildings",
          "If you enjoy classical music, this is the place to go... They have several rooms. Please be on time, otherwise they close the doors and won't let you in. In the break during concerts, you can drink a glass of wine (not free).",
          "The building is new and up to date but the music has a long history. I enjoyed a Bach organ concert that took advantage of the instrument and sound to really give a different view of this musical period. The ticket was reasonable and the box office very obliging. The shop",

          "it was quite a simple building, not with a lot of architectural findings, in a main square easy to approach, there is underground parking just in front, the aqustic was very good and the main stage is ineteresting because its in the center and not behind, taht means taht the",
          "Impressive building, great orchestra and the amazing Mr. Blomstedt (Yes, he was back) never ceases to amaze us! Love the Gewandhaus. Somehow you can always get tickets, and even the Orgelemporium tickets for 20 Euros (behind the orchestra) are great.",
          "The combination of history, design, acoustics and superb music made my first visit to Leipzig's Gewandhaus a memorable experience. The building itself is amazing, including the reception area ceiling mural. We booked online and the process was smooth and troublefree.",
          "This was the only concert hall building of the former East Germany, seating 1920 visitors. We went to a concert of organ music on the majestic Schuke organ - 6638 pipes and 89 registers. There is a striking ceiling painting by Sighard Gille \"The Song of Life\", the largest",
          "LOVED THIS first time visit. Trevor Pinnock was conducting the Bach B Minor Mass ( my favourite piece of all time!). I sat behind the choir and could see the conductor perfectly which added to the wow factor. Truly remarkable performance and one of the best I HAVE EVER heard.",

          "I attended a solo organ concert. I listened to organ instrument once in Frankfurt, but it was not very impressive. This time it was totally magnificent. The acoustics are good, the musician is very skillful and played with full emotions. I would recommend to attend at least once",
          "We attended concert of piano/cello duo in the Mendelssohn theater, a small venue separate from main hall, so we cannot rate the latter. The smaller hall was fairly plain, but acoustics were good.",
          "The acoustics are very good. We obtained good seats, booked the previous day, in the upper level. Virtually a booked out concert. An excellent view of the orchestra was obtained. The lead flute player was outstanding. The best acoustics that I know is in the Berlin",

          "Concert was very good, tickets not too expensive and the venue was of course of historical interest and it added a new dimension to visiting Mendelssohn's house etc to have attended a concert in the Gewandhaus. When ordering drinks for the interval we had a whole stand-up table",

        "wiki": "Leipzig (, also , , German: [\u02c8la\u026apts\u026a\u00e7] (listen);; Upper Saxon: Leibzsch) is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. With a population of 600,000 inhabitants as of 2019 (1.1 million residents in the larger urban zone), it is Germany's eighth most populous city as well as the second most populous city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin. Together with Halle (Saale), the largest city of the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt, the city forms the polycentric conurbation of Leipzig-Halle. Between the two cities (in Schkeuditz) lies Leipzig/Halle International Airport.\nLeipzig is located about 160 kilometres (99 mi) southwest of Berlin in the Leipzig Bay, which constitutes the southernmost part of the North German Plain, at the confluence of the White Elster River (progression: Saale\u2192 Elbe\u2192 North Sea) and two of its tributaries: the Plei\u00dfe and the Parthe. The name of the city as well as the names of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.\nLeipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire. The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes. Leipzig was once one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing. After the  Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East German terms, but its cultural and economic importance declined. Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy, which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry, severe unemployment, and urban blight. Starting around 2000, however, decline was first arrested and then reversed. Leipzig has undergone significant change with the restoration of major historical buildings, the demolition of derelict properties of little historical value, and the development of new industries and a modern transport infrastructure.Leipzig today is an economic centre, the most livable city in Germany, according to the GfK marketing research institution and has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, according to HWWI and Berenberg Bank. The city is one of two seats of the German National Library (together with Frankfurt), as well as the seat of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and ranks first in Germany and second in Europe according to Anthony Sheridan. Since the opening of the Leipzig City Tunnel in 2013, Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system. Leipzig is currently listed as a Gamma World City, Germany's \"Boomtown\" and as the European City of the Year 2019.Leipzig has long been a major centre for music, both classical as well as modern \"dark alternative music\" or darkwave genres. The Oper Leipzig is one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany. Leipzig is also home to the University of Music and Theatre \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\". It was during a stay in this city that Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem \"Ode to Joy\". The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Johann Sebastian Bach is one among many major composers who lived and worked in Leipzig.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Name ===\n\nThe name Leipzig is derived from the Slavic word Lipsk, which means \"settlement where the linden trees (British English: lime trees; U.S. English: basswood trees) stand\". An older spelling of the name in English is Leipsic. The Latin name Lipsia was also used. The name is cognate with Lipetsk (\u041b\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043a) in Russia and Liep\u0101ja in Latvia.\n\nIn 1937 the Nazi government officially renamed the city Reichsmessestadt Leipzig (Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig).Since 1989 Leipzig has been informally dubbed \"Hero City\" (Heldenstadt), in recognition of the role that the Monday demonstrations there played in the fall of the East German regime \u2013 the name alludes to the honorary title awarded in the former Soviet Union to certain cities that played a key role in the victory of the Allies during the Second World War. The common usage of this nickname for Leipzig up until the present is reflected, for example, in the name of a blog for local arts and culture, Heldenstadt.de.More recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\", \"Hypezig\" or \"The better Berlin\" for being celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for the vital lifestyle and creative scene with many startups.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nLeipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as urbs Libzi (Chronikon VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by Otto the Rich. Leipzig Trade Fair, started in the Middle Ages, has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world.\nThere are records of commercial fishing operations on the river Plei\u00dfe in Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the Margrave Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.There were a number of monasteries in and around the city, including a Franciscan monastery after which the Barfu\u00dfg\u00e4\u00dfchen (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks (Jacobskirche, destroyed in 1544) near the present day Ranst\u00e4dter Steinweg (the old Via Regia).\nThe foundation of the University of Leipzig in 1409 initiated the city's development into a centre of German law and the publishing industry, and towards being the location of the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) and the German National Library (founded in 1912).\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, two battles took place in Breitenfeld, about 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) outside Leipzig city walls. The first Battle of Breitenfeld took place in 1631 and the second in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.\nOn 24 December 1701, an oil-fueled street lighting system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig between Napoleonic France and an allied coalition of Prussia, Russia, Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended Napoleon's presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on Elba. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.When it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the Royal Saxon State Railways and the western one for the Prussian state railways.\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German labor party, the General German Workers' Association (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein, ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge Gr\u00fcnderzeit areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei became the largest cotton mill company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Daily production surpassed 5 million kilograms of yarn.During the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to World War II. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.\nOn 22 May 1930, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was elected mayor of Leipzig. He was well known as an opponent of the Nazi regime. He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of Felix Mendelssohn. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue, one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. Goerdeler was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.\n\nSeveral thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.\nBeginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the Gemeinde, a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.Like all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to aryanisation. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenh\u00e4user, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.As with other cities in Europe during the Holocaust, the Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the Nuremberg Laws. However, due to the Leipzig Trade Fair and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures. Shortly before Kristallnacht, Polish Jews living in the city were expelled.On 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the \"Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig\". In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in Zionism through Jewish citizens. Many of these Zionists attempted to flee before deportations began. On 28 October 1938, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of Polish Jews from Leipzig to Poland.On 9 November 1938, as part of Kristallnacht, in Gottschedstrasse (German: Gottschedstra\u00dfe), now a popular dining and nightlife area in Leipzig, synagogues and businesses were set on fire. Only a couple of days later, on 11 November 1938, many Jews in the Leipzig area were deported to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. As World War II came to an end, much of Leipzig was destroyed. Following the war, the Communist Party of Germany (German: Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, KPD) provided aid for the reconstruction of the city.In 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported. On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors. According to records of the Theresienstadt deportation, only 53 Jews survived.Until late 1943, there was little threat of aerial bombings to the city. However, on the morning of 4 December 1943, the British Royal Air Force dropped over 1,000 tons of explosives, resulting in the death of nearly 1,000 civilians. This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, the storm was too overwhelming for them. Unlike its neighbouring city of Dresden, this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945. In April 1945 the SS Gruppehfuhrer/Mayor of Leipzig Bruno Erich Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter; the Deputy Mayor/Treasurer of Leipzig, Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter, and a Volkssturm Major Walter D\u00f6nicke committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\nThe United States turned the city over to the Red Army as it pulled back from the line of contact with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city.In the mid-20th century, the city's trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the Comecon Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which East Germany was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the Monument to the Battle of the Nations.\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in. Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.In October 1989, after prayers for peace at St. Nicholas Church, established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the Monday demonstrations started as the most prominent mass protest against the East German government. The reunification of Germany, however, was at first not good for Leipzig. The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city's speciality was, in terms of the advanced economy of  reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished. As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunificaiton, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.Starting in 2000, an ambitious (and subsequently much-praised) urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig's decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving as much as possible of the city's urban structure, especially its attractive historic center and various architectural gems, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nNowadays, Leipzig is an important economic center in Germany. Since the 2010s, the city has been celebrated by the media as a hip urban center with a very high quality of living. It is often called \"The new Berlin\". Leipzig is also Germany's fastest growing city. Leipzig was the German candidate for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful. After ten years of construction, the Leipzig City Tunnel opened on 14 December 2013. Leipzig forms the centerpiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system, which operates in the four German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLeipzig lies at the confluence of the rivers White Elster, Plei\u00dfe and Parthe, in the Leipzig Bay, on the most southerly part of the North German Plain, which is the part of the North European Plain in Germany. The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the Leipzig Riverside Forest, though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat though there is also some evidence of moraine and drumlins.\nAlthough there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-cast mines in the region, many of which are being converted to use as lakes. Also see: Neuseenland\nLeipzig is also situated at the intersection of the ancient roads known as the Via Regia (King's highway), which traversed Germany in an east\u2013west direction, and the Via Imperii (Imperial Highway), a north\u2013south road.\nLeipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and the current \"ring\" road around the historic centre of the city follows the line of the old city walls.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nSince 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten districts, which in turn contain a total of 63 subdistricts. Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike many places located in Eastern parts of Germany, Leipzig has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb close to a Dfb [0 \u00b0C US isotherm]) with significant continental influences due to inland location. Winters are cool to cold, with an average of around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F). Summers are generally warm, averaging at 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) with daytime temperatures of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours a day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours a day).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nLeipzig has a population of about 570,000. In 1930, the population reached its historical peak of over 700,000. It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation. After almost doubling the city area by incorporation of surrounding towns in 1999, the number stabilised and started to rise again, with an increase of 1,000 in 2000. As of 2015, Leipzig is the fastest-growing city in Germany with over 500,000 inhabitants.\nThe growth of the past 10\u201315 years has mostly been due to inward migration. In recent years, inward migration accelerated, reaching an increase of 12,917 in 2014.In the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates. Births dropped from 7,000 in 1988 to less than 3,000 in 1994. However, the number of children born in Leipzig has risen since the late 1990s. In 2011, it reached 5,490 births resulting in a RNI of \u221217.7 (\u2212393.7 in 1995).The unemployment rate decreased from 18.2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2014 and 7.6% in June 2017.The percentage of the population from an immigrant background is low compared with other German cities. As of 2012, only 5.6% of the population were foreigners, compared to the German national average of 7.7%.The number of people with an immigrant background (immigrants and their children) grew from 49,323 in 2012 to 77,559 in 2016, making them 13.3% of the city's population (Leipzig's population 579,530 in 2016).The largest minorities (first and second generation) in Leipzig by country of origin as of 31.12.2018 are:\n\n\n== Culture, sights and cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe historic central area of Leipzig features a Renaissance-style ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several baroque period trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the historicist style representative of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The new city hall, completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\nSome 64,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in Plattenbau buildings during Communist rule in East Germany. and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, at least 10% of Leipzig's population (50,000 people) are still living in Plattenbau accommodation. Gr\u00fcnau, for example, has approximately 40,000 people living in this sort of accommodation.The St. Paul's Church was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called Paulinum, which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings and structures ===\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of 205 metres (673 feet). With 142 metres (466 feet), the City-Hochhaus Leipzig is the tallest high-rise building in Leipzig. From 1972 to 1973 it was Germany's tallest building.\n\n\n=== Museums and the arts ===\nOne of the highlights of the city's contemporary arts was the Neo Rauch retrospective opening in April 2010 at the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts. This is a show devoted to the father of the New Leipzig School of artists. According to The New York Times, this scene \"has been the toast of the contemporary art world\" for the past decade. In addition, there are eleven galleries in the so-called Spinnerei.The Grassi Museum complex contains three more of Leipzig's major collections: the Ethnography Museum, Applied Arts Museum and Musical Instrument Museum (the last of which is run by the University of Leipzig). The university also runs the Museum of Antiquities.Founded in March 2015, the G2 Kunsthalle houses the Hildebrand Collection. This private collection focuses on the so-called New Leipzig School. Leipzig's first private museum dedicated to contemporary art in Leipzig after the turn of the millennium is located in the city centre close to the famous St. Thomas Church on the third floor of the former GDR processing centre.Other museums in Leipzig include the following:\n\nThe German Museum of Books and Writing is the world's oldest museum of its kind, founded in 1884.\nThe Egyptian Museum of the University of Leipzig comprises a collection of about 7,000 artefacts from several millennia.\nThe Schillerhaus is the house where Schiller lived in summer 1785.\nThe Zeitgeschichtliches Forum Leipzig (Forum of Contemporary History) shows the history of the German division and the everyday life in the socialist German Democratic Republic.\nNaturkundemuseum Leipzig is the city's natural history museum.\nThe Leipzig Panometer is a visual panorama displayed inside a former gasometer, accompanied by a thematic exhibition.\nThe \"Museum in der Runden Ecke\" is the best known museum in the city. It deals with the operation of the Stasi State Security of former East Germany.\nJohann Sebastian Bach lived from 1723 until his death in Leipzig. The Bach Archive is an institution for the documentation and research of his life and work.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\nLeipzig Zoological Garden is one of the most modern zoos in Europe, with approximately 850 different animal species.

After the Reunification of Germany, immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nOpened in 1915, Leipzig Central Station is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the ICE and Intercity network of the Deutsche Bahn as well as a connection point for S-Bahn and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\nIn Leipzig, the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg-)Berlin-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Munich and Dresden-Leipzig-Erfurt-Frankfurt am Main-(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. After completion of the high-speed line to Erfurt, the ICE will run on both lines via Leipzig/Halle Airport and Erfurt. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)-Magdeburg-Braunschweig-Hannover-Dortmund-K\u00f6ln and -Bremen-Oldenburg(-Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via two S-Bahn lines, one of which runs hourly via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200 km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300 km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg is scheduled for completion in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network will considerably reduce the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200 km/h. The ICE will also be able to operate from Leipzig to Dresden in the near future. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long City Tunnel, which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a large freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\n\n=== Suburban train ===\n\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and Bayerischer Bahnhof leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n\n=== Tramway and Buses ===\n\nThe Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe, existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\nThe total length of the tram network is 149.9 km (93.1 mi), making it the largest in Saxony ahead of Dresden (130.2 km (80.9 mi)) and the second largest in Germany after Berlin (193.6 km (120.3 mi)).\nThe longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be bicycle-friendly. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\nSince 2004 there is a bicycle-sharing system. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the A 14 in the north, the A 9 in the west and the A 38 in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the A 72 is also partly under construction or being planned.\nThe federal roads B 2, B 6, B 87, B 181, B 184 and B 186 lead through the city area.\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\nLeipzig has a dense network of carsharing stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a ridesharing provider. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n\n=== Long-distance buses ===\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5 million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and Leipziger Messe for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLeipzig/Halle Airport is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). DHL uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines Aerologic and European Air Transport Leipzig.\nThe former military airport near Altenburg, Thuringia called Leipzig-Altenburg Airport about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by Ryanair until 2010.\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the Elster-Saale canal, White Elster and Saale was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of forced labor. The Lindenauer port was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and Karl-Heine canal respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, New Luppe, Plei\u00dfe, and Parthe) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing mill races and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused open cast mines, the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the Elbe from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Quotations ==\nMein Leipzig lob' ich mir!

        "wiki": "Luc Delahaye (born 1962) is a French photographer known for his large-scale color works depicting conflicts, world events or social issues. His pictures are characterized by detachment, directness and rich details, a documentary approach which is however countered by dramatic intensity and a narrative structure.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDelahaye started his career as a photojournalist. He joined the photo agency Sipa Press in the mid-1980s and dedicated himself to war reporting. In 1994, he joined the cooperative Magnum Photos and Newsweek Magazine (he left Magnum in 2004). He distinguished himself during the 1980s and 1990s in Lebanon, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Chechnya. His war photography was characterized by its raw, direct recording of news and often combined a perilous closeness to events with an intellectual detachment in the questioning of his own presence. This concern was later mirrored in minimalist series published as books, notably Portrait/1, a set of photobooth portraits of homeless people and L'Autre, a series of stolen portraits made in the Paris subway. With Winterreise, he explored the social consequences of the economic depression in Russia. In 2001, Delahaye conducted a radical formal change. Documenting conflicts, political events or social issues, his pictures are made using large or medium format cameras, sometimes edited on computers and are shown in museums. While exploring the boundaries between reality and the imaginary, they constitute documents-monuments of immediate history, and urge reflection \"upon the relationships among art, history and information\".\n\n\n== Books ==\nPortraits/1 (Sommaire, 1996)\nMemo (Hazan, 1997)\nL'Autre (Phaidon, 1999)\nWinterreise (Phaidon, 2000)\nUne Ville (Xavier Barral, 2003)\nHistory (Chris Boot, 2003)\nLuc Delahaye 2006-2010 (Steidl, 2011)\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1992: Robert Capa Gold Medal.\n2000: Oskar Barnack Award.\n2001: Infinity Award, International Center of Photography, New York.\n2001: Robert Capa Gold Medal.\n2002: Niepce Prize.\n2005: Deutsche B\u00f6rse Photography Prize.\n2012: Prix Pictet.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nDelahaye's work is held in the following public collections:\n\nCentre Georges Pompidou, Paris\nChrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk\nFonds National d\u2019Art Contemporain, Paris\nFondation Antoine de Galbert \u2013 La Maison Rouge, Paris\nLouis Vuitton Foundation for Creation, Paris\nJ.

        "wiki": "Ernst Karl (sometimes also Carl) Erdmann Heine (January 10, 1819 \u2013 August 25, 1888) was a lawyer in Leipzig and a major entrepreneur and industrial pioneer who shaped the face of the western suburbs of Leipzig.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\nKarl Heine was born in Leipzig, to the owner of Neuscherbitz Estate, Johann Carl Friedrich Heine, and his wife Christiana Dorothea, n\u00e9e Reichel (1781\u20131857). He attended the Thomasschule zu Leipzig, a public boarding school in Leipzig. Later he studied law at the University of Leipzig - he was member of the Corps Saxonia Leipzig fraternity. He received a doctorate on the economic use of waterways and shores according to Saxon state law. Later, he established himself as a barrister in Leipzig .\nAfter the death of his grandfather E.T. Reichel (1748\u20131832), Karl Heine bought the shares of Reichel's Garden from another heir, took these pieces of land and from the medial of the 19th century on, he gradually built what is today the inner western suburb of Leipzig.\nIn 1854, Heine also expanded his estate in the Gemeinde Plagwitz district of Leipzig; in 1856, he began the construction of the first section of a navigable canal connecting the rivers White Elster and Saale, which today bears his name (Karl-Heine-Kanal). The excavation of the canal reclaimed which was later to become the western suburb of Leipzig. To institute his plans for construction and industrialization, Heine established an \"economy\" in Plagwitz.\nWhen the western suburb was connected to Gemeinde Plagwitz, Heine constructed the Plagwitzer Stra\u00dfe (today named K\u00e4the-Kollwitz-Stra\u00dfe), a street to the south of the old highway from Leipzig to Lindenau, which ran parallel to the new street. Against the opposition of the Leipzig council, he also built the Plagwitz bridge, which connected to the Leipziger Stra\u00dfe in Plagwitz (today: Karl-Heine-Stra\u00dfe).\nKarl Heine was a member of the Saxon Diet from 1870 to his death. He was also a representative in the Leipzig city council.\nIn 1874, he moved into his newly built villa in Neuschleu\u00dfig (Karl-Heine-Villa, K\u00f6nneritzstra\u00dfe 1), where he resided until his death.\nIn 1876, a construction scheme was approved which encompassed merging Karl Heine's meadows and fields in the northern part of Schleu\u00dfig (Neuschleu\u00dfig) with Bernhard H\u00fcffer's (1824\u20131904) estate and extensive undeveloped forest land. These areas would be designated as new residential areas. \nOn May 24, 1888, Heine founded the Westend-Baugesellschaft, a construction company, to continue his work in developing the Leipzig economy after his death.\nSince 1854, Karl Heine had also been a member of the Leipzig masonic lodge Apollo. He died on August 25, 1888, aged 69, in Leipzig.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nIn 1897, the city of Leipzig honoured Karl Heine with a monument. The monument was melted down in the Second World War but was renewed in 2001. Many streets and one plaza are named after him. (Erdmannstra\u00dfe, 1891; Karl-Heine-Stra\u00dfe, 1904; Karl-Heine-Platz, et al.)\nIn 2003, a Leipzig vocational school adopted the name of Karl-Heine-Schule.\n\n\n== References ==\nGreiling, Walter (1969), \"Heine, Ernst Carl Erdmann\", Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB) (in German), 8, Berlin: Duncker & Humblot, pp. 293\u2013294\nKr\u00fcger, Ulrich (2008).

          "this miraculous museum somehow manages to immerse you - about as far as you'd ever want to be immersed - in the GDR and make you feel both its oppression and, somehow, its loss. A true experience.",
          "If you interested in German history as it had been devided, this might the best place to get a general impression how different those two independent statues developed after WWII. American influence vs. Communist domination. Definitely worth a visit.....after that please see the",
          "Our two boys (aged 13 and 11) and I LOVED this museum. We went twice. It deals with the history of East Germany in a really interesting and engaging way. You can spend hours here and admission is free. Info is in German and English. Highly recommend!!!",
          "This museum is free of charge and worth visiting. It shows how East Germany developed after the war and how GDR became a part of the Soviet controlled Warsaw Pact countries. You get a glance of life under dictatorship and under the eyes of secret service that tries to control",
          "This museum is free and it is so interesting. Lots of interesting information in German and English about the GDR. This is a must see!",
          "A good (and also free) look at East and West Germany; explanations are in English, too; be sure to take time to visit here.",
          "This museum gives a very nice and complete account of the recent history in East and West Germany. It is for free, so just go there and have a look!",
          "Fantastic exhibition about a historic period still very close. Well curated and told from various perspectives about the different periods Germany was forced into after 1945. And similar things are still going on all around the world. When will we ever learn.",
          "We were not expecting such a complete collection of historic objects related to the socialist time in Leipzig. The museum is impressive and tells the history before and after the Berlin wall was eliminated.",
          "Fantastic museum, comprehensive and well laid out. The temporary exhibitions on the East German comic and German club culture were a bonus. Lots of information in English throughout.",
          "Can you explain what the DDR was like? After a visit here you have had the opportunity to see and sense the rather harsh realities of life in the erstwhile Eastern Germany.",
          "Wow! This is what a museum should be like; it tells a story, in an interesting way, of life in the GDR (East Germany) from after WWII to the present. Everything is well documented in both English and German. Displays include well written, well organized documentation;",
          "You could easily spend a full half day here learning about Germany's recent history, from the end of WWII to the present day. Excellent exhibits. Important lessons for all.",
          "This place exceeded our expectations. It certainly brought to life this era from 1945. It is told in a stark, factual way with many audio diaries. There is a lot in English so you are absorbed. Being relatively young it contrasts sharply with our free life in the west at that",
          "Leipzigers like to tell a story. This one is about what it was like to live in the DDR. It's told without self-pity, just matter-of-fact vignettes of their world back then. Visit this museum. That's an order!",
          "We enjoyed the temporary exhibit about industrial design in the DDR. Unfortunately, there was a lot of German audio which we could not understand. The main exhibition was closed for renovation which was very disappointing. Guess we have to return to Leipzig!",
          "This is a free museum, the Forum of Contemporsry History. It presents Germany's divided history ( 1949-1989) and provides exhibits on life in Communist era East Germany and then the reunification process. It is very large and packed with information, pictures, videos and",
          "I've learned so much about not only Leipzig's history, but also the history in Germany. You can easily spend a whole afternoon in here. It's noticeable that there was a lot of care put into the exhibitions and they are interactive as well. Too bad that it was mostly in German,",
          "Entrance is free and you can spend an hour or 2 in the place seeing the different eras r the German life.",
          "This had a wealth of information and interesting exhibits but unfortunately the text was(understandably) mainly in German. We found it thought provoking but our poor understanding of German meant we felt a bit frustrated. However still well worth a visit if you want to",
          "Really good overview of German history. Even for a German native there are things to discover. And for FREE. Really good (y)",
          "Some of the main exhibits have English translations, but most do not. I got by with rudimentary German, but much of the museum was wasted on me. In particular, photography from the recent Syrian conflict was very moving.",
          "I would definitely recommend this museum. Fortunately on the day we were visiting, sunday, they held an english tour. The guide had studied history and was able to explain most of the important elements of the exhibition in an hour. The tickets and guides are free. They also",
          "Onla few summaries in English but most of the images tell their own story anyway. Bigger than it looks from outside and unbeatable value.",
          "This was my favourite museum trip in Germany, as it detailed life in the east under the soviets through to the wall coming down, and the integration phase. This is current history at its best, a lot of documented coverage with a small East German movie theatre replica, nod many",
          "This is a free attraction - thank goodness for that! All in German, and no English to be seen anywhere. It was not useful at all for me. It seems though a well documented history of the two Germany's with lots of historical facts and memorabilia. If you are fluent in German, it",
          "The English are very much the minority in Leipzig and unfortunately this means there isn't a lot in English. This is one place that is fantastic, but most exibits are described in German, with no English explanation...a big shame as its a fantastic place.",
          "Very interesting place, with very nice design and information it is not boring as many historic meuesums. It is made in a very creative way. Recommended",
          "Wonderful displays. They had historical time lines, artifacts, maps and odd and ends of daily life. As a tourist from overseas, i wish there were more English translations. Whatever there was in English is not quite enough to satisfy my curiosity. Still worth visiting though for",
          "It's not a fancy museum nor an old one. It has the vibes of a Modern one quite frankly, but it is full of the old things if one can say... what I liked was; the videos that they were playing, kinda took me back to that time and made me feel in a way that I'm with them. At last",
          "Centrally located etensive exhibit of the history of the German Democratic Republic. The initial part that elaborates on the suffering of the poor East Germans during the Nazi years is something you will have to fight your way through, but after that, there is a well-balanced",
          "Great exhibition . We had a very good guide who told us so many interesting stories in English . From the world football championship in Bern to the unification of Germany worth a visit.",
          "This place can be visited in three ways. 1. going around on one's own 2. taking advantage of the countless interactive participation oportunities and finally 3. every 2 hours or so they offer a free guided tour covering the highlights of this enormous and interesting exhibition.",
          "While the DDR museum in Berlin is focussing on the goods and associated memories of people living in the DDR this museum shows the political history and struggles. Less memorablia and more background.",
          "It is in a way like \"the\" definitive museum on East German history. As Leipzig was where popular protests against the East German Communist regime boiled over in 1989, it is the most fitting place for the definitive German memorial/museum on GDR history/repression/revolutio.",
          "this is a must! the displays bring to life the story of post war germany, especially in the East. We had a tour (free) with an English speaking guide and it was WELL worth waiting for. Easily overlooked because it doesn't leap out of the guide books, but DON\"T miss it!!!",
          "It is located in the town centre, the entrance is free, the exibitions are excellent, big and well exposed, it shows and describes well a big part of German history, really worth a visit, I went twice in a week",
          "This is Avery nice museum with the latest history of Leipzig and the DDR. The exposition is only in German, but at the entrance you are given a little document which explains the museum. I didn't know that the resistance and movement to bring down the wall started here at",
          "A museum to fully understand the growing of germany after the war, they explain taking all myths out of german history, put in real history with no cover, just consider its only in german there's no english, you can leave your things in the locjwrs downstairs, staff is very",
          "..well done to the city authorities for pumping money into museums such as this. Extremely professional and excellently laid out. Outlines the history of Leipzig from just before first world war up to the present. Lots of interesting memorabilia. One criticism might be, more",
          "We wanted to go there in the evening and entered before the closing time of this place. We were very rudely told that the place will close in 15 minutes. Not a good service.",
          "In my opinion the most interesting museum in Leipzig, especially for Germans, from East and West. The entrance is free, it is open all week except mondays, and takes up to 3-4 hours to walk through if you take the time to do it. Didactics are very well used and it gives accurate",
          "This is a fascinating step into history. The formation of and life in East Germany. Unfortunately there is very little in English so a lot of detailed information is not conveyed if you don't know German. But you still get the feel of the era.",
          "This is a free museum in the centre of Leipzig but all of the displays are in German. There are also video shows but these too are in German. The space inside seemed small or rather they seem to try and cram so much into a small space. I speak German so it was interesting to an",
          "Wonderful museum but speaking no German at all I found almost no signs in German. There was a free museum guide brochure in English available which allowed me to find my way around but I felt I missed so much because there is no other language but German. I found only 2 signs in",
          "I think one of the reasons I would always come back to this museum is because it highlights the everyday life of Germans in divided Germany extremely well. There are many authentic relics displayed and in-depth explanations of everything regarding East German lifestyle,",
          "Covers the GDR well - its strengths and weaknesses. Free and easy to walk round. Very central and well displayed.",
          "I wandered in on a rainy afternoon, and am so pleased I did. This forum / museum is a wonderful interactive presentation of modern German history. Much of the information is translated, and those which aren't (for example the films) are easy to figure out. I learned a lot.",
          "This Museum traces the history of the setting up, career and downfall of the German Democratic Republic from 1945 to 1989. There may be an audio guide but I wasn't offered one. Some of the information providing a commentary on historical developments is translated into English",
          "We lost track of time in this exhibition, in more ways than one. So much to take it, it was almost painful. If you're not a German speaker, you need to work hard to understand what's going on here. Luckily I am so perhaps that's why I got so much from our visit. Maybe non",
          "What a lucky day. We came across the 2.00pm English guided tour which was free. If in Leipzig then this would be considered a must do. Our guide was amazing. She had first hand knowledge of the events including the start of the reunification on 9th November 1989. From a",
          "The Zeitgeschichlitches Forum, the museum of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) reflects cutting-edge interactive design. The museum incorporates text, film clips, objects from everyday life (including East German versions of 1960s go-go-boots era clothing), propaganda posters",
          "Very good permanent exhibition about everyday life at DDR - note: explanations only in german - situated nicely at city center and worth just to pop up and take just as much or little of time one feels fitting.",
          "This museum is worth visiting when in Leipzig. It gives the history from WWII and to the reunion of the German nation. Through documents and eye whiteness descriptions you get and insight to how Germans understands the time from the division of their country after the war and",
          "We had a great experience on an english guided tour by Sebastian, who presented himself as having studied history in Leipzig, and in fact what a great performance, very entertaining and interactive, in a perfect and clear english. The tour took 1 hour and the focus was on one",
          "This museum of modern German history, concentrating on Leipzig and Saxony, is surprisingly robust and informative. The numerous displays are very well designed and accompanied by detailed and interesting information and analysis. No one with an interest in post-war East Germany",
          "We really wanted to learn about the GDR but without good German this museum is frustrating. There is a bit translated but it's the tip of the iceberg really. You can wander around looking at everything but if your German is basic/moderate so much of the displays is a mystery. An",
          "The second floor is the most important one of the museum: it offers an extended exhibition about the rise and fall of the former German Democratic Republic (DDR). A quick run-through, without going into all the exhibits, will take an hour or so. But chances are that you will",
          "Not much to add to all the other reviews. We didn't see any lockers, but then we also didn't ask, or the signs could have been in German! It would be really helpful to have good German language skills for this museum, however, some of the museum can be understood without those",
          "A very interesting museum, and free! Lots to see, not a lot of English descriptions but there are some. Sometimes too dark to read the labels, and quite confusing to find your way round, but well worthwhile nevertheless.",
          "The major things are in English, but there is a lot more info in German. The audio guides are only for groups. Entrance is free. The visiting exhibits are interesting to include the current sex exhibit (all in German, but easy to figure out based on items displayed).",
          "If you are interested in german history, you must vist this museum. I was there in summer, from the window of this museum you get a nice view of Leipzig. It located in the midst of Leipzig.",
          "First thing you need to know is, the museum entry is totally free. That should attract everyone to pay a visit to this rich museum full of East German history. There are free lockers (another awesome feature!!!) available if you need to keep your bags/jackets safe. Only",
          "We visited the Forum in February 2015. We were interested in their exhibition about the World War II, and we were not disappointed. The entrance is free, not only for the \"Dauerausstellung\" (which I believe means it is always there) but also for the exhibitions that are only",
          "Of all the exhibitions and museums I've seen that focus on German history (East and West) since 1945, this is the best one I've been to. The multimedia displays are really engaging and kept me interested for a couple of hours, which is a good sign as I don't tend to hang around",
          "Wonderful permanent exhibition on the former DDR. Free to the public, this museum nicely combines realia and artifact with a variety of interactive presentations. Though the major points are present in English and German, the finer points are exclusively in German, so an",
          "The museum holds exhibitions on very interesting topics. The exhibitions are well displayed and quite interactive. I only had the chance to visit the temporary exhibition, which is concerntrated on sexism. It opens discussions on gender inequality, gender identity, etc. If I had",
          "There is a ton of cool stuff in here, and to top it off it's free! The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is because there are very few English captions on any of the exhibits. There were 10-15 brief explanations on major events, but all of the individual item descriptions",
          "As title, It's the best museum about DDR I visited in Germany, (even better than Berlin's) and I was really surprised that it's free for visiting. This museum displays a lots of records and objects about Germany and DDR, it can still be stayed few hours if you are interested",
          "Extensive exposition on Germany's recent history, especially in the GDR. Very informative and interesting, also for children. Right in city center and no admission fees.",
          "This museum is in the heart of Leipzig. It gives an insight into the recent history of the city during the communist era. Well worth a visit.",
          "A complicated exposition of the trials and tribulations of people in the GDR as they experience the end of Nazism and its replacement by an equally nasty regime. The museum in general looks at the darker side of life under Communism, certainly highlighting the brutality. Not",
          "When we visited there was a special exhibit on American influences post-war which was very well- displayed and presented in both English and German. Several floors of a modern building are used for the museum so it was uncrowded and easy to navigate. Worth a visit.",
          "Fantastic museum in what looks to be an office building in the centre of Leipzig. A detailed review of East-West relationships and life in the DDR. And it's free, although mainly in German.",
          "This museum shows the visitor how the East German GDR (die DDR) came into being, what daily life was like, who was who and how people were effected by the positive and negative aspects of living in a socialist state. Then came the end - Protests and celebrations, elections and",
          "Allow a good few hours to peruse the materials on display here. As other reviewers have pointed out there is only introductory boards in English with the predominance in German only but this does not lessen the impact of the materials. We were absorbed for the time we were",
          "This modern museum presents the story of the transition from post war life to modern life in Germany. Starting with the devastation of a defeated nation in 1945 the museum covers the period of Russian occupation, the East German DDR government and transition to German",
          "This is a brilliant museum. Even though there is very little written information in English and no audio guide we recommend that you do not miss it. Also it is free!",
          "This is an excellent presentation that gives one an idea of what the DDR (Former East Germany under Communist rule) was like. There are hundreds of artifacts from the era - newsclips, advertisements, films, clothing, propaganda - as well as an explanation of the history of how",
          "I can tell this would have been really excellent, though. If you can read German, go and spend a good 2 hours. There is a translated board for about every section, but it doesn't cover all of the articles, memorabilia, videos, etc etc. Really, a ton of great material. We're",
          "This museum shows you the history of the East Germany. Not to be missed even because it is free! Yes, so every one can get to know what happen and judge by him/herself. This museum is interesting and even not English friendly (only some panels are in EN) is informative since you",
          "Not easy to find amongst the high street shops, with a glass front that looks like many others along the street. It has a really interesting collection of pictures and items, but very few were in English, so I feel I missed out on the meanings(can't complain to much in a no",
          "Although this museum only has introductory panels in English, there is still quite a bit to see. We especially liked the television footage from October 7, and the mock-up of an East German apartment.",
          "This extraordinary museum documents the transition from Nazi rule through the Russian-dominated DDR, to the fall of the Wall. The exhibits include many life histories of the oppressed, but also those who seamlessly made the transition from Nazi to Communist apparatchik. Lots of",
          "My wife is German (I'm English) so we both we taught different perspectives on GDR and the history building up to the fall of the Berlin wall. We both found the Zeitgeschichtiches Forum provides a fascinating insight into how the political agendas n play touched the lives of",
          "I really enjoyed the time spent in this fascinating museum, which is full of insights into life in the DDR and how things developed. It was a little difficult to get a complete picture if you didn't have a general knowledge of the history already and there was a lot of exhibits",
          "This is a museum where you can find yourself. Recent German history, intelligently packaged. I've taken a number of UK friends here and they all found it really helpful not only better understanding a part of German history, but drawing connections to their own pasts. I",
          "Highly recommended museum, particularly as there is no entrance fee. We visited during the New Year's break and so it was busy but may be less so at other times of the year. The museum details, in chronological format, a detailed social history of Germany. There are lots of",
          "Nice museum in a modern building, and its exhibitions are free, so it's highly recommended to visit if you are in Leipzig. Most of the exhibitions are about the divided Germany and the life in the Eastern provinces. Unfortunately, almost everything is in German, and you will",
          "The exhibition is nicely divided into several themes following the partition of the German reich after WWII to the events of November 1989. A lot of objects and didactic material is available in German, sadly not in English. The 3rd floor hosts a great section dedicated to",
          "This was an amazingly well put together museum covering the recent history of Leipzig. There was a bit in english, but I would have benefited from a few more translations. Most interesting was the timeline from 1945 thru to today. Recommend pairing this with visiting Runden",
          "The exhibit creators and historians who worked on this project should be very pleased with their work. Very well done. My only complaint: Invest in a few more English language panels and/or audio guides. Those of us that would benefit from learning more about the exhibit,",
          "You can see a lot about German division and reunification. How people lived in East and West Germany, and how the city of Leipzig was important in this process.",
          "A kind of museum, entrance is free and gives a very good overview of what went on in Germany during the cold war, from right after the war till now. Especially nice and informational for non-Germans or the ones that did not experience the cold war themselves. The temporary",
          "Excellent collection of memories and artefacts from the socialist days. However, they really need captions in other languages. I was lucky and tagged on to a guided tour in English. But, if you're new to this period of history, you would struggle to make sense of it all.",

        "wiki": "The Museum of Musical Instruments of the University of Leipzig (German: Museum f\u00fcr Musikinstrumente der Universit\u00e4t Leipzig) is a museum in Leipzig, Germany.  It is located on Johannisplatz, near the city centre. The museum belongs to the University of Leipzig and is also part of the Grassi Museum, whose other members are the Museum of Ethnography and the Museum of Applied Arts.\nIt is one of the largest music instrument museums in Europe, alongside those of Brussels and of Paris.  Its collection of around 10,000 objects includes valuable instruments from Europe and beyond, as well as music-related items from the Renaissance, the Baroque, and Bach's Leipzig period.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1886 the Dutchman Paul de Wit opened a museum of historic musical instruments in Leipzig, but he sold the collection to the paper merchant Wilhelm Heyer in 1905.  The \"Wilhelm Heyer Museum of Music History\" opened in 1913, containing De Wit's collection alongside that of the Florentine Baron Alessandro Kraus and keyboard instruments from the Prussian manufacturer Ibach.  The collection was bought by the University of Leipzig in 1926, paid for partly by the State of Saxony and partly by the publisher C.F. Peters, and was opened in the New Grassi Museum in 1929.Parts of the collection were removed for safekeeping during World War II, but a large number of the remaining items were destroyed during a bomb raid on the building in 1943, including the Ibach pianos, the archive and the library.  After the war it transpired that the items which had been removed were also significantly damaged or lost, owing to improper storage or theft.Starting in the 1950s, the museum was gradually rebuilt and reopened to the public.  The collection was expanded anew over the following decades, through purchases and donations.  All or part of the De Wit, Heyer, Kraus and Ibach collections still survive.The museum is a member of the Konferenz Nationaler Kultureinrichtungen, a union of more than twenty cultural institutions in the former East Germany.\n\n\n== Exhibition ==\nThe permanent exhibition presents the major eras of musical history (in particular that of Leipzig) and instrument technology.  The oldest exhibits date from the 16th century.  The exhibition is chronologically ordered and divided into 13 sections.  Besides those mentioned above, the most important collections include bowed, wind and percussion instruments, piano rolls, the collection of Friedrich von Amerling, and a 1931 theatre organ.  The museum also contains a sound laboratory where musical instruments can be tested out.\n\n\n== University connections ==\nThe museum has been part of the University of Leipzig since 1929, and includes a teaching collection and a study collection.  It also holds teaching events for students of Leipzig University and the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nEszter Fontana, Birgit Heise: F\u00fcr Aug' und Ohren gleich erfreulich.

It is the largest football stadium in the former East Germany and has also hosted music concerts as well as football.\nOpened in 2004, it is currently the home stadium for first-division club RB Leipzig, with FC Sachsen Leipzig having previously used the stadium from its opening until 2009. Due to UEFA sponsorship regulations, the stadium is known as the RB Arena for European matches.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 1956, the first Zentralstadion opened, at the time it was one of the biggest stadiums in Europe being able to hold 100,000 spectators. Various Leipzig football teams used the venue as a home stadium, including VfB Leipzig (precursor to 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig) at various points in the 20th century (including large-scale European matches in the 1970s and domestic football in the 1990s). However, over the years it fell into disuse and was costing the city too much to maintain. In 1997, the city of Leipzig decided to build a new stadium within the old stadium, a modern state of the art stadium only for football. The new stadium was built from December 2000 till March 2004. A similar endeavor of constructing a new stadium within the confines of an historic stadium's exterior was completed in Chicago's Soldier Field, which similarly build a modern stadium while preserving the exterior of the original structure.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Zentralstadion was the only stadium in the former East Germany to host games in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. It hosted four group matches and a round of 16 game in the tournament. A year earlier, it was also one of the venues for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and hosted three matches of the tournament, including the third-place match. From 2005 to 2007, the Zentralstadion was host of the German League Cup final.\nFC Sachsen Leipzig used the stadium as a home ground from time to time between 2004 and 2007, however they moved back to their traditional home, the Alfred-Kunze-Sportpark at the start of the 2008\u201309 season.\nIn July 2009, energy drink manufacturer Red Bull took over the license of SSV Markranst\u00e4dt and renamed the team RasenBallsport Leipzig, in short RB Leipzig. From the outset, the new team outlined their wish to move into the tenant-less Zentralstadion and rename it the \"Red Bull Arena\". The naming rights were granted on 25 March 2010 and the stadium will be named so for a minimum period of 10 years as of 1 July 2010. The cost for renting the stadium will rise in accordance with the level of football RasenBallsport Leipzig are at. The team has pledged to upgrade the seating, install video advertising boards and make changes to the boxes and the VIP area.In the 2010\u201311 season, Hallescher FC played between three and five games at the Zentralstadion due to their own Kurt-Wabbel Stadion being renovated.In 2014, the stadium was ranked 17th in the country based on attendance, safety, and number of events.\n\n\n=== Future expansion ===\nIn October 2015, expansion of the Red Bull Arena was back on the agenda. New plans were made to expand the stadium to 57,000 seats, involving Viennese architect Albert Wimmer. Reconstruction could start in the summer break of 2016. In January 2016, the club decided to put the plans on hold, at least until 2017.In December 2016 RB Leipzig offered, that the stadium would be sold from former owner Michael K\u00f6lmel to the club to continue the plans from the 2015 agenda. Due to the move of the arena into ownership of Red Bull, a new stadium was out of possibility. The Stadium will expand to a total of 53,840 Seats as of Summer 2021, beginning from November 2018, when construction works will start.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\nThere are bridges built over the old stadium to connect with the new stadium. The roof has an integrated floodlight design and is designed to provide superior acoustics. The grass area is 120 x 80 m, the actual playing field is 105 x 68 m. It has been integrated into the area surrounding the stadium by large numbers of trees and other greenery.\n\n\n== External dimensions ==\nNorth to South: 230 m\nEast to West: 210 m\nHeight to Roof: 46.5 m\nRoof Area: 28,100 m\u00b2\nMap Coordinates: 51\u00b0 20' 44\" N; 12\u00b0 20' 54\" E\n\n\n== 2006 FIFA World Cup ==\nThe stadium was one of the venues for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the only one located in the territory of the former East Germany.\nThe following games were played at the stadium during the 2006 World Cup:\n\n\n== Other uses ==\nThe arena is frequently used as a concert venue.

        "wiki": "The Ministry for State Security (German: Ministerium f\u00fcr Staatssicherheit, MfS) or State Security Service (Staatssicherheitsdienst, SSD), commonly known as the Stasi (IPA: [\u02c8\u0283ta\u02d0zi\u02d0]), was the official state security service of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). It has been described as one of the most effective and repressive intelligence and secret police agencies ever to have existed. The Stasi was headquartered in East Berlin, with an extensive complex in Berlin-Lichtenberg and several smaller facilities throughout the city. The Stasi motto was Schild und Schwert der Partei (Shield and Sword of the Party), referring to the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED) and also echoing a theme of the KGB, the Soviet counterpart and close partner, with respect to its own ruling party, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Erich Mielke was the Stasi's longest-serving chief, in power for thirty-two of the GDR's forty years of existence.\nOne of its main tasks was spying on the population, mainly through a vast network of citizens turned informants, and fighting any opposition by overt and covert measures, including hidden psychological destruction of dissidents (Zersetzung, literally meaning decomposition). It arrested 250,000 people as political prisoners during its existence. Its Main Directorate for Reconnaissance (Hauptverwaltung Aufkl\u00e4rung) was responsible for both espionage and for conducting covert operations in foreign countries. Under its long-time head Markus Wolf, this directorate gained a reputation as one of the most effective intelligence agencies of the Cold War. The Stasi also maintained contacts, and occasionally cooperated, with Western terrorists.Numerous Stasi officials were prosecuted for their crimes after 1990. After German reunification, the surveillance files that the Stasi had maintained on millions of East Germans were laid open, so that any citizen could inspect their personal file on request; these files are now maintained by the Stasi Records Agency.\n\n\n== Creation ==\nThe Stasi was founded on 8 February 1950. Wilhelm Zaisser was the first Minister of State Security of the GDR, and Erich Mielke was his deputy. Zaisser tried to depose SED General Secretary Walter Ulbricht after the June 1953 uprising, but was instead removed by Ulbricht and replaced with Ernst Wollweber thereafter. Following the  June 1953 uprising, the Politb\u00fcro decided to downgrade the apparatus to a State Secretariat and incorporate it under the Ministry of Interior under the leadership of Willi Stoph. The Minister of State Security simultaneously became a State Secretary of State Security. The Stasi held this status until November 1955, when was restored to a ministry. Wollweber resigned in 1957 after clashes with Ulbricht and Erich Honecker, and was succeeded by his deputy, Erich Mielke.\nIn 1957, Markus Wolf became head of the Hauptverwaltung Aufkl\u00e4rung (HVA) (Main Reconnaissance Administration), the foreign intelligence section of the Stasi. As intelligence chief, Wolf achieved great success in penetrating the government, political and business circles of West Germany with spies. The most influential case was that of G\u00fcnter Guillaume, which led to the downfall of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt in May 1974. In 1986, Wolf retired and was succeeded by Werner Grossmann.\n\n\n== Relationship with the KGB ==\n\nAlthough Mielke's Stasi was superficially granted independence in 1957, until 1990 the KGB continued to maintain liaison officers in all eight main Stasi directorates, each with his own office inside the Stasi's Berlin compound, and in each of the fifteen Stasi district headquarters around East Germany. Collaboration was so close that the KGB invited the Stasi to establish operational bases in Moscow and Leningrad to monitor visiting East German tourists and Mielke referred to the Stasi officers as \"Chekists of the Soviet Union\". In 1978, Mielke formally granted KGB officers in East Germany the same rights and powers that they enjoyed in the Soviet Union.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe Ministry for State Security was organized according to the Line principle. A high-ranking official was in charge of a particular mission of the Ministry and headed a division in the Central Apparatus (Zentrale). A corresponding division was organized in each of the 15 District Departments for State Security (Bezirksverwaltungen f\u00fcr Staatssicherheit in the Berlin Capital Region and 14 regional districts (Bezirke)). At the local level the Stasi had Area Precincts for State Security (Bezirksverwaltungen f\u00fcr Staatssicherheit - one each for the 227 cities and municipal districts and the 11 city boroughs (Stadtbezirken) of East Berlin). A single case officer held responsibility for the particular mission in each area precinct. The line principle meant that the case officers were subordinated to the specialized divisions at the district departments. The specialized divisions at the district departments were subordinated to the specialized division in the central apparatus and the whole line was under the direct command and control of the high-ranking Stasi officer in charge of the mission. The Stasi also fielded Location Detachments (Objektdienststellen) at state-owned enterprises of high importance (such as the joint USSR-East German Wismar uranium mining company). Shortly before the transformation of the Stasi into the Office of National Security the Ministry had the following structure:\n\n\n=== Ministry for State Security ===\nMinister for State Security\nPolicy Board (Kollegium des MfS, included the Minister and his deputies)\n\n\n==== Central Apparatus ====\nCentral Apparatus (Zentrale)\nDivisions directly subordinated to the Minister Army general Erich Mielke (Dem Minister f\u00fcr Staatssicherheit direkt unterstellte Diensteinheiten)\n\nOffice of the Minister (Sekretariat des Ministers)\nMain Division II (Hauptabteilung II) - Counter-intelligence\nDivision M (Abteilung M) - Postal control\nMain Division IX (Hauptabteilung IX) - Investigative body\nDivision X (Abteilung X) - International liaison with partner agencies from the Socialist Bloc\nDivision XIV (Abteilung XIV) - Criminal prosecution and Stasi prisons\nExecutive Group of the Minister (Arbeitsgruppe des Ministers)\nFelix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment (Wachregiment Berlin \"Feliks E.

of mail and telephone communications.\nAdministration 2000 was responsible for the reliability of National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee, NVA) personnel. Administration 2000 operated a secret, unofficial network of informants within the NVA. Administration 2000 was the name of the division in NVA documentation. Its actual Stasi name was Main Division I.\nAdministration for Security of Heavy Industry and Research and Main Administration for Security of the Economy: protection against sabotage or espionage.\nDivision of Garbage Analysis: was responsible for analyzing garbage for any suspect western foods and/or materials.\nFelix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment: the armed force at disposal of the ministry, named for the founder of the Cheka, the Bolshevik secret police. The members of this regiment, who served at least three years, were responsible for protecting high government and party buildings and personnel. The regiment was composed of six motorized rifle battalions, one artillery battalion, and one training battalion. Its equipment included PSZH-IV armored personnel carriers, 120 mm mortars, 85 mm and 100 mm antitank guns, ZU-23 antiaircraft guns, and helicopters. A Swiss source reported in 1986 that the troops of the Ministry of State Security also had commando units similar to the Soviet Union's Spetsnaz GRU forces. These East German units were said to wear the uniform of the airborne troops, although with the violet collar patch of the Ministry for State Security rather than the orange one of paratroopers. They also wore the sleeve stripe of the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment.\nGuard and Security Unit (Wach- und Sicherungseinheit (WSE)) each of the 15 district departments had its own GSU, directly subordinated to the district department chief. The manpower of the units ranged roughly between 200 and 400 men. They had four roles - security of the Stasi headquarters in the district, combat training of personnel of the district department, initial posting for newly appointed Stasi officers for a couple of years until their careers advance to specialized positions and (most importantly) Quick Reaction Alert tactical intervention units. As such the GSUs were armed and equipped as motor rifle units with APCs, automatic rifles, grenade launchers etc.\nHVA: focused its efforts primarily on West Germany and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but it also operated East German intelligence in all foreign countries.\nMain Administration for Struggle Against Suspicious Persons was charged with the surveillance of foreigners\u2014particularly from the West\u2014legally traveling or residing within the country. This included the diplomatic community, tourists, and official guests.\nMain Coordinating Administration of the Ministry for State Security: coordinated its work with Soviet intelligence agencies.\nMain Department for Communications Security and Personnel Protection: provided personal security for the national leadership and maintained and operated an internal secure communications system for the government.\nPenal System: to facilitate its mission of enforcing the political security of East Germany, the Stasi operated its own penal system, distinct from that of the Ministry of the Interior. This system comprised prison camps for political, as opposed to criminal, offenders.\n\n\n== Operations ==\n\n\n=== Personnel and recruitment ===\n\nBetween 1950 and 1989, the Stasi employed a total of 274,000 people in an effort to root out the class enemy. In 1989, the Stasi employed 91,015 people full-time, including 2,000 fully employed unofficial collaborators, 13,073 soldiers and 2,232 officers of GDR army, along with 173,081 unofficial informants inside GDR and 1,553 informants in West Germany.Regular commissioned Stasi officers were recruited from conscripts who had been honourably discharged from their 18 months' compulsory military service, had been members of the SED, had had a high level of participation in the Party's youth wing's activities and had been Stasi informers during their service in the Military. The candidates would then have to be recommended by their military unit political officers and Stasi agents, the local chiefs of the District (Bezirk) Stasi and Volkspolizei office, of the district in which they were permanently resident, and the District Secretary of the SED. These candidates were then made to sit through several tests and exams, which identified their intellectual capacity to be an officer, and their political reliability. University graduates who had completed their military service did not need to take these tests and exams. They then attended a two-year officer training programme at the Stasi college (Hochschule) in Potsdam. Less mentally and academically endowed candidates were made ordinary technicians and attended a one-year technology-intensive course for non-commissioned officers.\nBy 1995, some 174,000 inoffizielle Mitarbeiter (IMs) Stasi informants had been identified, almost 2.5% of East Germany's population between the ages of 18 and 60. 10,000 IMs were under 18 years of age. From the volume of material destroyed in the final days of the regime, the office of the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records (BStU) believes that there could have been as many as 500,000 informers. A former Stasi colonel who served in the counterintelligence directorate estimated that the figure could be as high as 2 million if occasional informants were included. There is significant debate about how many IMs were actually employed.\n\n\n=== Infiltration ===\nFull-time officers were posted to all major industrial plants (the extensiveness of any surveillance largely depended on how valuable a product was to the economy) and one tenant in every apartment building was designated as a watchdog reporting to an area representative of the Volkspolizei (Vopo). Spies reported every relative or friend who stayed the night at another's apartment. Tiny holes were drilled in apartment and hotel room walls through which Stasi agents filmed citizens with special video cameras. Schools, universities, and hospitals were extensively infiltrated, as were organizations, such as computer clubs where teenagers exchanged Western video games.The Stasi had formal categorizations of each type of informant, and had official guidelines on how to extract information from, and control, those with whom they came into contact. The roles of informants ranged from those already in some way involved in state security (such as the police and the armed services) to those in the dissident movements (such as in the arts and the Protestant Church). Information gathered about the latter groups was frequently used to divide or discredit members. Informants were made to feel important, given material or social incentives, and were imbued with a sense of adventure, and only around 7.7%, according to official figures, were coerced into cooperating. A significant proportion of those informing were members of the SED; to employ some form of blackmail, however, was not uncommon. A large number of Stasi informants were tram conductors, janitors, doctors, nurses and teachers; Mielke believed that the best informants were those whose jobs entailed frequent contact with the public.The Stasi's ranks swelled considerably after Eastern Bloc countries signed the 1975 Helsinki accords, which GDR leader Erich Honecker viewed as a grave threat to his regime because they contained language binding signatories to respect \"human and basic rights, including freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and conviction\". The number of IMs peaked at around 180,000 in that year, having slowly risen from 20,000\u201330,000 in the early 1950s, and reaching 100,000 for the first time in 1968, in response to Ostpolitik and protests worldwide. The Stasi also acted as a proxy for KGB to conduct activities in other Eastern Bloc countries, such as Poland, where the Soviets were despised.The Stasi infiltrated almost every aspect of GDR life. In the mid-1980s, a network of IMs began growing in both German states; by the time that East Germany collapsed in 1989, the Stasi employed 91,015 employees and 173,081 informants. About one out of every 63 East Germans collaborated with the Stasi. By at least one estimate, the Stasi maintained greater surveillance over its own people than any secret police force in history. The Stasi employed one secret policeman for every 166 East Germans; by comparison, the Gestapo deployed one secret policeman per 2,000 people. As ubiquitous as this was, the ratios swelled when informers were factored in: counting part-time informers, the Stasi had one agent per 6.5 people. This comparison led Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal to call the Stasi even more oppressive than the Gestapo. Stasi agents infiltrated and undermined West Germany's government and spy agencies.In some cases, spouses even spied on each other. A high-profile example of this was peace activist Vera Lengsfeld, whose husband, Knud Wollenberger, was a Stasi informant.\n\n\n=== Zersetzung ===\n\nThe Stasi perfected the technique of psychological harassment of perceived enemies known as Zersetzung (pronounced [\u02a6\u025b\u0250\u032f\u02c8z\u025bts\u028a\u014b]) \u2013 a term borrowed from chemistry which literally means \"decomposition\".\n\nBy the 1970s, the Stasi had decided that the methods of overt persecution that had been employed up to that time, such as arrest and torture, were too crude and obvious. It was realised that psychological harassment was far less likely to be recognised for what it was, so its victims, and their supporters, were less likely to be provoked into active resistance, given that they would often not be aware of the source of their problems, or even its exact nature. Zersetzung was designed to side-track and \"switch off\" perceived enemies so that they would lose the will to continue any \"inappropriate\" activities.\nTactics employed under Zersetzung generally involved the disruption of the victim's private or family life. This often included psychological attacks, such as breaking into homes and subtly manipulating the contents, in a form of gaslighting \u2013 moving furniture, altering the timing of an alarm, removing pictures from walls or replacing one variety of tea with another. Other practices included property damage, sabotage of cars, purposely incorrect medical treatment, smear campaigns including sending falsified compromising photos or documents to the victim's family, denunciation, provocation, psychological warfare, psychological subversion, wiretapping, bugging, mysterious phone calls or unnecessary deliveries, even including sending a vibrator to a target's wife. Usually, victims had no idea that the Stasi were responsible. Many thought that they were losing their minds, and mental breakdowns and suicide could result.\nOne great advantage of the harassment perpetrated under Zersetzung was that its subtle nature meant that it was able to be plausibly denied. This was important given that the GDR was trying to improve its international standing during the 1970s and 80s, especially in conjunction with the Ostpolitik of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt massively improving relations between the two German states.\n\n\n== International operations ==\n\nAfter German reunification, revelations of the Stasi's international activities were publicized, such as its military training of the West German Red Army Faction.\n\n\n=== Examples ===\nStasi experts helped to build the secret police organization of Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia.\nFidel Castro's regime in Cuba was particularly interested in receiving training from the Stasi. Stasi instructors worked in Cuba and Cuban communists received training in East Germany. The Stasi chief Markus Wolf described how he set up the Cuban system on the pattern of the East German system.\nStasi officers helped in initial training and indoctrination of Egyptian State Security organizations under the Nasser regime from 1957\u201358 onwards. This was discontinued by Anwar Sadat in 1976.\nThe Stasi's experts worked with building secret police systems in the People's Republic of Angola, the People's Republic of Mozambique, and the People's Republic of Yemen (South Yemen).\nThe Stasi organized and extensively trained Syrian intelligence services under the regime of Hafez al-Assad and Ba'ath Party from 1966 onwards and especially from 1973.\nStasi experts helped to set up Idi Amin's secret police.\nStasi experts helped the President of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, to set up his secret police. When Nkrumah was ousted by a military coup, Stasi Major J\u00fcrgen Rogalla was imprisoned.\nThe Stasi sent agents to the West as sleeper agents. For instance, sleeper agent G\u00fcnter Guillaume became a senior aide to social democratic chancellor Willy Brandt, and reported about his politics and private life.\nThe Stasi operated at least one brothel. Agents were used against both men and women working in Western governments. \"Entrapment\" was used against married men and homosexuals.\nMartin Schlaff \u2013 According to the German parliament's investigations, the Austrian billionaire's Stasi codename was \"Landgraf\" and registration number \"3886-86\". He made money by supplying embargoed goods to East Germany.\nSokratis Kokkalis \u2013 Stasi documents suggest that the Greek businessman was a Stasi agent, whose operations included delivering Western technological secrets and bribing Greek officials to buy outdated East German telecom equipment.\nRed Army Faction (Baader-Meinhof Group)\u2014A terrorist organization which killed dozens of West Germans and others, which received financial and logistical support from the Stasi, as well as shelter and new identities.\nThe Stasi ordered a campaign in which cemeteries and other Jewish sites in West Germany were smeared with swastikas and other Nazi symbols. Funds were channelled to a small West German group for it to defend Adolf Eichmann.\nThe Stasi channelled large amounts of money to Neo-Nazi groups in West, with the purpose of discrediting the West.\nThe Stasi allowed the wanted West German Neo-Nazi Odfried Hepp to hide in East Germany and then provided him with a new identity so that he could live in the Middle East.\nThe Stasi worked in a campaign to create extensive material and propaganda against Israel.\nMurder of Benno Ohnesorg \u2013 A Stasi informant in the West Berlin police, Karl-Heinz Kurras, fatally shot an unarmed demonstrator, which stirred a whole movement of Marxist radicalism, protest, and terrorist violence. The Economist describes it as \"the gunshot that hoaxed a generation\". The surviving Stasi Records contain no evidence that Kurras was acting under their orders when he shot Ohnesorg.\nOperation Infektion\u2014The Stasi helped the KGB to spread HIV/AIDS disinformation that the United States had created the disease. Millions of people around the world still believe in these claims.\nSandoz chemical spill\u2014The KGB reportedly ordered the Stasi to sabotage the chemical factory to distract attention from the Chernobyl disaster six months earlier in Ukraine.\nInvestigators have found evidence of a death squad that carried out a number of assassinations (including assassination of Swedish journalist Cats Falck) on orders from the East German government from 1976 to 1987. Attempts to prosecute members failed.\nThe Stasi attempted to assassinate Wolfgang Welsch, a famous critic of the regime. Stasi collaborator Peter Haack (Stasi codename \"Alfons\") befriended Welsch and then fed him hamburgers poisoned with thallium. It took weeks for doctors to find out why Welsch had suddenly lost his hair.\nDocuments in the Stasi archives state that the KGB ordered Bulgarian agents to assassinate Pope John Paul II, who was known for his criticism of human rights in the Communist bloc, and the Stasi was asked to help with covering up traces.\nA special unit of the Stasi assisted Romanian intelligence in kidnapping Romanian dissident Oliviu Beldeanu from West Germany.\nThe Stasi in 1972 made plans to assist the Vietnam People's Public Security in improving its intelligence work during the Vietnam War.\nIn 1975, the Stasi recorded a conversation between senior West German CDU politicians Helmut Kohl and Kurt Biedenkopf. It was then \"leaked\" to the Stern magazine as a transcript recorded by American intelligence. The magazine then claimed that Americans were wiretapping West Germans and the public believed the story.\n\n\n== Fall of the Soviet Union ==\nRecruitment of informants became increasingly difficult towards the end of the GDR's existence, and, after 1986, there was a negative turnover rate of IMs. This had a significant impact on the Stasi's ability to survey the population, in a period of growing unrest, and knowledge of the Stasi's activities became more widespread. Stasi had been tasked during this period with preventing the country's economic difficulties becoming a political problem, through suppression of the very worst problems the state faced, but it failed to do so.Stasi officers reportedly had discussed re-branding East Germany as a democratic capitalist country to the West, but which in practice would have been taken over by Stasi officers. The plan specified 2,587 OibE officers (Offiziere im besonderen Einsatz, \"officers on special assignment\") who would have assumed power as detailed in the Top Secret Document 0008-6/86 of 17 March 1986. According to Ion Mihai Pacepa, the chief intelligence officer in communist Romania, other communist intelligence services had similar plans. On 12 March 1990, Der Spiegel reported that the Stasi was indeed attempting to implement 0008-6/86. Pacepa has noted that what happened in Russia and how KGB Colonel Vladimir Putin took over Russia resembles these plans. See Putinism.\nOn 7 November 1989, in response to the rapidly changing political and social situation in the GDR in late 1989, Erich Mielke resigned. On 17 November 1989, the Council of Ministers (Ministerrat der DDR) renamed the Stasi the \"Office for National Security\" (Amt f\u00fcr Nationale Sicherheit \u2013 AfNS), which was headed by Generalleutnant Wolfgang Schwanitz. On 8 December 1989, GDR Prime Minister Hans Modrow directed the dissolution of the AfNS, which was confirmed by a decision of the Ministerrat on 14 December 1989.\nAs part of this decision, the Ministerrat originally called for the evolution of the AfNS into two separate organizations: a new foreign intelligence service (Nachrichtendienst der DDR) and an \"Office for the Protection of the Constitution of the GDR\" (Verfassungsschutz der DDR), along the lines of the West German Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz, however, the public reaction was extremely negative, and under pressure from the \"Round Table\" (Runder Tisch), the government dropped the creation of the Verfassungsschutz der DDR and directed the immediate dissolution of the AfNS on 13 January 1990. Certain functions of the AfNS reasonably related to law enforcement were handed over to the GDR Ministry of Internal Affairs. The same ministry also took guardianship of remaining AfNS facilities.\nWhen the parliament of Germany investigated public funds that disappeared after the Fall of the Berlin Wall, it found out that East Germany had transferred large amounts of money to Martin Schlaff through accounts in Vaduz, the capital of Liechtenstein, in return for goods \"under Western embargo\".\nMoreover, high-ranking Stasi officers continued their post-GDR careers in management positions in Schlaff's group of companies. For example, in 1990, Herbert Kohler, Stasi commander in Dresden, transferred 170 million marks to Schlaff for \"harddisks\" and months later went to work for him.\nThe investigations concluded that \"Schlaff's empire of companies played a crucial role\" in the Stasi attempts to secure the financial future of Stasi agents and keep the intelligence network alive.\nThe Stern magazine noted that KGB officer (and future Russian President) Vladimir Putin worked with his Stasi colleagues in Dresden in 1989.\n\n\n== Recovery of Stasi files ==\nDuring the Peaceful Revolution of 1989, Stasi offices and prisons throughout the country were occupied by citizens, but not before the Stasi destroyed a number of documents (approximately 5%) consisting of, by one calculation, 1 billion sheets of paper.\n\n\n=== Storming the Stasi headquarters ===\n\nWith the fall of the GDR the Stasi was dissolved. Stasi employees began to destroy the extensive files and documents they held, by hand, fire and with the use of shredders. When these activities became known, a protest began in front of the Stasi headquarters, The evening of 15 January 1990 saw a large crowd form outside the gates calling for a stop to the destruction of sensitive files. The building contained vast records of personal files, many of which would form important evidence in convicting those who had committed crimes for the Stasi. The protesters continued to grow in number until they were able to overcome the police and gain entry into the complex. Once inside, specific targets of the protesters' anger were portraits of Erich Honecker and Erich Mielke which were trampled on or burnt. Among the protesters were former Stasi collaborators seeking to destroy incriminating documents.\n\n\n=== Controversy of the Stasi files ===\nWith the German reunification on 3 October 1990, a new government agency was founded called the Federal Commissioner for the Records of the State Security Service of the former German Democratic Republic (German: Der Bundesbeauftragte f\u00fcr die Unterlagen des Staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen Deutschen Demokratischen Republik), officially abbreviated \"BStU\". There was a debate about what should happen to the files, whether they should be opened to the people or kept closed.\nThose who opposed opening the files cited privacy as a reason. They felt that the information in the files would lead to negative feelings about former Stasi members, and, in turn, cause violence. Pastor Rainer Eppelmann, who became Minister of Defense and Disarmament after March 1990, felt that new political freedoms for former Stasi members would be jeopardized by acts of revenge. Prime Minister Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re even went so far as to predict murder. They also argued against the use of the files to capture former Stasi members and prosecute them, arguing that not all former members were criminals and should not be punished solely for being a member. There were also some who believed that everyone was guilty of something. Peter-Michael Diestel, the Minister of Interior, opined that these files could not be used to determine innocence and guilt, claiming that \"there were only two types of individuals who were truly innocent in this system, the newborn and the alcoholic\". Other opinions, such as the one of West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, believed in putting the Stasi behind them and working on German reunification.\n\nOthers argued that everyone should have the right to see their own file, and that the files should be opened to investigate former Stasi members and prosecute them, as well as not allow them to hold office. Opening the files would also help clear up some of the rumors that were currently circulating. Some also believed that politicians involved with the Stasi should be investigated.\nThe fate of the files was finally decided under the Unification Treaty between the GDR and West Germany. This treaty took the Volkskammer law further and allowed more access and use of the files. Along with the decision to keep the files in a central location in the East, they also decided who could see and use the files, allowing people to see their own files.\nIn 1992, following a declassification ruling by the German government, the Stasi files were opened, leading people to look for their files. Timothy Garton Ash, an English historian, after reading his file, wrote The File: A Personal History.Between 1991 and 2011, around 2.75 million individuals, mostly GDR citizens, requested to see their own files. The ruling also gave people the ability to make duplicates of their documents. Another big issue was how the media could use and benefit from the documents. It was decided that the media could obtain files as long as they were depersonalized and not regarding an individual under the age of 18 or a former Stasi member. This ruling not only gave the media access to the files, but also gave schools access.\n\n\n=== Tracking down former Stasi informers with the files ===\nEven though groups of this sort were active in the community, those who were tracking down ex-members were, as well. Many of these hunters succeeded in catching ex-Stasi; however, charges could not be made for merely being a member. The person in question would have to have participated in an illegal act, not just be a registered Stasi member. Among the high-profile individuals who were arrested and tried were Erich Mielke, Third Minister of State Security of the GDR, and Erich Honecker, head of state for the GDR. Mielke was sentenced to six years prison for the murder of two policemen in 1931. Honecker was charged with authorizing the killing of would-be escapees on the east\u2013west frontier and the Berlin Wall. During his trial, he went through cancer treatment. Because he was nearing death, Honecker was allowed to spend his final time in freedom. He died in Chile in May 1994.\n\n\n=== Reassembling the destroyed files ===\nReassembling the destroyed files has been relatively easy due to the number of archives and the failure of shredding machines (in some cases \"shredding\" meant tearing paper in two by hand and documents could be recovered easily). In 1995, the BStU began reassembling the shredded documents; 13 years later, the three dozen archivists commissioned to the projects had only reassembled 327 bags; they are now using computer-assisted data recovery to reassemble the remaining 16,000 bags \u2013 estimated at 45 million pages. It is estimated that this task may be completed at a cost of 30 million dollars.The CIA acquired some Stasi records during the looting of the Stasi's archives. West Germany asked for their return and received some in April 2000. See also Rosenholz files.\n\n\n== Museums ==\n\nThere a number of memorial sites and museums relating to the Stasi in former Stasi prisons and administration buildings. In addition, offices of the Stasi Records Agency in Berlin, Dresden, Erfurt, Frankfurt-an-der-Oder and Halle (Saale) all have permanent and changing exhibitions relating to the activities of the Stasi in their region.\n\n\n=== Berlin ===\nStasi Museum (Berlin) -  This is located at Ruschestra\u00dfe 103, in  \"Haus 1\" on the former Stasi headquarters compound. The office of Erich Mielke, the head of the Stasi, was in this building and it has been preserved along with a number of other rooms. The building was occupied by protesters on 15 January 1990. On 7 November 1990, a Research Centre and Memorial was opened, which now called the Stasi Museum.\nBerlin-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen Memorial - A memorial to repression during both the Soviet occupation and GDR era in a former prison that was used by both regimes. The building was a Soviet prison from 1946, and from 1951 until 1989 it was a Stasi remand centre. It officially closed on 3 October 1990, the day of German reunification. The museum and memorial site opened in 1994. It is in Alt-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen, in Lichtenberg in north-east Berlin.\n\n\n=== Erfurt ===\n\nMemorial and Education Centre Andreasstrasse - a museum in Erfurt which is housed in a former Stasi remand prison. From 1952 until 1989, over 5000 political prisoners were held on remand and interrogated in the Andreasstrasse prison, which was one of 17 Stasi remand prisons in the GDR. On 4 December 1989, local citizens occupied the prison and the neighbouring Stasi district headquarters to stop the mass destruction of Stasi files. It was the first time East Germans had undertaken such resistance against the Stasi and it instigated the take over of Stasi buildings throughout the country.\n\n\n=== Dresden ===\n\nGedenkst\u00e4tte Bautzner Stra\u00dfe Dresden (The Bautzner Strasse Memorial in Dresden) - A Stasi remand prison and the Stasi's regional head office in Dresden. It was used as a prison by the Soviet occupying forces from 1945 to 1953, and from 1953 to 1989 by the Stasi. The Stasi held and interrogated between 12,000 and 15,000 people during the time they used the prison. The building was originally a 19th-century paper mill. It was converted into a block of flats in 1933 before being confiscated by the Soviet army in 1945. The Stasi prison and offices were occupied by local citizens on 5 December 1989, during a wave of such takeovers across the country. The museum and memorial site was opened to the public in 1994.\n\n\n=== Frankfurt-an-der-Oder ===\nRemembrance and Documentation Centre for \"Victims of political tyranny\" - A memorial and museum at Collegienstra\u00dfe 10 in Frankfurt-an-der-Oder, in  a building that was used as a detention centre by the Gestapo, the Soviet occupying forces and the Stasi. The building was the Stasi district offices and a remand prison from 1950 until 1969, after which the Volkspolizei used the prison. From 1950 to 1952 it was an execution site where 12 people sentenced to death were executed. The prison closed in 1990. It has been a cultural centre and a memorial to the victims of political tyranny since June 1994, managed by the Museum Viadrina.\n\n\n=== Gera ===\nGedenkst\u00e4tte Amthordurchgang, a memorial and 'centre of encounter' in Gera in a former remand prison, originally opened in 1874, that was used by the Gestapo from 1933-1945, the Soviet occupying forces from 1945 to 1949, and from 1952 to 1989 by the Stasi. The building was also the district offices of the Stasi administration. Between 1952 and 1989 over 2,800 people were held in the prison on political grounds. The memorial site opened with the official name \"Die Gedenk- und Begegnungsst\u00e4tte im Torhaus der politischen Haftanstalt von 1933 bis 1945 und 1945 bis 1989\" in November 2005.\n\n\n=== Halle (Saale) ===\nThe Roter Ochse (Red Ox) is a museum and memorial site at the prison at Am Kirchtor 20,  Halle (Saale). Part of the prison, built 1842, was used by the Stasi from 1950 until 1989, during with time over 9,000 political prisoners were held in the prison. From 1954 it was mainly used for women prisoners. The name \"Roter Ochse\" is the informal name of the prison, possibly originating in the 19th century from the colour of the external walls. It still operates as a prison for young people. Since 1996, the building which was used as an interrogation centre by the Stasi and an execution site by the Nazis has been a museum and memorial centre for victims of political persecution.\n\n\n=== Leipzig ===\n\nGedenkst\u00e4tte Museum in der \u201eRunden Ecke\u201c (Memorial Museum in the \"Round Corner\") - The former Stasi district headquarters on am Dittrichring is now a museum focusing on the history and activities of the organisation. It is named after the curved shape of the front of the building. The Stasi used the building from 1950 until 1989. On the evening of 4 December 1989, it was occupied by protesters in order to stop the destruction of Stasi files. There has been a permanent exhibition on the site since 1990. The building also houses the Leipzig branch of the Stasi Records Agency, which holds about 10 km of files on its shelves.\nStasi-Bunker L\u00fcbsch\u00fctzer Teiche (Stasi Bunker Museum) - The Stasi Bunker Museum is in Machern, a village about 30 km from Leipzig. It is managed by the Runde Ecke Museum administration. The bunker was built from 1968 to 1972, as a fallout shelter for the staff of the Stasi's Leipzig administration in case of a nuclear attack. It could accommodate about 120 people. The bunker, which was disguised as a holiday resort on 5.2 hectares of land, was only discovered in December in 1989. It is completely preserved in its original state. \"The emergency command centre was a secretly-created complex, designed to maintain the Stasi leadership's hold on power, even in exceptional circumstances.\" The whole grounds are classified as a historic monument and are open to the public on the last weekend of every month, and for pre-arranged group tours at other times.\nGDR Execution site - The execution site at Alfred-K\u00e4stner-Stra\u00dfe in south Leipzig, was the central site in East Germany where the death penalty was carried out from 1960 until 1981. It remains in its original condition. The management of the \"Runde Ecke\" Museum opens the site once a year on \"Museum night\" and on special state-wide days when historic buildings and sites that are not normally accessible to the public are opened.\n\n\n=== Magdeburg ===\nGedenkst\u00e4tte Moritzplatz Magdeburg - The memorial site at Mortzplatz in Magdeburg is a museum on the site of a former prison, built from 1873-1876, that was used by the Soviet administration from 1945-1949 and the Stasi from 1958 until 1989 to hold political prisoners. Between 1950 and 1958 the Stasi shared another prison with the civil police. The prison at Moritzplatz was used by the Volkspolizei from 1952 until 1958. Between 1945 and 1989, more than 10,000 political prisoners were held in the prison. The memorial site and museum was founded in December 1990.\n\n\n=== Potsdam ===\n\nGedenkst\u00e4tte Lindenstra\u00dfe The memorial site and museum at Lindenstra\u00dfe 54/55 in Potsdam, examines political persecution in the Nazi, Soviet occupation and GDR eras. The original building was built 1733-1737 as a baroque palace; it became a court and prison in 1820. From 1933, the Nazi regime held political prisoners there, many of whom were arrested for racial reasons, for example Jews who refused to wear the yellow star on their clothing.The Soviet administration took over the prison in 1945, also using it as a prison for holding political prisoners on remand. The Stasi then used it as a remand prison, mainly for political prisoners from 1952 until 1989. Over 6,000 people were held in the prison by the Stasi during that time. On 27 October 1989, the prison freed all political prisoners due to a nationwide amnesty. On 5 December 1989, the Stasi Headquarters in Potsdam and the Lindenstrasse Prison were occupied by protesters. From January 1990 the building was used as offices for various citizens initiatives and new political groups, such as the Neue Forum. The building was opened to the public from 20 January 1990 and people were taken on tours of the site. It officially became a Memorial site in 1995.\n\n\n=== Rostock ===\nDocumentation Centre and Memorial site, former Stasi remand prison, Rostock - The memorial site is in a former Stasi remand prison at Hermanstrasse 34b. It is on what was part of a Stasi compound in Rostock, where its district headquarters were also located. Most of the site is now used by the Rostock county court and the University of Rostock. The complex was built 1958-1960. The remand prison was used by the Stasi from 1960 until 1989. About 4,900 people were held in the prison during that time, most of them were political prisoners. Most of prisoners were released after an amnesty issued on 27 October 1989. The Stasi prison in the Rostock compound was occupied by protesters on 4 December 1989 following a wave of such occupation across East Germany starting in Erfurt on the same day.The prison closed in the early 1990s. The state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern took ownership of it in 1998, and the memorial site and museum were established in 1999. An extensive restoration of the site began in December 2018.\n\n\n== Stasi officers after the reunification ==\n\n\n=== Recruitment by Russian state-owned companies ===\nFormer Stasi agent Matthias Warnig (codename \"Arthur\") is currently the CEO of Nord Stream.\nGerman investigations have revealed that some of the key Gazprom Germania managers are former Stasi agents.\n\n\n=== Lobbying ===\nFormer Stasi officers continue to be politically active via the Gesellschaft zur Rechtlichen und Humanit\u00e4ren Unterst\u00fctzung (GRH, Society for Legal and Humanitarian Support). Former high-ranking officers and employees of the Stasi, including the last Stasi director, Wolfgang Schwanitz, make up the majority of the organization's members, and it receives support from the German Communist Party, among others.\nImpetus for the establishment of the GRH was provided by the criminal charges filed against the Stasi in the early 1990s. The GRH, decrying the charges as \"victor's justice\", called for them to be dropped. Today the group provides an alternative if somewhat utopian voice in the public debate on the GDR legacy. It calls for the closure of the Berlin-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen Memorial and can be a vocal presence at memorial services and public events. In March 2006 in Berlin, GRH members disrupted a museum event; a political scandal ensued when the Berlin Senator (Minister) of Culture refused to confront them.Behind the scenes, the GRH also lobbies people and institutions promoting opposing viewpoints. For example, in March 2006, the Berlin Senator for Education received a letter from a GRH member and former Stasi officer attacking the Museum for promoting \"falsehoods, anticommunist agitation and psychological terror against minors\". Similar letters have also been received by schools organizing field trips to the museum.\n\n\n== Stasi agents ==\nChristel Boom\nGabriele Gast\nG\u00fcnter Guillaume\nKarl-Heinz Kurras\nLilli P\u00f6ttrich\nRainer Rupp\nHans Sommer\nWerner Teske\n\n\n== Alleged informants ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nBarkas (van manufacturer)\nDeutschland 83 and Deutschland 86\nFelix Dzerzhinsky Watch Regiment\nStasi Records Agency\nStasiland\nThe Lives of Others, movie centered on the Stasi\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBlumenau, Bernhard. \u2018Unholy Alliance: The Connection between the East German Stasi and the Right-Wing Terrorist Odfried Hepp\u2019.

          "Very informative but thought we would have seen more... you have to take your time to read all the information. It was terrible what they had to live through. Zero privacy",
          "Much like the museum in der runden ecke in Leipzig (not to be confused with the bunker for which this review is for, this is recommended for anyone who takes an interest in this era. But if you're not an German speaker, you need to manage your expectations. The museum do",
          "Small and very flew of the material exhibited was described in English. Go to the contemporary history forum instead",
          "This museum is well worth the visit especially if you lived during that time span. The admission was free but if you want a recorded English guide it will cost you 5 euros (well worth it). It is real and accurate history. Nothing is sugar coated. You'll learn all of the methods",
          "Visiting this museum with a local whose family was affected by the Stasi policies was a real eye opener. A really interesting insight into how the Stasi infiltrated different families and communities across Germany.",
          "Well, we wnet to the Stasi museum 'an der ecke' and thought we'd visit the bunker too. it's a way out of town, so we took an S-Bahn and then hiked the rest of the way. (5km?). it's located at the edge of a holiday park, which was its 'cover' during the cold war years. it's",
          "Really interesting to go see some of the historical past where communist party was able to brain wash and torture its own citizens. Really disturbing, but a must!",
          "This museum is a must for people who are interested in seeing something of the remains of a very dark period in the history of Germany, to say the least. Not having to do with the Holocaust directly, this post.war bunker gives insight into pretty nasty methods and behaviour,",

          "It is not the best place to learn and understand the East German suppression methods of their secret service (Stasi- Ministerium fuer Staatssicherheit). There is some technical stuff in a bunker, quite far from the clty of Leipzig. The real important historic places for that",

          "As another reviewer said, if you can't speak German then use an audio-guide. You can get a little A4 thing in English, but it's very scanty. I didn't see any human guides. The most striking aspect of the museum is its reality. This isn't a re-creation. It's the real thing, the",

        "wiki": "Merseburg ([\u02c8m\u025b\u0250z\u0259b\u028ark]) is a town in the south of the German state of Saxony-Anhalt on the river Saale, approx. 14 km south of Halle (Saale) and 30 km west of Leipzig. It is the capital of the Saalekreis district. It had a diocese founded by Archbishop Adalbert of Magdeburg.\nThe University of Merseburg is located within the town. Merseburg has around 33,000 inhabitants. Merseburg is part of the Central German Metropolitan Region.\n\n\n== Names ==\nCzech: Merseburk, Mezibo\u0159\nFrench: Mersebourg\nGerman: Merseburg\nLatin: Merseburga\nPolish: Mi\u0119dzyb\u00f3rz\nSorbian languages: Mjezybor\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Administrative reforms ===\nVenenien was incorporated into Merseburg on 1 January 1949. The parish K\u00f6tzschen followed on 1 July 1950. Since 30 May 1994, Meuschau is part of Merseburg. Trebnitz followed later. Beuna was annexed on 1 January 2009. Geusa is a part of Merseburg since 1 January 2010.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-history and Middle Ages ===\nMerseburg was first mentioned in 850. King Henry the Fowler built a royal palace at Merseburg; in the 933 Battle of Riade, he gained his great victory over the Hungarians in the vicinity.\nThietmar, appointed in 973, became the first bishop of the newly created bishopric of Prague in Bohemia. Prague had been part of the archbishopric of Mainz for a hundred years before that. From 968 until the Protestant Reformation, Merseburg was the seat of the Bishop of Merseburg, and in addition to being for a time the residence of the margraves of Meissen, it was a favorite residence of the German kings during the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries. Fifteen diets were held here during the Middle Ages, during which time its fairs enjoyed the importance which was afterwards transferred to those of Leipzig. Merseburg was the site of a failed assassination attempt on Polish ruler Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry in 1002. The town suffered severely during the German Peasants' War and also during the Thirty Years' War.\n\n\n=== 17th century to 20th century ===\nFrom 1657 to 1738 Merseburg was the residence of the Dukes of Saxe-Merseburg, after which it fell to the Electorate of Saxony. In 1815 following the Napoleonic Wars, the town became part of the Prussian Province of Saxony.\nMerseburg is where the Merseburg Incantations were rediscovered in 1841. Written down in Old High German, they are hitherto the only preserved German documents with a heathen theme. One of them is a charm to release warriors caught during battle, and the other is a charm to heal a horse's sprained foot.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Merseburg was transformed into an industrial town, largely due to the pioneering work done by Carl Bosch and Friedrich Bergius, who laid down the scientific fundamentals of the catalytic high-pressure ammonia synthesis from 1909 to 1913. Enterprises, too, blazed a trail in the course of the transformational process. Ultimately, the nearby Leuna works emerged at the nearby town of Leuna, which continues to operate in the 21st century as a chemical production park that serves multiple international chemical companies.Merseburg was badly damaged in World War II. In 23 air raids 6,200 dwellings were completely or partly destroyed. The historic town centre was almost completely destroyed.\nBriefly part of Saxony-Anhalt after the war, it was then administered within the Bezirk Halle in East Germany. It became part of Saxony-Anhalt again after reunification of Germany.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nLike many towns in the former East Germany, Merseburg has had a general decline in population since German Reunification despite annexing and merging with a number of smaller nearby villages.\nPopulation of Merseburg (from 1960, population on 31 December, unless otherwise indicated):\n\nData source from 1990: Statistical Office of Saxony Anhalt\n1 29 October\n2 31 August\n3 3 October\n4 14 July 2008\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nAmong the notable buildings of Merseburg are the Merseburg Cathedral of St John the Baptist (founded 1015, rebuilt in the 13th and 16th centuries) and the episcopal palace (15th century). The cathedral-and-palace ensemble also features a palace garden (Schlossgarten).\nOther attractions include the Merseburg House of Trades with a cultural stage and the German Museum of Chemistry, Merseburg.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\nThe Merseburg Palace Festival with the Historical Pageant, the International Palace-Moat Concerts, Merseburg Organ Days and the Puppet Show Festival Week are events celebrated every year.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nMerseburg station is located on the Halle\u2013Bebra railway. Leipzig/Halle Airport is just 25 kilometers away.\nMerseburg is connected with the Halle (Saale) tramway network. A tram ride from Halle's city centre to Merseburg takes about 50 minutes.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nMerseburg is twinned with:\n Ch\u00e2tillon, France\n Genzano di Roma, Italy\n Bottrop, Germany\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nThietmar of Merseburg, bishop and chronist\nJohannes Knolleisen, (died 1511), theological professor\nErnst Haeckel, (1834-1919), biologist, philosopher, physician\nLucian M\u00fcller, classical scholar\nKlaus Tennstedt, (1926-1998), conductor\nElisabeth Schumann, singer\nKarl Adolph von Basedow, physician\nJawed Karim, (born 1979), YouTube co-founder\nSzymon Bogumi\u0142 Zug, architect and designer of gardens\nUwe Nolte, artist\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

        "wiki": "The Br\u00fchl (pronounced [b\u0281y\u02d0l] (listen)) is a street in Leipzig, Germany, just within the former city wall.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOn the corner of the Br\u00fchl and Katharinestrasse stands the Romanus house, built for the mayor of Leipzig between 1701 and 1704, and one of the finest baroque buildings remaining in the town.In the late 18th century and early 19th century,the Br\u00fchl was part of the Jewish quarter of the city. A synagogue was established in 1763, and Jews visiting the annual Leipzig Fair would lodge in the Br\u00fchl and the surrounding streets.\nThe Br\u00fchl retained Jewish connections into the 20th century. The street was a centre of the world fur trade. Chaim Eitingon, the Russian-born 'king of the fur trade', opened a branch there in 1893, and in the 1920s the street represented one-third of the world trade in furs. Only 4.2% of Leipzigers as a whole worked in the fur industry, but 8.7% of Jewish Leipzigers did. The Br\u00fchl was an emblem of Jewish economic activity in Leipzig, and of the city as a whole.\nIn 1938, under the Nazi government, 'the entire Br\u00fchl district changed hands, as fur firms \u2014 the pinnacle of Jewish commerce in the city, along with the department stores \u2014 were stolen from their owners.'Today the street contains a few 19th-century and early 20th-century buildings, most of the remaining buildings being from the third quarter of the 20th century. A notable modern building is the town's Museum der bildenden K\u00fcnste (Museum of the visual arts).\n\n\n== Wagner's birthplace ==\n\nIt was in the Br\u00fchl, in 1813, that the composer Richard Wagner was born at no. 3, the 'House of the Red and White Lions'. Ironically, Wagner's disciple Theodor Uhlig, in an 1850 essay which Wagner was later to build on for his own essay Das Judenthum in der Musik, condemned the music of Meyerbeer by linking it to the Jewish quarters of Leipzig and Dresden: 'If that is dramatic song, then Gluck, Mozart, Cherubini and Spontini carried out their studies at the Neumarkt in Dresden or the Br\u00fchl in Leipzig.' Wagner's birthplace was demolished in 1886, three years after his death, and the site was later occupied by a department store, built in 1968 to a design of the architect Harry M\u00fcller. \nThis building, which became disused in the 21st century, and a number of adjoining Plattenbauten,  were replaced by a shopping centre called \"H\u00f6fe am Br\u00fchl\", which opened in 2015. Part of the facade of the 1968 department store was retained and the new construction contains a memorial to the composer at the site of his birthplace.\nA parallel street to the Br\u00fchl is now named Richard-Wagner-Stra\u00dfe, and the square at the western end of the Br\u00fchl is named Richard-Wagner-Platz.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nRobert Allen Willingham II, Jews in Leipzig:Nationality and Community in the 20th Century, PhD dissertation, University of Texas, retrieved 19 April 2020\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "Leipzig (, also , , German: [\u02c8la\u026apts\u026a\u00e7] (listen);; Upper Saxon: Leibzsch) is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. With a population of 600,000 inhabitants as of 2019 (1.1 million residents in the larger urban zone), it is Germany's eighth most populous city as well as the second most populous city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin. Together with Halle (Saale), the largest city of the neighbouring state of Saxony-Anhalt, the city forms the polycentric conurbation of Leipzig-Halle. Between the two cities (in Schkeuditz) lies Leipzig/Halle International Airport.\nLeipzig is located about 160 kilometres (99 mi) southwest of Berlin in the Leipzig Bay, which constitutes the southernmost part of the North German Plain, at the confluence of the White Elster River (progression: Saale\u2192 Elbe\u2192 North Sea) and two of its tributaries: the Plei\u00dfe and the Parthe. The name of the city as well as the names of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.\nLeipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire. The city sits at the intersection of the Via Regia and the Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes. Leipzig was once one of the major European centres of learning and culture in fields such as music and publishing. After the  Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) Leipzig remained a major urban centre in East German terms, but its cultural and economic importance declined. Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy, which had come to depend on highly polluting heavy industry, severe unemployment, and urban blight. Starting around 2000, however, decline was first arrested and then reversed. Leipzig has undergone significant change with the restoration of major historical buildings, the demolition of derelict properties of little historical value, and the development of new industries and a modern transport infrastructure.Leipzig today is an economic centre, the most livable city in Germany, according to the GfK marketing research institution and has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, according to HWWI and Berenberg Bank. The city is one of two seats of the German National Library (together with Frankfurt), as well as the seat of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and ranks first in Germany and second in Europe according to Anthony Sheridan. Since the opening of the Leipzig City Tunnel in 2013, Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system. Leipzig is currently listed as a Gamma World City, Germany's \"Boomtown\" and as the European City of the Year 2019.Leipzig has long been a major centre for music, both classical as well as modern \"dark alternative music\" or darkwave genres. The Oper Leipzig is one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany. Leipzig is also home to the University of Music and Theatre \"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\". It was during a stay in this city that Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem \"Ode to Joy\". The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Johann Sebastian Bach is one among many major composers who lived and worked in Leipzig.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Name ===\n\nThe name Leipzig is derived from the Slavic word Lipsk, which means \"settlement where the linden trees (British English: lime trees; U.S. English: basswood trees) stand\". An older spelling of the name in English is Leipsic. The Latin name Lipsia was also used. The name is cognate with Lipetsk (\u041b\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043a) in Russia and Liep\u0101ja in Latvia.\n\nIn 1937 the Nazi government officially renamed the city Reichsmessestadt Leipzig (Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig).Since 1989 Leipzig has been informally dubbed \"Hero City\" (Heldenstadt), in recognition of the role that the Monday demonstrations there played in the fall of the East German regime \u2013 the name alludes to the honorary title awarded in the former Soviet Union to certain cities that played a key role in the victory of the Allies during the Second World War. The common usage of this nickname for Leipzig up until the present is reflected, for example, in the name of a blog for local arts and culture, Heldenstadt.de.More recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Boomtown of eastern Germany\", \"Hypezig\" or \"The better Berlin\" for being celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for the vital lifestyle and creative scene with many startups.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nLeipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as urbs Libzi (Chronikon VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by Otto the Rich. Leipzig Trade Fair, started in the Middle Ages, has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world.\nThere are records of commercial fishing operations on the river Plei\u00dfe in Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the Margrave Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.There were a number of monasteries in and around the city, including a Franciscan monastery after which the Barfu\u00dfg\u00e4\u00dfchen (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks (Jacobskirche, destroyed in 1544) near the present day Ranst\u00e4dter Steinweg (the old Via Regia).\nThe foundation of the University of Leipzig in 1409 initiated the city's development into a centre of German law and the publishing industry, and towards being the location of the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) and the German National Library (founded in 1912).\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, two battles took place in Breitenfeld, about 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) outside Leipzig city walls. The first Battle of Breitenfeld took place in 1631 and the second in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.\nOn 24 December 1701, an oil-fueled street lighting system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig between Napoleonic France and an allied coalition of Prussia, Russia, Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended Napoleon's presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on Elba. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.When it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the Royal Saxon State Railways and the western one for the Prussian state railways.\nIn the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German labor party, the General German Workers' Association (Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein, ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge Gr\u00fcnderzeit areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nWith the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei became the largest cotton mill company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Daily production surpassed 5 million kilograms of yarn.During the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to World War II. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.\nOn 22 May 1930, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was elected mayor of Leipzig. He was well known as an opponent of the Nazi regime. He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city's statue of Felix Mendelssohn. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue, one of the city's most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. Goerdeler was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.\n\nSeveral thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.\nBeginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the Gemeinde, a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.Like all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to aryanisation. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenh\u00e4user, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.As with other cities in Europe during the Holocaust, the Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the Nuremberg Laws. However, due to the Leipzig Trade Fair and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures. Shortly before Kristallnacht, Polish Jews living in the city were expelled.On 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the \"Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig\". In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in Zionism through Jewish citizens. Many of these Zionists attempted to flee before deportations began. On 28 October 1938, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of Polish Jews from Leipzig to Poland.On 9 November 1938, as part of Kristallnacht, in Gottschedstrasse (German: Gottschedstra\u00dfe), now a popular dining and nightlife area in Leipzig, synagogues and businesses were set on fire. Only a couple of days later, on 11 November 1938, many Jews in the Leipzig area were deported to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. As World War II came to an end, much of Leipzig was destroyed. Following the war, the Communist Party of Germany (German: Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, KPD) provided aid for the reconstruction of the city.In 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported. On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Theresienstadt Concentration Camp. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors. According to records of the Theresienstadt deportation, only 53 Jews survived.Until late 1943, there was little threat of aerial bombings to the city. However, on the morning of 4 December 1943, the British Royal Air Force dropped over 1,000 tons of explosives, resulting in the death of nearly 1,000 civilians. This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, the storm was too overwhelming for them. Unlike its neighbouring city of Dresden, this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.\nThe Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945. In April 1945 the SS Gruppehfuhrer/Mayor of Leipzig Bruno Erich Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter; the Deputy Mayor/Treasurer of Leipzig, Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter, and a Volkssturm Major Walter D\u00f6nicke committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.\nThe United States turned the city over to the Red Army as it pulled back from the line of contact with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city.In the mid-20th century, the city's trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the Comecon Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which East Germany was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the Monument to the Battle of the Nations.\nThe planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in (East) Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make bad worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in. Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.In October 1989, after prayers for peace at St. Nicholas Church, established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the Monday demonstrations started as the most prominent mass protest against the East German government. The reunification of Germany, however, was at first not good for Leipzig. The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city's speciality was, in terms of the advanced economy of  reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished. As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunificaiton, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.Starting in 2000, an ambitious (and subsequently much-praised) urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig's decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving as much as possible of the city's urban structure, especially its attractive historic center and various architectural gems, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nNowadays, Leipzig is an important economic center in Germany. Since the 2010s, the city has been celebrated by the media as a hip urban center with a very high quality of living. It is often called \"The new Berlin\". Leipzig is also Germany's fastest growing city. Leipzig was the German candidate for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful. After ten years of construction, the Leipzig City Tunnel opened on 14 December 2013. Leipzig forms the centerpiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system, which operates in the four German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nLeipzig lies at the confluence of the rivers White Elster, Plei\u00dfe and Parthe, in the Leipzig Bay, on the most southerly part of the North German Plain, which is the part of the North European Plain in Germany. The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the Leipzig Riverside Forest, though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat though there is also some evidence of moraine and drumlins.\nAlthough there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-cast mines in the region, many of which are being converted to use as lakes. Also see: Neuseenland\nLeipzig is also situated at the intersection of the ancient roads known as the Via Regia (King's highway), which traversed Germany in an east\u2013west direction, and the Via Imperii (Imperial Highway), a north\u2013south road.\nLeipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and the current \"ring\" road around the historic centre of the city follows the line of the old city walls.\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nSince 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten districts, which in turn contain a total of 63 subdistricts. Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.\n\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike many places located in Eastern parts of Germany, Leipzig has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb close to a Dfb [0 \u00b0C US isotherm]) with significant continental influences due to inland location. Winters are cool to cold, with an average of around 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F). Summers are generally warm, averaging at 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F) with daytime temperatures of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours a day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours a day).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nLeipzig has a population of about 570,000. In 1930, the population reached its historical peak of over 700,000. It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation. After almost doubling the city area by incorporation of surrounding towns in 1999, the number stabilised and started to rise again, with an increase of 1,000 in 2000. As of 2015, Leipzig is the fastest-growing city in Germany with over 500,000 inhabitants.\nThe growth of the past 10\u201315 years has mostly been due to inward migration. In recent years, inward migration accelerated, reaching an increase of 12,917 in 2014.In the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates. Births dropped from 7,000 in 1988 to less than 3,000 in 1994. However, the number of children born in Leipzig has risen since the late 1990s. In 2011, it reached 5,490 births resulting in a RNI of \u221217.7 (\u2212393.7 in 1995).The unemployment rate decreased from 18.2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2014 and 7.6% in June 2017.The percentage of the population from an immigrant background is low compared with other German cities. As of 2012, only 5.6% of the population were foreigners, compared to the German national average of 7.7%.The number of people with an immigrant background (immigrants and their children) grew from 49,323 in 2012 to 77,559 in 2016, making them 13.3% of the city's population (Leipzig's population 579,530 in 2016).The largest minorities (first and second generation) in Leipzig by country of origin as of 31.12.2018 are:\n\n\n== Culture, sights and cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe historic central area of Leipzig features a Renaissance-style ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several baroque period trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the historicist style representative of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig's flats are in buildings of this type. The new city hall, completed in 1905, is built in the same style.\nSome 64,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in Plattenbau buildings during Communist rule in East Germany. and although some of these have been demolished and the numbers living in this type of accommodation have declined in recent years, at least 10% of Leipzig's population (50,000 people) are still living in Plattenbau accommodation. Gr\u00fcnau, for example, has approximately 40,000 people living in this sort of accommodation.The St. Paul's Church was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called Paulinum, which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.\nMany commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings and structures ===\nThe tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk B\u00f6sdorf GmbH with a height of 205 metres (673 feet). With 142 metres (466 feet), the City-Hochhaus Leipzig is the tallest high-rise building in Leipzig. From 1972 to 1973 it was Germany's tallest building.\n\n\n=== Museums and the arts ===\nOne of the highlights of the city's contemporary arts was the Neo Rauch retrospective opening in April 2010 at the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts. This is a show devoted to the father of the New Leipzig School of artists. According to The New York Times, this scene \"has been the toast of the contemporary art world\" for the past decade. In addition, there are eleven galleries in the so-called Spinnerei.The Grassi Museum complex contains three more of Leipzig's major collections: the Ethnography Museum, Applied Arts Museum and Musical Instrument Museum (the last of which is run by the University of Leipzig). The university also runs the Museum of Antiquities.Founded in March 2015, the G2 Kunsthalle houses the Hildebrand Collection. This private collection focuses on the so-called New Leipzig School. Leipzig's first private museum dedicated to contemporary art in Leipzig after the turn of the millennium is located in the city centre close to the famous St. Thomas Church on the third floor of the former GDR processing centre.Other museums in Leipzig include the following:\n\nThe German Museum of Books and Writing is the world's oldest museum of its kind, founded in 1884.\nThe Egyptian Museum of the University of Leipzig comprises a collection of about 7,000 artefacts from several millennia.\nThe Schillerhaus is the house where Schiller lived in summer 1785.\nThe Zeitgeschichtliches Forum Leipzig (Forum of Contemporary History) shows the history of the German division and the everyday life in the socialist German Democratic Republic.\nNaturkundemuseum Leipzig is the city's natural history museum.\nThe Leipzig Panometer is a visual panorama displayed inside a former gasometer, accompanied by a thematic exhibition.\nThe \"Museum in der Runden Ecke\" is the best known museum in the city.

The composer Richard Wagner was born in Leipzig in 1813, in the Br\u00fchl. Robert Schumann was also active in Leipzig music, having been invited by Felix Mendelssohn when the latter established Germany's first musical conservatoire in the city in 1843. Gustav Mahler was second conductor (working under Artur Nikisch) at the Leipzig Opera from June 1886 until May 1888, and achieved his first significant recognition while there by completing and publishing Carl Maria von Weber's opera Die Drei Pintos. Mahler also completed his own 1st Symphony while living in Leipzig.\nToday the conservatory is the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig. A broad range of subjects are taught, including artistic and teacher training in all orchestral instruments, voice, interpretation, coaching, piano chamber music, orchestral conducting, choir conducting and musical composition in various musical styles. The drama departments teach acting and scriptwriting.\nThe Bach-Archiv Leipzig, an institution for the documentation and research of the life and work of Bach (and also of the Bach family), was founded in Leipzig in 1950 by Werner Neumann. The Bach-Archiv organizes the prestigious International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition, initiated in 1950 as part of a music festival marking the bicentennial of Bach's death. The competition is now held every two years in three changing categories. The Bach-Archiv also organizes performances, especially the international festival Bachfest Leipzig (de) and runs the Bach-Museum.\nThe city's musical tradition is also reflected in the worldwide fame of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, under its chief conductor Andris Nelsons, and the Thomanerchor.\nThe MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra is Leipzig's second largest symphony orchestra. Its current chief conductor is Kristjan J\u00e4rvi.

Leipzig has for twenty years been home to the world's largest Gothic festival, the annual Wave-Gotik-Treffen (WGT), where thousands of fans of gothic and dark styled music from across Europe and the world gather in the early summer. The first Wave Gotik Treffen was held at the Eiskeller club, today known as Conne Island, in the Connewitz district. Mayhem's notorious album Live in Leipzig was also recorded at the Eiskeller club. Leipzig Pop Up is an annual music trade fair for the independent music scene as well as a music festival taking place on Pentecost weekend.

The University of Leipzig attracts millions of euros of investment yearly and is in the middle of a massive construction and refurbishment to celebrate its 600th anniversary.\nLeipzig also benefits from world leading medical research (Leipzig Heart Centre) and a growing biotechnology industry.Many bars, restaurants and stores found in the downtown area are patronized by German and foreign tourists. Leipzig Hauptbahnhof itself is the location of a shopping mall. Leipzig is one of Germany's most visited cities with over 3 million overnight stays in 2017.In 2010, Leipzig was included in the top 10 cities to visit by The New York Times, and ranked 39th globally out of 289 cities for innovation in the 4th Innovation Cities Index published by Australian agency 2thinknow.

It provides programmes to various TV and radio networks and has its own symphony orchestra, choir and a ballet.\nLeipziger Volkszeitung (LVZ) is the city's only daily newspaper. Founded in 1894, it has published under several different forms of government. The monthly magazine Kreuzer specializes in culture, festivities and the arts in Leipzig. Leipzig was also home to the world's first daily newspaper in modern times. The \"Einkommende Zeitungen\" were first published in 1650.\nLeipzig has one daily or semi-daily English-language publication, The Leipzig Glocal. It is an online-based magazine and blog that caters to an international as well as local audience. Besides publishing pages on jobs, doctors and movies available in English and other languages, the site's team of authors writes articles about lifestyle, arts & culture, politics, entertainment, Leipzig events, etc.\nOnce known for its large number of publishing houses, Leipzig had been called Buch-Stadt (book city), the most notable of them being branches of Brockhaus and Insel Verlag. Few are left after the years of economic decline during the German Democratic Republic, during which time Frankfurt developed as a much more important publishing center. Reclam, founded in 1828, was one of the large publishing houses to move away. Leipzig still has a book fair, but Frankfurt's is far bigger.\nThe German Library (Deutsche B\u00fccherei) in Leipzig is part of Germany's National Library. Its task is to collect a copy of every book published in German.\n\n\n== Quality of life ==\n\nIn December 2013, according to a study by GfK, Leipzig was ranked as the most livable city in Germany.In 2015/2016, Leipzig was named the second-best city for students in Germany (after Munich).In a 2017 study, the Leipzig inner city ranked first among all large cities in Germany due to its urban aesthetics, gastronomy, and shopping opportunities.Since 2018 it also has the second-best future prospects of all cities in Germany, only surpassed by Munich in 2018 and Berlin in 2019.According to the 2017 Global Least & Most Stressful Cities Ranking, Leipzig was one of the least stressful cities in the World. It was ranked 25th out of 150 cities worldwide and above Dortmund, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Berlin.In 2018, Leipzig won the European Cities of Future prize in the category of \"Best Large City for Human Capital & Lifestyle\".Leipzig was named European City of the Year at the 2019 Urbanism Awards.According to the 2019 study by Forschungsinstitut Prognos, Leipzig is the most dynamic region in Germany. Within 15 years, the city climbed 230 places and occupied in 2019 rank 104 of all 401 German regions.Leipzig is one of 52 places to go in 2020 by The New York Times and the highest-ranking German destination.Leipzig Hauptbahnhof is the best railway station in Germany and the third-best in Europe (only surpassed by St Pancras railway station and Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof).\n\n\n== Transport ==\nFounded at the crossing of Via Regia and Via Imperii, Leipzig has been a major interchange of inter-European traffic and commerce since medieval times. After the Reunification of Germany, immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nOpened in 1915, Leipzig Central Station is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the ICE and Intercity network of the Deutsche Bahn as well as a connection point for S-Bahn and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.\nIn Leipzig, the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg-)Berlin-Leipzig-Nuremberg-Munich and Dresden-Leipzig-Erfurt-Frankfurt am Main-(Wiesbaden/Saarbr\u00fccken) intersect. After completion of the high-speed line to Erfurt, the ICE will run on both lines via Leipzig/Halle Airport and Erfurt. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)-Magdeburg-Braunschweig-Hannover-Dortmund-K\u00f6ln and -Bremen-Oldenburg(-Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.\nMost major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via two S-Bahn lines, one of which runs hourly via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.\nThe city's rail connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at 200 km/h since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for 300 km/h, was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg is scheduled for completion in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network will considerably reduce the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200 km/h. The ICE will also be able to operate from Leipzig to Dresden in the near future. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long City Tunnel, which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.\nFor freight traffic, there are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a large freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.\n\n\n=== Suburban train ===\n\nLeipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and Bayerischer Bahnhof leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Oschatz, Zwickau, Geithain and Bitterfeld. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport. In 2015, the network will be extended to Dessau and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\nWith the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north\u2013south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.\n\n\n=== Tramway and Buses ===\n\nThe Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe, existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 13 tram lines and 51 bus lines in the city.\nThe total length of the tram network is 149.9 km (93.1 mi), making it the largest in Saxony ahead of Dresden (130.2 km (80.9 mi)) and the second largest in Germany after Berlin (193.6 km (120.3 mi)).\nThe longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.\nNight bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nLike most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be bicycle-friendly. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990.\nSince 2004 there is a bicycle-sharing system. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nSeveral federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the A 14 in the north, the A 9 in the west and the A 38 in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the A 72 is also partly under construction or being planned.\nThe federal roads B 2, B 6, B 87, B 181, B 184 and B 186 lead through the city area.\nThe ring, which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.\nLeipzig has a dense network of carsharing stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.\nApart from the usual taxi traffic, Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with a ridesharing provider. Taxi-like rides can be booked via an app. However, in contrast to a taxi, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.\n\n\n=== Long-distance buses ===\nSince March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.\nIn addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5 million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.\nSome lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and Leipziger Messe for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nLeipzig/Halle Airport is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.\nPassenger flights are operated to the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially in the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). DHL uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines Aerologic and European Air Transport Leipzig.\nThe former military airport near Altenburg, Thuringia called Leipzig-Altenburg Airport about a half-hour drive from Leipzig was served by Ryanair until 2010.\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the Elster-Saale canal, White Elster and Saale was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of forced labor. The Lindenauer port was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and Karl-Heine canal respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, New Luppe, Plei\u00dfe, and Parthe) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.\nThrough the renovation and reconstruction of existing mill races and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused open cast mines, the city's navigable water network is being expanded. The city commissioned planning for a link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port in 2008. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the Elbe from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Quotations ==\nMein Leipzig lob' ich mir!

        "wiki": "Augustus of Saxe-Weissenfels (Dresden, 13 August 1614 \u2013 4 June 1680, Halle), was a Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels-Querfurt of the House of Wettin and administrator of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg.\nHe was the fourth (but second surviving) son of John George I, Elector of Saxony, and his second wife, Magdalene Sibylle of Prussia.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nOn 23 January 1628, at the age of 13, August was appointed administrator of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg by its Chapter to replace the current holder of that title, Christian Wilhelm of Brandenburg. By that time, August had already served three years as coadjutor. Nevertheless, he could not assume his post: on 20 May 1631, after seven months of siege and plundering during the Sack of Magdeburg, the city was taken by the Imperial troops; the Catholic competitor for the diocese, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, assumed the title of archbishop and administrator of Magdeburg. The Peace of Prague (1635) confirmed his rule over the city, but three years later, Swedish troops expelled the Habsburg army and restored August as administrator as of 19 October 1638. August finally took full control of Magdeburg on 31 December 1642 after a neutrality treaty was concluded with the Swedish general Lennart Torstenson.  He was then able to begin the reconstruction of the city.\nIn 1643 August was accepted into the Fruitbearing Society at the behest of Louis I, Prince of Anhalt-K\u00f6then.\n\n\n== Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels ==\nIn his will of 20 July 1652, Elector John George I ordered a division of the Albertine territories that was carried out on 22 April 1657 in Dresden. August inherited the towns of Wei\u00dfenfels and Querfurt and became their first duke.\nAugust also increased his incomes by taking over the administration of the County of Barby during the minority of Count August Ludwig.  On 17 October 1659, however, the young count died shortly before attaining his majority. With him, the line of Barby became extinct. A dispute over his lands was resolved in favor of August seven years later (1666). In his will, the duke left Barby to his son Heinrich.\nOn 25 July 1660, August laid the first stone for his official residence, Schloss Neu-Augustusburg in Weissenfels. This castle was built in the same place as the old one, which had been devastated by Swedish troops. The duke died before the castle was finished.\nOn 15 July 1667, the sons of the late Duke Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar offered August the presidency of the Fruitbearing Society. He accepted the office with its responsibility for fostering the work of artists and scientists. His activities as a patron left considerable debts for his descendants to deal with.\n\n\n== Marriages and issue ==\nIn Schwerin on 23 November 1647 August married Anna Maria of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. They had twelve children:\n\nMagdalene Sibylle (b. Halle, 2 September 1648 - d. Gotha, 7 January 1681), married on 14 November 1669 to Duke Frederick I of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. She was an ancestor of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.\nJohann Adolf I (b. Halle, 2 November 1649 - d. Weissenfels, 24 May 1697).\nAugust (b. Halle, 3 December 1650 - d. Halle, 11 August 1674), Provost of Magdeburg; married on 25 August 1673 to Charlotte of Hesse-Eschwege. Their only son was stillborn (24 April 1674).\nChristian (b. Halle, 25 January 1652 - killed in action at Mainz, 24 August 1689), General Field Marshal of the Saxon Electoral Army.\nAnna Maria (b. Halle, 28 February 1653 - d. Halle, 17 February 1671).\nSophie (b. Halle, 23 June 1654 - d. Zerbst, 31 March 1724), married on 18 June 1676 to Karl, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst. Like her older sister Magdalene Sybille, she was an ancestor of Queen Victoria.\nKatharine (b. Halle, 12 September 1655 - d. Halle, 21 April 1663).\nChristine (b. Halle, 25 August 1656 - d. Eutin, 27 April 1698), married on 21 June 1676 to August Friedrich of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince-Bishop of L\u00fcbeck (son of Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and his wife Duchess Marie Elisabeth of Saxony).\nHeinrich (b. Halle, 29 September 1657 - d. Barby, 16 February 1728); he inherited Barby.\nAlbrecht (b. Halle, 14 April 1659 - d. Leipzig, 9 May 1692).\nElisabeth (b. Halle, 25 August 1660 - d. Halle, 11 May 1663).\nDorothea (b. Halle, 17 December 1662 - d. Halle, 12 May 1663).In Halle on 29 January 1672, two years after the death of his first wife, August married Johanna Walpurgis of Leiningen-Westerburg.  They had three sons:\n\nFrederick (b. Halle, 20 November 1673 - d. Dahme, 16 April 1715), he inherited Dahme.\nMaurice (b. Halle, 5 January 1676 - d. Szeged, Hungary, 12 September 1695).\nStillborn son (1679).\n\n\n== References ==\nJohann Christoph von Dreyhaupt: Beschreibung des \u2026 Saal-Creyses, insonderheit der St\u00e4dte Halle; Halle 1749/1751 (Dreyhaupt-Chronik)\nHeinrich Theodor Flathe: August (Herzog von Sachsen-Wei\u00dfenfels).

It is the largest city and administrative center of Krasnodar Krai in Southern Russia. Located on the Kuban River, it is approximately 148 kilometers (92 mi) northeast of the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 774,234. According to the Federal Statistics Service of Russia, Krasnodar officially reached a population of 1,000,007 on September 22, 2018, making the city the 16th most populated city in Russia, and the country's 16th city to reach at least a million inhabitants. It was previously known as Yekaterinodar until December 7, 1920.The city originated in 1793 as a fortress built by the Cossacks, and became a trading center for southern Russia. The city sustained heavy damage in World War II but was rebuilt and renovated after the war. Krasnodar is a major economic hub in southern Russia. In 2012, Forbes named Krasnodar the best city for business in Russia. Krasnodar is home to numerous sights, including Krasnodar Stadium. Its main airport is Krasnodar International Airport.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nKrasnodar was founded on January 12, 1794 (Gregorian calendar) as Yekaterinodar (\u0415\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0301\u0440). The original name meant \"Catherine's Gift\", recognizing both Catherine the Great's grant of land in the Kuban region to the Black Sea Cossacks (created from former Zaporozhian Cossacks) and Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who is considered to be the patron of the city. City status was granted in 1867.On December 7, 1920, as a result of the October Revolution, Yekaterinodar was renamed Krasnodar (Gift of the Reds). The new name consists of Krasno- (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e- \u2013 'red', i.e. Communist, but also archaic/poetic form of 'beautiful'); and dar (\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u2013 'gift').\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe city originated in 1793 as a military camp, then as a fortress built by the Cossacks to defend imperial borders and to assert Russian dominion over Circassia, a claim which Ottoman Turkey contested. In the first half of the 19th century, Yekaterinodar grew into a busy center of the Kuban Cossacks, gaining official town status in 1867. By 1888 about 45,000 people lived in the city, which had become a vital trade center for southern Russia. In 1897 an obelisk commemorating the two-hundred-year history of the Kuban Cossacks (seen as founded in 1696) was erected in Yekaterinodar.\nDuring the Russian Civil War (1917-1922) the city changed hands several times, coming successively under the control of the Red Army and of the Volunteer Army. Many Kuban Cossacks, as committed anti-Bolsheviks, supported the White Movement. Lavr Kornilov, a White general, captured the city on April 10, 1918, only to be killed a week later when a Bolshevik artillery shell blew up the farmhouse where he had set up his headquarters.\nDuring World War II units of the German Army occupied Krasnodar between August 12, 1942, and February 12, 1943. The city sustained heavy damage in the fighting but was rebuilt and renovated after the war. German forces, including Gestapo and \"mobile SS execution squads\", killed thousands of Jews, Communists, and \"supposed Communist 'partisans.'\" Shooting, hanging, burning, and even gas vans were used.In the summer of 1943, the Soviets began trials, including of their own citizens, for collusion with the Nazis and for participation in war crimes. The first such trial took place at Krasnodar from July 14 to 17, 1943. The Krasnodar tribunal pronounced eight death sentences, which were summarily carried out in the city square in front of a crowd of about thirty thousand people.\nOn June 14, 1971, a bombing occurred on a bus in the city, when a homemade suitcase bomb placed near the gas tank by a mentally ill Peter Volynsky exploded. The bomb killed 10 persons and wounded 20\u201390 others.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nKrasnodar is the largest city and capital of Krasnodar Krai by population and the second-largest by area.

          "In general, a good safari park! But something is missing in it, I don\u2019t know, there may be well-thought-out zones, there are very comfortable beautiful corners, but in general for the regional capital it could be more \u2026",
          "When you go through the dinopark, then look under your feet, as the whole platform is from rotten boards. All dinosaurs are torn at the fold. The toilet in the area is disgusting (without flushing). In vain spent \u2026",

        "wiki": "Nottingham ( (listen) NOT-ing-\u0259m) is a city and unitary authority area in Nottinghamshire, England. Part of the East Midlands region, it is 128 miles (206 km) north of London and 45 miles (72 km) northeast of Birmingham. To the west lies Derby, separated by the M1 motorway.\nNottingham has links to the legend of Robin Hood and to the lace-making, bicycle (notably Raleigh bikes) and tobacco industries. It was granted its city charter in 1897, as part of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Nottingham is a tourist destination; in 2018, the city received the second highest amount of overnight visitors in the Midlands and the highest amount in the East Midlands.In 2017, Nottingham had an estimated population of 329,200. The population of the city proper, compared to its regional counterparts, has been attributed to its historical and tightly-drawn city boundaries. The wider conurbation, which includes many of the city's suburbs, has a population of 768,638. It is the largest urban area in the East Midlands and the second-largest in the Midlands. Its Functional Urban Area , also the largest in the East Midlands, has a population of 919,484. The population of the Nottingham/Derby metropolitan area is estimated to be 1,610,000.Its metropolitan economy is the seventh largest in the United Kingdom with a GDP of $50.9bn (2014). The city was the first in the East Midlands to be ranked as a sufficiency-level world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Nottingham's public transport system won awards prior to 2015, including the largest publicly owned bus network in England, and is also served by Nottingham railway station and the modern Nottingham Express Transit tram system.\nIt is also a major sporting centre and, in October 2015, was named 'Home of English Sport'. The National Ice Centre, Holme Pierrepont National Watersports Centre and Trent Bridge international cricket ground are all based in or around the city, which is also the home of two professional football teams; the former world's oldest professional league club Notts County and Nottingham Forest, famously two-time winners of the UEFA European Cup under Brian Clough and Peter Taylor in 1979 and 1980. The city also has professional rugby, ice hockey and cricket teams, and the Aegon Nottingham Open, an international tennis tournament on the ATP and WTA tours. This accolade came just over a year after Nottingham was named as the UK's first City of Football.On 11 December 2015, Nottingham was named a \"City of Literature\" by UNESCO, joining Dublin, Edinburgh, Melbourne and Prague as one of only a handful in the world. The title reflects Nottingham's literary heritage, with Lord Byron, D. H. Lawrence and Alan Sillitoe having links to the city, as well as a contemporary literary community, a publishing industry and a poetry scene.The city is served by three universities: the University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent University and the University of Law; hosting the highest concentration of higher education providers in the East Midlands.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe settlement may predate Anglo-Saxon times, as hinted at in a Welsh tradition of an earlier Brythonic name being Tigguo Cobauc, meaning Place of Caves (known also as \"City of Caves\"). In modern Welsh it is known poetically as Y T\u0177 Ogofog and Irish as Na Tithe Uaimh \"The Cavey Dwelling\". When it fell under the rule of a Saxon chieftain named Snot it became known as \"Snotingaham\"; the homestead of Snot's people (-inga = the people of; -ham = homestead). Some authors derive \"Nottingham\" from Snottenga, caves, and ham, but \"this has nothing to do with the English form\".\n\nNottingham Castle was constructed in 1068 on a sandstone outcrop by the River Leen. The Anglo-Saxon settlement was originally confined to the area today known as the Lace Market and was surrounded by a substantial defensive ditch and rampart, which fell out of use following the Norman Conquest and was filled by the time of the Domesday Survey (1086). Following the Norman Conquest the Saxon settlement developed into the English Borough of Nottingham and housed a Town Hall and Law Courts. A settlement also developed around the castle on the hill opposite and was the French borough supporting the Normans in the castle. Eventually, the space between was built on as the town grew and the Old Market Square became the focus of Nottingham several centuries later. Defences consisted initially of a ditch and bank in the early 12th century. The ditch was later widened, in the mid-13th century, and a stone wall built around much of the perimeter of the town. A short length of the wall survives, and is visible at the northern end of Maid Marian Way, and is protected as a Scheduled Monument.On the return of Richard the Lionheart from the Crusades, the castle was occupied by supporters of Prince John, including the Sheriff of Nottingham. It was besieged by Richard and, after a sharp conflict, was captured. In the legends of Robin Hood, Nottingham Castle is the scene of the final showdown between the Sheriff and the hero outlaw.By the 15th century Nottingham had established itself as a centre of a thriving export trade in religious sculpture made from Nottingham alabaster. The town became a county corporate in 1449 giving it effective self-government, in the words of the charter, \"for eternity\". The Castle and Shire Hall were expressly excluded and remained as detached Parishes of Nottinghamshire.\nOne of those highly impressed by Nottingham in the late 18th century was the German traveller C. P. Moritz, who wrote in 1782, \"Of all the towns I have seen outside London, Nottingham is the loveliest and neatest. Everything had a modern look, and a large space in the centre was hardly less handsome than a London square. A charming footpath leads over the fields to the highway, where a bridge spans the Trent. \u2026 Nottingham \u2026 with its high houses, red roofs and church steeples, looks excellent from a distance.\"During the Industrial Revolution, much of Nottingham's prosperity was founded on the textile industry; in particular, the city became an internationally important centre of lace manufacture. In 1831 citizens rioted in protest against the Duke of Newcastle's opposition to the Reform Act 1832, setting fire to his residence, Nottingham Castle.\n\nIn common with the UK textile industry, Nottingham's textile sector fell into decline in the decades following World War II.  Little textile manufacture now takes place in Nottingham; however, many of the former industrial buildings in the Lace Market district have been restored and put to new uses.\nNottingham was one of the boroughs reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, and at that time consisted of the parishes of St Mary, St Nicholas and St Peter. It was expanded in 1877 by adding the parishes of Basford, Brewhouse Yard, Bulwell, Radford, Sneinton, Standard Hill, and parts of the parishes of West Bridgford, Carlton, Wilford (North Wilford). In 1889 Nottingham became a county borough under the Local Government Act 1888. City status was awarded as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria, being signified in a letter from the prime minister, the Marquess of Salisbury to the mayor, dated 18 June 1897. Nottingham was extended in 1933 by adding Bilborough and Wollaton, parts of the parishes of Bestwood Park and Colwick, and a recently developed part of the Beeston Urban District. A further boundary extension was granted in 1951 when Clifton and Wilford (south of the River Trent) were incorporated into the city.\nElectric trams were introduced to the city in 1901; they served the city for 35 years until 1936. Trams were reintroduced after 68 years when a new network opened in 2004.In the sporting world, Nottingham is home to the world's oldest professional football club, Notts County, which was formed in 1862. The town's other football club, Nottingham Forest, had a period of success between 1977 and 1993 under manager Brian Clough, winning the First Division, four League Cups, a UEFA Super Cup and two European Cups. During this time Forest signed Trevor Francis, Britain's first \u00a31 million footballer, who joined the club in February 1979 from Birmingham City.The city was the site of race riots in 1958, centred on the St Ann's neighbourhood.During the second half of the 20th century Nottingham saw urban growth with the development of new public and private housing estates and new urban centres, which have engulfed former rural villages such as Bilborough, Wollaton, Gedling and Bramcote. South of the river there has also been expansion with new areas such as Edwalton and West Bridgford, adding to Nottingham's urban sprawl. Although this growth slowed towards the end of the century, the modern pressures for more affordable and council housing is back on the political agenda and there is now pressure on the green belt which surrounds the city.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThere are two major local authorities that serve the Nottingham area. These are Nottingham City Council and Nottinghamshire County Council.\nNottingham City Council is a unitary authority based at Loxley House, Nottingham on Station Street. It consists of 55 councillors, representing 20 wards, who are elected every four years; the last elections being held on 7 May 2015.\nThe city also has a Lord Mayor who is selected by city councillors from among themselves. The position is largely ceremonial but the Lord Mayor also acts as Chair of Full Council meetings.\nThe City of Nottingham's boundaries are tightly drawn and exclude several suburbs and satellite towns that are usually considered part of Greater Nottingham. Unlike the City, these areas are governed by a two tier system of local government. Nottinghamshire County Council (based at County Hall), provides the upper tier of local government whilst the lower tier is split into several district or borough councils. The County Council are responsible for Health, Social Care, Education, Highways, Transport, Libraries and Trading Standards, whilst the lower tier councils are responsible for local planning, neighbourhood services, housing, licensing, environmental health and leisure facilities. The western suburbs of Beeston, Stapleford and Eastwood are administered by Broxtowe Borough Council. Further west still, the Nottingham urban district extends into Derbyshire where Ilkeston and Long Eaton are administered by Erewash Borough Council, and Ripley by Amber Valley. To the north, Hucknall is controlled by Ashfield District Council, while in the east Arnold and Carlton form part of the Borough of Gedling. South of the river, the suburb of West Bridgford lies in Rushcliffe, as do the outlying villages of Ruddington and Tollerton and the town of Bingham.\n\n\n=== UK Parliament ===\nNottingham has three UK parliamentary constituency seats within its boundaries. Nottingham North has been represented since 2017 by Labour MP Alex Norris, Nottingham East since 2010 by Labour MP Chris Leslie (Change UK - The Independent Group as of February 2019) and Nottingham South since 2010 by Labour MP Lilian Greenwood. Each of the outer districts (Broxtowe, Ashfield, Gedling and Rushcliffe) are also parliamentary constituencies in their own right although the parliamentary constituency boundaries do not align with the boundaries of the council districts of which they share their name.\nNottingham is currently represented in the House of Commons in the Parliament of the United Kingdom by three Labour Members of Parliament; Nadia Whittome, Alex Norris and Lilian Greenwood.\n\n\n== Geography and ecology ==\nNottingham is situated on an area of low hills along the lower valley of the River Trent, and is surrounded by the Sherwood Forest in the north, the Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire Coalfield in the west, and the Trent and Belvoir Vales in the east and south.\n\n\n=== Map ===\n\n\n=== Within the city ===\n\n\n=== Around the city ===\n\n\n=== Ecology ===\nWithin the city, native wildlife includes red fox, peregrine falcon and common kingfisher. Notable nature reserves around the city include Attenborough Nature Reserve SSSI, Sherwood Forest National Nature Reserve, Holme Pit SSSI, Fairham Brook Local Wildlife Site and Wollaton Park. Due to its position as a central city with strong transport links, Nottingham has become home to invasive animal and plant species including rose-ringed parakeet, Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike most of the United Kingdom, Nottingham has a temperate oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) and experiences warm mild summers and mild to cool winters with abundant precipitation throughout the year. There are weather-reporting stations close to Nottingham\u2014the former \"Nottingham Weather Centre\", at Watnall, about 6 miles (10 km) north-west of the city centre; and the University of Nottingham's agricultural campus at Sutton Bonington, about 10 miles (16 km) to the south-west of the city centre. The highest temperature recorded in Nottingham (Watnall) stands at 36.1 \u00b0C (97.0 \u00b0F), whilst Sutton Bonington recorded a temperature of 36.0 \u00b0C (96.8 \u00b0F), both recorded on 25 July 2019, and the record-high minimum temperature is 19.9 \u00b0C (67.8 \u00b0F) recorded in August 2004. On average, a temperature of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) or above is recorded on 11.0 days per year at Watnall (1981\u20132010), and the warmest day of the year reaches an average of 29.4 \u00b0C (84.9 \u00b0F).For the period 1981\u20132010 Nottingham (Watnall) recorded on average 42.9 days of air frost per year, and Sutton Bonington 47.1. The lowest recorded temperature in Nottingham (Watnall) is \u221213.3 \u00b0C (8.1 \u00b0F) recorded in January 1963 and January 1987, whilst a temperature of \u221217.8 \u00b0C (0.0 \u00b0F) was recorded in Sutton Bonington on 24 February 1947. The record-low maximum temperature is \u22126.3 \u00b0C (20.7 \u00b0F) recorded in January 1963. For the period of 1981\u20132010, the coldest temperature of the year reaches an average of \n\u22126.6 \u00b0C (20.1 \u00b0F) in Nottingham (Watnall).\n\n\n=== Air quality ===\nIn 2017 it was reported that Nottingham is one of a number of UK cities that break WHO air pollution guidelines for the maximum concentration of small particulate matter. Pollution in part being caused by harmful wood-burning stoves.\n\n\n=== Green Belt ===\n\nNottingham is bounded by a green belt area, provisionally drawn up from the 1950s. Completely encircling the city, it extends for several miles into the surrounding districts, as well as towards Derby.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe geographical centre of Nottingham is usually defined as the Old Market Square. The square is dominated by the Council House, which replaced the Nottingham Exchange Building, built in 1726. The Council House was built in the 1920s to display civic pride, ostentatiously using baroque columns and placing stone statues of two lions at the front to stand watch over the square. The Exchange Arcade, on the ground floor, is an upmarket shopping centre containing boutiques.\n\nTall office buildings line Maid Marian Way. The Georgian area around Oxford and Regent Streets is dominated by small professional firms. The Albert Hall faces the Gothic revival St Barnabas' Roman Catholic Cathedral by Pugin. Nottingham Castle and its grounds are located further south in the western third of the city. The central third descends from the University district in the north, past Nottingham Trent University's Gothic revival Arkwright Building. The university also owns many other buildings in this area. The Theatre Royal on Theatre Square, with its pillared fa\u00e7ade, was built in 1865. King and Queen Streets are home to striking Victorian buildings designed by such architects as Alfred Waterhouse and Watson Fothergill.To the south, is Broadmarsh Shopping Centre. The Canal-side further south of this is adjacent to Nottingham railway station and home to numerous redeveloped 19th-century industrial buildings, reused as bars and restaurants.The eastern third of the city centre contains the Victoria Shopping Centre, built in the 1970s on the site of the demolished Victoria Railway Station. All that remains of the old station is the clock tower and the station hotel, now the Nottingham Hilton Hotel. The 250-foot-high Victoria Centre flats stand above the shopping centre and are the tallest buildings in the city. The eastern third contains Hockley Village. Hockley is where many of Nottingham's unique, independent shops are to be found. It is also home to two alternative cinemas.\n\n\n=== Lace Market ===\n\nThe Lace Market area just south of Hockley has streets with four- to seven-storey red brick warehouses, iron railings and red phone boxes.\nMany of the buildings have been converted into apartments, bars and restaurants. The largest building in the Lace Market is the Adams Building, built by Thomas Chambers Hine for Thomas Adams (1807\u20131873), and currently used by Nottingham College. The Georgian-built Shire Hall, which was once Nottingham's main court and prison building, is now home to the National Justice Museum (formerly the \"Galleries of Justice\").\n\n\n=== Public houses ===\nYe Olde Trip To Jerusalem (the Trip), partially built into the cave system beneath Nottingham Castle, is a contender for the title of England's Oldest Pub, as it is supposed to have been established in 1189. The Bell Inn in the Old Market Square, and Ye Olde Salutation Inn (the Salutation) in Maid Marian Way have both disputed this claim. The Trip's current timber building probably dates back to the 17th or 18th century, but the caves are certainly older and may have been used to store beer and water for the castle during medieval times. There are also caves beneath the Salutation that date back to the medieval period, although they are no longer used as beer cellars. The Bell Inn is probably the oldest of the three pub buildings still standing, according to dendrochronology, and has medieval cellars that are still used to store beer.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAlmost 62,000 students attend the city's three universities, Nottingham Trent University, the University of Law and the University of Nottingham; in the 2016/17 academic year, Trent University was attended by 29,370 students and Nottingham University by 32,515. The University of Nottingham Medical School is part of the Queen's Medical Centre.There are three colleges of further education located in Nottingham: Bilborough College is solely a sixth form college; Nottingham College was formed in 2017, by the amalgamation of Central College Nottingham and New College Nottingham (which had both previously formed from the merger of smaller FE colleges); and the Confetti Institute of Creative Technologies, owned by Nottingham Trent University, is a further education college that specialises in media. The city has dozens of sixth form colleges and academies, providing education and training for adults aged over sixteen.Nottingham also has a number of independent schools. The city's oldest educational establishment is Nottingham High School, which was founded in 1513.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nNottingham is the East Midlands' largest economy.In 2010, Nottingham City Council announced that the target sectors of their economic development strategy would include low-carbon technologies; digital media; life sciences; financial and business services; and retail and leisure.Nottingham is home to the headquarters of several companies. These include Alliance Boots (formerly Boots the Chemists); Chinook Sciences; GM (cricket bats); Pedigree pet food; VF Corporation (American clothing); Changan Automobile (Chinese-made automobiles); the credit reference agency Experian; energy company E.ON UK; betting company Gala Group; amusement and gambling machine manufacturer Bell-Fruit-Games; engineering company Siemens; sportswear manufacturers Speedo; high-street opticians Vision Express and Specsavers; games and publishing company Games Workshop; PC software developer Serif Europe (publisher of PagePlus and other titles); web hosting provider Heart Internet; the American credit card company Capital One; the national law firm Browne Jacobson; and Earache Records, an independent music company founded by local resident Digby Pearson, based on Handel Street in Sneinton. Nottingham also has offices of Nottingham Building Society (established 1849); HM Revenue and Customs; the Driving Standards Agency; Ofsted; the Care Quality Commission; and BBC East Midlands.\nNottingham was named one of the UK's six science cities in 2005 by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. Among the science-based industries within the city is BioCity. Founded as a joint venture between Nottingham Trent University and the University of Nottingham, it is the UK's biggest bioscience innovation and incubation centre, housing around 80 science-based companies.\nUntil recently, bicycle manufacturing was a major industry: the city was the birthplace of Raleigh Cycles in 1886, later joined by Sturmey-Archer, the developer of three-speed hub gears. However, Raleigh's factory on Triumph Road, famous as the location for the filming of Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, was demolished in 2003 to make way for the University of Nottingham's expansion of its Jubilee Campus. The schools and aerial photographers, H Tempest Ltd, were Nottingham-based for many years, until relocating to St. Ives (Cornwall) around 1960.\nIn 2015, Nottingham was ranked in the top 10 UK cities for job growth (from 2004 to 2013), in the public and private sectors. And in the same year, it was revealed that more new companies were started in Nottingham in 2014-15 than in any other UK city, with a 68% year-on-year increase.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nIn 2017, Nottingham came seventh in HDH's Top 50 British Centres, behind the West End of London, Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool.\n\n\n==== Victoria Centre ====\nNottingham's Victoria Centre is the city's main retail shopping centre. It was the first to be built in the city and was developed on the site of the former Nottingham Victoria railway station. It provides parking for up to 2,400 cars on several levels, and contains a bus station.\nIts owners, Intu have plans to extend the centre's floor space but it is understood these will not be submitted until the Broadmarsh redevelopment is complete.\n\n\n==== Broadmarsh ====\nBroadmarsh is undergoing a major redevelopment as part of the city's \u00a32bn southside regeneration scheme, due for completion in 2021.\n\n\n===== History =====\nNottingham City Council, then owners of the Broadmarsh Centre, had been trying to redevelop it for \"almost two decades\". Work on redeveloping Broadmarsh, at a cost of \u00a3400 million (creating 400 stores, 136,000 m2 of shopping space), was due to start in 2008. However, the economic downturn meant that redevelopment was delayed throughout from 2008 to 2010. In the light of the Victoria Centre's redevelopment plans, Westfield announced in 2011 that it was once again planning a \u00a3500 million development of Broadmarsh, which would start in 2012. This, however, did not happen either.\nBroadmarsh was finally sold to Capital Shopping Centres, the owners of the Victoria Centre.

          "I agree with other review. Stadium was nice but I was fearful of fans. We saw two guys escorted from seats for bad behavior. They had to announce several times that fans should not throw things onto fields or have rude behavior. Really? You have to announce this on the big",
          "My son and I attend a playoff game from out of state. It was obvious we were Astros fans given we were wearing their jerseys. There were several drunk dudes behind us who were extremely rude. To the point that it was beyond the pale. When a certain call didn\u2019t go their way they",
          "You might want to take out a mortgage on your home to pay for lunch at the Yankee Stadium. I would not have minded so much if they just had fountains for refilling water bottles. It cost $6-8 for a bottle of water. If you go in summer it is hot like hades and you might get heat",
          "We went to Yankee stadium to look around and watch a soccer match. We got the 4 subway train to the Bronx 161st. It is amazing to inside Yankee stadium however the food is awful and expensive, with not a lot of choice",

          "Great to see baseball live. The stadium is huge. Prices are average for any large event. The entrance to Hard Rock Cafe is strange where you show the ticket and you get a wrist band and then you still have to show your ticket to get back out. No idea what the wrist bands",
          "What an incredible experience. The stadium is easy to get to via Subway. The station itself is questionable but with so many people around I wasn\u2019t too nervous. I loved that in order to get up to your seat, they had switchback ramps instead of stairs. It was an easy climb",

          "Yankee Stadium is truly amazing, no matter where your seats are you always have a great view. Obviously, the more you pay, the better the view, but you can spend very little and still have an amazing time. My favorite place to go to a game!",

          "We went to our first Yankee\u2019s game September 19. Getting to the game was super easy on the D train and the game was great. The seats were really comfortable, but the food was horrible. I\u2019m sure we will attend more games at Yankee Stadium, but will definitely eat before going.",
          "Love going to Stadium with my family, everything is expensive but I get it. What I don't get is food quality at Concession Stands its not very good and when I went to purchase food at smaller concession stands they were sold out... Young lady says to me...\"The stadium has 50,000",
          "Didn\u2019t have a chance to visit the original stadium, but this stadium seems to cater more to the corporate level then to the average Joe. Food and drink prices are expensive, but that is to be expected at most ballparks, but the food options were disappointing. Nothing really",
          "Love going to the ballpark and tailgating before the game with Family and Friends. Unfortunately the parking lots are not accommodating with regards to grilling but are ok with non-BBQ parties. Worst part of going to the game is Entering the Ballpark! It\u2019s absolutely Terrible!",
          "I have been to many sporting events at many venues and I can honestly say that this is right up there. The stadium is impeccable. Clean, great views, food and drink concessions everywhere - they have thought of everything. The game experience was also great and very family",

          "I grew up going to Yankee Stadium, but had not been to the new stadium, so when my wife and I decided to go to New York over Labor Day weekend, we had to get to a Yankees game. There is nothing like it in baseball. I say that because I have been to about fifteen major league",
          "Our boys are Yankees fans, and have been wanting to see a game. We have been going to a lot of minor league games, especially on vacation. This was an extra special game for the boys, against the A's. We stayed in Connecticut and took the train in, which was an easy way to go",

          "I'm a Yankee fan that does not live in NY. I do try to get to one game a year on one of my several visits to the city. Yankee Stadium is a Jewel. The staff are all courteous and helpful. Show up an hour before the game and you will avoid line ups and will also be able to visit",
          "Great baseball stadium with all modern amenities, fantastic choices of food and beverages, train stop or numerous parking choices, Stan\u2019s bar before or after the game, NYY Steakhouse on premises, and best of all the greatest baseball team in history\u2019s home field.",
          "Beautiful facility with great ease of access. Lines were very long getting in, but they moved quickly. Food options were disappointing with average options. The subway took us right to the stadium and there was definitely a police presence. We did a day game and we had Jim Beam",

          "First time in Yankee Stadium. Beautiful from the outside. Seats are comfortable. Good vision of field. Did not buy food (expensive), but bought a hat and water. Easy access to exits, restrooms, food. Very easy walk to the Subway station. So they spent $2.3 billion on this",

          "First time seeing a yankee game and its pretty cool. Train to get here was really simple to figure out. Prices at the stadium for food is crazy but that\u2019s expected. Also be aware that the locals will probably sit in your seats, just get staff to move them. They seem to be used",
          "I was in Connecticut for work, decided to drive down to catch a game. Glad I did, I was a little nervous at first. Psh, people in New York were very nice and helpful. Walked around the small bars and drank some beers before the game. Met a small group of people and hung out with",

          "I love Yankee Stadium. To take in Monument Park, the museum and the thrill of watching the Yankees is well worth the first visit and many more visits.",
          "Love the smells and sounds....The Yankees have the best fans! Our favorite food is Lobel's Steak Sandwiches! Nothing better and can't get them anywhere else. Always a line but well worth the wait.",
          "The stadium itself is a great ballpark with an awesome fan experience whether you are a Yankees fan or not. Everything you could want in a stadium experience. Great staff who were very helpful and friendly.",
          "A vibrant and exciting place to visit. My son and I went to Yankee Stadium in July 2018 - the game was the Boston Red Sox v NY Yankees. We couldn't have chosen a better contest for our first US baseball match. The atmosphere is electric, the crowd really gets involved and when",
          "It's not your father's Yankee Stadium. It is huge. It is concrete..plastic and loud. You can't even hear the people you arrive with by the incredibly loud films being shown and the audio level. OH MY GOD. I have no idea why they would want the pre-game experience be so",
          "This stadium is beautiful! The people and staff are always friendly. The food although is VERY pricy. They have a wide variety of food options which is great. Bars over looking the baseball game are a plus. Very nice stadium.",
          "Yankee Stadium is what you would expect. Go for the exciting baseball. Enjoy being part of the crowd. Eat the food (which is a lot more varied than hot dogs, peanuts, and beer -- although they are still great). But be surprised by an attentive and friendly security and",

          "I can\u2019t see any reason why anyone wouldn\u2019t like yankee stadium I personally am not a fan of baseball but I won some free tickets in a raffle and went alone and it was a great game so the atmosphere was intense the crowd is very loud and entertaining in itself the concession",
          "The food was delicious & the stadium was confortable and beautiful. The seats were cushioned and contained a place to store our drinks on the railing in front of us.",
          "Been going to the Stadium for decades. As for the new place, The 161st Street garage is the seat for entry and exit. Will take you right to the Deegan north",
          "I went with my partner to see one match and we had enjoyed a lot! We ate chicken and we had some Pepsi\u2019s! It was so cool and funny. Highly recommended",
          "Nice new stadium. We went to the old stadium back many years ago. This one seems bigger for some reason. However, everything from water to beer to anything you want to eat is very EXPENSIVE",
          "I go to about 30 games a year both alone and with family and friends. Never disappoints even when the Yankees lose. If you like baseball you must go. Come early and go to Monument Park and the Yankees Museum.",
          "My friend and I was at the Yankee game last night. The stadium is great but the yankees were HORRIBLE. I was so upset that they didn\u2019t pull the pitcher I wanted to scream. (I think I did scream) I have mad love for the Yankees and love the stadium but I need the Yankees to win.",
          "I have been to 4 games this year. This game was a playoff game. As always the atmosphere was awesome. Seats are comfortable and the view is always good.",
          "I have been to NYC twice now, and going to a Yankees game has been my favorite thing to do there! Yes, the park is new-ish (I like older more historical parks like Fenway) But they modeled it after the old one which is pretty cool. The stadium was clean and nice. Food and drinks",
          "Yankees vs. White Sox. Yankees lost that day. I'm a Yankee fan but it's just a game. Yankees has won many games before, so it's ok. We came here with Hubby\u2019s friend and friends with teenagers. They\u2019re Japanese so they wanted to see Tanaka the pitcher so bad! I was ready with my",

          "We loved our visit to Yankee Stadium. Its an intimate stadium and we had great, cheap seats! Clean facility. Easy acess by subway!",
          "The line into the stadium was long but moved quickly. Knew ballpark food would be expensive but was good and the delivery to your seat was simple. Going to a game was a nice addition to the usual sightseeing in NYC.",
          "What can say? The house that Ruth built is now Disney World! Steaks, Asian bowls and sushi, southern BBQ and hot dogs! The view from every seat is great, especially the bleachers. I miss the old ballpark but I admit the new Yankee Stadium has it all! I even saw a fruit stand.",
          "My 1st game ever to see here. Definitely my #1 bucket list, (check). What a great experience and to share with 3 very important people in my life. We got the win and felt the stadium shake after a 3 run home run. GO YANKEES!!!",
          "Awesome sight and one of the best looking stadiums in the world. The only downside is how expensive the tickets are.",
          "We landed on a Friday afternoon and headed straight out to a Yankees VS Blue Jays game. We got there just after it had started, our seats were easy, 2nd from the back in section 113, to find and magnificent seats. I dont think you could get a bad seat at this stadium, they have",
          "awesome place to attend for any budget. if you can afford it I recommend legends seating behind home plate. sat next to rudy guiliani and rick ross at a game. had a special date with mark the museum curator and it was awesome. thank you for taking care of my family . the new",

          "Me and my girlfriend were visiting NY and on the last day, before going to the airport to fly back home, we decided to do a tour of the stadium. We had to bring our hand luggage since we had checked out of the hotel and when we arrived in front of the security control check, a",
          "Great access through different means of transportation. Helpful employees in the shop. Very well organized.",
          "I went to the old Yankee Stadium a few times and loved it. This new stadium lacks a bit of the nostalgia but makes up for it in class and facilities. Museum and monument park are very cool, interesting. And there is an amazing aura in Yankee Stadium that I have not felt in other",
          "This was my first time to Yankee Stadium, I am a lifelong fan and I could not have been more pleased. The stadium is beautiful, clean and the all the staff were welcoming and very helpful. Food and beverages are on the pricey side. That being said, the steak sandwich, and the",
          "First visit to a baseball match to see Yankees v Toronto Blue Jays. Very enjoyable experience and first class stadium. Booked tickets before going on holiday and picked these up on the day at the stadium. Food and drink expensive but it\u2019s all part of the event. Don\u2019t feel",
          "Turned up on the night to watch a Yankees game. Easy to get tickets and reasonably priced. Expensive beers and no cheaper if you keep the cup for refills. The buckets of popcorn are something else! Great atmosphere and enjoyable for my first baseball game. Easy to get to on",
          "We\u2019ve been to 20 of the current MLB stadiums and Yankee Stadium isn\u2019t in the top ten. Food choices are mediocre and fans ignore their actual seat assignment. We witnessed several arguments over this.",
          "Yankee Stadium was my 112th stadium where I have seen professional regular season baseball games. It is more like a monument where baseball is played. One nice thing is that if you sit in the lower bowl, if you get up to get something, you can see the game from the area behind",
          "Great Night of Baseball although was supposed to be a 1pm start, we arrived and were told it would be delayed until 7pm, decided to travel back to our hotel which was 40 minutes by train and return later. once entered the stadium we walked around it took pictures and got a hot",
          "It is certainly a fantastic stadium and has all the bells and whistles, great food and beverage outlets. Mostly friendly staff. Im not sure what happened for this game but the queues were crazy and despite being at the stadium at 6 pm, I didn\u2019t get in until 740, the staff",
          "This place is a home for the New York Yankees. Go and check the atmosphere even if you're not a baseball fan - it's the biggest sport in NYC.",
          "Being a history buff, I enjoy Fenway Park, because you\u2019re basically in a living museum. Yankee Stadium didn\u2019t have that feeling for me. Sure they tried to give it the charm of the old stadium, but it\u2019s not the old stadium. Still, it was really good. Monument Park was nice. The",
          "Yankee stadium is a must for baseball but also for sport fans in general. The structure is spectacular and amazing, with great view from every angle and a lot of restaurants and shops inside. The food and beverages are very expensive and not always good, it depends a lot on what",
          "We took a mini bus to the stadium as we had 18 people take in a Saturday late afternoon game vs the Blue Jays. Though the Yankees lost we enjoyed our time immensely. Great views from suite 10, and the food we ordered was yummy.",
          "We went to watch the Yankees play the Detroit Tigers as our first experience of MLB! It did not disappoint. Very friendly crowd with a great atmosphere. The stadium is huge, but from the seats we had (and the ones we passed) you\u2019ll have a great view wherever you choose to sit.",
          "We watched the Yankees vs. Red Socks last nice and had a great time. The game started at 7pm and finished close to 11pm. We took the train back to Manhattan - the station is a short walk from the Stadium. There were no safety issues as there were plenty of police around and",
          "Four of us were fortunate enough to score tickets to a Yankee - Red Sox game. The seating is fine, the audio is perfect, the locale is fine. And the Yanks WON!! One gripe: Uber drivers block the roads on the way out.",
          "The stadium is great to come to. Both locals and tourists it is a must see in NYC. the food is great, the shops have great stuff and of course the Yankees. Met some knowledgeable staff who displayed some vintage bats from Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle as well as some Series rings",
          "Went to the September 16.2018 game vs. the Toronto Blue Jays. It was a nice sunny day. We felt like cattle trying to get in with the metal roadway similar to cattle going to the slaughter. The cost of food in the stadium is expensive. $6.00 for a cup of lemonade. Bring your own",
          "This stadium is lovely. Seats were great. We won...the Blue Jays!!!!! Clean Chicken and fries in a BUCKET...wowza Police presence awesome Great visit",
          "We had 3 first timers out of 7 with us and all enjoyed our day. It was a hot day and we were glad to be under the overhang to escape the hot sun! Unfortunately the Yankees lost but it was a good day overall. Food/drinks are EXPENSIVE! You can bring unopened H2O bottles in fyi.",
          "Easy to find from the MTA just follow the crowd. 5 minute walk. Large security regime to make you feel safe. Huge stadium with shops, restaurants, bars great experience. Free to walk around at any level. Really friendly staff who are happy to help. Don't forget your free",
          "Visited NY in August 2018 with my 12 year old son. We went to our first baseball match. Didn\u2019t know what to expect but we loved it, the atmosphere, the hype. You\u2019ve got to have the Grub bucket if eating there. We got a free Key ring each on entry. Easy to get there on the",
          "Caught a Game while recently in NYC for a week, the stadium is clean and easy to get around, food and drinks are widely available (but expensive.) We entered via the on site Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 which short cut a major queue outside. We hadn't planned it but having entered the caf\u00e9",
          "Great stadium to see a game. Lots to see and good eating places. I found the seats a little expensive compared to other parks like Fenway.",
          "What a great night we had at the stadium.A must visit if you are visiting New York .We have never been to a baseball match and what a great time we had soaking up the atmosphere from chatting to people in the que then a meal and then watching the whole event,We got our tickets",
          "We went to see the NYY. The stadium was clean and we had great seats. My kids loved that we were able to order food on their app from our seats & have it delivered. There was great energy from the crowd.",
          "Although I prefer the old stadium this place has Great amenities. The site lines are perfect. And of course the Yankees play here",
          "If you want to make the most of your visit, plan on arriving as soon as you can. The entry gates open 1.5 hours before scheduled game time Monday through Friday and 2 hours prior on Saturday, Sunday, and special event days. Be prepared for delays in getting through stadium",
          "Very good stadium. Many transportation options leading to it. Half a dozen train lines from any part of the city. The stadium is well built to handle the crowds. Lots of food/drink options. A playground for little ones. A tiny NY Yankees museum.",
          "If you're coming to the Bronx definitely make a trip to Yankee Stadium. If it's during the season, get some cheap tickets and make your way inside. You can bring your own food and drinks, but make sure you check out the website to confirm the specifics. That will save you a few",
          "Always an amazing time going to a Yankee Game. Take the train to get there, so much better than driving. Sit in the 400's near home plate for the best views of the game and the ballpark. 419 is a great section. It's right near the elevators and food/beverages. GO YANKS!!!",
          "We had lunch at the Red Rooster, in Harlem before the game. Took the subway to the stadium. Thirty minutes before game time we purchased our tickets at the stadium the day of the game as we were only going to be in town for 4 days. The ticket line was long, however it operated",
          "Yankee Satium in the Bronx NY. That tittle says it all right? Wrong! Let me begin by saying that I visited there for the first time since the \"new\" stadium was built. Yes. I now, took me long enough! The lines were out of control, and quite a bit chaotic. Come in early, like an",
          "We can into town for the Tigers/Yankees series. The stadium is easy to get to and from via mass transit in Manhattan. It\u2019s a short walk from station to the stadium but it didn\u2019t seem like there was many bars and restaurants to go to before you enter the stadium. We sat in",
          "I\u2019ve been to see the NY Yankees a few times now. Becoming a habit on business trips to the Big Apple; and why not!? The relatively new Yankee Stadium is easy to reach on the subway & the amenities inside are as good as any global top flight stadium; albeit beers in particular",
          "First timers and it was all very straightforward. Had a very friendly man next to me to explain the rules and what was happening, as quite a lot happens, and not just on the pitch. Loved the loud music, the bright lights, the screens, oh, and we got ourselves on the big",

          "The stadium is easy to reach from NYC downtown with line D, arriving just in front of gate 6. The stadium is well organized, we hardly queued despite the stadium was quite full. Entry, store, toilets, food and drink are available without problems. There are water fountains too,",
          "My first taste of US sports ! They do it different here that\u2019s for sure. I wish the UK would find more ways to get the fans involved like our American cousins do. Baseball isn\u2019t a fast paced game by any stroke of the imagination and I found it a little boring but the",
          "Had a great time at our first Yankee game. Great seats in section 128 row 1! Uber best way to travel to and from the game! Food at the stadium was good and so was the service! Used an app on our phone to get served at our seats.... great idea!",

          "Everything was first class as always with the Yankees. Great menu items available at the ball park and all are fabulous!",
          "Atmosphere great, family orientated and relaxed. Big downside is size of queues to get in. There is limited entrances due to scanning for security. The queues are huge and they don\u2019t delay the start of the game. It took us over 30 mins just to get in. You can buy tickets on",

          "Great to see also for non baseball enthusiasts. Plenty of good food and drink options to fill the long time a baseball game takes. Probably des for drinks are high, food however is decently priced.",
          "I loved this stadium and the experience! Got free parking 1 street off the main road going in. Make sure you don\u2019t park where it says you\u2019ll get towed because you will! But if you\u2019re patient and go early you can get free parking reasonably close! The museum was awesome! We sat",

          "We had such a great time here the neighborhood felt super safe (everyone will have their own experience but ours \"felt\" great). You basically have to get off at 161st street and you are dropped in the heart of the action! The only thing that wasn't 5 Stars was the subway home",
          "We went to a Yankees vs Mets game, and not being familiar with the game, found the stadium, game and atmosphere fascinating. It is a must do and an experience that needs to be had when visiting New York. Easy subway trip from Manhattan both to and back at night.",

          "We love the Yankees, but this was our first visit to the new stadium. What a great atmosphere and venue. Getting here via subway is always so very easy. Always choose the subway rather than driving when you can. Of course food and drinks are expensive just like any other venue,",
          "I went with a group of 20 friends and we really enjoyed the game there. Be prepared if you\u2019ll stay at the uncovered area because is really hot, so use hats, sunscreen and drink lots of water, there\u2019s a lot of places to grab some food, you can\u2019t not go inside with backpacks but",

          "As my heading says I really like this church. The people that work there are quite relaxed and let you take photos. The murals on the roof and walls are quite beautiful and tell stories. I\u2019ve been here a few time already and like to wander around inside. Worth a visit/ 10",
          "With interesting design and colours on the outside I wasn\u2019t sure what to think about visiting here but I was glad I did. The inside has some amazing paintings of various scenes and characters from the Bible. I ended up staying there for quite some time just looking at",
          "I liked the inside of this church a lot better than the outside. (I don't like brick very much.) Brightly coloured frescoes are painted everywhere.",
          "Awe inspiring cathedral with the most beautiful interior of wall and ceiling art - well worth a visit",
          "We visited this cathedral by walking from the nearby Gorodskoye Nachalo park. Mnay buses run on Krasny Prospekt, but approaching from the south, the only optioned seemed walking. The Alexander Nevsky cathedral was the first stone building in the city, and was constructed in",
          "Beautiful building which we visited on way to the River (more of which in a Minute). Couldn\u2019t really look around as it was in process of renovation and this is therefore included in our 3 star rating. However, the river walk, just beyond the cathedral, from Alexander lll",
          "If you are walking around the city, make sure you check this church out. Building in good condition and some nice icons inside. Please don't go if you expect something kitsch like St. Basil cathedral, as this is much more traditional.",
          "I've always thought this is an unfinished church, but it is not. Just a dark-looking building in a strange place. Disappointing.",
          "Old church has good condition and shape. Small but inside paintings are very nice. One of the nice and historical building in the city to visit.",
          "If you visit the center of Novosibirsk you can't miss this church- right on Main Street and where heartbeat of the city begins. The gold dome and brick exterior invites you for a closer look and doesn't disappoint- the interior will have the plethora of icons, candlelit stands",
          "Since it's one of the first real buildings in town, it's a must see. Woman have to cover their hair. You can buy candles outside and light them for a gone one, for a wonder or the health of somebody It's not super impressive, but a must see",
          "The cathedral is the most interesting church in Novosibirsk .The style is Byzantine and is made with red-brown breaks.The interior paintings are nice,without to be something super.Is only some minutes walk from Lenin square and on the way to the church you will see nice",
          "Good place to visit I was lucky to attend a service. Avoid taking photos during service. Beautiful interior. Has a history, worth reading before visiting. It admirable thing that the building strong against the communists aggression",
          "The building is beautiful and people would enjoy both spiritual and architecture sence of such visit. Easy to find too",
          "I'd say worth stopping by because I like visiting churches, but if you are looking to see something larger like Westmister Abbey or the Vatican, this is not it.",
          "Amazing beautiful, apparently one of the first stone buildings in Novosibirsk. Neo - Byzantine architecture at its best. A great place to reflect also",
          "The Cathedral is of Neo-Byzantine design,being built of red brick. with gilded domes. As in other Russian churches, the inner walls are covered with murals",
          "Church at the end of the road before you reach the railways lines. Small in size but the interior is amazing to look at.",
          "It was simply a beautiful Cathedral I was simply amazed at how from the Soviet era they have transformed this beautiful church into one of the most beautiful churches I have seen.",
          "Beautiful cathedral, but after travelling through Russia for a while it doesn't stand out particularly",
          "30 minutes walk from Lenin Square, so worth a visit for it's central location. I consider the Cathedral of the Ascension more beautiful inside and the Trinity Orthodox Vladimir Cathedral more beautiful outside.",
          "We went there during our brief time in Novosibirsk. It's located on the head street of the city. It's a bit of a walk but definitely worth it. Inside it looked very pretty with light colours. Unfortunately we couldn't stay there long as there was a wedding ceremony.",
          "Walk into this small cathedral and you're immersed in a different world. Although Nevsky is most known for a St. Petersburg link, there is a local link too. But we couldn't find out why. The inside is magnificent. About an easy 15 min. walk from Lenin Sq.",
          "Its a small brick church at an intersection on the edge of town. We didn't go inside so I can't comment on that, but we stopped outside and took some pictures. Worth checking out if your exploring Novosibirsk. Include this on any tour of the cathedrals in the city.",
          "The cathedral is an impressive building from outside but to go inside is much more so. Of course no photos allowed - it's a working church - but it's interesting to come inside and see the art work and structures.",
          "I was drawn to the cathedral by its imposing looks; when inside I felt surrounded by tranquility. Good feel when you need that special moment",
          "When travelling in Russia, one might note that there are far fewer churches in Siberia than there are in the European part of Russia. What accounts for this? Firstly, the primary concern of the newcomers who settled in Siberia was to physically survive in the harsh environment,",
          "The cathedral is an important historic landmark. It was one of the first stone buildings in town (the town was founded in 1893 and the cathedral construction started in 1897), then it was closed in Soviet times (in 1937) and reopened as a cathedral in 1989. So this a kind of",
          "The first church built in town (which does not mean an old one, since Novosibirsk is a fairly modern city). One of the two main biggest churches still in use. Quite nice looking - deserves a visit if you've got an extra hour"

        "brit": "Zoo, also called zoological garden or zoological park,    place where wild animals and, in some instances, domesticated animals are exhibited in captivity. In such an establishment, animals can generally be given more intensive care than is possible in nature reserves or sanctuaries. Most long-established zoos exhibit general collections of animals, but some formed more recently specialize in particular groups\u2014e.g., primates, big cats, tropical birds, or waterfowl. Marine invertebrates, fishes, and marine mammals are often kept in separate establishments known as aquariums. The word zoo was first used in the late 19th century as a popular abbreviation for the zoological gardens in London.jaguarsTwo jaguars in a zoo. \u00a9 Index Open For information on particular zoos, see articles at their specific names\u2014e.g., Basel Zoological Garden, Lincoln Park Zoo, Prague Zoological Gardens, and so on. It is not known when the earliest zoos were established, but it is possible that they were associated with the first attempts at animal domestication. Pigeons were kept in captivity as early as 4500 bce in what is now Iraq, and 2,000 years later elephants were semidomesticated in India. Antelopes, including the addax, ibex, oryx, and gazelle, are depicted wearing collars on Egyptian tomb pictures at \u1e62aqq\u0101rah, dating from 2500 bce. In China the empress Tanki, who probably lived about 1150 bce, built a great marble \u201chouse of deer,\u201d and Wen Wang, who apparently reigned just before 1000 bce, established a zoo of 1,500 acres in extent, which he named the Ling-Yu, or Garden of Intelligence.The biblical king Solomon, who also reigned about 1000 bce, was a farmer-zoologist, and he was followed, for at least the next 600 years, by other royal zookeepers, including Semiramis and Ashurbanipal of Assyria and King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylonia.\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\nCollections of captive animals were in existence in Greece by the 7th century bce, and by the 4th century bce it is probable that such collections existed in most, if not all, of the Greek city-states. Aristotle (384\u2013322 bce) was obviously well acquainted with zoos; his most famous pupil, Alexander the Great, sent back to Greece many animals that were caught on his military expeditions.The earlier Egyptian and Asian zoos were kept mainly as public spectacles and only secondarily for study, but the Greeks of Aristotle\u2019s time were more concerned with study and experiment. The Romans had two types of animal collections: those destined for the arena and those kept as private zoos and aviaries.With the end of the Roman Empire, zoos went into a decline, but animal collections were maintained by the emperor Charlemagne in the 8th century ce and by Henry I in the 12th century. In Europe Philip VI had a menagerie in the Louvre, Paris, in 1333, and many members of the house of Bourbon kept collections of animals at Versailles.In the New World, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s discovered a magnificent zoo in Mexico in 1519. The collection, which included birds of prey, mammals, and reptiles, was so large that it needed a staff of 300 keepers.Modern zookeeping may be said to have started in 1752 with the founding of the Imperial Menagerie at the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace in Vienna. This menagerie, which still flourishes, was opened to the general public in 1779. In 1775 a zoo was founded in a Royal Park in Madrid, and 18 years later the zoological collection of the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, was begun. The Zoological Society of London established its collection in Regent\u2019s Park in 1828, two years after the society itself was founded.By the mid-19th century, zoos were being opened all over the world; among those existing today, more than 40, most of which are in Europe, are more than 100 years old. Since the end of World War II there has been a rapid and worldwide proliferation of zoos, many of which have as their aim not the study of animals but public entertainment and commercial gain. The total number of animal collections open to the public in the world today is not accurately known but exceeds 1,000. ",

The first stone of the church, dedicated to the Holy Rosary and St. Barbara, was laid in 1893 and the church was consecrated on June 15, 1907 by Bishop Josef Alois Kessler (1862-1933). The number of parishioners, who were largely Germans and Poles, amounted to 2,500 in 1914. There is also a large minority of Catholic Armenians of Kuban that grew after the Armenian genocide by the Ottomans.\nThe church was closed by the communist authorities in 1937 and became a residential building. After the fall of communism in 1990, the parish was registered again in 1992. He received a plot of land in 1996 to build a new church, which was consecrated by the apostolic nuncio to St. Liborius, on 14 November 1999. Today day most of the parishioners are Armenian Catholics. They are helped by the sisters of the Congregation of the Servants of Jesus in the Eucharist, founded in 1923 by Monsignor Georges Matulewicz (1871-1927).\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoman Catholicism in Russia\nSt. Liborius Church\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "FC Krasnodar is a Russian association football club from Krasnodar that plays in the Russian Premier League. The club was founded in 2008. In 2009, the club was promoted to the Russian First Division, the second highest division of the Russian football league system, despite finishing Zone South of Second Division in third. And at the end of the 2010 season, they were promoted to the Russian Premier League for the 2011 season, despite finishing fifth in the first division.In May 2013, FC Krasnodar began the construction of the 35,074-seat Krasnodar Stadium which was opened on 9 October 2016. Until the stadium was completed, FC Krasnodar continued playing their home matches in the Kuban Stadium.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe club owner and founder is Sergey Galitsky, a Russian businessman who has been rewarded by the Russian Football Union for his dedication to development of football in Russia.\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nIn February 2008, FC Krasnodar had been granted professional status which allowed them enter Second Division (the third tier of Russian professional football). Its first official match was a 0\u20130 draw against FC Nika Krasny Sulin. The team was at that time managed by Vladimir Volchek.\nFC Krasnodar finished third in the 2008 Second Division season. Although the third place does not grant promotion to the upper tier of Russian football league, FC Krasnodar had been invited by PFL to take part in the 2009 First Division tournament. This happened because SKA Rostov and Sportakademklub refused to take part in the tournament despite finishing high enough to avoid relegation.After being promoted, the club appointed Nurbiy Khakunov as manager. Krasnodar finished its debut First Division campaign tenth in the league table.\nIn the next season, FC Krasnodar was managed by Sergey Tashuyev. In this year, the team faced another club from Krasnodar city, FC Kuban. The first match between the rival clubs took place on 12 June 2010, where FC Kuban won 3\u20130. The second match also granted no points to FC Krasnodar as they lost the game 0\u20131. However the team's overall performance in this season had been more successful  compared to previous year. They ended up 5th.\n\n\n=== Promotion to the Premier League ===\nIn December 2010, FC Krasnodar signed a contract with Serbian manager Slavoljub Muslin. Before the start of the next season, FC Krasnodar got another promotion despite finishing fifth in the league. This happened because Saturn Ramenskoye, Nizhny Novgorod and KAMAZ declined to play in the Russian Premier League due to financial problems. On 25 January 2011, the Premier League committee decided to replace FC Saturn with FC Krasnodar.After promotion to the Premier League, the team performed with mixed success. Both matches against perennial title contender CSKA Moscow ended in draws, which could be considered success considering the disparity between the two's squad strengths. However, in both matches against another top Premier League club in Spartak Moscow, the team conceded eight goals, losing away and home matches, 4\u20130 and 2\u20134, respectively. Other notable matches FC Krasnodar played were the ones against FC Kuban; matches between the two marked the first Premier League derby not involving Moscow-based clubs. In the first match, FC Krasnodar won 0\u20131, though FC Kuban won the second match, 0\u20132. During the season, club owner Sergey Galitsky stated that he was satisfied with his team's performance, also stating that he wants his team to play in a manner fascinating for spectators, and that he does not plan on buying expensive players; instead, the club should evolve steadily, \"step by step.\" FC Krasnodar ultimately finished the 2011\u201312 season ninth in the league table.\nThe team's second season in 2012\u201313 was less successful. The team lost all but one match against the eventual top-three teams in the league. FC Krasnodar ended the year in tenth, one of the likelier reasons that led the board to terminate manager Slavoljub Muslin's contract. Muslin himself, however, stated that he was sacked because the club stopped investing into the club to improve its on-field performance.On 11 August 2013, Belarusian coach Oleg Kononov was named manager of FC Krasnodar, with club management also bolstering the squad ahead of the 2013\u201314 season, with Ari, Artur J\u0119drzejczyk and Andreas Granqvist joining the club.These personnel changes awarded the club a top-five Premier League finish, making it eligible to compete in the UEFA Europa League for the first time in its history for 2014\u201315. FC Krasnodar also advanced to the Russian Cup Final where the club was narrowly defeated by Rostov in a penalty shoot-out. FC Krasnodar successfully completed three Europa League qualification phases after defeating Sillam\u00e4e Kalev, Di\u00f3sgy\u0151r and Real Sociedad on aggregate. The team then advanced to the Group Stage, where they were drawn into Group H alongside Lille, Wolfsburg and Everton, eventually finishing third.\nThe following year Krasnodar got to the Europa League group stage for the second time in a row. Their group consisted of Borussia Dortmund, PAOK and Gabala. They won all their home games and pulled off a 1\u20130 win against Dortmund. They finished first with 4 wins (1\u20130 against Dortmund, 2\u20131 against PAOK, 2\u20131 and 3\u20130 against Gabala), 1 draw (0\u20130 against PAOK and 1 loss (1\u20132 against Dortmund). They continued to the round of 32 and were drawn against Sparta Prague. They lost 1\u20130 in their away game and lost a poor home game, 3\u20130.\n\n\n=== League position ===\n\n\n== Achievements ==\n\n\n=== Non-official ===\nMatch Premier Cup: 1Winners (1): 2019\n\n\n== European history ==\nOn 17 July 2014, FC Krasnodar played its first-ever match in the UEFA Europa League, playing Estonian club Sillam\u00e4e Kalev.

        "wiki": "Krasnodar (; Russian: \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0301\u0440, IPA: [kr\u0259sn\u0250\u02c8dar]) is a city in Russia. It is the largest city and administrative center of Krasnodar Krai in Southern Russia. Located on the Kuban River, it is approximately 148 kilometers (92 mi) northeast of the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 774,234. According to the Federal Statistics Service of Russia, Krasnodar officially reached a population of 1,000,007 on September 22, 2018, making the city the 16th most populated city in Russia, and the country's 16th city to reach at least a million inhabitants. It was previously known as Yekaterinodar until December 7, 1920.The city originated in 1793 as a fortress built by the Cossacks, and became a trading center for southern Russia. The city sustained heavy damage in World War II but was rebuilt and renovated after the war. Krasnodar is a major economic hub in southern Russia. In 2012, Forbes named Krasnodar the best city for business in Russia. Krasnodar is home to numerous sights, including Krasnodar Stadium. Its main airport is Krasnodar International Airport.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nKrasnodar was founded on January 12, 1794 (Gregorian calendar) as Yekaterinodar (\u0415\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0301\u0440). The original name meant \"Catherine's Gift\", recognizing both Catherine the Great's grant of land in the Kuban region to the Black Sea Cossacks (created from former Zaporozhian Cossacks) and Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who is considered to be the patron of the city. City status was granted in 1867.On December 7, 1920, as a result of the October Revolution, Yekaterinodar was renamed Krasnodar (Gift of the Reds). The new name consists of Krasno- (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e- \u2013 'red', i.e. Communist, but also archaic/poetic form of 'beautiful'); and dar (\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u2013 'gift').\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe city originated in 1793 as a military camp, then as a fortress built by the Cossacks to defend imperial borders and to assert Russian dominion over Circassia, a claim which Ottoman Turkey contested. In the first half of the 19th century, Yekaterinodar grew into a busy center of the Kuban Cossacks, gaining official town status in 1867. By 1888 about 45,000 people lived in the city, which had become a vital trade center for southern Russia. In 1897 an obelisk commemorating the two-hundred-year history of the Kuban Cossacks (seen as founded in 1696) was erected in Yekaterinodar.\nDuring the Russian Civil War (1917-1922) the city changed hands several times, coming successively under the control of the Red Army and of the Volunteer Army. Many Kuban Cossacks, as committed anti-Bolsheviks, supported the White Movement. Lavr Kornilov, a White general, captured the city on April 10, 1918, only to be killed a week later when a Bolshevik artillery shell blew up the farmhouse where he had set up his headquarters.\nDuring World War II units of the German Army occupied Krasnodar between August 12, 1942, and February 12, 1943. The city sustained heavy damage in the fighting but was rebuilt and renovated after the war. German forces, including Gestapo and \"mobile SS execution squads\", killed thousands of Jews, Communists, and \"supposed Communist 'partisans.'\" Shooting, hanging, burning, and even gas vans were used.In the summer of 1943, the Soviets began trials, including of their own citizens, for collusion with the Nazis and for participation in war crimes. The first such trial took place at Krasnodar from July 14 to 17, 1943. The Krasnodar tribunal pronounced eight death sentences, which were summarily carried out in the city square in front of a crowd of about thirty thousand people.\nOn June 14, 1971, a bombing occurred on a bus in the city, when a homemade suitcase bomb placed near the gas tank by a mentally ill Peter Volynsky exploded. The bomb killed 10 persons and wounded 20\u201390 others.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nKrasnodar is the largest city and capital of Krasnodar Krai by population and the second-largest by area.

In 2012, Forbes named Krasnodar the best city for business in Russia. Krasnodar is home to numerous sights, including Krasnodar Stadium. Its main airport is Krasnodar International Airport.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nKrasnodar was founded on January 12, 1794 (Gregorian calendar) as Yekaterinodar (\u0415\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0301\u0440). The original name meant \"Catherine's Gift\", recognizing both Catherine the Great's grant of land in the Kuban region to the Black Sea Cossacks (created from former Zaporozhian Cossacks) and Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who is considered to be the patron of the city. City status was granted in 1867.On December 7, 1920, as a result of the October Revolution, Yekaterinodar was renamed Krasnodar (Gift of the Reds). The new name consists of Krasno- (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e- \u2013 'red', i.e. Communist, but also archaic/poetic form of 'beautiful'); and dar (\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u2013 'gift').\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe city originated in 1793 as a military camp, then as a fortress built by the Cossacks to defend imperial borders and to assert Russian dominion over Circassia, a claim which Ottoman Turkey contested. In the first half of the 19th century, Yekaterinodar grew into a busy center of the Kuban Cossacks, gaining official town status in 1867. By 1888 about 45,000 people lived in the city, which had become a vital trade center for southern Russia. In 1897 an obelisk commemorating the two-hundred-year history of the Kuban Cossacks (seen as founded in 1696) was erected in Yekaterinodar.\nDuring the Russian Civil War (1917-1922) the city changed hands several times, coming successively under the control of the Red Army and of the Volunteer Army. Many Kuban Cossacks, as committed anti-Bolsheviks, supported the White Movement. Lavr Kornilov, a White general, captured the city on April 10, 1918, only to be killed a week later when a Bolshevik artillery shell blew up the farmhouse where he had set up his headquarters.\nDuring World War II units of the German Army occupied Krasnodar between August 12, 1942, and February 12, 1943. The city sustained heavy damage in the fighting but was rebuilt and renovated after the war. German forces, including Gestapo and \"mobile SS execution squads\", killed thousands of Jews, Communists, and \"supposed Communist 'partisans.'\" Shooting, hanging, burning, and even gas vans were used.In the summer of 1943, the Soviets began trials, including of their own citizens, for collusion with the Nazis and for participation in war crimes. The first such trial took place at Krasnodar from July 14 to 17, 1943. The Krasnodar tribunal pronounced eight death sentences, which were summarily carried out in the city square in front of a crowd of about thirty thousand people.\nOn June 14, 1971, a bombing occurred on a bus in the city, when a homemade suitcase bomb placed near the gas tank by a mentally ill Peter Volynsky exploded.

        "wiki": "Yerevan (UK:  YERR-\u0259-VAN, US:  -\u2060VAHN; Armenian: \u0535\u0580\u0587\u0561\u0576 [j\u025b\u027e\u025b\u02c8v\u0251n] (listen), sometimes spelled Erevan) is the capital and largest city of Armenia and one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities. Situated along the Hrazdan River, Yerevan is the administrative, cultural, and industrial center of the country. It has been the capital since 1918, the fourteenth in the history of Armenia and the seventh located in or around the Ararat plain. The city also serves as the seat of the Araratian Pontifical Diocese; the largest diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church and one of the oldest dioceses in the world.The history of Yerevan dates back to the 8th century BC, with the founding of the fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC by king Argishti I at the western extreme of the Ararat plain. Erebuni was \"designed as a great administrative and religious centre, a fully royal capital.\" By the late ancient Armenian Kingdom, new capital cities were established and Yerevan declined in importance. Under Iranian and Russian rule, it was the center of the Erivan Khanate from 1736 to 1828 and the Erivan Governorate from 1850 to 1917, respectively. After World War I, Yerevan became the capital of the First Republic of Armenia as thousands of survivors of the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire arrived in the area. The city expanded rapidly during the 20th century as Armenia became part of the Soviet Union. In a few decades, Yerevan was transformed from a provincial town within the Russian Empire to Armenia's principal cultural, artistic, and industrial center, as well as becoming the seat of national government.\nWith the growth of the Armenian economy, Yerevan has undergone major transformation. Much construction has been done throughout the city since the early 2000s, and retail outlets such as restaurants, shops, and street caf\u00e9s, which were rare during Soviet times, have multiplied. As of 2011, the population of Yerevan was 1,060,138, just over 35% of the Republic of Armenia's total population. According to the official estimate of 2016, the current population of the city is 1,073,700. Yerevan was named the 2012 World Book Capital by UNESCO. Yerevan is an associate member of Eurocities.Of the notable landmarks of Yerevan, Erebuni Fortress is considered to be the birthplace of the city, the Katoghike Tsiranavor church is the oldest surviving church of Yerevan and Saint Gregory Cathedral is the largest Armenian cathedral in the world, Tsitsernakaberd is the official memorial to the victims of the Armenian Genocide, and several opera houses, theatres, museums, libraries, and other cultural institutions. Yerevan Opera Theatre is the main spectacle hall of the Armenian capital, the National Gallery of Armenia is the largest art museum in Armenia and shares a building with the History Museum of Armenia, and the Matenadaran repository contains one of the largest depositories of ancient books and manuscripts in the world.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nOne theory regarding the origin of Yerevan's name is the city was named after the Armenian king, Yervand (Orontes) IV, the last leader of the Orontid Dynasty, and founder of the city of Yervandashat. However, it is likely that the city's name is derived from the Urartian military fortress of Erebuni (\u0537\u0580\u0565\u0562\u0578\u0582\u0576\u056b), which was founded on the territory of modern-day Yerevan in 782 BC by Argishti I. As elements of the Urartian language blended with that of the Armenian one, the name eventually evolved into Yerevan (Erebuni = Erevani = Erevan = Yerevan). Scholar Margarit Israelyan notes these changes when comparing inscriptions found on two cuneiform tablets at Erebuni:\n\nThe transcription of the second cuneiform bu [original emphasis] of the word was very essential in our interpretation as it is the Urartaean b that has been shifted to the Armenian v (b > v). The original writing of the inscription read \u00aber-bu-ni\u00bb; therefore the prominent Armenianologist-orientalist Prof. G. A. Ghapantsian justly objected, remarking that the Urartu b changed to v at the beginning of the word (Biani > Van) or between two vowels (ebani > avan, Zabaha > Javakhk)....In other words b was placed between two vowels. The true pronunciation of the fortress-city was apparently Erebuny.\nEarly Christian Armenian chroniclers attributed the origin of the name Yerevan to a derivation from an expression exclaimed by Noah, in Armenian. While looking in the direction of Yerevan, after the ark had landed on Mount Ararat and the flood waters had receded, Noah is believed to have exclaimed, \"Yerevats!\" (\"it appeared!\").In the late medieval and early modern periods, when Yerevan was under Turkic and later Persian rule, the city was known in Persian as Irav\u00e2n (Persian: \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646\u200e). This name is still widely used by Azerbaijanis (Azerbaijani: \u0130r\u0259van). The city was officially known as Erivan (Russian: \u042d\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044c) under Russian rule during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The city was renamed back to Yerevan (\u0415\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d) in 1936. Up until the mid-1970s the city's name was spelled Erevan, more often than Yerevan, in English sources.\n\n\n== Symbols ==\n\nThe principal symbol of Yerevan is Mount Ararat, which is visible from any area in the capital. The seal of the city is a crowned lion on a pedestal with the inscriptit in the upper part. The emblem is a rectangular shield with a blue border.On 27 September 2004, Yerevan adopted an anthem, \"Erebuni-Yerevan\", written by Paruyr Sevak and composed by Edgar Hovhanisyan. It was selected in a competition for a new anthem and new flag that would best represent the city. The chosen flag has a white background with the city's seal in the middle, surrounded by twelve small red triangles that symbolize the twelve historic capitals of Armenia. The flag includes the three colours of the Armenian National flag. The lion is portrayed on the orange background with blue edging.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-history and pre-classical era ===\n\nThe territory of Yerevan has been inhabited since approximately the 2nd half of the 4th millennium BC. The southern part of the city currently known as Shengavit has been populated since at least 3200 BC, during the period of Kura\u2013Araxes culture of the early Bronze Age. The first excavations at the Shengavit historical site was conducted between 1936 and 1938 under the guidance of archaeologist Yevgeny Bayburdyan. After two decades, archaeologist Sandro Sardarian resumed the excavations starting from 1958 until 1983. The 3rd phase of the excavations started in 2000, under the guidance of archaeologist Hakob Simonyan. In 2009, Simonyan was joined by professor Mitchell S. Rothman from the Widener University of Pennsylvania. Together they conducted three series of excavations in 2009, 2010, and 2012 respectively. During the process, a full stratigraphic column to bedrock was reached, showing there to be 8 or 9 distinct stratigraphic levels. These levels cover a time between 3200 BC and 2500 BC. Evidences of later use of the site, possibly until 2200 BC, were also found. The excavation process revealed a series of large round buildings with square adjoining rooms and minor round buildings. A series of ritual installations was discovered in 2010 and 2012.\n\n\n=== Erebuni ===\n\nThe ancient kingdom of Urartu was formed in the 9th century BC by King Arame in the basin of Lake Van of the Armenian Highland, including the territory of modern-day Yerevan. Archaeological evidence, such as a cuneiform inscription, indicates that the Urartian military fortress of Erebuni (\u0537\u0580\u0565\u0562\u0578\u0582\u0576\u056b) was founded in 782 BC by the orders of King Argishti I at the site of modern-day Yerevan, to serve as a fort and citadel guarding against attacks from the north Caucasus. The cuneiform inscription found at Erebuni Fortress reads:\n\nBy the greatness of the God Khaldi, Argishti, son of Menua, built this mighty stronghold and proclaimed it Erebuni for the glory of Biainili [Urartu] and to instill fear among the king's enemies. Argishti says, \"The land was a desert, before the great works I accomplished upon it. By the greatness of Khaldi, Argishti, son of Menua, is a mighty king, king of Biainili, and ruler of Tushpa.\" [Van].\nDuring the height of the Urartian power, irrigation canals and artificial reservoirs were built in Erebuni and its surrounding territories. \n\nIn the mid-7th century BC, the city of Teishebaini was built by Rusa II of Urartu, around 7 kilometres (4.3 miles) west of Erebuni Fortress. It was fortified on a hill -currently known as Karmir Blur within Shengavit District of Yerevan- to protect the eastern borders of Urartu from the barbaric Cimmerians and Scythians. During excavations, the remains of a governors palace that contained a hundred and twenty rooms spreading across more than 40,000 m2 (10 acres) was found, along with a citadel dedicated to the Urartian god Teisheba. The construction of the city of Teishebaini, as well as the palace and the citadel was completed by the end of the 7th century BC, during the reign of Rusa III. However, Teishebaini was destroyed by an alliance of Medes and the Scythians in 585 BC.\n\n\n=== Median and Achaemenid rules ===\n\n \nIn 590 BC, following the fall of the Kingdom of Urartu by the hands of the Iranian Medes, Erebuni along with the Armenian Highland became part of the Median Empire.\nHowever, in 550 BC, the Median Empire was conquered by Cyrus the Great, and Erebuni became part of the Achaemenid Empire. Between 522 BC and 331 BC, Erebuni was one of the main centers of the Satrapy of Armenia, a region controlled by the Orontid Dynasty as one of the satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire. The Satrapy of Armenia was divided into two parts: the northern part and the southern part, with the cities of Erebuni (Yerevan) and Tushpa (Van) as their centres, respectively.\nCoins issued in 478 BC along with many other items found in the Erebuni Fortress, reveal the importance of Erebuni as a major centre for trade under Achaemenid rule.\n\n\n=== Ancient Kingdom of Armenia ===\n\nDuring the victorious period of Alexander the Great, and following the decline of the Achaemenid Empire, the Orontid rulers of the Armenian Satrapy achieved independence as a result of the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC, founding the Kingdom of Armenia. With the establishment of new cities such as Armavir, Zarehavan, Bagaran and Yervandashat, the importance of Erebuni had gradually declined.\nWith the rise of the Artaxiad dynasty of Armenia who seized power in 189 BC, the Kingdom of Armenia greatly expanded to include major territories of Asia Minor, Atropatene, Iberia, Phoenicia and Syria. The Artaxiads considered Erebuni and Tushpa as cities of Persian heritage. Consequently, new cities and commercial centres were built by Kings Artaxias I, Artavasdes I and Tigranes the Great. Thus, with the dominance of cities such as Artaxata and Tigranocerta, Erebuni had significantly lost its importance as a central city.\n\nUnder the rule of the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia (54\u2013428 AD), many other cities around Erebuni including Vagharshapat and Dvin flourished. Consequently, Erebuni was completely neutralized, losing its role as an economic and strategic centre of Armenia. During the period of the Arsacid kings, Erebuni was only recorded in a Manichaean text of the 3rd century, where it is mentioned that one of the disciples of the prophet Mani founded a Manichaean community near the Christian community in Erebuni.\nAccording to Ashkharatsuyts, Erebuni was part of the Kotayk canton (\u053f\u0578\u057f\u0561\u0575\u0584 \u0563\u0561\u057e\u0561\u057c, Kotayk gavar, not to be confused with the current Kotayk Province) of Ayrarat province, within Armenia Major.\nArmenia became a Christian nation in the early 4th century, during the reign of the Arsacid king Tiridates III.\n\n\n=== Sasanian and Roman periods ===\n\nFollowing the partition of Armenia by the Byzantine and Sasanian empires in 387 and in 428, Erebuni and the entire territory of Eastern Armenia came under the rule of Sasanian Persia. The Armenian territories formed the province of Persian Armenia within the Sasanian Empire.\nDue to the diminished role of Erebuni, as well as the absence of proper historical data, much of the city's history under the Sasanian rule is unknown.\nIn 587 during the reign of emperor Maurice, Yerevan and much of Armenia came under Roman administration after the Romans defeated the Sassanid Persian Empire at the battle of the Blarathon. Soon after, Katoghike Tsiranavor Church in Avan was built between 595 and 602. Despite being partly damaged during the 1679 earthquake), it is the oldest surviving church within modern Yerevan city limits.\nThe province of Persian Armenia (also known as Persarmenia) lasted until 646, when the province was dissolved with the Muslim conquest of Persia.\n\n\n=== Arab Islamic invasion ===\n\nIn 658 AD, at the height of the Arab Islamic invasions, Erebuni-Yerevan was conquered during the Muslim conquest of Persia, as it was part of Persian-ruled Armenia. The city became part of the Emirate of Armenia under the Umayyad Caliphate. The city of Dvin was the centre of the newly created emirate. Starting from this period, as a result of the developing trade activities with the Arabs, the Armenian territories had gained strategic importance as a crossroads for the Arab caravan routes passing between Europe and India through the Arab-controlled Ararat plain of Armenia. Most probably, \"Erebuni\" has become known as \"Yerevan\" since at least the 7th century AD.\n\n\n=== Bagratid Armenia ===\n\nAfter 2 centuries of Islamic rule over Armenia, the Bagratid prince Ashot I of Armenia led the revolution against the Abbasid Caliphate. Ashot I liberated Yerevan in 850, and was recognized as the Prince of Princes of Armenia by the Abbasid Caliph al-Musta'in in 862. Ashot was later crowned King of Armenia through the consent of Caliph al-Mu'tamid in 885. During the rule of the Bagratuni dynasty of Armenia between 885 and 1045, Yerevan was relatively a secure part of the Kingdom before falling to the Byzantines.\nHowever, Yerevan did not have any strategic role during the reign of the Bagratids, who developed many other cities of Ayrarat, such as Shirakavan, Dvin, and Ani.\n\n\n=== Seljuk period, Zakarid Armenia and Mongol rule ===\n\nAfter a brief Byzantine rule over Armenia between 1045 and 1064, the invading Seljuks -led by Tughril and later by his successor Alp Arslan- ruled over the entire region, including Yerevan. However, with the establishment of the Zakarid Principality of Armenia in 1201 under the Georgian protectorate, the Armenian territories of Yerevan and Lori had significantly grown. After the Mongols captured Ani in 1236, Armenia turned into a Mongol protectorate as part of the Ilkhanate, and the Zakarids became vassals to the Mongols. After the fall of the Ilkhanate in the mid-14th century, the Zakarid princes ruled over Lori, Shirak and Ararat plain until 1360 when they fell to the invading Turkic tribes.\n\n\n=== Aq Qoyunlu and Kara Koyunlu tribes ===\n\nDuring the last quarter of the 14th century, the Aq Qoyunlu Sunni Oghuz Turkic tribe took over Armenia, including Yerevan. In 1400, Timur invaded Armenia and Georgia, and captured more than 60,000 of the survived local people as slaves. Many districts including Yerevan were depopulated.In 1410, Armenia fell under the control of the Kara Koyunlu Shia Oghuz Turkic tribe. According to the Armenian historian Thomas of Metsoph, although the Kara Koyunlu levied heavy taxes against the Armenians, the early years of their rule were relatively peaceful and some reconstruction of towns took place. The Kara Koyunlus made Yerevan the centre of the newly formed Chukhur Saad administrative territory. The territory was named after a Turkic leader known as Emir Saad.\nHowever, this peaceful period was shattered with the rise of Qara Iskander between 1420 and 1436, who reportedly made Armenia a \"desert\" and subjected it to \"devastation and plunder, to slaughter, and captivity\". The wars of Iskander and his eventual defeat against the Timurids, invited further destruction in Armenia, as many more Armenians were taken captive and sold into slavery and the land was subjected to outright pillaging, forcing many of them to leave the region.Following the fall of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in 1375, the seat of the Armenian Church was transferred from Sis back to Vagharshapat near Yerevan in 1441. Thus, Yerevan became the main economic, cultural and administrative centre in Armenia.\n\n\n=== Iranian rule ===\n\nIn 1501\u201302, most of the Eastern Armenian territories including Yerevan were swiftly conquered by the emerging Safavid dynasty of Iran led by Shah Ismail I. Soon after in 1502, Yerevan became the centre of the Erivan Beglarbegi, a new administrative territory of Iran formed by the Safavids. For the following 3 centuries, it remained, with brief intermissions, under the Iranian rule. Due to its strategic significance, Yerevan -known as Revan by the Ottomans- was initially often fought over, and passed back and forth, between the dominion of the rivaling Iranian and Ottoman Empire, until it permanently became controlled by the Safavids. In 1555, Iran had secured its legitimate possession over Yerevan with the Ottomans through the Treaty of Amasya.In 1582\u20131583, the Ottomans led by Serdar Ferhad Pasha took brief control over Yerevan. Ferhad Pasha managed to build the Erivan Fortress on the ruins of one thousand-years old ancient Armenian fortress, on the shores of Hrazdan river. However, Ottoman control ended in 1604 when the Persians regained Yerevan as a result of first Ottoman-Safavid War.\nShah Abbas I of Persia who ruled between 1588 and 1629, ordered the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Armenians including citizens from Yerevan to mainland Persia. As a consequence, Yerevan significantly lost its Armenian population who had declined to 20%, while Muslims including Persians, Turks, Kurds and Tatars gained dominance with around 80% of the city's population. Muslims were either sedentary, semi-sedentary, or nomadic. Armenians mainly occupied the Kond neighbourhood of Yerevan and the rural suburbs around the city. However, the Armenians dominated over various professions and trade in the area and were of great economic significance to the Persian administration.\n\nDuring the second Ottoman-Safavid War, Ottoman troops under the command of Sultan Murad IV conquered the city on 8 August 1635. Returning in triumph to Constantinople, he opened the \"Yerevan Kiosk\" (Revan K\u00f6\u015fk\u00fc) in Topkap\u0131 Palace in 1636. However, Iranian troops under commanded by Shah Safi retook Yerevan on 1 April 1636. As a result of the Treaty of Zuhab in 1639, the Iranians reconfirmed their control over Eastern Armenia, including Yerevan. On 7 June 1679, a devastating earthquake razed the city to the ground.\nIn 1724, the Erivan Fortress was besieged by the Ottoman army. After a period of resistance, the fortress fell to the Turks. As a result of the Ottoman invasion, the Erivan Beglarbegi of the Safavids was dissolved.\nFollowing a brief period of Ottoman rule over Eastern Armenia between 1724 and 1736, and as a result of the fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1736, Yerevan along with the adjacent territories became part of the newly formed administrative territory of Erivan Khanate under the Afsharid dynasty of Iran, which encompassed an area of 15,000 square kilometres (5,800 square miles). The Afsharids controlled Eastern Armenia from the mid 1730s until the 1790s. Following the fall of the Afsharids, the Qajar dynasty of Iran took control of Eastern Armenia until 1828, when the region was conquered by the Russian Empire after their victory over the Qajars that resulted in the Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828.\n\n\n=== Russian rule ===\n\nDuring the second Russo-Persian War of the 19th century, the Russo-Persian War of 1826\u201328, Yerevan was captured by Russian troops under general Ivan Paskevich on 1 October 1827. It was formally ceded by the Iranians in 1828, following the Treaty of Turkmenchay. After 3 centuries of Iranian occupation, Yereven along with the rest of Eastern Armenia designated as the \"Armenian Oblast\", became part of the Russian Empire, a period that would last until the collapse of the Empire in 1917. The Russians sponsored the resettlement process of the Armenian population from Persia and Turkey. Due to the resettlement, the percentage of the Armenian population of Yerevan increased from 28% to 53.8%. The resettlement was intended to create Russian power bridgehead in the Middle East. In 1829, Armenian repatriates from Persia were resettled in the city and a new quarter was built.\nYerevan served as the seat of the newly formed Armenian Oblast between 1828 and 1840. By the time of Nicholas I's visit in 1837, Yerevan had become an uyezd. In 1840, the Armenian Oblast was dissolved and its territory incorporated into a new larger province; the Georgia-Imeretia Governorate. In 1850 the territory of the former oblast was reorganized into the Erivan Governorate, covering an area of 28,000 square kilometres (11,000 square miles). Yerevan was the centre of the newly established governorate. \n\nAt that period, Yerevan was a small town with narrow roads and alleys, including the central quarter of Shahar, the Ghantar commercial centre, and the residential neighbourhoods of Kond, Dzoragyugh, Nork and Shentagh. During the 1840s and the 1850s, many schools were opened in the city. However, the first major plan of Yerevan was adopted in 1856, during which, Saint Hripsime and Saint Gayane women's colleges were founded and the English Park was opened. In 1863, the Astafyan Street was redeveloped and opened. In 1874, Zacharia Gevorkian opened Yerevan's first printing house, while the first theatre opened its doors in 1879.\nOn 1 October 1879, Yerevan was granted the status of a city through a decree issued by Alexander II of Russia. In 1881, The Yerevan Teachers' Seminary and the Yerevan Brewery were opened, followed by the Tairyan's wine and brandy factory in 1887. Other factories for alcoholic beverages and mineral water were opened during the 1890s. The monumental church of Saint Gregory the Illuminator was opened in 1900. Electricity and telephone lines were introduced to the city in 1907 and 1913 respectively.\nIn general, Yerevan had rapidly grown under the Russian rule, both economically and politically. Old buildings were torn down and new buildings of European style were erected instead.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Yerevan city's population was over 29,000. In 1902, a railway line linked Yerevan with Alexandropol, Tiflis and Julfa. In the same year, Yerevan's first public library was opened. In 1905, the grandnephew of Napoleon I; prince Louis Joseph J\u00e9r\u00f4me Napol\u00e9on (1864\u20131932) was appointed as governor of Yerevan province. In 1913, for the first time in the city, a telephone line with eighty subscribers became operational.\nYerevan served as the centre of the governorate until 1917, when Erivan governorate was dissolved with the collapse of the Russian Empire.\n\n\n=== Brief independence ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Yerevan was a small city with a population of 30,000. In 1917, the Russian Empire ended with the October Revolution. In the aftermath, Armenian, Georgian and Muslim leaders of Transcaucasia united to form the Transcaucasian Federation and proclaimed Transcaucasia's secession.\nThe Federation, however, was short-lived. After gaining control over Alexandropol, the Turkish army was advancing towards the south and east to eliminate the center of Armenian resistance based in Yerevan. On 21 May 1918, the Turks started their campaign moving towards Yerevan via Sardarabad. Catholicos Gevorg V ordered that church bells peal for 6 days as Armenians from all walks of life \u2013 peasants, poets, blacksmiths, and even the clergymen \u2013 rallied to form organized military units. Civilians, including children, aided in the effort as well, as \"Carts drawn by oxen, water buffalo, and cows jammed the roads bringing food, provisions, ammunition, and volunteers from the vicinity\" of Yerevan.\n\nBy the end of May 1918, Armenians were able to defeat the Turkish army in the battles of Sardarabad, Abaran and Karakilisa. Thus, on 28 May 1918, the Dashnak leader Aram Manukian declared the independence of Armenia. Subsequently, Yerevan became the capital and the center of the newly founded Republic of Armenia, although the members of the Armenian National Council were yet to stay in Tiflis until their arrival in Yerevan to form the government in the summer of the same year. Armenia became a parliamentary republic with four administrative divisions. The capital Yerevan was part of the Araratian Province. At the time, Yerevan received more than 75,000 refugees from Western Armenia, who escaped the massacres perpetrated by the Ottoman Turks during the Armenian Genocide.\nOn 26 May 1919, the government passed a law to open the Yerevan State University, which was located on the main Astafyan (now Abovyan) street of Yerevan.\nAfter the signing of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres in 1920, Armenia was granted formal international recognition. The United States, as well as many South American countries, officially opened diplomatic channels with the government of independent Armenia. Yerevan had also opened representatives in Great Britain, Italy, Germany, Serbia, Greece, Iran and Japan.\nHowever, after the short period of independence, Yerevan fell to the Bolsheviks, and Armenia was incorporated into Soviet Russia on 2 December 1920. Although nationalist forces managed to retake the city in February 1921 and successfully released all the imprisoned political and military figures, the city's nationalist elite were once again defeated by the Soviet forces on 2 April 1921.\n\n\n=== Soviet rule ===\n\nThe Red Soviet Army invaded Armenia on 29 November 1920 from the northeast. On 2 December 1920, Yerevan along with the other territories of the Republic of Armenia, became part of Soviet Russia, known as the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. However, the Armenian SSR formed the Transcaucasian SFSR (TSFSR) together with the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, between 1922 and 1936.\nUnder the Soviet rule, Yerevan became the first among the cities in the Soviet Union for which a general plan was developed. The \"General Plan of Yerevan\" developed by the academician Alexander Tamanian, was approved in 1924. It was initially designed for a population of 150,000. The city was quickly transformed into a modern industrial metropolis of over one million people. New educational, scientific and cultural institutions were founded as well.\nTamanian incorporated national traditions with contemporary urban construction. His design presented a radial-circular arrangement that overlaid the existing city and incorporated much of its existing street plan. As a result, many historic buildings were demolished, including churches, mosques, the Persian fortress, baths, bazaars and caravanserais. Many of the districts around central Yerevan were named after former Armenian communities that were destroyed by the Ottoman Turks during the Armenian Genocide. The districts of Arabkir, Malatia-Sebastia and Nork Marash, for example, were named after the towns Arabkir, Malatya, Sebastia, and Marash, respectively. After the end of World War II, German POWs were used to help in the construction of new buildings and structures, such as the Kievyan Bridge.\nWithin the years, the central Kentron district has become the most developed area in Yerevan, something that created a significant gap compared with other districts in the city. Most of the educational, cultural and scientific institutions were centred in the Kentron district.\nIn 1965, during the commemorations of the fiftieth anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, Yerevan was the location of a demonstration, the first such demonstration in the Soviet Union, to demand recognition of the Genocide by the Soviet authorities. In 1968, the city's 2,750th anniversary was commemorated.\nYerevan played a key role in the Armenian national democratic movement that emerged during the Gorbachev era of the 1980s. The reforms of Glasnost and Perestroika opened questions on issues such as the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, the environment, Russification, corruption, democracy, and eventually independence. At the beginning of 1988, nearly one million Armenians from several regions of Armenia engaged in demonstrations concerning these subjects, centered in the city's Theater Square (currently Freedom Square).\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yerevan became the capital of Armenia on 21 September 1991. Maintaining supplies of gas and electricity proved difficult; constant electricity was not restored until 1996 amidst the chaos of the badly instigated and planned transition to a market-based economy.\n\nSince 2000, central Yerevan has been transformed into a vast construction site, with cranes erected all over the Kentron district. Officially, the scores of multi-storied buildings are part of large-scale urban planning projects. Roughly $1.8 billion was spent on such construction in 2006, according to the national statistical service. Prices for downtown apartments have increased by about ten times during the first decade of the 21st century. Many new streets and avenues were opened, such as the Argishti street, Italy street, Saralanj Avenue, Monte Melkonian Avenue, and the Northern Avenue.\nHowever, as a result of this construction boom, the majority of the historic buildings located on the central Aram Street, were either entirely destroyed or transformed into modern residential buildings through the construction of additional floors. Only a few structures were preserved, mainly in the portion that extends between Abovyan Street and Mashtots Avenue.\n\nThe first major post-independence protest in Yerevan took place in September 1996, after the announcement of incumbent Levon Ter-Petrosyan's victory in the presidential election. Major opposition parties of the time, consolidated around the former Karabakh Committee member and former Prime Minister Vazgen Manukyan, organized mass demonstrations between 23 and 25 September, claiming electoral fraud by Ter-Petrosyan. An estimated of 200,000 people gathered in the Freedom Square to protest the election results. After a series of riot and violent protests around the Parliament building on 25 September, the government sent tanks and troops to Yerevan to enforce the ban on rallies and demonstrations on the following day. Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsyan and Minister of National Security Serzh Sargsyan announced on the Public Television of Armenia that their respective agencies have prevented an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat.\n\nIn February 2008, unrest in the capital between the authorities and opposition demonstrators led by ex-President Levon Ter-Petrosyan took place after the 2008 Armenian presidential election. The events resulted in 10 deaths and a subsequent 20-day state of emergency declared by President Robert Kocharyan.In July 2016, a group of armed men calling themselves the Daredevils of Sassoun (Armenian: \u054d\u0561\u057d\u0576\u0561 \u053e\u057c\u0565\u0580 Sasna Tsrrer) stormed a police station in Erebuni District of Yerevan, taking several hostages, demanding the release of opposition leader Jirair Sefilian and the resignation of President Serzh Sargsyan. 3 policeman were killed as a result of the attack. Many anti-government protestors held rallies in solidarity with the gunmen. However, after 2 weeks of negotiations, the crisis ended and the gunmen surrendered.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography and cityscape ===\n\nYerevan has an average height of 990 m (3,248.03 ft), with a minimum of 865 m (2,837.93 ft) and a maximum of 1,390 m (4,560.37 ft) above sea level at the southwest and the northeast respectively. It is located on to the edge of the Hrazdan River, northeast of the Ararat plain (Ararat Valley), to the center-west of the country. The upper part of the city is surrounded with mountains on three sides while it descends to the banks of the river Hrazdan at the south. The Hrazdan divides Yerevan into two parts through a picturesque canyon.\nHistorically, the city is situated at the heart of the Armenian Highland, in Kotayk canton (Armenian: \u053f\u0578\u057f\u0561\u0575\u0584 \u0563\u0561\u057e\u0561\u057c Kotayk gavar, not to be confused with the current Kotayk Province) of Ayrarat province, within Armenia Major.\nAs the capital of Armenia, Yerevan is not part of any marz (\"province\"). Instead, it is bordered with the following provinces: Kotayk from the north and the east, Ararat from the south and the south-west, Armavir from the west and Aragatsotn from the north-west.\nThe Erebuni State Reserve formed in 1981, is located around 8 km southeast of the city centre within the Erebuni District of the city. At a height between 1300 and 1450 meters above sea level, the reserve occupies an area of 120 hectares, mainly consisted of semi-deserted mountains-steppe.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nYerevan features a continental influenced steppe climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: BSk or \"cold semi-arid climate\"), with long, hot, dry summers and short, but cold and snowy winters. This is attributed to Yerevan being on a plain surrounded by mountains and to its distance from the sea and its effects. The summers are usually very hot with the temperature in August reaching up to 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F), and winters generally carry snowfall and freezing temperatures with January often being as cold as \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F) and lower. The amount of precipitation is small, amounting annually to about 318 millimetres (12.5 in). Yerevan experiences an average of 2,700 sunlight hours per year.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe Yerevan TV Tower is the tallest structure in the city, and one of the tallest structures in the Transcaucasian region.\nThe Republic Square, the Yerevan Opera Theatre, and the Yerevan Cascade are among the main landmarks at the centre of Yerevan, mainly developed based on the original design of the academician Alexander Tamanian, and the revised plan of architect Jim Torosyan.\nA major redevelopment process has been launched in Yerevan since 2000. As a result, many historic structures have been demolished and replaced with new buildings. This urban renewal plan has been met with opposition and criticism from some residents, as the projects destroy historic buildings dating back to the period of the Russian Empire, and often leave residents homeless. Downtown houses deemed too small are increasingly demolished and replaced by high-rise buildings.\n\nThe Saint Gregory Cathedral, the new building of Yerevan City Council, the new section of Matenadaran institute, the new terminal of Zvartnots International Airport, the Cafesjian Center for the Arts at the Cascade, the Northern Avenue, and the new government complex of ministries are among the major construction projects fulfilled during the first two decades of the 21st century.\nAram Street of old Yerevan and the newly built Northern Avenue are respectively among the notable examples featuring the traditional and modern architectural characteristics of Yerevan.\nAs of May 2017, Yerevan is home to 4,883 residential apartment buildings, and 65,199 street lamps installed on 39,799 street light posts, covering a total length of 1,514 km. The city has 1,080 streets with a total length of 750 km.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nYerevan is a densely built city but still offers several public parks throughout its districts, graced with mid-sized green gardens. The public park of Erebuni District along with its artificial lake is the oldest garden in the city. Occupying an area of 17 hectares, the origins of the park and the artificial lake date back to the period of king Argishti I of Urartu during the 8th century BC. In 2011, the garden was entirely remodeled and named as Lyon Park, to become a symbol of the partnership between the cities of Lyon and Yerevan.The Lovers' Park on Marshal Baghramyan Avenue and the English Park at the centre of the city, dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries respectively, are among the most popular parks for the Yerevantsis. The Yerevan Botanical Garden opened in 1935, the Victory park formed in the 1950s and the Circular Park are among the largest green spaces of the city.\n\nFormed in the 1960s, the Yerevan Opera Theatre park along with its artificial Swan Lake is also among the favorite green spaces of the city. In 2019 some of the public space of the park leased to restaurants was reclaimed allowing for improved landscape design. A public ice-skating arena is operated in the park's lake area during winters.\nThe Yerevan Lake is an artificial reservoir opened in 1967 on Hrazdan riverbed at the south of the city centre, with a surface of 0.65 km2 (0.25 sq mi).\nEach administrative district of Yerevan has its own public park, such as the Buenos Aires Park and Tumanyan Park in Ajapnyak, Komitas park in Shengavit, Vahan Zatikian park in Malatia-Sebastia, David Anhaght park in Kanaker-Zeytun, the Family park in Avan, and Fridtjof Nansen park in Nor Nork.\n\n\n== Politics and government ==\n\n\n=== Capital ===\n\nYerevan has been the capital of Armenia since the independence of the First Republic in 1918. Situated in the Ararat plain, the historic lands of Armenia, it served as the best logical choice for capital of the young republic at the time.\nWhen Armenia became a republic of the Soviet Union, Yerevan remained as capital and accommodated all the political and diplomatic institutions in the republic. In 1991 with the independence of Armenia, Yerevan continued with its status as the political and cultural centre of the country, being home to all the national institutions: the Government House, the National Assembly, the Presidential Palace, the Central Bank, the Constitutional Court, all ministries, judicial bodies and other government organizations.\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\n\nYerevan received the status of a city on 1 October 1879, upon a decree issued by Tsar Alexander II of Russia. The first city council formed was headed by Hovhannes Ghorghanyan, who became the first mayor of Yerevan.\nThe Constitution of the Republic of Armenia adopted on 5 July 1995, granted Yerevan the status of a marz (\u0574\u0561\u0580\u0566, province). Therefore, Yerevan functions similarly to the provinces of Armenia with a few specifications.\nThe administrative authority of Yerevan is thus represented by:\n\nthe mayor, appointed by the President (who can remove him at any moment) upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister, alongside a group of four deputy mayors heading eleven ministries (of which financial, transport, urban development etc.),\nthe Yerevan City Council, regrouping the Heads of community districts under the authority of the mayor,\ntwelve \"community districts\", with each having its own leader and their elected councils. Yerevan has a principal city hall and twelve deputy mayors of districts.In the modified Constitution of 27 November 2005, Yerevan city was turned into a \"community\" (\u0570\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0575\u0576\u0584, hamaynk); since, the Constitution declares that this community has to be led by a mayor, elected directly or indirectly, and that the city needs to be governed by a specific law. The first election of the Yerevan City Council took place in 2009 and won by the ruling Republican Party of Armenia.In addition to the national police and road police, Yerevan has its own municipal police. All three bodies cooperate to maintain law in the city.\n\n\n=== Administrative districts ===\n\nYerevan is divided into twelve \"administrative districts\" (\u057e\u0561\u0580\u0579\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u0577\u0580\u057b\u0561\u0576, var\u010dakan \u0161r\u0135an) each with an elected leader. The total area of the 12 districts of Yerevan is 223 square kilometres (86 square miles).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nOriginally a small town, Yerevan became the capital of Armenia and a large city with over one million inhabitants. Until the fall of the Soviet Union, the majority of the population of Yerevan were Armenians with minorities of Russians, Kurds, Azerbaijanis and Iranians present as well. However, with the breakout of the Nagorno-Karabakh War from 1988 to 1994, the Azerbaijani minority diminished in the country in what was part of population exchanges between Armenia and Azerbaijan. A big part of the Russian minority also fled the country during the 1990s economic crisis in the country. Today, the population of Yerevan is overwhelmingly Armenian.\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, due to economic crises, thousands fled Armenia, mostly to Russia, North America and Europe. The population of Yerevan fell from 1,250,000 in 1989 to 1,103,488 in 2001 and to 1,091,235 in 2003. However, the population of Yerevan has been increasing since. In 2007, the capital had 1,107,800 inhabitants.\nYerevantsis in general use the Yerevan dialect, an Eastern Armenian dialect most probably formed during the 13th century. It is currently spoken in and around Yerevan, including the towns of Vagharshapat and Ashtarak. Classical Armenian (Grabar) words compose a significant part of the dialect's vocabulary. Throughout the history, it was influenced by several languages, especially Russian and Persian and loan words have significant presence in it today. It is currently the most widespread Armenian dialect.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\nYerevan was inhabited first by Armenians and remained homogeneous until the 15th century. The population of the Erivan Fortress, founded in the 1580s, was mainly composed of Muslim soldiers, estimated two to three thousand. The city itself was mainly populated by Armenians. French traveler Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who visited Yerevan possibly up to six times between 1631 and 1668, states that the city is exclusively populated by Armenians. During the 1720s Ottoman\u2013Persian War its absolute majority were Armenians. The demographics of the region changed because of a series of wars between the Ottoman Empire, Iran and Russia. By the early 19th century, Yerevan had a Muslim majority.\nUntil the Sovietization of Armenia, Yerevan was a multicultural city, mainly with an Armenian and \"Caucasian Tatar\" (modern-day Azerbaijani) population. After the Armenian Genocide, many refugees from what Armenians call Western Armenia (nowadays Turkey, then Ottoman Empire) escaped to Eastern Armenia. In 1919, about 75,000 Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire arrived in Yerevan, mostly from the Vaspurakan region (city of Van and surroundings). A significant part of these refugees died of typhus and other diseases.From 1921 to 1936, about 42,000 ethnic Armenians from Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Greece, Syria, France, Bulgaria etc. went to Soviet Armenia, with most of them settling in Yerevan. The second wave of repatriation occurred from 1946 to 1948, when about 100,000 ethnic Armenians from Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Cyprus, Palestine, Iraq, Egypt, France, United States etc. moved to Soviet Armenia, again most of whom settled in Yerevan. Thus, the ethnic makeup of Yerevan became more monoethnic during the first 3 decades in the Soviet Union. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s, the remaining 2,000 Azeris left the city, because of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\n\n==== Armenian Apostolic Church ====\n\nArmenian Apostolic Christianity is the predominant religion in Armenia. The 5th-century Saint Paul and Peter Church demolished in November 1930 by the Soviets, was among the earliest churches ever built in Erebuni-Yerevan.

It is the largest diocese of the Armenian Church and one of the oldest dioceses in the world, covering the city of Yerevan and the Ararat Province of Armenia.Yerevan is currently home to the largest Armenian church in the world, the Cathedral of Saint Gregory the Illuminator. It was consecrated in 2001, during the 1700th anniversary of the establishment of the Armenian Church and the adoption of Christianity as the national religion in Armenia.\nAs of 2017, Yerevan has 17 active Armenian churches as well as four chapels.\n\n\n==== Russian Orthodox Church ====\n\nAfter the capture of Yerevan by the Russians as a result of the Russo-Persian War of 1826\u201328, many Russian Orthodox churches were built in the city under the orders of the Russian commander General Ivan Paskevich. The Saint Nikolai Cathedral opened during the second half of the 19th century, was the largest Russian church in the city. The Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God was opened in 1916 in Kanaker-Zeytun.However, most of the churches were either closed or demolished by the Soviets during the 1930s. The Saint Nikolai Cathedral was entirely destroyed in 1931, while the Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God was closed and converted first into a warehouse and later into a club for the military personnel. Religious services resumed in the church it in 1991, and in 2004 a cupola and a belfry were added to the building. In 2010, the groundbreaking ceremony of the new Holy Cross Russian Orthodox church took place with the presence of Patriarch Kirill I of Moscow. The church was eventually consecrated on 7 October 2017, with the presence of Catholicos Karekin II, Russian bishops and the church benefactor Ara Abramyan.\n\n\n==== Other religions ====\nAccording to Ivan Chopin, there were eight mosques in Yerevan in the middle of the 19th century.

However, some structures have remained moderately intact and were renovated during the following years.\nErebuni Fortress, also known as Arin Berd, is the hill where the city of Yerevan was founded in 782 BC by King Argishti I. The remains of other structures from earlier periods are also found in Shengavit.\n\nThe 4th-century chapel of the Holy Mother of God and the 6th-century Tsiranavor Church both located in Avan District at the north of Yerevan, are among the oldest surviving Christian structures of the city. Originally a suburb at the north of Yerevan, Avan was eventually absorbed by the city's gradual expansion. The district is also home to the remains of Surp Hovhannes Chapel dating back to the 12\u201313th centuries.\nKatoghike Church; a medieval chapel in the centre of Yerevan built in 1264, is one of the best preserved churches of the city. Zoravor Surp Astvatsatsin Church is also among the best surviving churches of Yerevan, built 1693\u201394 right after the devastating earthquake, on the ruins of a medieval church.

In 1959, a monument was erected near the Yerevan Railway Station dedicated to the legendary Armenian hero David of Sassoun. The monumental statue of Mother Armenia is a female personification of the Armenian nation, erected in 1967, replacing the huge statue of Joseph Stalin in the Victory park.\nKomitas Pantheon is a cemetery opened in 1936 where many famous Armenians are buried, while the Yerablur Pantheon, is a military cemetery where over 1,000 Armenian martyrs of the Nagorno-Karabakh War are buried since 1990.\nMany new notable buildings were constructed after the independence of Armenia such as the Yerevan Cascade, and the Saint Gregory Cathedral opened in 2001 to commemorate the 1700th anniversary of Christianity in Armenia. In May 2016, a monumental statue of the prominent Armenian statesman and military leader Garegin Nzhdeh was erected at the centre of Yerevan.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nYerevan is served by the Zvartnots International Airport, located 12 kilometres (7 miles) west of the city center. It is the primary airport of the country. Inaugurated in 1961 during the Soviet era, Zvartnots airport was renovated for the first time in 1985 and a second time in 2002 in order to adapt to international norms. It went through a facelift starting in 2004 with the construction of a new terminal. The first phase of the construction ended in September 2006 with the opening of the arrivals zone. A second section designated for departures was inaugurated in May 2007. The departure terminal is anticipated, October 2011 housing state of the art facilities and technology. This will make Yerevan Zvartnots International Airport, the largest, busiest and most modern airport in the entire Caucasus. Currently there are no national airlines operating in Armenia. The entire project costs more than US$100 million.\nA second airport, Erebuni Airport, is located just south of the city. Since the independence, \"Erebuni\" is mainly used for military or private flights. The Armenian Air Force has equally installed its base there and there are several MiG-29s stationed on Erebuni's tarmac.\n\n\n=== City buses, public vans and trolleybus ===\n\nPublic transport in Yerevan is heavily privatized and mostly handled by around 60 private operators. As of May 2017, 39 city bus lines are being operated throughout Yerevan. These lines mostly consist of about 425 Bogdan, Higer City Bus and Hyundai County buses. However, the market share these buses in public transit is only about 39.1%.\nBut the 50.4% of public transit is still served by \"public vans\", locally known as marshrutka. These are about 1210 Russian-made GAZelle vans with 13 seats, that operate same way as buses, having 79 different lines with certain routes and same stops. According to Yerevan Municipality office, in future, marshrutkas should be replaced by ordinary larger buses. Despite having about 13 seats, the limit of passengers is not controlled, so usually these vans carry many more people who stand inside.\nThe Yerevan trolleybus system has been operating since 1949. Some old Soviet-era trolleybuses have been replaced with comparably new ones. As of May 2017, only 5 trolleybus lines are in operation (2.6% share), with around 45 units in service. The trolleybus system is owned and operated by the municipality.\n\nThe tram network that operated in Yerevan since 1906 was decommissioned in January 2004. Its operation had a cost 2.4 times higher than the generated profits, which pushed the municipality to shut down the network, despite a last-ditch effort to save it towards the end of 2003. Since the closure, the rails have been dismantled and sold.\nDue to being dispersed among dozens of private operators, the transportation is barely regulated, with only trip fee is being a subject of regulation. Thus, the quality of vehicles is often inadequate, with no certain regulations for safety. Unlike the majority of world capitals, there is no established ticketing system in Yerevan's public transportation. Passengers need to pay the money directly to the driver when getting out of the vehicle. The fare -being one of the few things that is regulated- is fixed and controlled by authorities. A one-way trip costs AMD 100 (around US$0.21) for all buses and public vans, while it is AMD 50 for trolleybuses.\nThe central station in Nor Kilikia neighborhood serves as bus terminal for inter-city transport, serving outbound routes towards practically all the cities of Armenia as well as abroad, notably Tbilisi and Tabriz.\n\n\n=== Underground ===\n\nThe Yerevan Metro named after Karen Demirchyan, (Armenian: \u053f\u0561\u0580\u0565\u0576 \u0534\u0565\u0574\u056b\u0580\u0573\u0575\u0561\u0576\u056b \u0561\u0576\u057e\u0561\u0576 \u0535\u0580\u0565\u0582\u0561\u0576\u056b \u0574\u0565\u057f\u0580\u0578\u057a\u0578\u056c\u056b\u057f\u0565\u0576 \u056f\u0561\u0575\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576 (Karen Dyemirchyani anvan Yerevani metropoliten kayaran)) is a rapid transit system that serves the capital city since 1981. It has a single line of 12.1 km (7.5 mi) length with 10 active stations and 45 units in service. The interiors of the stations resemble that of the former western Soviet nations, with chandeliers hanging from the corridors. The metro stations had most of their names changed after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the independence of the Republic of Armenia.\nA northeastern extension of the line with two new stations is currently being developed. The construction of the first station (Ajapnyak) and of the one-kilometre (0.62-mile) tunnel linking it to the rest of the network will cost US$18 million. The time of the end of the project has not yet been defined. Another long-term project is the construction of two new lines, but these have been suspended due to lack of finance.\nThe system transports more than 60,000 people on a daily basis.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\n\nYerevan has a single central railway station (several railway stations of suburbs have not been used since 1990) that is connected to the metro via the Sasuntsi Davit station. The railway station is made in Soviet-style architecture with its long point on the building roof, representing the symbols of communism: red star, hammer and sickle. Due to the Turkish and Azerbaijani blockades of Armenia, there is only one international train that passes by once every two days, with neighboring Georgia being its destination. For a sum of 9 000 to 18 000 dram, it is possible to take the night train to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. This train then continues to its destination of Batumi, on the shores of the Black sea in the summer season.\nThe only railway that goes to Iran to the south passes by the closed border of Nakhichevan. For this reason, there are no trains that go south from Yerevan.

        "wiki": "The Cossacks are a group of predominantly East Slavic-speaking Orthodox Christian people who became known as members of democratic, self-governing, semi-military communities, originating in the Pontic steppe, north of the Black Sea. They inhabited sparsely populated areas and islands in the lower Dnieper, Don, Terek and Ural river basins and played an important role in the historical and cultural development of both Ukraine and Russia.After World War II, the Cossack units in the Soviet Army were disbanded. During the Perestroika era of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, descendants of Cossacks began to revive their national traditions. In 1988, the Soviet Union passed a law allowing the reestablishment of former Cossack hosts, and the creation of new ones. During the 1990s, many regional authorities agreed to hand over to these Cossack hosts some of the local administrative and policing duties. \nIn the 2002 Russian Census, 140,028 people claimed Cossack ethnicity, with 67,573 people identifying as ethnic Cossack in the Russian Census of 2010. Between 3.5 and 5 million people associate themselves with the Cossack identity in Europe and across the world, and there are Cossack organizations in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus, and the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origins of the Cossacks are disputed. Originally the term referred to semi-independent Tatar groups (qazaq or \"free men\") who inhabited the \"Wild Fields\", or steppes, north of the Black Sea near the Dnieper River. By the end of the 15th century, the term was also applied to peasants who had fled to the devastated regions along the Dnieper and Don rivers, where they established their self-governing communities. Until at least the 1630s, these Cossack groups remained ethnically and religiously open to virtually anybody, although the Slavic element predominated. There were several major Cossack hosts in the 16th century: near the Dnieper, Don, Volga and Ural rivers; the Greben Cossacks in Caucasia; and the Zaporozhian Cossacks, mainly west of the Dnieper.The Zaporizhian Sich became a vassal polity of Poland\u2013Lithuania during feudal times. Under increasing pressure from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, in the mid-17th century the Sich declared an independent Cossack Hetmanate. The Hetmanate was initiated by a rebellion under Bohdan Khmelnytsky against Polish and Catholic domination, known as the Khmelnytsky Uprising.  Afterwards, the Treaty of Pereyaslav (1654) brought most of the Cossack state under Russian rule. The Sich, with its lands, became an autonomous region under the Russian protectorate.The Don Cossack Host, which had been established by the 16th century, allied with the Tsardom of Russia. Together, they began a systematic conquest and colonization of lands to secure the borders on the Volga, the whole of Siberia (see Yermak Timofeyevich), and the Yaik (Ural) and Terek rivers. Cossack communities had developed along the latter two rivers well before the arrival of the Don Cossacks.By the 18th century, Cossack hosts in the Russian Empire occupied effective buffer zones on its borders. The expansionist ambitions of the Empire relied on ensuring Cossack loyalty, which caused tension given their traditional exercise of freedom, democracy, self-rule, and independence. Cossacks such as Stenka Razin, Kondraty Bulavin, Ivan Mazepa and Yemelyan Pugachev led major anti-imperial wars and revolutions in the Empire in order to abolish slavery and harsh bureaucracy, and to maintain independence. The empire responded with executions and tortures, the destruction of the western part of the Don Cossack Host during the Bulavin Rebellion in 1707\u20131708, the destruction of Baturyn after Mazepa's rebellion in 1708, and the formal dissolution of the Lower Dnieper Zaporozhian Host after Pugachev's Rebellion in 1775.By the end of the 18th century, Cossack nations had been transformed into a special military estate (sosloviye), \"a military class.\" Similar to the knights of medieval Europe in feudal times, or to the tribal Roman auxiliaries, the Cossacks had to obtain their cavalry horses, arms, and supplies for their military service at their own expense, the government providing only firearms and supplies. Cossack service was considered rigorous.\nCossack forces played an important role in Russia's wars of the 18th\u201320th centuries, including the Great Northern War, the Seven Years' War, the Crimean War, the Napoleonic Wars, the Caucasus War, many Russo-Persian Wars, many Russo-Turkish Wars, and the First World War. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Tsarist regime used Cossacks extensively to perform police service. Cossacks also served as border guards on national and internal ethnic borders, as had been the case in the Caucasus War.\nDuring the Russian Civil War, Don and Kuban Cossacks were the first people to declare open war against the Bolsheviks. In 1918, Russian Cossacks declared their complete independence, creating two independent states: the Don Republic and the Kuban People's Republic, and the Ukrainian State emerged. Cossack troops formed the effective core of the anti-Bolshevik White Army, and Cossack republics became centers for the anti-Bolshevik White movement. With the victory of the Red Army, Cossack lands were subjected to decossackization and the Holodomor famine.\nAs a result, during the Second World War, their loyalties were divided and both sides had Cossacks fighting in their ranks.Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Cossacks made a systematic return to Russia. Many took an active part in post-Soviet conflicts. In the 2002 Russian Census, 140,028 people reported their ethnicity as Cossack. There are Cossack organizations in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus, and the United States.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nMax Vasmer's etymological dictionary traces the name to the Old East Slavic word \u043a\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043a\u044a, kozak, a loanword from Cuman, in which cosac meant \"free man\", from Turkic languages. The ethnonym Kazakh is from the same Turkic root. In modern Turkish it is pronounced as \"Kazak\".\nIn written sources, the name is first attested in the Codex Cumanicus from the 13th century. In English, \"Cossack\" is first attested in 1590.\n\n\n== Early history ==\n\nIt is unclear when Slavic people other than the Brodnici and Berladniki began to settle in the lower reaches of major rivers such as the Don and the Dnieper after the demise of the Khazar state. Their arrival is unlikely before the 13th century, when the Mongols broke the power of the Cumans, who had assimilated the previous population on that territory. It is known that new settlers inherited a lifestyle that long pre-dated their presence, including that of the Turkic Cumans and the Circassian Kassaks. In contrast, Slavic settlements in southern Ukraine started to appear relatively early during Cuman rule, with the earliest, such as Oleshky, dating back to the 11th century.\nEarly \"Proto-Cossack\" groups are generally reported to have come into existence within the present-day Ukraine in the 13th century as the influence of Cumans grew weaker, although some have ascribed their origins to as early as the mid-8th century. Some historians suggest that the Cossack people were of mixed ethnic origin, descending from Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Turks, Tatars, and others who settled or passed through the vast Steppe. Some Turkologists, however, argue that Cossacks are descendants of the native Cumans of Ukraine, who had lived there long before the Mongol invasion.As Moscow and Lithuania grew in power, new political entities appeared in the region. These included Moldavia and the Crimean Khanate. In 1261, Slavic people living in the area between the Dniester and the Volga were mentioned in Ruthenian chronicles. Historical records of the Cossacks before the 16th century are scant, as is the history of the Ukrainian lands in that period.\nAs early as the 15th century, a few individuals ventured into the \"Wild Fields,\" or southern frontier regions of Ukraine separating Poland-Lithuania from the Crimean Khanate. These were short-term expeditions, to acquire the resources of what was a naturally rich and fertile region teeming with cattle, wild animals, and fish. This lifestyle, based on subsistence agriculture, hunting, and either returning home in the winter or settling permanently, came to be known as the Cossack way of life. The Crimean\u2013Nogai raids into East Slavic lands caused considerable devastation and depopulation in this area. The Tatar raids also played an important role in the development of the Cossacks.\n\nIn the 15th century, Cossack society was described as a loose federation of independent communities, which often formed local armies and were entirely independent from neighboring states such as Poland, the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and the Crimean Khanate. According to Hrushevsky, the first mention of Cossacks dates back to the 14th century, although the reference was to people who were either Turkic or of undefined origin. Hrushevsky states that the Cossacks may have descended from the long-forgotten Antes, or from groups from the Berlad territory of the Brodniki in present-day Romania, then a part of the Grand Duchy of Halych. There, the Cossacks may have served as self-defense formations, organized to defend against raids conducted by neighbors. By 1492, the Crimean Khan complained that Kanev and Cherkasy Cossacks had attacked his ship near Tighina (Bender), and the Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander I promised to find the guilty party. Sometime in the 16th century, there appeared the old Ukrainian Ballad of Cossack Holota, about a Cossack near Kiliya.In the 16th century, these Cossack societies merged into two independent territorial organizations, as well as other smaller, still-detached groups:\n\nThe Cossacks of Zaporizhia, centered on the lower bends of the Dnieper, in the territory of modern Ukraine, with the fortified capital of Zaporozhian Sich. They were formally recognized as an independent state, the Zaporozhian Host, by a treaty with Poland in 1649.\nThe Don Cossack State, on the River Don. Its capital was initially Razdory, then it was moved to Cherkassk, and later to Novocherkassk.There are also references to the less well-known Tatar Cossacks, including the Na\u011fayb\u00e4kl\u00e4r and Meschera (mishari) Cossacks, of whom Sary Azman was the first Don ataman. These groups were assimilated by the Don Cossacks, but had their own irregular Bashkir and Meschera Host up to the end of the 19th century. The Kalmyk and Buryat Cossacks also deserve mention.\n\n\n== Ukrainian Cossacks ==\n\n\n=== Zaporozhian Cossacks ===\n\nThe Zaporozhian Cossacks lived on the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe below the Dnieper Rapids (Ukrainian: za porohamy), also known as the Wild Fields. The group became well known, and its numbers increased greatly between the 15th and 17th centuries. The Zaporozhian Cossacks played an important role in European geopolitics, participating in a series of conflicts and alliances with the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire.\nThe Zaporozhians gained a reputation for their raids against the Ottoman Empire and its vassals, although they also sometimes plundered other neighbors. Their actions increased tension along the southern border of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Low-level warfare took place in those territories for most of the period of the Commonwealth (1569\u20131795).\nPrior to the formation of the Zaporizhian Sich, Cossacks had usually been organized by Ruthenian boyars, or princes of the nobility, especially various Lithuanian starostas. Merchants, peasants, and runaways from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, Muscovy, and Moldavia also joined the Cossacks.\nThe first recorded Zaporizhian Host prototype was formed by the starosta of Cherkasy and Kaniv, Dmytro Vyshnevetsky, who built a fortress on the island of Little Khortytsia on the banks of the Lower Dnieper in 1552. The Zaporizhian Host adopted a lifestyle that combined the ancient Cossack order and habits with those of the Knights Hospitaller.\nThe Cossack structure arose, in part, in response to the struggle against Tatar raids. Socio-economic developments in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth were another important factor in the growth of the Ukrainian Cossacks. During the 16th century, serfdom was imposed because of the favorable conditions for grain sales in Western Europe. This subsequently decreased the locals' land allotments and freedom of movement. In addition, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth government attempted to impose Catholicism, and to Polonize the local Ukrainian population. The basic form of resistance and opposition by the locals and burghers was flight and settlement in the sparsely populated steppe.But the nobility obtained legal ownership of vast expanses of land on the Dnipro from the Polish kings, and then attempted to impose feudal dependency on the local population. Landowners utilized the locals in war, by raising the Cossack registry in times of hostility, and then radically decreasing it and forcing the Cossacks back into serfdom in times of peace. This institutionalized method of control bred discontent among the Cossacks. By the end of the 16th century, they began to revolt, in the uprisings of Kryshtof Kosynsky (1591-1593), Severyn Nalyvaiko (1594-1596), Hryhorii Loboda (1596), Marko Zhmailo (1625), Taras Fedorovych (1630), Ivan Sulyma (1635), Pavlo Pavliuk and Dmytro Hunia (1637), and Yakiv Ostrianyn and Karpo Skydan (1638). All were brutally suppressed and ended by the Polish government.\nForeign and external pressure on the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth led to the government making concessions to the Zaporizhian Cossacks. King Stephen B\u00e1thory granted them certain rights and freedoms in 1578, and they gradually began to create their foreign policy. They did so independently of the government, and often against its interests, as for example with their role in Moldavian affairs, and with the signing of a treaty with Emperor Rudolf II in the 1590s.The Zaporizhian Cossacks became particularly strong in the first quarter of the 17th century under the leadership of hetman Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny, who launched successful campaigns against the Tatars and Turks. Tsar Boris Godunov had incurred the hatred of Ukrainian Cossacks by ordering the Don Cossacks to drive away from the Don all the Ukrainian Cossacks fleeing the failed uprisings of the 1590s. This contributed to the Ukrainian Cossacks' willingness to fight against him. In 1604, 2000 Zaporizhian Cossacks fought on the side of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and their proposal for the Tsar (Dmitri I), against the Muscovite army. By September 1604, Dmitri I had gathered a force of 2500 men, of whom 1400 were Cossacks. Two thirds of these \"cossacks\", however, were in fact Ukrainian civilians, only 500 being professional Ukrainian Cossacks. On July 4, 1610, 4000 Ukrainian Cossacks fought in the Battle of Klushino, on the side of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. They helped to defeat a combined Muscovite-Swedish army and facilitate the occupation of Moscow from 1610\u20131611, riding into Moscow with Stanis\u0142aw \u017b\u00f3\u0142kiewski.The final attempt by King Sigismund and Wladyslav to seize the throne of Muscovy was launched on April 6, 1617. Although Wladyslav was the nominal leader, it was Jan Karol Chodkiewicz who commanded the Commonwealth forces. By October, the towns of Dorogobuzh and Vyazma had surrendered. But a defeat, when the counterattack on Moscow by Chodkiewicz failed between Vyasma and Mozhaysk, prompted the Polish-Lithuanian army to retreat. In 1618, Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny continued his campaign against the Tsardom of Russia on behalf of the Cossacks and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Numerous Russian towns were sacked, including Livny and Yelets. In September 1618, with Chodkiewicz, Konashevych-Sahaidachny laid siege to Moscow, but peace was secured.After Ottoman-Polish and Polish-Muscovite warfare ceased, the official Cossack register was again decreased. The registered Cossacks (reiestrovi kozaky) were isolated from those who were excluded from the register, and from the Zaporizhian Host. This, together with intensified socioeconomic and national-religious oppression of the other classes in Ukrainian society, led to a number of Cossack uprisings in the 1630s. These eventually culminated in the Khmelnytsky Uprising, led by the hetman of the Zaporizhian Sich, Bohdan Khmelnytsky.As a result of the mid\u201317th century Khmelnytsky Uprising, the Zaporozhian Cossacks briefly established an independent state, which later became the autonomous Cossack Hetmanate (1649\u20131764). It was placed under the suzerainty of the Russian Tsar from 1667, but was ruled by local hetmans for a century. The principal political problem of the hetmans who followed the Pereyeslav Agreement was defending the autonomy of the Hetmanate from Russian/Muscovite centralism. The hetmans Ivan Vyhovsky, Petro Doroshenko and Ivan Mazepa attempted to resolve this by separating Ukraine from Russia.Relations between the Hetmanate and their new sovereign began to deteriorate after the autumn of 1656, when the Muscovites, going against the wishes of their Cossack partners, signed an armistice with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in Vilnius. The Cossacks considered the Vilnius agreement a breach of the contract they had entered into at Pereiaslav. For the Muscovite tsar, the Pereiaslav Agreement signified the unconditional submission of his new subjects; the Ukrainian hetman considered it a conditional contract from which one party could withdraw if the other was not upholding its end of the bargain.The Ukrainian hetman Ivan Vyhovsky, who succeeded Khmelnytsky in 1657, believed the Tsar was not living up to his responsibility. Accordingly, he concluded a treaty with representatives of the Polish king, who agreed to re-admit Cossack Ukraine by reforming the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to create a third constituent, comparable in status to that of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Union of Hadiach provoked a war between the Cossacks and the Muscovites/Russians that began in the fall of 1658.In June 1659, the two armies met near the town of Konotop. One army comprised Cossacks, Tatars, and Poles, and the other was led by a top Muscovite military commander of the era, Prince Aleksey Trubetskoy. After terrible losses, Trubetskoy was forced to withdraw to the town of Putyvl on the other side of the border. The battle is regarded as one of the Zaporizhian Cossacks' most impressive victories.In 1658, Yurii Khmelnytsky was elected hetman of the Zaporizhian Host/Hetmanate, with the endorsement of Moscow and supported by common Cossacks unhappy with the conditions of the Union of Hadiach. In 1659, however, Yurii Khmlenytsky asked the Polish king for protection, leading to the period of Ukrainian history known as The Ruin.Historian Gary Dean Peterson writes: \"With all this unrest, Ivan Mazepa of the Ukrainian Cossacks was looking for an opportunity to secure independence from Russia and Poland\". In response to Mazepa's alliance with Charles XII of Sweden, Peter I ordered the sacking of the then capital of the Hetmanate, Baturyn. The city was burnt and looted, and 11,000 to 14,000 of its inhabitants were killed. The destruction of the Hetmanate's capital was a signal to Mazepa and the Hetmanate's inhabitants of severe punishment for disloyalty to the Tsar's authority. One of the Zaporizhian Sichs, the Chortomlyk Sich built at the mouth of the Chortomlyk River in 1652, was also destroyed by Peter I's forces in 1709, in retribution for decision of the hetman of the Chortmylyk Sich, Kost Hordienko, to ally with Mazepa.The Zaporozhian Sich had its own authorities, its own \"Nizovy\" Zaporozhsky Host, and its own land. In the second half of the 18th century, Russian authorities destroyed this Zaporozhian Host, and gave its lands to landlords. Some Cossacks moved to the Danube Delta region, where they formed the Danubian Sich under Ottoman rule. To prevent further defection of Cossacks, the Russian government restored the special Cossack status of the majority of Zaporozhian Cossacks. This allowed them to unite in the Host of Loyal Zaporozhians, and later to reorganize into other hosts, of which the Black Sea Host was most important. Because of land scarcity resulting from the distribution of Zaporozhian Sich lands among landlords, they eventually moved on to the Kuban region.\n\nThe majority of Danubian Sich Cossacks moved first to the Azov region in 1828, and later joined other former Zaporozhian Cossacks in the Kuban region. Groups were generally identified by faith rather than language in that period, and most descendants of Zaporozhian Cossacks in the Kuban region are bilingual, speaking both Russian and Balachka, the local Kuban dialect of central Ukrainian. Their folklore is largely Ukrainian. The predominant view of ethnologists and historians is that its origins lie in the common culture dating back to the Black Sea Cossacks.The major powers tried to exploit Cossack warmongering for their own purposes. In the 16th century, with the power of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth extending south, the Zaporozhian Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded by the Commonwealth as their subjects. Registered Cossacks formed a part of the Commonwealth army until 1699.\n\nAround the end of the 16th century, increasing Cossack aggression strained relations between the Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire. Cossacks had begun raiding Ottoman territories in the second part of the 16th century. The Polish government could not control them, but was held responsible as the men were nominally its subjects. In retaliation, Tatars living under Ottoman rule launched raids into the Commonwealth, mostly in the southeast territories. Cossack pirates responded by raiding wealthy trading port-cities in the heart of the Ottoman Empire, as these were just two days away by boat from the mouth of the Dnieper river. In 1615 and 1625, Cossacks razed suburbs of Constantinople, forcing the Ottoman Sultan to flee his palace. In 1637, the Zaporozhian Cossacks, joined by the Don Cossacks, captured the strategic Ottoman fortress of Azov, which guarded the Don.Consecutive treaties between the Ottoman Empire and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth called for the governments to keep the Cossacks and Tatars in check, but neither enforced the treaties strongly. The Polish forced the Cossacks to burn their boats and stop raiding by sea, but the activity did not cease entirely. During this time, the Habsburg Monarchy sometimes covertly hired Cossack raiders against the Ottomans, to ease pressure on their own borders. Many Cossacks and Tatars developed longstanding enmity due to the losses of their raids. The ensuing chaos and cycles of retaliation often turned the entire southeastern Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth border into a low-intensity war zone. It catalyzed escalation of Commonwealth\u2013Ottoman warfare, from the Moldavian Magnate Wars (1593\u20131617) to the Battle of Cecora (1620), and campaigns in the Polish\u2013Ottoman War of 1633\u20131634.\n\nCossack numbers increased when the warriors were joined by peasants escaping serfdom in Russia and dependence in the Commonwealth. Attempts by the szlachta to turn the Zaporozhian Cossacks into peasants eroded the formerly strong Cossack loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The government constantly rebuffed Cossack ambitions for recognition as equal to the szlachta. Plans for transforming the Polish\u2013Lithuanian two-nation Commonwealth into a Polish\u2013Lithuanian\u2013Rus' Commonwealth made little progress, due to the unpopularity among the Rus' szlachta of the idea of Rus' Cossacks being equal to them. The Cossacks' strong historic allegiance to the Eastern Orthodox Church also put them at odds with officials of the Roman Catholic-dominated Commonwealth. Tensions increased when Commonwealth policies turned from relative tolerance to suppression of the Eastern Orthodox Church after the Union of Brest. The Cossacks became strongly anti-Roman Catholic, an attitude that became synonymous with anti-Polish.\n\n\n=== Registered Cossacks ===\n\nThe waning loyalty of the Cossacks, and the szlachta's arrogance towards them, resulted in several Cossack uprisings against the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in the early 17th century. Finally, the King's adamant refusal to accede to the demand to expand the Cossack Registry prompted the largest and most successful of these: the Khmelnytsky Uprising, that began in 1648. Some Cossacks, including the Polish szlachta, converted to Eastern Orthodoxy, divided the lands of the Ruthenian szlachta in Ukraine, and became the Cossack szlachta. The uprising was one of a series of catastrophic events for the Commonwealth, known as The Deluge, which greatly weakened the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and set the stage for its disintegration 100 years later.\n\nInfluential relatives of the Russian and Lithuanian szlachta in Moscow helped to create the Russian\u2013Polish alliance against Khmelnitsky's Cossacks, portrayed as rebels against order and against the private property of the Ruthenian Orthodox szlachta. Don Cossack raids on Crimea leaving Khmelnitsky without the aid of his usual Tatar allies. From the Russian perspective, the rebellion ended with the 1654 Treaty of Pereyaslav, in which, in order to overcome the Russian\u2013Polish alliance against them, the Khmelnitsky Cossacks pledged their loyalty to the Russian Tsar. In return, the Tsar guaranteed them his protection; recognized the Cossack starshyna (nobility), their property, and their autonomy under his rule; and freed the Cossacks from the Polish sphere of influence and the land claims of the Ruthenian szlachta.Only some of the Ruthenian szlachta of the Chernigov region, who had their origins in the Moscow state, saved their lands from division among Cossacks and became part of the Cossack szlachta. After this, the Ruthenian szlachta refrained from plans to have a Moscow Tsar as king of the Commonwealth, its own Micha\u0142 Korybut Wi\u015bniowiecki later becoming king. The last, ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to rebuild the Polish\u2013Cossack alliance and create a Polish\u2013Lithuanian\u2013Ruthenian Commonwealth was the 1658 Treaty of Hadiach. The treaty was approved by the Polish king and the Sejm, and by some of the Cossack starshyna, including hetman Ivan Vyhovsky. The treaty failed, however, because the starshyna were divided on the issue, and it had even less support among rank-and-file Cossacks.\nUnder Russian rule, the Cossack nation of the Zaporozhian Host was divided into two autonomous republics of the Moscow Tsardom: the Cossack Hetmanate, and the more independent Zaporizhia. These organisations gradually lost their autonomy, and were abolished by Catherine II in the late 18th century. The Hetmanate became the governorship of Little Russia, and Zaporizhia was absorbed into New Russia.\nIn 1775, the Lower Dnieper Zaporozhian Host was destroyed. Later, its high-ranking Cossack leaders were exiled to Siberia, its last chief, Petro Kalnyshevsky, becoming a prisoner of the Solovetsky Islands. The Cossacks established a new Sich in the Ottoman Empire without any involvement of the punished Cossack leaders.\n\n\n=== Black Sea, Azov and Danubian Sich Cossacks ===\n\nWith the destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich, many Zaporozhian Cossacks, especially the vast majority of Old Believers and other people from Greater Russia, defected to Turkey. There they settled in the area of the Danube river, and founded a new Sich. Some of these Cossacks settled on the Tisa river in the Austrian Empire, also forming a new Sich. A number of Ukrainian-speaking Eastern Orthodox Cossacks fled to territory under the control of the Ottoman Empire across the Danube, together with Cossacks of Greater Russian origin. There they formed a new host, before rejoining others in the Kuban. Many Ukrainian peasants and adventurers later joined the Danubian Sich. While Ukrainian folklore remembers the Danubian Sich, other new siches of Loyal Zaporozhians on the Bug and Dniester rivers did not achieve such fame.\nThe majority of Tisa and Danubian Sich Cossacks returned to Russia in 1828. They settled in the area north of the Azov Sea, becoming known as the Azov Cossacks. But the majority of Zaporozhian Cossacks, particularly the Ukrainian-speaking Eastern Orthodox, remained loyal to Russia despite Sich destruction. This group became known as the Black Sea Cossacks. Both Azov and Black Sea Cossacks were resettled to colonize the Kuban steppe, a crucial foothold for Russian expansion in the Caucasus.\nDuring the Cossack sojourn in Turkey, a new host was founded that numbered around 12,000 people by the end of 1778. Their settlement on the Russian border was approved by the Ottoman Empire after the Cossacks officially vowed to serve the sultan. Yet internal conflict, and the political manoeuvring of the Russian Empire, led to splits among the Cossacks. Some of the runaway Cossacks returned to Russia, where the Russian army used them to form new military bodies that also incorporated Greeks, Albanians, Crimean Tatars, and Gypsies. After the Russo-Turkish war of 1787\u20131792, most of these Cossacks were absorbed into the Black Sea Cossack Host, together with Loyal Zaporozhians. The Black Sea Host moved to the Kuban steppe. Most of the remaining Cossacks who had stayed in the Danube Delta returned to Russia in 1828, creating the Azov Cossack Host between Berdyansk and Mariupol. In 1860, more Cossacks were resettled in the North Caucasus, and merged into the Kuban Cossack Host.\n\n\n== Russian Cossacks ==\n\nThe native land of the Cossacks is defined by a line of Russian town-fortresses located on the border with the steppe, and stretching from the middle Volga to Ryazan and Tula, then breaking abruptly to the south and extending to the Dnieper via Pereyaslavl. This area was settled by a population of free people practicing various trades and crafts.\nThese people, constantly facing the Tatar warriors on the steppe frontier, received the Turkic name Cossacks (Kazaks), which was then extended to other free people in Russia. Many Cumans, who had assimilated Khazars, retreated to the Principality of Ryazan (Grand Duchy of Ryazan) after the Mongol invasion. The oldest mention in the annals is of Cossacks of the Russian principality of Ryazan serving the principality in the battle against the Tatars in 1444. In the 16th century, the Cossacks (primarily of Ryazan) were grouped in military and trading communities on the open steppe, and began to migrate into the area of the Don.\n\nCossacks served as border guards and protectors of towns, forts, settlements, and trading posts. They performed policing functions on the frontiers, and also came to represent an integral part of the Russian army. In the 16th century, to protect the borderland area from Tatar invasions, Cossacks carried out sentry and patrol duties, guarding against Crimean Tatars and nomads of the Nogai Horde in the steppe region.\nThe most popular weapons of the Cossack cavalrymen were the sabre, or shashka, and the long spear.\nFrom the 16th to 19th centuries, Russian Cossacks played a key role in the expansion of the Russian Empire into Siberia (particularly by Yermak Timofeyevich), the Caucasus, and Central Asia. Cossacks also served as guides to most Russian expeditions of civil and military geographers and surveyors, traders, and explorers. In 1648, the Russian Cossack Semyon Dezhnyov discovered a passage between North America and Asia. Cossack units played a role in many wars in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, including the Russo-Turkish Wars, the Russo-Persian Wars, and the annexation of Central Asia.\n\nWestern Europeans had a lot of contact with Cossacks during the Seven Years' War, and had seen Cossack patrols in Berlin. During Napoleon's Invasion of Russia, Cossacks were the Russian soldiers most feared by the French troops. Napoleon himself stated, \"Cossacks are the best light troops among all that exist. If I had them in my army, I would go through all the world with them.\" Cossacks also took part in the partisan war deep inside French-occupied Russian territory, attacking communications and supply lines. These attacks, carried out by Cossacks along with Russian light cavalry and other units, were one of the first developments of guerrilla warfare tactics and, to some extent, special operations as we know them today.\nFrenchmen had had few contacts with Cossacks before the Allies occupied Paris in 1814. As the most exotic of the Russian troops seen in France, Cossacks drew a great deal of attention. Bistrots appeared at some point after the Cossack occupation of Paris. While some folk etymologies claim that the French word \"bistro\" dates from this period, when Russian troops supposedly shouted \"Bystro!\" (\"quickly!\") at their dilatory wine waiters, most French linguists dispute this derivation.\n\n\n=== Don Cossacks ===\n\nThe Don Cossack Host (Russian: \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435, Vsevelikoye Voysko Donskoye) was either an independent or an autonomous democratic republic, located in present-day Southern Russia. It existed from the end of the 16th century until the early 20th century. There are two main theories of the origin of the Don Cossacks. Most respected historians support the migration theory, according to which they were Slavic colonists. The various autochthonous theories popular among the Cossacks themselves do not find confirmation in genetic studies. The gene pool comprises mainly the East Slavic component, with a significant Ukrainian contribution. There is no influence of the peoples of the Caucasus; and the steppe populations, represented by the Nogais, have only limited impact.The majority of Don Cossacks are either Eastern Orthodox or Christian Old Believers (\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u044f\u0434\u0446\u044b). Prior to the Russian Civil War, there were numerous religious minorities, including Muslims, Subbotniks, and Jews.\n\n\n=== Kuban Cossacks ===\n\nKuban Cossacks are Cossacks who live in the Kuban region of Russia. Although many Cossack groups came to inhabit the Western North Caucasus, most of the Kuban Cossacks are descendants of the Black Sea Cossack Host (originally the Zaporozhian Cossacks), and the Caucasus Line Cossack Host.\nA distinguishing feature is the Chupryna or Oseledets hairstyle, a roach haircut popular among some Kubanians. This tradition traces back to the Zaporizhian Sich.\n\n\n=== Terek Cossacks ===\nThe Terek Cossack Host was created in 1577 by free Cossacks resettling from the Volga to the Terek River. Local Terek Cossacks joined this host later. In 1792, the host was included in the Caucasus Line Cossack Host, from which it separated again in 1860, with Vladikavkaz as its capital. In 1916, the population of the host was 255,000, within an area of 1.9 million desyatinas.\n\n\n=== Yaik Cossacks ===\n\nThe Ural Cossack Host was formed from the Ural Cossacks, who had settled along the Ural River. Their alternative name, Yaik Cossacks, comes from the river's former name, changed by the government after Pugachev's Rebellion of 1773\u20131775. The Ural Cossacks spoke Russian, and identified as having primarily Russian ancestry, but also incorporated many Tatars into their ranks. In 1577, twenty years after Moscow had conquered the Volga from Kazan to Astrakhan, the government sent troops to disperse pirates and raiders along the Volga. Among them was Yermak Timofeyevich. Some escaped to flee southeast to the Ural River, where they joined the Yaik Cossacks. In 1580, they captured Saraichik. By 1591, they were fighting on behalf of the government in Moscow. Over the next century, they were officially recognized by the imperial government.\n\n\n=== Razin and Pugachev Rebellions ===\nAs a largely independent nation, the Cossacks had to defend their liberties and democratic traditions against the ever-expanding Muscovy, succeeded by Russian Empire. Their tendency to act independently of the Tsardom of Muscovy increased friction. The Tsardom's power began to grow in 1613, with the ascension of Mikhail Romanov to the throne following the Time of Troubles. The government began attempting to integrate the Cossacks into the Muscovite Tsardom by granting elite status and enforcing military service, thus creating divisions among the Cossacks themselves as they fought to retain their own traditions. The government's efforts to alter their traditional nomadic lifestyle resulted in the Cossacks being involved in nearly all the major disturbances in Russia over a 200-year period, including the rebellions led by Stepan Razin and Yemelyan Pugachev.\n\nAs Muscovy regained stability, discontent grew within the serf and peasant populations. Under Alexis Romanov, Mikhail's son, the Code of 1649 divided the Russian population into distinct and fixed hereditary categories. The Code increased tax revenue for the central government, and put an end to nomadism, to stabilize the social order by fixing people on the same land and in the same occupation as their families. Peasants were tied to the land, and townsmen were forced to take on their fathers' occupations. The increased tax burden fell mainly on the peasants, further widening the gap between poor and wealthy. Human and material resources became limited as the government organized more military expeditions, putting even greater strain on the peasants. War with Poland and Sweden in 1662 led to a fiscal crisis, and rioting across the country. Taxes, harsh conditions, and the gap between social classes drove peasants and serfs to flee. Many went to the Cossacks, knowing that the Cossacks would accept refugees and free them.\nThe Cossacks experienced difficulties under Tsar Alexis as more refugees arrived daily. The Tsar gave the Cossacks a subsidy of food, money, and military supplies in return for acting as border defense. These subsidies fluctuated often; a source of conflict between the Cossacks and the government. The war with Poland diverted necessary food and military shipments to the Cossacks as fugitive peasants swelled the population of the Cossack host. The influx of refugees troubled the Cossacks, not only because of the increased demand for food, but also because their large number meant the Cossacks could not absorb them into their culture by way of the traditional apprenticeship. Instead of taking these steps for proper assimilation into Cossack society, the runaway peasants spontaneously declared themselves Cossacks and lived alongside the true Cossacks, laboring or working as barge-haulers to earn food.\nDivisions among the Cossacks began to emerge as conditions worsened and Mikhail's son Alexis took the throne. Older Cossacks began to settle and become prosperous, enjoying privileges earned through obeying and assisting the Muscovite system. The old Cossacks started giving up the traditions and liberties that had been worth dying for, to obtain the pleasures of an elite life. The lawless and restless runaway peasants who called themselves Cossacks looked for adventure and revenge against the nobility that had caused them suffering. These Cossacks did not receive the government subsidies that the old Cossacks enjoyed, and had to work harder and longer for food and money. \n\n\n==== Razin's Rebellion ====\n\nThe divisions between the elite and the lawless led to the formation of a Cossack army, beginning in 1667 under Stenka Razin, and ultimately to the failure of Razin's rebellion.\nStenka Razin was born into an elite Cossack family, and had made many diplomatic visits to Moscow before organizing his rebellion. The Cossacks were Razin's main supporters, and followed him during his first Persian campaign in 1667, plundering and pillaging Persian cities on the Caspian Sea. They returned in 1669, ill and hungry, tired from fighting, but rich with plundered goods. Muscovy tried to gain support from the old Cossacks, asking the ataman, or Cossack chieftain, to prevent Razin from following through with his plans. But the ataman was Razin's godfather, and was swayed by Razin's promise of a share of expedition wealth. His reply was that the elite Cossacks were powerless against the band of rebels. The elite did not see much threat from Razin and his followers either, although they realized he could cause them problems with the Muscovite system if his following developed into a rebellion against the central government.Razin and his followers began to capture cities at the start of the rebellion, in 1669. They seized the towns of Tsaritsyn, Astrakhan, Saratov, and Samara, implementing democratic rule and releasing peasants from slavery as they went. Razin envisioned a united Cossack republic throughout the southern steppe, in which the towns and villages would operate under the democratic, Cossack style of government. Their sieges often took place in the runaway peasant Cossacks' old towns, leading them to wreak havoc there and take revenge on their old masters. The elder Cossacks began to see the rebels' advance as a problem, and in 1671 decided to comply with the government in order to receive more subsidies. On April 14, ataman Yakovlev led elders to destroy the rebel camp. They captured Razin, taking him soon afterward to Moscow to be executed.\nRazin's rebellion marked the beginning of the end of traditional Cossack practices. In August 1671, Muscovite envoys administered the oath of allegiance and the Cossacks swore loyalty to the tsar. While they still had internal autonomy, the Cossacks became Muscovite subjects, a transition that was a dividing point again in Pugachev's Rebellion.\n\n\n==== Pugachev's Rebellion ====\n\nFor the Cossack elite, noble status within the empire came at the price of their old liberties in the 18th century. Advancing agricultural settlement began to force the Cossacks to give up their traditional nomadic ways and adopt new forms of government. The government steadily changed the entire culture of the Cossacks. Peter the Great increased Cossack service obligations, and mobilized their forces to fight in far-off wars. Peter began establishing non-Cossack troops in fortresses along the Yaik River. In 1734, construction of a government fortress at Orenburg gave Cossacks a subordinate role in border defense. When the Yaik Cossacks sent a delegation to Peter with their grievances, Peter stripped the Cossacks of their autonomous status, and subordinated them to the War College rather than the College of Foreign Affairs. This consolidated the Cossacks' transition from border patrol to military servicemen. Over the next fifty years, the central government responded to Cossack grievances with arrests, floggings, and exiles.Under Catherine the Great, beginning in 1762, the Russian peasants and Cossacks again faced increased taxation, heavy military conscription, and grain shortages, as before Razin's rebellion. Peter III had extended freedom to former church serfs, freeing them from obligations and payments to church authorities, and had freed other peasants from serfdom, but Catherine did not follow through on these reforms. In 1767, the Empress refused to accept grievances directly from the peasantry. Peasants fled once again to the lands of the Cossacks, in particular the Yaik Host, whose people were committed to the old Cossack traditions. The changing government also burdened the Cossacks, extending its reach to reform Cossack traditions. Among ordinary Cossacks, hatred of the elite and central government rose. In 1772, a six\u2013month open rebellion ensued between the Yaik Cossacks and the central government.\n\nYemelyan Pugachev, a low-status Don Cossack, arrived in the Yaik Host in late 1772. There, he claimed to be Peter III, playing on the Cossack belief that Peter would have been an effective ruler but for his assassination in a plot by his wife, Catherine II. Many Yaik Cossacks believed Pugachev's claim, although those closest to him knew the truth. Others, who may have known of it, did not support Catherine II due to her disposal of Peter III, and also spread Pugachev's claim to be the late emperor.\nThe first of three phases of Pugachev's Rebellion began in September 1773. Most of the rebels' first prisoners were Cossacks who supported the elite. After a five-month siege of Orenburg, a military college became Pugachev's headquarters. Pugachev envisioned a Cossack tsardom, similar to Razin's vision of a united Cossack republic. The peasantry across Russia stirred with rumors and listened to the manifestos Pugachev issued. But the rebellion soon came to be seen as an inevitable failure. The Don Cossacks refused to help the final phase of the revolt, knowing that military troops were closely following Pugachev after lifting the siege of Orenburg, and following his flight from defeated Kazan. In September 1774, Pugachev's own Cossack lieutenants turned him over to the government troops.Opposition to centralization of political authority led the Cossacks to participate in Pugachev's Rebellion. After their defeat, the Cossack elite accepted government reforms, hoping to secure status within the nobility. The ordinary Cossacks had to follow and give up their traditions and liberties.\n\n\n=== In the Russian Empire ===\n\nCossack relations with the Tsardom of Russia were varied from the outset. At times they supported Russian military operations; at other times they rebelled against the central power. After one such uprising at the end of the 18th century, Russian forces destroyed the Zaporozhian Host. Many of the Cossacks who had remained loyal to the Russian Monarch and continued their service later moved to the Kuban. Others, choosing to continue a mercenary role, escaped control in the large Danube Delta. The service of the Cossacks in the Napoleonic wars led them to be celebrated as Russian folk heroes, and throughout the 19th century a \"powerful myth\" was promoted by the government that portrayed the Cossacks as having a special and unique bond to the Emperor. This image as the Cossacks as the ultra-patriotic defenders of not only Russia, but also of the House of Romanov was embraced by many ordinary Cossacks, making them into a force for conservatism.By the 19th century, the Russian Empire had annexed the territory of the Cossack Hosts, and controlled them by providing privileges for their service such as exemption from taxation and allowing them to own the land they farmed. At this time, the Cossacks served as military forces in many wars conducted by the Russian Empire. Cossacks were considered excellent for scouting and reconnaissance duties, and for ambushes. Their tactics in open battle were generally inferior to those of regular soldiers, such as the Dragoons. In 1840, the Cossack hosts included the Don, Black Sea, Astrakhan, Little Russia, Azov, Danube, Ural, Stavropol, Mesherya, Orenburg, Siberian, Tobolsk, Tomsk, Yeniseisk, Irkutsk, Sabaikal, Yakutsk, and Tartar voiskos. In the 1890s, the Ussuri, Semirechensk, and Amur Cossacks were added; the last had a regiment of elite mounted rifles.Increasingly as the 19th century went on, the Cossacks served as a mounted para-military police force in all of the various provinces of the vast Russian Empire, covering a territory stretching across Eurasia from what is now modern Poland to the banks of the river Amur that formed the Russian-Chinese border. The police forces of the Russian empire, especially in rural areas, were undermanned owning to the low wages while the officers of the Imperial Russian Army hated having their units deployed to put down domestic unrest, which was viewed as destructive towards morale and possibly a source of mutiny. For the government, deploying Cossacks as a para-military police force was the best solution as the Cossacks were viewed as one of the most social groups most loyal to the House of Romanov while their group solitary and isolation from local populations was felt to make them immune to revolutionary appeals. Traditionally, Cossacks were viewed in Russia as dashing, romantic horsemen with a rebellious aura about them, but their deployment as a mounted police force gave them a \"novel\" image as a rather violent and thuggish police force committed to upholding the social order that endures to this day. This change from an irregular cavalry force that fought against the enemies of Russia such as the Ottoman empire and France to a mounted police force deployed against the subjects of the empire caused much disquiet within the Cossack Hosts as it was contrary to the heroic ethos of frontier warfare that the Cossacks cherished.In 1879, the Shah of Iran, Nasir al-Din, who had been impressed with the equestrian skills and distinctive uniforms of the Cossacks while on a visit to Russia the previous year, requested that the Emperor Alexander II sent some Cossacks to train a Cossack force for himself. Alexander granted his request and later in 1879 a group of 9 Cossacks led by Kuban Cossack Colonel Aleksey Domantovich arrived in Tehran to train the Persian Cossack Brigade. The shah very much liked the colorful uniforms of the Cossacks and Domantovich devised uniforms for one regiment of the brigade based on the uniforms of the Kuban Cossack Host and another regiment had its uniform based on the Terek Cossack Host. The uniforms of the Cossacks were based on the flamboyant costumes of the peoples of the Caucasus, and what in Russia were viewed as exotic and colorful uniforms were viewed in Iran as a symbol of Russianness. Nasir al-Din, who was widely regarded as a deeply superficial and shallow man, was not interested in having his Cossack Brigade be an effective military force, and for him merely seeing his brigade ride before him while dressed in their brightly colored uniforms was quite enough. Over the shah's indifference, Domantovich and his Cossacks worked hard on training the Cossack Brigade, which became the only disciplined unit in the entire Persian Army, and thus of considerable importance in maintaining the shah's authority.      \n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Cossack communities enjoyed a privileged tax-free status in the Russian Empire, although they had a 20-year military service commitment (reduced to 18 years from 1909). They were on active duty for five years, but could fulfill their remaining obligation with the reserves. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Russian Cossacks numbered 4.5 million. They were organized as independent regional hosts, each comprising a number of regiments. The need for the government to call up Cossack men to serve either with the Army or a mounted police force caused many social and economic problems, which compounded by the growing impoverishment the communities of the Hosts.       \nTreated as a separate and elite community by the Tsar, the Cossacks rewarded his government with strong loyalty. His administration frequently used Cossack units to suppress domestic disorder, especially during the Russian Revolution of 1905. The Imperial Government depended heavily on the perceived reliability of the Cossacks. By the early 20th century, their decentralized communities and semi-feudal military service were coming to be seen as obsolete. The Russian Army Command, which had worked to professionalize its forces, considered the Cossacks less well disciplined, trained, and mounted than the hussars, dragoons, and lancers of the regular cavalry. The Cossack qualities of initiative and rough-riding skills were not always fully appreciated. As a result, Cossack units were frequently broken up into small detachments for use as scouts, messengers, or picturesque escorts.\n\n\n==== Cossacks between 1900 and 1917 ====\n\nIn 1905, the Cossack hosts experienced deep mobilization of their menfolk amid the fighting of the Russo-Japanese War in Manchuria and the outbreak of revolution within the Russian Empire. Like other peoples of the empire, some Cossack stanitsas voiced grievances against the regime by defying mobilization orders, or by making relatively liberal political demands. But these infractions were eclipsed by the prominent role of Cossack detachments in stampeding demonstrators and restoring order in the countryside. Subsequently, the wider population viewed the Cossacks as instruments of reaction. Tsar Nicholas II reinforced this concept by issuing new charters, medals, and bonuses to Cossack units in recognition for their performance during the Revolution of 1905.In September 1906, reflecting the success of the Cossacks in putting down the Revolution of 1905, Polkovnik Vladimir Liakhov was sent to Iran to command the train and lead the Persian Cossack Brigade. Liakhov had led a Cossack squad in putting down the revolution in the Caucasus, and following the outbreak of the Constitutional Revolution in Iran he was sent to Tehran to recognize the Cossack Brigade as a force for power to the shah. The Persian Cossack Brigade had not been paid for months and proved to be dubious loyalty to the House of Qajar during the Constructional revolution while its Russian officers were uncertain what to do with Russia itself in revolution. Liakhov, a vigorous, able, and reactionary officer firmly committed to upholding absolute monarchies whatever in Russia or Iran, transformed the Persian Cossack Brigade into a mounted para-military police force rather than as a combat force. Liakhov was close to the new Shah, Mohammed Ali, who ascended to the Peacock Throne in January 1907, and it was due to the shah's patronage the Persian Cossack Brigade emerged as the main bulwark of the Iranian state. In June 1908, Liakhov led the Cossack Brigade in bombarding Majlis (Parliament) while being appointed military governor of Tehran. Reza Khan, who became the first Iranian to command the Cossack Brigade led the coup d'etat in 1921 and in 1925 deposed the Qajars to found a new dynasty.   \nAfter the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Cossacks became a key component in the cavalry of the Imperial Russian Army. The mounted Cossacks made up 38 regiments, plus some infantry battalions and 52 horse artillery batteries. Initially, each Russian cavalry division included a regiment of Cossacks in addition to regular units of hussars, lancers, and dragoons. By 1916, the Cossacks' wartime strength had expanded to 160 regiments, plus 176 independent sotnias (squadrons) employed as detached units.The importance of cavalry in the frontlines faded after the opening phase of the war settled into a stalemate. During the remainder of the war, Cossack units were dismounted to fight in trenches, held in reserve to exploit a rare breakthrough, or assigned various duties in the rear. Those duties included rounding up deserters, providing escorts to war prisoners, and razing villages and farms in accordance with Russia's scorched earth policy.\n\n\n=== After the February Revolution, 1917 ===\nAt the outbreak of the disorder on 8 March 1917 that led to the overthrow of the tsarist regime, approximately 3,200 Cossacks from the Don, Kuban, and Terek Hosts were stationed in Petrograd. Although they comprised only a fraction of the 300,000 troops in the proximity of the Russian capital, their general defection on the second day of unrest (10 March) enthused raucous crowds and stunned the authorities and remaining loyal units.In the aftermath of the February Revolution, the Cossacks hosts were authorized by the War Ministry of the Russian Provisional Government to overhaul their administrations. Cossack assemblies (known as krugs or, in the case of the Kuban Cossacks, a rada) were organized at regional level to elect atamans and pass resolutions. At national level, an all-Cossack congress was convened in Petrograd. This congress formed the Union of Cossack Hosts, ostensibly to represent the interests of Cossacks across Russia.\nDuring the course of 1917, the nascent Cossack governments formed by the krugs and atamans increasingly challenged the Provisional Government's authority in the borderlands. The various Cossack governments themselves faced rivals, in the form of national councils organized by neighboring minorities, and of soviets and zemstvos formed by non-Cossack Russians, especially the so-called \"outlanders\" who had immigrated to Cossack lands.\n\n\n=== Bolshevik Uprising and Civil War, 1917\u20131922 ===\nSoon after the Bolsheviks seized power in Petrograd on 7\u20138 November 1917, most Cossack atamans and their government refused to recognize the legitimacy of the new regime. The Don Cossack ataman, Aleksey Kaledin, went as far as to invite opponents of the Bolsheviks to the Don Host. But the position of many Cossack governments was far from secure, even within the boundaries of their hosts. In some areas, soviets formed by outlanders and soldiers rivaled the Cossack government, and ethnic minorities also tried to acquire a measure of self-rule. Even the Cossack communities themselves were divided, as the atamans tended to represent the interests of prosperous landowners and the officer corps. Poorer Cossacks, and those serving in the army, were susceptible to Bolshevik propaganda promising to spare \u201ctoiling Cossacks\u201d from land appropriation.The unwillingness of rank-and-file Cossacks to vigorously defend the Cossack government enabled the Red Army to occupy the vast majority of Cossack lands by late spring of 1918. But the Bolsheviks\u2019 policy of requisitioning grain and foodstuffs from the countryside to supply Russia's starving northern cities quickly fomented revolt among Cossack communities. These Cossack rebels elected new atamans and made common cause with other anticommunist forces, such as the Volunteer Army in South Russia. Subsequently, the Cossack homelands became bases for the White movement during the Russian Civil War.Throughout the civil war, Cossacks sometimes fought as an independent ally, and other times as an auxiliary, of White armies. In South Russia, the Armed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) under General Anton Denikin relied heavily on conscripts from the Don and Kuban Cossack Hosts to fill their ranks. Through the Cossacks, the White armies acquired experienced, skilled horsemen that the Red Army was unable to match until late in the conflict. But the relationship between Cossack governments and the White leaders was frequently acrimonious. Cossack units were often ill-disciplined, and prone to bouts of looting and violence that caused the peasantry to resent the Whites. In Ukraine, Kuban and Terek Cossack squadrons carried out pogroms against Jews, despite orders from Denikin condemning such activity. Kuban Cossack politicians, wanting a semi-independent state of their own, frequently agitated against the AFSR command. In the Russian Far East, anticommunist Transbaikal and Ussuri Cossacks undermined the rear of Siberia's White armies by disrupting traffic on the Trans-Siberian Railway and engaging in acts of banditry that fueled a potent insurgency in that region.As the Red Army gained the initiative in the civil war during late 1919 and early 1920, Cossack soldiers, their families, and sometimes entire stanitsas retreated with the Whites. Some continued to fight with the Whites in the conflict's waning stages in Crimea and the Russian Far East. As many as 80,000\u2013100,000 Cossacks eventually joined the defeated Whites in exile.Although the Cossacks were sometimes portrayed by Bolsheviks and, later, \u00e9migr\u00e9 historians, as a monolithic counterrevolutionary group during the civil war, there were many Cossacks who fought with the Red Army throughout the conflict. Many poorer Cossack communities also remained susceptible to communist propaganda. In late 1918 and early 1919, widespread desertion and defection among Don, Ural, and Orenburg Cossacks fighting with the Whites produced a military crisis that was exploited by the Red Army in those sectors. After the main White armies were defeated in early 1920, many Cossack soldiers switched their allegiance to the Bolsheviks, and fought with the Red Army against the Poles and in other operations.\n\n\n=== Cossacks in the Soviet Union, 1917\u20131945 ===\nOn 22 December 1917, the Council of People's Commissars effectively abolished the Cossack estate by ending their military service requirements and privileges. After the widespread anticommunist rebellions among Cossacks in 1918, the Soviet regime's approach hardened in early 1919, when the Red Army occupied Cossack districts in the Urals and northern Don. The Bolsheviks embarked on a genocidal policy of \u201cde-Cossackization\u201d, intended to end the Cossack threat to the Soviet regime. This was pursued through resettlement, widespread executions of Cossack veterans from the White armies, and favoring the outlanders within the Cossack hosts. Ultimately, the de-Cossackization campaign led to a renewed rebellion among Cossacks in Soviet-occupied districts, and produced a new round of setbacks for the Red Army in 1919.When the victorious Red Army again occupied Cossack districts in late 1919 and 1920, the Soviet regime did not officially reauthorize the implementation of de-Cossackization. There is, however, disagreement among historians as to the degree of Cossack persecution by the Soviet regime. For example, the Cossack hosts were broken up among new provinces or autonomous republics. Some Cossacks, especially in areas of the former Terek host, were resettled so their lands could be turned over to natives displaced from them during the initial Russian and Cossack colonization of the area. At the local level, the stereotype that Cossacks were inherent counterrevolutionaries likely persisted among some Communist officials, causing them to target, or discriminate against, Cossacks despite orders from Moscow to focus on class enemies among Cossacks rather than the Cossack people in general.Rebellions in the former Cossack territories erupted occasionally during the interwar period. In 1920\u20131921, disgruntlement with continued Soviet grain-requisitioning activities provoked a series of revolts among Cossack and outlander communities in South Russia. The former Cossack territories of South Russia and the Urals also experienced a devastating famine in 1921\u20131922. In 1932\u20131933, another famine, known as the Holodomor, devastated Ukraine and some parts of South Russia, causing a population decline of about 20\u201330%. While urban areas were less affected, the decline was even higher in the rural areas, populated largely by ethnic Cossacks. Robert Conquest estimates the number of famine-related deaths in the Northern Caucasus at about one million. Government officials expropriated grain and other produce from rural Cossack families, leaving them to starve and die. Many families were forced from their homes in the severe winter and froze to death. Mikhail Sholokhov's letters to Joseph Stalin document the conditions and widespread deaths, as do eyewitness accounts. Besides starvation, the collectivization and dekulakization campaigns of the early 1930s threatened Cossacks with deportation to labor camps, or outright execution by Soviet security organs.In April 1936, the Soviet regime began to relax its restrictions on Cossacks, allowing them to serve openly in the Red Army. Two existing cavalry divisions were renamed as Cossack divisions, and three new Cossack cavalry divisions were established. Under the new Soviet designation, anyone from the former Cossack territories of the North Caucasus, provided they were not Circassians or other ethnic minorities, could claim Cossack status.\n\nIn World War II, during the German invasion of the Soviet Union, many Cossacks continued to serve in the Red Army. Some fought as cavalry in the Cossack divisions, such as the 17th Kuban Cossack Cavalry Corps and the famous Lev Dovator Corps, later awarded the honorific designation \u201cguard\u201d in recognition of its performance. Other Cossacks fought as partisans, although the partisan movement did not acquire significant traction during the German occupation of the traditional Cossack homelands in the North Caucasus.\n\n\n=== Anticommunist Cossacks in Exile and World War II, 1920\u20131945 ===\nThe Cossack emigration consisted largely of relatively young men who had served, and retreated with, the White armies. Although hostile to communism, the Cossack \u00e9migr\u00e9s remained broadly divided over whether their people should pursue a separatist course to acquire independence or retain their close ties with a future post-Soviet Russia. Many quickly became disillusioned with life abroad. Throughout the 1920s, thousands of exiled Cossacks voluntarily returned to Russia through repatriation efforts sponsored by France, the League of Nations, and even the Soviet Union.The Cossacks who remained abroad settled primarily in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, France, Xinjiang, and Manchuria. Some managed to create farming communities in Yugoslavia and Manchuria, but most eventually took up employment as laborers in construction, agriculture, or industry. A few showcased their lost culture to foreigners by performing stunts in circuses or serenading audiences in choirs.\nCossacks who were determined to carry on the fight against communism frequently found employment with foreign powers hostile to Soviet Russia. In Manchuria, thousands of Cossacks and White \u00e9migr\u00e9s enlisted in the army of that region's warlord, Zhang Zuolin. After Japan's Kwantung Army occupied Manchuria in 1932, the ataman of the Transbaikal Cossacks, Grigory Semyonov, led collaboration efforts between Cossack \u00e9migr\u00e9s and the Japanese military.In the initial phase of Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Cossack \u00e9migr\u00e9s were initially barred from political activity or travelling into the occupied Eastern territories. Hitler had no intention of entertaining the political aspirations of the Cossacks, or any minority group, in the USSR. As a result, collaboration between Cossacks and the Wehrmacht began in ad hoc manner through localized agreements between German field commanders and Cossack defectors from the Red Army. Hitler did not officially sanction the recruitment of Cossacks and lift the restrictions imposed on \u00e9migr\u00e9s until the second year of the Nazi-Soviet conflict. During their brief occupation of the North Caucasus region, the Germans actively recruited Cossacks into detachments and local self-defense militias. The Germans even experimented with a self-governing district of Cossack communities in the Kuban region. When the Wehrmacht withdrew from the North Caucasus region in early 1943, tens of thousands of Cossacks retreated with them, either out of conviction or to avoid Soviet reprisals.In 1943, the Germans formed the 1st Cossack Cavalry Division, under the command of General Helmuth von Pannwitz. While its ranks mostly comprised deserters from the Red Army, many of its officers and NCOs were Cossack \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had received training at one of the cadet schools established by the White Army in Yugoslavia. The division was deployed to occupied Croatia to fight Tito's Partisans. There, its performance was generally effective, although at times brutal. In late 1944, the 1st Cossack Cavalry Division was admitted into the Waffen-SS, and enlarged into the XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps.In late 1943, the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories and Wehrmacht headquarters issued a joint proclamation promising the Cossacks independence once their homelands were \u201cliberated\u201d from the Red Army. The Germans followed this up by establishing the Cossack Central Administration, under the leadership of the former Don Cossack ataman, Pyotr Krasnov. Although it had many attributes of a government-in-exile, the Cossack Central Administration lacked any control over foreign policy or the deployment of Cossack troops in the Wehrmacht. In early 1945, Krasnov and his staff joined a group of 20,000\u201325,000 Cossack refugees and irregulars known as \u201cCossachi Stan\u201d. This group, then led by Timofey Domanov, had fled the North Caucasus alongside the Germans in 1943, and was moved between Kamianets-Podilskyi in Ukraine, Navahrudak in Belarus, and Tolmezzo, Italy.In early May 1945, in the closing days of WWII, both Domanov's \u201cCossachi Stan\u201d and Pannwitz's XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps retreated into Austria, where they surrendered to the British. Many Cossack accounts allege that British officers had given them, or their leaders, a guarantee that they would not be forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union, but there is no hard evidence that such a promise was made. At the end of the month, and in early June 1945, the majority of Cossacks from both groups were transferred to Red Army and SMERSH custody at the Soviet demarcation line in Judenburg, Austria. This episode is known as the Betrayal of the Cossacks, and resulted in sentences of hard labor or execution for the majority of the repatriated Cossacks.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\nFollowing the war, Cossack units, and the cavalry in general, were rendered obsolete and released from the Soviet Army. In the post-war years, many Cossack descendants were thought of as simple peasants, and those who lived in one of the autonomous republics usually gave way to the local minority and migrated elsewhere, particularly to the Baltic region.\n\nDuring the Perestroika era of the Soviet Union of the late 1980s, many descendants of the Cossacks became enthusiastic about reviving their national traditions. In 1988, the Soviet Union passed a law allowing the reestablishment of former hosts and creation of new ones. The ataman of the largest, the Almighty Don Host, was granted Marshal rank and the right to form a new host. Simultaneously, many attempts were made to increase Cossack impact on Russian society, and throughout the 1990s many regional authorities agreed to hand over some local administration and policing duties to the Cossacks.\nAccording to the 2002 Russian Census, 140,028 people currently self-identify as ethnic Cossacks. Between 3.5 and 5 million people associate themselves with the Cossack identity in post-Soviet Russia and around the world.Cossacks have taken an active part in many of the conflicts that have taken place since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. These include the War of Transnistria, Georgian\u2013Abkhazian conflict, Georgian\u2013Ossetian conflict, First Chechen War, Second Chechen War, and the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine and subsequent War in Donbass.\n\n\n== Culture and organization ==\nIn early times, an ataman (later called hetman) commanded a Cossack band. He was elected by the tribe members at a Cossack rada, as were the other important officials: the judge, the scribe, the lesser officials, and the clergy. The ataman's symbol of power was a ceremonial mace, a bulava. Today, Russian Cossacks are led by atamans, and Ukrainian Cossacks by hetmans.\n\nAfter the Polish\u2013Russian Treaty of Andrusovo split Ukraine along the Dnieper River in 1667, Ukrainian Cossacks were known as Left-bank and Right-bank Cossacks. The ataman had executive powers, and in wartime was the supreme commander in the field. Legislative power was given to the Band Assembly (Rada). The senior officers were called starshyna. In the absence of written laws, the Cossacks were governed by the \"Cossack Traditions\" \u2013 the common, unwritten law.\nCossack society and government were heavily militarized. The nation was called a host (vois\u2019ko, or viys\u2019ko, translated as \"army\"). The people and territories were subdivided into regimental and company districts, and village posts (polky, sotni, and stanytsi). A unit of a Cossack troop could be called a kuren. Each Cossack settlement, alone or in conjunction with neighboring settlements, formed military units and regiments of light cavalry or, in the case of Siberian Cossacks, mounted infantry. They could respond to a threat on very short notice.\nA high regard for education was a tradition among the Cossacks of Ukraine. In 1654, when Macarios III Zaim,\nthe Patriarch of Antioch, traveled to Moscow through Ukraine, his son, Deacon Paul Allepscius, wrote the following report:\n\nAll over the land of Rus', i.e., among the Cossacks, we have noticed a remarkable feature which made us marvel; all of them, with the exception of only a few among them, even the majority of their wives and daughters, can read and know the order of the church-services as well as the church melodies. Besides that, their priests take care and educate the orphans, not allowing them to wander in the streets ignorant and unattended.\n\n\n=== Settlements ===\nRussian Cossacks founded numerous settlements (stanitsas) and fortresses along troublesome borders. These included the forts Verny (Almaty, Kazakhstan) in south Central Asia; Grozny in North Caucasus; Fort Alexandrovsk (Fort Shevchenko, Kazakhstan); Krasnovodsk (Turkmenbashi, Turkmenistan); Novonikolayevskaya stanitsa (Bautino, Kazakhstan); Blagoveshchensk; and towns and settlements along the Ural, Ishim, Irtysh, Ob, Yenisei, Lena, Amur, Anadyr (Chukotka), and Ussuri Rivers. A group of Albazin Cossacks settled in China as early as 1685.\nCossacks interacted with nearby peoples, and exchanged cultural influences (the Terek Cossacks, for example, were heavily influenced by the culture of North Caucasian tribes). They also frequently intermarried with local non-Cossack settlers and local inhabitants, regardless of race or origin, sometimes setting aside religious restrictions. War brides brought from distant lands were also common in Cossack families. General Bogaevsky, a commander in the Russian Volunteer Army, mentions in his 1918 memoir that one of his Cossacks, Sotnik Khoperski, was a native Chinese who had been brought back as a child from Manchuria during the Russian-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905, and adopted and raised by a Cossack family.\n\n\n=== Family life ===\n\nCossack family values as expressed in 21st century Russia are simple, rigid, and very traditional compared to those of contemporary Western culture. In theory, men build the home and provide an income, and women take care of the family and provide for the children and household. Traditional Russian values, culture and Orthodox Christianity form the bedrock of their beliefs.Cossacks, particularly those in rural areas, tend to have more children than most other people in Russia. Rural Cossacks often observe traditional kinship systems, living in large clans of extended family. These are led by an elder patriarch, usually a grandfather, who often has the title of Ataman.\nHistorically, when Cossack men fought in permanent wars far from home, the women took over the role of family leaders. Women were also called upon to physically defend their villages and towns from enemy attacks. In some cases, they raided and disarmed neighboring villages composed of other ethnic groups. Leo Tolstoy described such Cossack female chauvinism in his novel, The Cossacks.\nWhen the Malorossian Cossack regiments were disbanded, those Cossacks who were not promoted to nobility, or did not join other estates, were united into a civil Cossack estate. Sergei Korolev's mother was the daughter of a leader of the civil estate of the Zaporozhian Sich.\n\n\n=== Popular image ===\n\nCossacks have long appealed to romantics as idealising freedom and resistance to external authority, and their military exploits against their enemies have contributed to this favorable image. For others, Cossacks are a symbol of repression, for their role in suppressing popular uprisings in the Russian Empire, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648\u20131657, and in pogroms, including those perpetrated by the Terek Cossacks during the Russian revolution and by various Cossack atamans in Ukraine in 1919, among them atamans Zeleny, Grigoriev, and Semosenko.\n\nLiterary reflections of Cossack culture abound in Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish literature, particularly in the works of Nikolai Gogol (Taras Bulba), Taras Shevchenko, Mikhail Sholokhov (And Quiet Flows the Don), Henryk Sienkiewicz (With Fire and Sword). One of Leo Tolstoy's first novellas, The Cossacks, depicts their autonomy and estrangement from Moscow and from centralized rule. Many of Isaac Babel's stories (for instance, those in Red Cavalry) depict Cossack soldiers, and were based on Babel's experiences as a war correspondent attached to the 1st Cavalry Army. \nPolish Romantic literature also commonly dealt with Cossack themes. Some of the Polish writers of this period (for instance, Micha\u0142 Czajkowski and J\u00f3zef Bohdan Zaleski) were known as \"Cossacophiles\" who wholeheartedly celebrated the Cossack history and lifestyle in their works. Others, such as Henryk Rzewuski and Micha\u0142 Grabowski, were more critical in their approach.In the literature of Western Europe, Cossacks appear in Byron's poem \"Mazeppa\", Tennyson's \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\", and Richard Connell's short story \"The Most Dangerous Game\". In many stories by adventure writer Harold Lamb, the main character is a Cossack.\nHistoriography interprets Cossackdom in imperial and colonial terms. In Ukraine, where Cossackdom represents historical and cultural heritage, some people have begun attempting to recreate the images of Ukrainian Cossacks. Traditional Ukrainian culture is often tied in with the Cossacks, and the Ukrainian government actively supports these attempts. The traditional Cossack bulava serves as a symbol of the Ukrainian presidency, and the island of Khortytsia, the origin and center of the Zaporozhian Sich, has been restored. The video game Cossacks: European Wars is a Ukrainian-made game series influenced by Cossack culture.\nSince the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, many have begun seeing Russian Cossacks as defenders of Russian sovereignty. Cossacks have reestablished all of their hosts, and have taken over police and even administrative duties in their homelands. The Russian military has also taken advantage of patriotic feelings among the Cossacks as the hosts have become larger and more organised, and has in the past turned over some of its surplus military equipment to them.\nCossacks also play a large cultural role in the South of Russia. Rural ethnic Russian inhabitants of the Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar, and Stavropol territories, and of the autonomous republics of the Northern Caucasus, regard themselves as consisting almost exclusively of at least spiritual descendants of the Cossacks. As such, the region has had a reputation, even in Soviet times, for its high discipline, low crime, and conservative views. These areas have high rates of religious attendance, and of literacy.Cossacks are also mentioned outside Europe. The Japanese anime The Doraemons, part of the larger Doraemon anime series, has a Cossack character, Dora-nichov, who is from Russia.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe official military march of Russian Cossacks units is Cossacks in Berlin, composed by Dmitry Pokrass and Daniil Pokrass, with lyrics being made by Caesar Solodar. Solodar was present when Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel signed the act of surrender to allied forces. That same day, he left for Moscow and by the evening of 9 May, the song was written. The lyrics are as follows:\nEnglish Translation\nOn Berlin\u2019s pavement.\nThe horses from Don area were going\nTossing by its mane\nThe rider is singing: \"Eh, guys, it is not firstly for us\nTo water Cossacks\u2019 horses\nFrom an alien river\"Cossacks\nCossacks\nOur Cossacks are riding to BerlinHe leads horses at a slow pace\nAnd sees that the girl, who has a signal flag in her hand\nAnd who has a nice plait under her sided cap\nStands at the corner\nHer slender waist is like a rod\nAnd her eyes look by blue\nShe bawls to the Cossack:\n\"Do not slow down traffic!\"Cossacks\nCossacks\nOur Cossacks are riding to BerlinHe is glad to stay more long here\nBut he caught her angry eye\nAnd bawled reluctantly\nOn riding: \"Come at a trot!\"\nThe cavalry went by dashingly\nAnd the girl blossomed -\nShe presents the tender look which doesn't correspond military regulations\nTo the CossackCossacks\nCossacks\nOur Cossacks are riding to BerlinThe horseman is riding again\nOn Berlin\u2019s pavement\nHe is singing\nAbout his love to the girl: :\"Although I am far from Pacific Don\nAlthough I am far from my sweet home\nI met the girl-fellow countryman\nEven in Berlin!\"Cossacks\nCossacks,\nOur Cossacks are riding to BerlinThe S. Tvorun arrangement of the Zaporizhian March (known as the Cossack march) is one of the main marches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, replacing Farewell of Slavianka in 1991 as the official sendoff music for army recruits. The Kuban Cossack Choir is a leading folkloric ensemble that reflects the dances and folklore of the Kuban Cossack.\n\n\n=== Public activities ===\n\nThe 4th Guards Cossacks Cavalry Corps took part in the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945 on Red Square. In 2015, a contingent of Kuban Cossacks (led by Head of the All-Russian Cossack Society, Cossack General Nikolai Doluda) took part in the 70th anniversary Moscow Victory Day Parade for the first time. Although the Kuban Cossacks were not able to return to the parade for the 75th anniversary in 2020 (due to COVID-19 restrictions), a Don Cossack contingent took part in its place. During the latter parade, they carried a military flag handed by President Vladimir Putin. General Doluda described the participation of the Cossacks in the Victory Day Parade as \"an example of an unbroken spirit\".In late April of every year, a parade of the Kuban Cossack army is held in Krasnodar, dedicated to the anniversary of the adoption of the law on the rehabilitation of the Cossacks. There is usually a traditional prayer service, before the Cossack pass along Krasnaya Street to the City Square, to which the parade begins at 12:00 am.\nThe parade is opened by a platoon of drummers of the Novorossiysk Cossack Cadet Corps and among the participants in the parade are  equestrian groups, honor guards and youth cadet corps.\n\n\n=== Ranks ===\n\nThe Russian Empire organised its Cossacks into several voiskos (hosts), which lived along the Russian border and internal borders between Russian and non-Russian peoples. Each host originally had its own leadership, ranks, regalia, and uniforms. By the late 19th century, ranks were standardized following the example of the Imperial Russian Army. The ranks and insignia were kept after the 1988 law allowing the hosts to reform, and the 2005 law legally recognizing the hosts as a combat service. They are given below as per all military tickets that are standard for the Russian Army.\n\n*Rank presently absent in the Russian Army\n*The application of the ranks Polkovnik and General is only stable for small hosts. Large hosts are divided into divisions, and consequently the Russian Army sub-ranks General-mayor, General-leytenant and General-polkovnik are used to distinguish the atamans' hierarchy of command, the supreme ataman having the highest rank available. In this case, the shoulder insignia has a dedicated one-, two- and three-star alignment, as is normal in the Russian Army. Otherwise, it will be blank.\nAs with the ranks Polkovnik and General, the Colonel ranks are only stable for small hosts, being given to atamans of regional and district status. The smallest unit, the stanitsa, is commanded by a Yesaul. If the region or district lacks any other stanitsas, the rank Polkovnik is applied automatically, but with no stars on the shoulder. As the hosts continue to grow, starless shoulder patches are becoming increasingly rare.\nIn addition, the supreme ataman of the largest Don Cossack Host is officially titled Marshal, and so wears insignia derived from the Russian/Soviet Marshal ranks, including the diamond Marshal Star. This is because the Don Cossack Supreme Ataman is recognized as the official head of all Cossack armies, including those outside the present Russian borders. He also has the authority to recognize and dissolve new hosts.\n\n\n=== Uniforms ===\n\nCossacks were expected to provide their own uniforms. While these were sometimes manufactured in bulk by factories owned by the individual host, families often handed down garments or made them within the household. Accordingly, individual items might vary from those laid down by regulation, or be of obsolete pattern. Each host had distinctive uniform colourings. Similar uniforms are in service today amongst the Cossacks of Russia.\nFor most hosts, the basic uniform consisted of the standard loose-fitting tunics and wide trousers typical of Russian regular troops from 1881 to 1908, and shown in the two photographs opposite. The Caucasian hosts (Kuban and Terek) wore the very long, open-fronted, cherkesska coats with ornamental cartridge loops and coloured beshmets (waistcoats). These have come to epitomize the popular image of the Cossacks. Most hosts wore fleece hats with coloured cloth tops in full dress, and round caps, with or without peaks, for ordinary duties. These caps were worn sharply slanted to one side by the rank-and-file of cossack regiments, over hair trimmed longer than that of ordinary Russian soldiers. The two Caucasian hosts wore high fleece caps on most occasions, together with black felt cloaks (burke) in bad weather.Until 1909, Cossack regiments in summer wore white gymnasterkas (blouses), and cap covers of standard Russian army pattern. The shoulder straps and cap bands were in the host colour, as detailed below. From 1910 to 1918, they wore a khaki-grey jacket for field wear. The dress uniform had blue or green breeches with broad, coloured stripes in the host colour, which were often worn with the service jacket.\nWhile most Cossacks served as cavalry, several of the larger hosts had infantry and artillery units. Four regiments of Cossacks formed part of the Imperial Guard, as well as the Konvoi\u2014the tsar's mounted escort. The Imperial Guard regiments wore tailored, government-issue uniforms, which were colourful and elaborate. For example, the Konvoi wore scarlet cherkesskas, white beshmets, and red crowns on their fleece hats. The Guard Cossacks of His Majesty and the Ataman's Guard Cossacks, both drawn from the Don Host, wore red, and light blue, coats respectively. The Combined Cossack Guard Regiment, comprising representative detachments from each of the remaining hosts, wore red, light blue, crimson, or orange coats, according to squadron.\n\n\n== Modern-day Cossack identity ==\nEthnic, or \"born\" (prirodnye), Cossacks are those who can trace, or claim to trace, their ancestry to people and families identified as Cossack in the Tsarist era. They tend to be Christian, practicing as Orthodox Christians or Old Believers. This group includes the edinovertsy, who identify as Slavic.\nOthers may be initiated as Cossacks, particularly men in military service. Such initiates may be neither ethnic Slavs, nor Christian. Not all agree that such initiates should be considered Cossack. There is no consensus on an initiation rite or rules.\nIn other cases, individuals may wear Cossack uniform and pass themselves off as Cossack, perhaps because there is a large ethnic Cossack population in the area and the person wants to fit in. Others adopt Cossack clothing in an attempt to take on some of their mythic status. Ethnic Cossacks refer to the re-enactors as ryazhenye (\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0435, or \"dressed up phonies\").Because of the lack of consensus on how to define Cossacks, accurate numbers are not available. According to the Russian Census of 2010, 67,573 people identify as ethnic Cossack in Russia. Between 3.5 and 5 million people associate themselves with the Cossack identity in Europe and across the world.\n\n\n== Registered Cossacks of the Russian Federation ==\n\nThe Registered Cossacks of the Russian Federation are the Cossack paramilitary formation providing public and other services, under the Federal Law of the Russian Federation dated December 5, 2005, No. 154-FZ \"On State Service of the Russian Cossacks\".\n\n\n== All-Russian Cossack Society ==\nThe All-Russian Cossack Society (Russian: \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0447\u044c\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430) is responsible for the coordination of the activities of all 11 registered Cossack hosts, particularly in the spheres of patriotic education and the continuity of historical Cossack customs and traditions. Both registered and non-registered Cossack organizations can be part of the society. On 4 November 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Kuban Vice Governor and Kuban Cossack Host Ataman Nikolai Doluda as Ataman of the All-Russia Cossack Society. Cossack General Doluda was appointed two years after the atamans and the Cossacks created it in October 2017. The idea was first proposed in 1994. On 27 November 2018, delegates of the Constitutive Assembly voted for the establishment of the society and adopted its official statute. Doluda was then nominated for head of the society, in which he was backed by the Presidential Council on Cossack Affairs.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nWitzenrath, Christoph (2007).

It is the country's main port on the Black Sea and the leading Russian port for exporting grain. It is one of the few cities honored with the title of the Hero City. Population: 241,952\u2009(2010 Census); 232,079\u2009(2002 Census); 185,938\u2009(1989 Census).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn antiquity, the shores of the Tsemes Bay were the site of Bata (Greek: \u039c\u03c0\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1), an ancient Greek colony that specialized in the grain trade. It is mentioned in the works of Strabo and Ptolemy, among others.\nFollowing brief periods of Roman and Khazar control, from the 9th century onwards, the area was part of the Byzantine \u03b8\u03ad\u03bc\u03b1 \u03a7\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u1ff6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 Thema Khersonos (Province of Cherson).\nDuring the 11th century, the area was overrun and controlled by nomads from the Eurasian steppe, led by the Cumans. Later that century, the Byzantine emperor \u1f08\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081\u20131118) was approached by Anglo-Saxon refugees, who had left England following the Norman conquest. Alexios offered land to these refugees in Thema Khersonos if they could recapture it from the nomads and there is contemporaneous evidence that a Byzantine-English colony was subsequently founded. For example, medieval nautical charts mention place names on the Kuban coast with possible English origins, including a port (located within or near the future site of Novorossiysk) known as Susaco (or Susacho) \u2013 a name that may have been derived from Sussex. (The same maps also show, north-west of Susaco, a river Londia, which may derive its name from London.)\nIn the 15th century, Genoese merchants from the Ghisolfi family maintained a trade outpost in the area. Archaeological investigation of related sites is in its infancy, but some interesting items have already been uncovered.[1]\n\nFrom 1722, the bay was controlled by an Ottoman fortress (qale) named Sujuk (also transliterated Sudzhuk, Sudschuk and So\u011fucak). This name may be derived from Susaco (see above) and, as late as 1769, the area was sometimes named in European maps as Suzako.\nThe coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the Russo-Turkish War. After this, admirals Mikhail Lazarev and Nikolay Raevsky founded an eastern base for the Black Sea Fleet on the shore in 1838. Named after the province of Novorossiya, the port formed a vital link in the chain of forts known as the Black Sea Coastal Line, which stretched south to Sochi.\nDuring the rest of the 19th century, Novorossiysk developed rapidly. It was granted city status in 1866 and became the capital of the Black Sea Governorate, the smallest in the Russian Empire, in 1896. In December 1905, the city was the seat of the short-lived Novorossiysk Republic. From August 26, 1918 until March 27, 1920, Novorossiysk was the principal center of Denikin's White Army. Denikin's South Russian Government was moved to Crimea and many Whites escaped from Novorossiysk to Constantinople during the Evacuation of Novorossiysk (1920).\nMost of the town was occupied by the German and Romanian Armies on September 10, 1942. A small unit of Soviet sailors defended one part of the town, known as Malaya Zemlya, for 225 days beginning on February 4, 1943, and the town was liberated by the Red Army on September 16, 1943. The heroic defense of the port by the sailors allowed the Soviets to retain possession of the city's bay, which prevented the Axis from using the port for supply shipments. Novorossiysk was awarded the title Hero City in 1973.\nIn 1960, the town was commemorated in Dmitri Shostakovich's work Novorossiysk Chimes, the Flame of Eternal Glory (Opus 111b).\nIn 2003, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree setting up a naval base for the Black Sea Fleet in Novorossiysk. Russia has allocated 12.3 billion rubles (about $480 million) for the construction of the new base between 2007 and 2012. The construction of other facilities and infrastructure at the base, including units for coastal troops, aviation and logistics, will continue beyond 2012. In 2016 the naval base remained incomplete; completion is currently scheduled for 2020.The Russian lease on port facilities in Sevastopol, which, though the main base of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, is part of Ukraine, was set to expire in 2017. Ukraine was reported to be planning to not renew the lease; however, in April 2010 the Russian and Ukrainian presidents signed an agreement to extend the lease by twenty-five years, with an option of further extension of five years after the new term expires.\nHowever, in 2014, Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation during the 2014 Crimean crisis and as such the question of renewing the lease does not immediately arise while Crimea remains de facto part of the territory of the Russian Federation.\n\n\n== Administrative and municipal status ==\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with twenty-four rural localities, incorporated as the City of Novorossiysk\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Novorossiysk is incorporated as Novorossiysk Urban Okrug.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nNovorossiysk has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa).\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city sprawls along the shore of the non-freezing Tsemess Bay, which has been recognized since antiquity as one of the superior bays of the Black Sea.\nThe Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port\u2013with the market capitalization of $1,110,000,000 and shares listed at Moscow Exchange and London Stock Exchange\u2013serves Russian sea trade with regions of Asia, Middle East, Africa] Mediterranean, and South America. It is the busiest oil port in the Black Sea and the terminus of the pipeline from the Tengiz Field, developed by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium.\nNovorossiysk is also an industrial city, dependent on steel, food processing, and the production of metal goods and other manufactures.  Extensive limestone quarries supply important cement factories in and around the city. The town is home to the Maritime State Academy and Novorossiysk Polytechnic Institute.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nNovorossiysk is connected by rail and highways to the main industrial and population centres of Russia, Transcaucasia, and Central Asia. The public transportation within the city boundaries consists of city buses, trolleybuses, and marshrutkas (routed taxis).\nHowever, with time, more and more people rely on automobiles as primary means of transportation.\nThe closest airports (Gelendzhik Airport, Anapa Airport and Krasnodar Airport, situated 33 kilometres (21 mi), 53 kilometres (33 mi) and 172 kilometres (107 mi) away from the city, respectively, offers flights to many cities in Russia.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe city association football team, FC Chernomorets Novorossiysk, plays in the Russian second Division.\n\n\n== Environment ==\nNovorossiysk is not a resort town, but Anapa to the north and Gelendzhik to the south are. There are several urban settlements under the jurisdiction of Novorossiysk. The most famous is Abrau-Dyurso, which consists of a townlet on the shore of Lake Abrau and a village on the coast of the Black Sea, connected by a winding mountain road.\nThe area of Novorossiysk is one of Russia's main wine-growing regions. The wineries of Abrau-Dyurso, established by Tsar Alexander III in 1870, produce table and sparkling wines for domestic consumption.\n\n\n== Buildings and structures ==\n\nNovorossiysk TV Tower\nShopping Mall \"Krasnaya Ploshchad\"\n\"Lenin's\" Amusement Park\nMalaya Zemlya Memorial\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nSeitumer Emin (1921 \u2013 2004), Crimean Tatar writer and civil rights activist\nIda Nudel (born 1931), refusenik and Israeli activist\nEugene Kaspersky (born 1956), founder of Kaspersky Labs\n\n\n== Twin towns and sister cities ==\n\nNovorossiysk is twinned with:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u0432\u0437\u0430\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044e \u0441 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0410\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f. \u0421\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u211634.01-707/13-03 \u043e\u0442 23 \u043c\u0430\u044f 2013 \u0433. \u00ab\u0420\u0435\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f\u00bb.

The inaugural World Championship Russian Grand Prix took place in 2014, beginning a seven-year contract.\nAlso, the TCR International Series raced at Sochi in June 2015, with the TCR Russian Series and SMP F4 Championship as support series.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nEarlier the International Olympic Committee was given the power to delay the race until 2015 if preparations for the race interfered with the Winter Olympics, though the Games started without interruption. In October 2011, the Russian government set aside US$195.4 million for the construction of the circuit.The construction of the Sochi Olympic Park Circuit marked the end of a thirty-year campaign for a Russian Grand Prix, with plans for a \"Grand Prix of the Soviet Union\" originating as early as 1983 before being abandoned for \"bureaucratic reasons\" and several failed attempts in the intervening years.\nThe circuit received its final approval from the FIA in August 2014.\n\n\n== The circuit ==\n\nThe 5.848-kilometre (3.634 mi) circuit is the fourth-longest circuit on the Formula One calendar, behind Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium, Baku City Circuit in Azerbaijan and Silverstone in the UK. The circuit is built around the Sochi Olympic Park, that is the coastal cluster of Olympic venues built for the 2014 Winter Olympics that have hosted competitions in ice hockey, speed skating, curling, figure skating, short track etc., and Fisht Olympic Stadium where Opening and Closing ceremonies were held. The surface was not laid until after the Closing Ceremony of the Olympics.\n\nThe circuit, designed by German architect Hermann Tilke, has the start grid on the northern edge of the Olympic Park next to the railway station, heading southwest towards the Black Sea coast. Then it runs along the outer edge of the central Sochi Medals Plaza, that is the podium for Olympic medal ceremonies. The long Turn 3 is one of the most notable on the circuit, and has been compared to the famous Turn 8 in Istanbul Park. Then, the track circles the plaza counterclockwise and makes three turns around the Bolshoy Ice Dome. Then follow series of tight corners before turning north where the track skirts the edge of the Olympic Park, above the main Olympic Village and the Adler Arena Skating Center. Then it passes the skating and curling centres, before funneling up behind the pit paddock toward the train station, and completing a circuit with two ninety-degree right turns.\n\n\n== Lap records ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n2014 Winter Olympics\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSochi Autodrom photos\nOMEGA Center (official development site)\nSochi Autodrom Guide\nSochi Autodrom on Google Maps (Current Formula 1 Tracks)",

          "It's a beautiful park with lots of rides and activities. They advertise it as an international attraction. Unfortunately all is ONLY MENTIONED in Russian, the staff is 99% only native Russian speaking. For a park promoted and as beautiful as it is just a shame because at certain",

          "By international standards, this is a small park with limited theming, by Russian standard, it is probably one of the best in the country. I felt the price of 1,750 was high bearing in mind this is not far off what other much larger parks charge, the number of rides is",

          "The water park is not bad ... It was a few years ago. Everything is old and shabby. At the entrance, a search, so that God forbid, a man did not carry a chocolate there. The cafe is dark, there are no places to sit, \u2026",

          "Cool place. In one of the pools there is a function: storm waves every hour, lasts five minutes. There is also a jacuzzi. Corresponding to the price quality and quantity of slides. And a calmer option: \"Lazy river.\" \u2026",
          "All liked it. We can distinguish a couple of moments from the negative - why only one cash desk accepts cards? Always turn! The food in the cafe is expensive, the two of you and your child ate \ud83e\udd24 for a thousand \u2026",

          "A good water park, though on interesting slides wait in line 10-15 minutes. The price tag for visiting is a little overpriced, in the cafe you can eat semi-finished products, in principle, at an affordable price. On \u2026",

          "Expected more. In the children's slides water is cold. Jets of water like in a fountain, not all kids like it. And the tilting barrel with cold water scares little children more than it entertains. I am not a fan of \u2026",
          "Good water park. There are different zones, from baby to adult. The people are moderate. there is a cafe, a lot of slides, for every taste. The main thing is to choose the weather, so as not to burn, a water park \u2026",

          "A good water park, but during the heat (13-16: 00) umbrellas did not open because of the supposedly stylish wind, although there was no wind\n\n",
          "I would like to ask if I go for 4-5 hours, will there be a lower price tag?\n\n",
          "What can I say about this water park. If you just want to relax with your family and you do not need a lot of adrenaline, you just have to go swimming, take a ride off the small slides and just lie down to sunbathe \u2026",
          "Walking distance from the place of rest. Do not need transport! On a large beautiful area has everything you need.\n\n",
          "For children, a very good water park. Interesting and safe enough\n\n",
          "Waterpark for families with children.\nThe price of admission is too high.\nWe visited the water park for the first time with two children (4 and 1), the children are delighted. We thought we would only be up to dinner, \u2026",

          "Icy water, a lot of which is impossible, with glasses in the pool, etc. etc. Open until 18 p.m. It\u2019s better to ask people through the fence like water))))\n\n",
          "Water park needs repair. Paid lockers are borsch. The price tag is slightly overpriced. The kids liked it.\n\n",

          "Oh, we've been in this water park for three times already. Very cool. It's possible to soak up in the jacuzzi, slowly swim in the \"lazy river\" -by the way, the depth is 1.4 m in total, plenty to jump into the wave \u2026",

          "Everything was very good, spent 5 hours, time passed quickly.\n\n",
          "A good place for a family holiday, the child will be happy and satisfied, but, for the most part, the shoppish approach, I'm sorry. Maybe I'm wrong, but there is something to compare, water parks in Europe, Southeast \u2026",
          "Were in August 2019. A lot out, there are large lines on the slides. Little pleasure\n\n",

          "Great water park, a lot of slides and pools, sun beds everywhere, it seems that you are somewhere in the tropics. There is also where to eat, although the prices are not the cheapest.\n\n",
          "Date of visit: 07/06/2019\nEverything is wonderful: there are a lot of slides, a lot of pools, there are separate slides and complexes for children - they are so wonderful. The only negative - there were so many of us, \u2026",
          "My child was delighted with slides and pools, and there was also a foamy disco\n\n",
          "Excellent water park. Perhaps the best water park. Cool, fun slides, in the morning there is no queue (in general!). The cafe is cool, but rather expensive, but tasty. Here you can spend a good day, and memories will \u2026",

          "Everything is fine, it\u2019s already slightly burned out and the slides are rubbed, but this does not affect the reception of emotions. The dining room is a little expensive, but in principle a family trip to the water \u2026",
          "An excellent water park, there is everything for families with children and the prices are reasonable.\n\n",
          "Very expensive. The water is cold even in the jacuzzi !! In a children's town on a roller coaster, a limit of 45 kg was not seen in the description of the water park. Climbing stairs do not feel safe. The only thing I \u2026",
          "A large enough water park, slides for children and adults, various pools, a left-luggage office. To eat and drinks are very expensive, bags look at the entrance, but you can carry it))\n\n",

          "A good water park, the quality of the slides and pools is decent, but still not quite calculated on a number of visitors. The queues at the family and extreme slides are simply unthinkable.\n\n",
          "We didn\u2019t like the waterpark tiki, very little entertainment, for the same money you can go to the aquapark golden beach and with children you are allowed on any slide! Immediately slides are simple and can not be \u2026",
          "Cons: Not polite staff, not very interesting, not worth the money for a ticket. The food is VERY expensive !!! In the pools, the floor is swollen, on the children's floor the tiles can be cut off.\nPros: there are many \u2026",

          "I like the water park itself, we go only to it, we were not in the water park in Anapa itself, although we rest there. What do not like in Tika So, these are the prices for food and drink, they are just not really \u2026",

          "Perfect place! Especially good with children, there are a lot of slides for children\n\n",
          "It is not clear why obsalyutno leadership makes fun of people! It all starts with tickets that can only be bought on the day of the visit! And if you buy them in the morning, before the opening, it is up to 10 hours, \u2026",
          "Very fun, the water is warm, there are swimming pools for adults, for children. A lot of slides and rides, most of all breathtaking slide \"Boomerang\". Waterpark SUPER hope to come there again\n\n",
          "Very good water park, spacious, the children are happy. Good dining in the grounds.\n\n",
          "Excellent water park! Have a great time with the kids! Confused only that in a lazy river you have to swim yourself \ud83d\ude2e it is from that and lazy that you lie down on a circle / double / triple or round family and \u2026",
          "Horror, disgusting. With your food, water is impossible, but there is nothing to eat on the territory, the food is disgusting, the price is like in a luxury restaurant. Chicken Kiev 260 p, but it is impossible to eat, \u2026",
          "Large queues at the slides, it would be good to update the cover of the tracks and so normal!\n\n",
          "We visit this water park with the whole family already 4 times. Like that there are pools for any age. Arranges water temperature, the location of the pools. Thank))\n\n",

          "It was fun, equal rights for children and extreme slides, but very cool\n\n",
          "I'll tell you in general. Impressions are not very, because there was a second time, but already with a small child (2g), the oldest 9 years old, everything was pleasant. They work from 10 to 19. I'm disappointed at \u2026",

          "All well I would like more slides\n\n",
          "Several slides with a descent on the cheesecake, which is very convenient when the child is not old enough for independent descent into the tube. If there are no groups, then there is no queue on the roller coaster. \u2026",
          "There are slides for every taste and age. The price in my opinion is a bit overpriced.\n\n",
          "The queue for the entrance ticket if you have a bank card - 30 minutes. The queue at the buffet 30-40 minutes. Wave pool - waves every 30 minutes - 1 hour.\n\n",
          "A variety of water rides, both for children and for adults. Prices are acceptable if you rest all day.\n\n",
          "You stand in line for a ticket, then you stand in line for a slide. And so everything is cool.\n\n",
          "Loved the aquaark. Got on the opening day for good discounts. cafe pricey\n\n",

          "The impression of visiting is unpleasant. Continuous restrictions, whistles of observers in the case and idle. Especially offensive for children. A ban is everywhere for them: without an adult, you can\u2019t grow below \u2026",
          "The water park is excellent. Were there from 10 and until 5 pm. Several times we swept from each hill. Minus of course the stairs on the hill, they are fastened, you can fly well and take a bunch of people with you. \u2026",
          "Waterpark very much. Price, of course, biting - about 1500 per adult and 800 per child. But there you can spend at least the whole day, there are slides of different heights and complexity, several pools, during the \u2026",
          "I give 3 stars because in the children's area you cannot swim more than 45kg. And because of this, people have to (so to speak) tear me into 2 parts in order to look after 2 children. If your back has burned your \u2026",
          "There is no normal parking. For things you need to take a left-luggage office, not included in the price. In the shower mess. The prices of water and food are overstated several times. Pool water is poorly cleaned, \u2026",
          "All liked it. But children's cold pool is one minus\n\n",
          "Excellent water park. I do not understand who is complaining. The slides are interesting, the children's zone on which the younger was sitting helplessly. Many sunbeds. The water is clear, the food is expensive. In \u2026",

          "Great place, the best water park of all those who are in Anapa\n\n",
          "It is designed for children from 5-7 to 15 years old, not for adults. There are only 4 slides for adults, this is very small. For children up to 4-5 years old, one pool and one slide, and then if there are parents at \u2026",

          "I was here with my daughter. Unforgettable sensations, extreme and high.\n\n",
          "Water park old, shabby parrots and paint on the floor cracked. The territory of the park is covered mostly with tiles and it is all raw from water, which is not safe for children. All the slides are combined in one \u2026",

          "Excellent water park, children were very satisfied. Pools are clean, toilets and showers too. Very cool. The products are certainly expensive, but the prices are the same as in other water parks. We brought a snack \u2026",
          "A large, convenient water park, but there are not enough parking spaces for cars. Cloakroom with \"safes\", electronic keys, many different cafes on the territory, but prices of course \"bite\". Loungers under what or \u2026",

          "Very cool, the children are delighted! Yes, and still got to the foam party! Great, thank you\n\n",
          "Why do children sell tickets for an adult price ?? Why is there no card payment terminal? Why the cost of the ticket does not change if people arrived three hours before closing?\n\n",
          "Good water park, but on the descent from the hills you must stand in line.\n\n",
          "There is parking. Lots of entertainment for all tastes\n\n",

          "Not bad, not bad ... To our surprise, everything was pleasant! ... It will be possible to go there again!))) One only minus, the food in the dining rooms which are located in the water park area, AT ALL is not tasty, \u2026",
          "the food is not tasty and very expensive.\n\n",
          "Waterpark slides are not impressive. Animators and law enforcement work at 5. Suitable for the first visit to the water park, for young children. Teenagers and those children who have something to compare - even do \u2026",
          "Many slides and pools. All is clean. The staff is friendly. Wave pool test. Storage cameras for a fee. In the hopping pool, in my opinion a bit too much bleach. There are enough buns.\n\n",
          "A good water park, but closed already at 6 in June, early. Bracelets, which are issued, were not regulated by the arm, so of course the child lost, a fine of 500 rubles\n\n",
          "A nice place. Many extreme slides, as well as family. True for very young children, the \"rainy season\" complex is not suitable, as the slides are too big. Also a large number of pools. Everyone will find in the water \u2026",
          "Good rest with children. I did not like that there are no free lockers for undressing. You need to buy. Tickets are expensive, and basic conditions are not created. Calculation for the territory of the water park only \u2026",

          "I like it. Although not a fan of water parks. Was in different. This is not bad. Relatively clean. A lot of people, but this is common for such places in the season. Big minus - do not accept cards only nalik. You can \u2026",

          "I'll start with the pros: a lot of slides, there are swimming pools for adults and children. Cons: expensive tickets are expensive, only two shifts per day per 6 hours a day, many (almost all) do not have so many \u2026",
          "The equipment is old (they were 07/22/19), the tiles have already fallen off somewhere, cracks on the sides, in the dining room the food is unreasonably expensive, french fries 100 gr. 100 rubles, cutlet 120-130, \u2026",
          "good water park! the water is normal ... the child can not be pulled out ... means it does not freeze. Gorok for children, above 140 cm, much more than in the water park Olympus. Ochreedy did not notice the giant, \u2026",

The inaugural World Championship Russian Grand Prix took place in 2014, beginning a seven-year contract.\nAlso, the TCR International Series raced at Sochi in June 2015, with the TCR Russian Series and SMP F4 Championship as support series.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nEarlier the International Olympic Committee was given the power to delay the race until 2015 if preparations for the race interfered with the Winter Olympics, though the Games started without interruption. In October 2011, the Russian government set aside US$195.4 million for the construction of the circuit.The construction of the Sochi Olympic Park Circuit marked the end of a thirty-year campaign for a Russian Grand Prix, with plans for a \"Grand Prix of the Soviet Union\" originating as early as 1983 before being abandoned for \"bureaucratic reasons\" and several failed attempts in the intervening years.\nThe circuit received its final approval from the FIA in August 2014.\n\n\n== The circuit ==\n\nThe 5.848-kilometre (3.634 mi) circuit is the fourth-longest circuit on the Formula One calendar, behind Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium, Baku City Circuit in Azerbaijan and Silverstone in the UK. The circuit is built around the Sochi Olympic Park, that is the coastal cluster of Olympic venues built for the 2014 Winter Olympics that have hosted competitions in ice hockey, speed skating, curling, figure skating, short track etc., and Fisht Olympic Stadium where Opening and Closing ceremonies were held. The surface was not laid until after the Closing Ceremony of the Olympics.\n\nThe circuit, designed by German architect Hermann Tilke, has the start grid on the northern edge of the Olympic Park next to the railway station, heading southwest towards the Black Sea coast. Then it runs along the outer edge of the central Sochi Medals Plaza, that is the podium for Olympic medal ceremonies. The long Turn 3 is one of the most notable on the circuit, and has been compared to the famous Turn 8 in Istanbul Park. Then, the track circles the plaza counterclockwise and makes three turns around the Bolshoy Ice Dome. Then follow series of tight corners before turning north where the track skirts the edge of the Olympic Park, above the main Olympic Village and the Adler Arena Skating Center. Then it passes the skating and curling centres, before funneling up behind the pit paddock toward the train station, and completing a circuit with two ninety-degree right turns.\n\n\n== Lap records ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n2014 Winter Olympics\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSochi Autodrom photos\nOMEGA Center (official development site)\nSochi Autodrom Guide\nSochi Autodrom on Google Maps (Current Formula 1 Tracks)",

        "wiki": "The 45th parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 45 degrees north of Earth's equator. It crosses Europe, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America, and the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe 45th parallel north is often called the halfway point between the equator and the North Pole, but the true halfway point is actually 16.0 km (9.9 mi) north of the 45th parallel because Earth is an oblate spheroid; that is, it bulges at the equator and is flattened at the poles.At this latitude, the Sun is visible for 15 hours 37 minutes during the summer solstice, and 8 hours 46 minutes during the winter solstice.  The midday Sun stands 21.6\u00b0 above the southern horizon at the December solstice, 68.4\u00b0 at the June solstice, and exactly 45.0\u00b0 at either equinox.\n\n\n== Around the world ==\nStarting at the Prime Meridian and heading eastwards, the parallel 45\u00b0 north passes through:\n\n\n== Europe ==\n\nIn Europe the 45th parallel stretches between the Bay of Biscay coast of France in the west and the Caspian Sea coast of the Russian Caucasus in the east.\nIn France, it crosses the river Rh\u00f4ne at Pont-de-l'Is\u00e8re, just north of Valence, Dr\u00f4me and through Grenoble. It then continues across the Massif Central and into the Aquitaine region.  The city of Bordeaux is just south of the parallel.\nIn northern Italy it parallels the river Po, near Rovigo, passing by Voghera, then just south of Turin before passing into France in the Cottian Alps.\nFurther west it passes through the Balkans: Romania (just north of Ploie\u015fti, and through T\u00e2rgu Jiu), the Serbian autonomous province of Vojvodina, the eastern tip of Croatia, the northern edge of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a section of Adriatic Croatia. The capital city of Serbia \u2013 Belgrade is just south of the parallel.\nIn Russia it runs from the west coast of the Caspian Sea to the east coast of the Black Sea, through the Republic of Kalmykia, Stavropol Krai and its capital Stavropol, and Krasnodar Krai and its capital Krasnodar.  In Ukraine it crosses the Crimea and its capital Simferopol.\n\n\n== Asia ==\nAfter leaving Russia the parallel passes through southern Kazakhstan, skirting the northern edge of the Ustyurt Plateau. It intersects the city of Burylbaytal at the southern tip of Lake Balkhash and the city of Qyzylorda further west.  At the border with Uzbekistan it bisects the Aral Sea and its toxic Vozrozhdeniya Island peninsula, site of an abandoned Soviet bioweapons laboratory.\nIn northwest China it passes through the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang and the oil city of Karamay. Transecting southern Mongolia it passes through the provinces of S\u00fckhbaatar, Dornogovi (and its capital Sainshand), Dundgovi, \u00d6v\u00f6rkhangai, Bayankhongor, Govi-Altai, and Khovd.  At Khanka Lake it enters northeast China, cutting across Heilongjiang and continuing through part of Jilin and eastern Inner Mongolia.\nIt leaves the Asian mainland on the coast of Primorsky Krai in Russia, north of Vladivostok and continues through the northern part of the Sea of Japan. It passes through Rishiri-Rebun-Sarobetsu National Park and the adjacent town of Horonobe on the northern tip of Hokkaid\u014d, the northernmost of Japan's main islands, before heading east across the North Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n== North America ==\n\nThroughout the United States the parallel is marked in many places on highways by a sign proclaiming that the location is halfway between the North Pole and the equator.The 45th parallel forms some boundaries of or passes through many U.S. states: Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, as well as going through the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.\nGoing from west to east, the line makes landfall at the Pacific coast in Oregon. After crossing Idaho and the Rocky Mountains, it makes up most of the boundary between Montana and Wyoming. It then passes through the Great Plains and further east roughly bisects the metropolitan area of Minneapolis-St. Paul. \nIn Michigan, the Old Mission Peninsula in Grand Traverse Bay ends just shy of the 45th parallel. Many guidebooks and signs at the Mission Point Lighthouse describe it as being halfway between the equator and north pole. When the Grand Traverse Bay recedes below normal level, it is possible to walk out to the exact line.\nFurther east, the 45th parallel roughly marks the Canada\u2013United States border between the St. Lawrence and Connecticut rivers, between the Canadian province of Quebec and the states of New York and Vermont. The parallel is sometimes called the \"Canada line\".  After the Seven Years' War, the 45th parallel was declared the boundary between New York and Quebec. Under the Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty of 1842, original measurement errors stand so that the boundary is not exactly at 45 degrees north but is where the survey monuments were erected in 1772. The actual boundary of Vermont lies approximately 1 kilometre (3,300 ft) north of the parallel due to an error in the 1772 survey.All of mainland New Brunswick lies north of the 45th parallel. Approximately two-thirds of Deer Island, plus all of Campobello and Grand Manan islands, are south of the 45th parallel.\nThe parallel roughly bisects mainland Nova Scotia. Halifax is approximately 40 km (25 mi) south of the parallel.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n45th parallel south\n44th parallel north\n46th parallel north\n45\u00d790 points\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe 45th Parallel at the Minnesota Museum of the Mississippi and Other Natural Wonders\nFrom the Minas Astronomy Group: Midway from the Equator to the North Pole\n45th Parallel Markers\nDegree Confluence Project",

        "wiki": "The 2014 Winter Olympics, officially called the XXII Olympic Winter Games (French: Les XXIIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver) (Russian: XXII \u041e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, tr. XXII Olimpiyskiye zimniye igry) and commonly known as Sochi 2014, was an international winter multi-sport event that was held from 7 to 23 February 2014 in Sochi, Krasnodar Krai, Russia. Opening rounds in certain events were held on 6 February 2014, the day before the opening ceremony.\nThese were the first Olympic Games under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach. Both the Olympics and Paralympics were organized by the Sochi Organizing Committee (SOOC). Sochi was selected as the host city in July 2007, during the 119th IOC Session held in Guatemala City. It was the first Olympics to be held in a CIS state after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Soviet Union was previously the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\nA record ninety-eight events in fifteen winter sport disciplines were held during the Games. A number of new competitions\u2014a total of twelve accounting for gender\u2014were held during the Games, including biathlon mixed relay, women's ski jumping, mixed-team figure skating, mixed-team luge, half-pipe skiing, ski and snowboard slopestyle, and snowboard parallel slalom. The events were held around two clusters of new venues: an Olympic Park constructed in Sochi's Imeretinsky Valley on the coast of the Black Sea, with Fisht Olympic Stadium, and the Games' indoor venues located within walking distance; and snow events in the resort settlement of Krasnaya Polyana.\nThe 2014 Winter Olympics were the most expensive Games in the history of the Olympics. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, major cost overruns caused this figure to expand to US$51 billion, more than three times the cost of the 2012 London Olympics and even surpassing the estimated cost of US$44 billion for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The 2014 Games achieved a record broadcast audience of 2.1 billion people worldwide.In 2016, an independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed allegations that the Russian Olympic team had been involved in a state-sponsored doping program, active from at least late-2011 through August 2015. The program was active during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, and athletes had benefited from the cover-up. The IOC stripped thirteen medals from Russian athletes in 2017, but nine were reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, with an option for whitelisted athletes to compete independently during the 2018 Winter Olympics.\n\n\n== Bidding process ==\n\nSochi was elected on 4 July 2007 during the 119th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, defeating bids from Salzburg, Austria; and Pyeongchang, South Korea. This is the first time that the Russian Federation has hosted the Winter Olympics. The Soviet Union was the host of the 1980 Summer Olympics held in and around Moscow.\n\n\n== Cost and financing ==\n\nAs of October 2013, the estimated combined cost of the 2014 Winter Olympics had topped US$51 billion. This amount included the cost for Olympic games themselves and cost of Sochi infrastructural projects (roads, railroads, power plants). This total is over four times the initial budget of $12 billion (compared to the $8 billion spent for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver), and made the Sochi games the most expensive Olympics in history, exceeding the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, which hosted 3 times as many events.  Dmitry Kozak was the main overseer for the events in Sochi.In its final budget published in June 2014, Olimpstroy\u2014the state corporation that oversaw the Sochi Olympics development\u2014reported the total allocated funds for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics of 1,524 billion rubles (US$49.5 billion). However, only about a fifth of that budget ($10.8 billion) was directly related to the Olympic games, while the rest went into urban and regional regeneration and the conversion of the Sochi region into an all-year round sea and alpine resort. The breakdown table below is based on a report that has analyzed the distribution of Olimpstroy's $49.5 billion budget. Estimates also suggest that additional unrecoverable operational costs (including for security) could have added another $3 billion.\n\n\n=== The breakdown of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics costs ===\n\n\n== Venues ==\n\nWith an average February temperature of 8.3 \u00b0C (42.8 \u00b0F) and a humid subtropical climate, Sochi is the warmest city to host a Winter Olympic Games. Sochi 2014 is the 12th straight Olympics to outlaw smoking; all Sochi venues, Olympic Park bars and restaurants and public areas were smoke-free during the Games. It is also the first time that an Olympic Park has been built for hosting winter games.\n\n\n=== Sochi Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster) ===\n\nThe Sochi Olympic Park was built by the Black Sea coast in the Imeretinsky Valley, about 4 km (2.5 miles) from Russia's border with Abkhazia/Georgia. The venues were clustered around a central water basin on which the Medals Plaza is built, allowing all indoor venues to be within walking distance. It also features \"The Waters of the Olympic Park\" (designed by California-based company WET), a choreographed fountain which served as the backdrop in the medals awards and the opening and closing ceremonies of the event. The new venues include:\nFisht Olympic Stadium \u2013 ceremonies (opening/closing) 40,000 spectators\nBolshoy Ice Dome \u2013 ice hockey (final), 12,000 spectators\nShayba Arena \u2013 ice hockey, 7,000 spectators\nAdler Arena Skating Center \u2013 speed skating, 8,000 spectators\nIceberg Skating Palace \u2013 figure skating, short track speed skating, 12,000 spectators\nIce Cube Curling Center \u2013 curling, 3,000 spectators\nMain Olympic village\nInternational broadcasting centre and main press room\n\n\n=== Krasnaya Polyana (Mountain Cluster) ===\n\nLaura Biathlon & Ski Complex \u2013 biathlon, cross-country skiing\nRosa Khutor Extreme Park \u2013 freestyle skiing and snowboarding\nRosa Khutor Alpine Resort \u2013 alpine skiing\nSliding Center Sanki \u2013 bobsleigh, luge and skeleton\nRusSki Gorki Jumping Center \u2013 ski jumping and Nordic combined (both ski jumping and cross-country skiing on a 2 km route around the arena)\nRoza Khutor plateau Olympic Village\n\n\n=== Post-Olympic usage ===\n\nA street circuit known as the Sochi Autodrom was constructed in and around Olympic Park. Its primary use is to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix, which held its inaugural edition in October 2014.In January 2015, work began on adapting Fisht Olympic Stadium into an open-air football stadium to host matches during the 2018 FIFA World Cup.A new ice hockey team in the Kontinental Hockey League, HC Sochi Leopards, now plays in Bolshoy Arena.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nThe Olympic infrastructure was constructed according to a Federal Target Program (FTP). In June 2009, the Games' organizers reported they were one year ahead in building the main Olympic facilities as compared to recent Olympic Games. In November 2011, IOC President Jacques Rogge was in Sochi and concluded that the city had made significant progress since he last visited eighteen months earlier.\n\n\n=== Telecommunications ===\n\nAccording to the FTP, US$580 million would be spent on construction and modernization of telecommunications in the region. Avaya was named by the Sochi Organizing Committee as the official supplier of telecommunications equipment. Avaya provided the data network equipment, including switches, routers, security, telephones and contact-center systems. It provided engineers and technicians to design and test the systems, and worked with other technology partners to provide athletes, dignitaries and fans information about the Games.The 2014 Olympics is the first \"fabric-enabled\" Games using Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) technology. The network is capable of handling up to 54,000 Gbit/s (54 Tbit/s) of traffic.Infrastructure built for the games included:\n\nA network of TETRA mobile radio communications for 100 user groups (with capacity of 10,000 subscribers);\n712 km (442 mi) of fiber-optic cables along the Anapa-Dzhubga-Sochi highways and Dzhubga\u2013Krasnodar branch;\nDigital broadcasting infrastructure, including radio and television broadcasting stations (building and communications towers) with coverage from Grushevaya Polyana (Pear Glade) to Sochi and Anapa cities. The project also included construction of infocommunications centre for broadcasting abroad via three HDTV satellites.During the Games, the core networks of Rostelecom and Transtelekom were used.In January 2012, the newest equipment for the television coverage of the Games arrived in the port of Adler. Prepared specifically for the Games, a team of regional specialists and the latest technology provide a qualitatively new level of television production in the region.The fiber-optic channel links Sochi between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana. The 46-kilometre-long (29 mi) channel enables videoconferencing and news reporting from the Olympics.In November 2013, it was reported that the fiber-optic cable that was built by the Federal Communications Agency, Rossvyaz, had no operator. With Rostelecom and Megafon both refusing to operate it, the line was transferred to the ownership of the state enterprise Center for Monitoring & Development of Infocommunication Technologies (Russian: \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u041c\u0418\u0420 \u0418\u0422).Russian mobile phone operator Megafon expanded and improved Sochi's telecom infrastructure with over 700 new 2G/3G/4G cell towers. Sochi was the first Games to offer 4G connectivity at a speed of 10 MB/sec.\nIn January 2014, Rostelecom reported that it had connected the Olympic media center in Sochi to the Internet and organized channels of communication with the main media center of the Olympic Games in the coastal cluster and press center in Moscow. The media center was built at total cost of 17 million rubles.\n\n\n=== Power infrastructure ===\n\nA five-year strategy for increasing the power supply of the Sochi region was presented by Russian energy experts during a seminar on 29 May 2009, held by the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee, and attended by International Olympic Committee (IOC) experts and officials from the Russian Ministry of Regional Development, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the State Corporation Olimpstroy and the Krasnodar Krai administration.According to the strategy, the capacity of the regional energy network would increase by two and a half times by 2014, guaranteeing a stable power supply during and after the Games.\nThe power demand of Sochi at the end of May 2009 was 424 MW. The power demand of the Olympic infrastructure was expected to be about 340 MW.\n\nPoselkovaya electrical substation became operational in early 2009.\nSochi thermal power station reconstructed (expected power output was 160 MW)\nLaura and Rosa Khutor electrical substations were completed in November 2010\nMzymta electrical substation was completed in March 2011\nKrasnopolyanskaya hydroelectric power station was completed in 2010\nAdler CHP station design and construction was completed in 2012. Expected power output was 360 MW\nBytkha substation, under construction with two transformers 25 MW each, includes dependable microprocessor-based protectionEarlier plans also include building combined cycle (steam and gas) power stations near the cities of Tuapse and Novorossiysk and construction of a cable-wire powerline, partially on the floor of the Black Sea.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nThe transport infrastructure prepared to support the Olympics includes many roads, tunnels, bridges, interchanges, railroads and stations in and around Sochi. Among others, 8 flyovers, 102 bridges, tens of tunnels and a bypass route for heavy trucks \u2014 367 km (228 miles) of roads were paved.The Sochi Light Metro is located between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana connecting the Olympic Park, Sochi International Airport, and the venues in Krasnaya Polyana.\n \nThe existing 102 km (63-mile), Tuapse-to-Adler railroad was renovated to provide double track throughout, increasing capacity and enabling a reliable regional service to be provided and extending to the airport. In December 2009, Russian Railways ordered 38 Siemens Mobility Desiro trains for delivery in 2013 for use during the Olympics, with an option for a further 16 partly built in Russia. Russian Railways established a high-speed Moscow-Adler link and a new railroad (more than 60 kilometres or 37 miles long) passing by the territory of Ukraine.\nAt Sochi International Airport, a new terminal was built along a 3.5 km (2.2-mile) runway extension, overlapping the Mzymta River. Backup airports were built in Gelendzhik, Mineralnye Vody and Krasnodar by 2009.\n\nAt the Port of Sochi, a new offshore terminal 1.5 km (0.93 mi) from the shore allows docking for cruise ships with capacities of 3,000 passengers. The cargo terminal of the seaport would be moved from the centre of Sochi.\nRoadways were detoured, some going around the construction site and others being cut off.\n\nIn May 2009, Russian Railways started the construction of tunnel complex No. 1 (the final total is six) on the combined road (automobile and railway) from Adler to Alpica Service Mountain Resort in the Krasnaya Polyana region. The tunnel complex No. 1 is located near Akhshtyr in Adlersky City District, and includes:\nEscape tunnel, 2.25 kilometres (1.40 mi), completed in 2010\nRoad tunnel, 2,153 metres (7,064 ft), completed in 2013\nOne-track railway tunnel, 2,473 metres (8,114 ft), completed in 2013Russian Railways president Vladimir Yakunin stated the road construction costed more than 200 billion rubles.In addition, Sochi's railway stations were renovated. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta, Khosta, Lazarevskaya, and Loo railway stations. In Adler, a new railway station was built while the original building was preserved, and in the Olympic park cluster, a new station was built from scratch, the Olympic Park railway station. Another new railway station was built in Estosadok, close to Krasnaya Polyana.\n\n\n=== Other infrastructure ===\n\nFunds were spent on the construction of hotels for 10,300 guests. The first of the Olympic hotels, Zvezdny (Stellar), was rebuilt anew. Significant funds were spent on the construction of an advanced sewage treatment system in Sochi, designed by Olimpstroy. The system meets BREF standards and employs top available technologies for environment protection, including tertiary treatment with microfiltration.Six post offices were opened at competition venues, two of them in the main media centre in Olympic Park and in the mountain village of Estosadok. In addition to standard services, customers had access to unique services including two new products, Fotomarka and Retropismo. Fotomarka presents an opportunity to get a stylized sheet of eight souvenir stamps with one's own photos, using the services of a photographer in the office. Retropismo service allows a customer to write with their own stylus or pen on antique paper with further letters, winding string and wax seal affixing. All the new sites and post offices in Sochi were opened during the Olympics until late night 7 days a week, and employees were trained to speak English.\n\n\n== The Games ==\n\n\n=== Torch relay ===\n\nOn 29 September 2013, the Olympic torch was lit in Ancient Olympia, beginning a seven-day journey across Greece and on to Russia, then the torch relay started at Moscow on 7 October 2013 before passing 83 Russian cities and arriving at Sochi on the day of the opening ceremony, 7 February 2014. It is the longest torch relay in Olympic history, a 60,000-kilometre (40,000 miles) route that passes through all regions of the country, from Kaliningrad in the west to Chukotka in the east.\nThe Olympic torch reached the North Pole for first time via a nuclear-powered icebreaker (50 Let Pobedy). The torch was also passed for the first time in space, though not lit for the duration of the flight for safety reasons, on flight Soyuz TMA-11M to the International Space Station (ISS). The spacecraft itself was adorned with Olympic-themed livery including the Games' emblem. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky waved the torch on a spacewalk outside ISS. The torch returned to Earth five days later on board Soyuz TMA-09M. The torch also reached Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, and Siberia's Lake Baikal.\n\n\n=== Opening ceremony ===\n\nThe opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics was held on 7 February 2014 at Fisht Olympic Stadium, an indoor arena built specifically for the ceremonies. The ceremony featured scenes based around aspects of Russian history and arts, including ballet, classical music, the Russian Revolution, and the age of the Soviet Union. The opening scene of the ceremony featured a notable technical error, where one of five snowflakes, which were to expand to form the Olympic rings, malfunctioned and did not expand (a mishap mocked by the organizers at the closing ceremony where one of the roundrelay dance groups symbolizing the Olympic rings \"failed\" to expand). The torch was taken into the stadium by Maria Sharapova, who then passed it to Yelena Isinbayeva who, in turn, passed it to wrestler Aleksandr Karelin. Karelin then passed the torch to gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Figure skater Irina Rodnina took the torch and was met by former ice hockey goalkeeper Vladislav Tretiak, who exited the stadium to jointly light the Olympic cauldron located near the center of Olympic Park.\n\n\n=== Participating National Olympic Committees ===\nA record 88 nations qualified to compete, which beat the previous record of 82 set at the previous Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Seven nations made their Winter Olympics debut: Dominica, Malta, Paraguay, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, and Zimbabwe.Kristina Krone qualified to compete in her second consecutive games for Puerto Rico, but the island's Olympic Committee once again chose not to send her to compete. Similarly, South Africa decided not to send alpine skier Sive Speelman to Sochi. Algeria also did not enter its only qualified athlete, Mehdi-Selim Khelifi.India's athletes originally competed as Independent Olympic Participants and marched under the Olympic flag during the opening ceremony, as India was originally suspended in December 2012 over the election process of the Indian Olympic Association. On 11 February, the Indian Olympic Association was reinstated and India's athletes were allowed the option to compete under their own flag from that time onward. Although Shiva Keshavan competed as an Independent athlete and is recorded as such, he was permitted to walk under the flag of India at the Closing Ceremony.\n\n\n==== National houses ====\nDuring the Games some countries had a national house, a meeting place for supporters, athletes and other followers. Houses can be either free for visitors to access or they can have limited access by invitation only.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe 2014 Winter Olympics featured 98 events over 15 disciplines in 7 sports. A total of twelve new events were contested, making it the largest Winter Olympics to date.\n\nNumbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.\n\n\n==== New events ====\n\nOn 6 April 2011, the IOC accepted a number of events that were submitted by their respective sports federations to be considered for inclusion into the official program of these Olympic Games.\nThe events included a Figure skating team event, Women's ski jumping, Mixed relay biathlon, Ski half-pipe, and Team relay luge.\nOn 4 July 2011, the IOC announced that three events would be added to the program. These events, which were officially declared by Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge on 5 July 2011, were:\n\nSki slopestyle\nSnowboard slopestyle\nSnowboard parallel special slalomTeam alpine skiing was also presented as a candidate for inclusion in the Olympic program but the Executive board of the IOC rejected this proposal. The International Ski Federation persisted with the nomination and this was considered. There were reports of bandy possibly being added to the sports program, but the IOC rejected this request. Subsequently, the international governing body, Federation of International Bandy, decided that Irkutsk and Shelekhov in Russia would host the 2014 Bandy World Championship just before the Olympics.\nOn 28 November 2006, the Executive Board of the IOC decided not to include Ski mountaineering, Ski-orienteering, or Winter triathlon in the review process of the program.\n\n\n=== Closing ceremony ===\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 23 February 2014 between 20:14 MSK (UTC+4) and 22:25 MSK (UTC+4) at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi.\nThe ceremony was dedicated to Russian culture featuring world-renowned Russian stars like conductor and violinist Yuri Bashmet, conductor Valery Gergiev, pianist Denis Matsuev, singer Hibla Gerzmava and violinist Tatiana Samouil. These artists were joined by performers from the Bolshoi and Mariinsky theaters.\n\n\n== Medals ==\n\nSochi's medal design was unveiled in May 2013. The design is intended to resemble Sochi's landscape, with a semi-translucent section containing a \"patchwork quilt\" of diamonds representing mountains; the diamonds themselves contain designs that reflect Russia's regions. Those who won gold medals on 15 February received special medals with fragments of the Chelyabinsk meteor, marking the one-year anniversary of the event where pieces of the cosmic body fell into the Chebarkul Lake in the Ural Mountains in central Russia.\n\n\n=== Medal table ===\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by number of gold medals are listed below. The host nation, Russia, is highlighted.\nTo sort this table by nation, total medal count, or any other column, click on the  icon next to the column title.\n\n  *   Host nation (Russia)\n\n\n=== Podium sweeps ===\na  Legkov and Vylegzhanin were initially disqualified by the IOC for doping offenses in November 2017, and their 2014 Olympic medals were stripped (gold and silver respectively). However, their results were restored on 1 February 2018 following a successful appeal.\n\n\n== Calendar ==\n\nIn the following calendar each blue box represents one or more event competition(s), such as a qualification round, on that day. The yellow boxes represent medal-awarding finals for a sport with in each box the number of finals that were contested on that day.\nAll dates are MSK (UTC+4)\n\n\n== Security ==\n\n\n=== Measures ===\nSecurity during both the Olympics and Paralympics were handled by over 40,000 law enforcement officials, including police and the Russian Armed Forces. A Presidential Decree signed by President Vladimir Putin took effect on 7 January, requiring that any protests and demonstrations in Sochi and the surrounding area through 21 March (the end of the Paralympics) be approved by the Federal Security Service. For the duration of the decree, travel restrictions were also in effect in and around Sochi: \"controlled\" zones, dubbed the \"ring of steel\" by the media, covered the Coastal and Mountain clusters which encompass all of the Games' venues and infrastructure, including transport hubs such as railway stations. To enter controlled areas, visitors were required to pass through security checkpoints with x-ray machines, metal detectors and explosive material scanners. Several areas were designated as \"forbidden\", including Sochi National Park and the border with Abkhazia. An unmanned aerial vehicle squadron, along with S-400 and Pantsir-S1 air defense rockets were used to protect Olympic airspace. Four gunboats were also deployed on the Black Sea to protect the coastline.A number of security organizations and forces began stationing in and around Sochi in January 2014; Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) was stationed in Sochi for the Games beginning on 7 January 2014. A group of 10,000 Internal Troops of the Ministry of Interior also provided security services during the Games. In mid-January, 1,500 Siberian Regional Command troops were stationed in a military town near Krasnaya Polyana. A group of 400 cossacks in traditional uniforms were also present to accompany police patrols. The 58th Army unit of the Russian Armed Forces, were defending the Georgia-Russia border. The United States also supplied Navy ships and other assets for security purposes.All communication and Internet traffic by Sochi residents was captured and filtered through deep packet inspection systems at all mobile networks using the SORM system.Former professional speed skater and current deputy of the Russian State Duma Svetlana Zhurova has stated that the 2014 Sochi Olympics were Vladimir Putin's personal project to showcase Russia to the world.\n\n\n=== Incidents and threats ===\nOrganizers received several threats prior to the Games. In a July 2013 video release, Chechen Islamist commander Dokka Umarov called for attacks on the Games, stating that the Games were being staged \"on the bones of many, many Muslims killed ...and buried on our lands extending to the Red Sea.\"Threats were received from the group Vilayat Dagestan, which had claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings under the demands of Umarov, and a number of National Olympic Committees had also received threats via e-mail, threatening that terrorists would kidnap or \"blow up\" athletes during the Games. However, while the IOC did state that the letters \"[contained] no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public\", the U.S. ski and snowboarding teams hired a private security agency to provide additional protection during the Games.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting rights ===\n\nIn most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics were packaged together with broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well. Domestic broadcast rights were sold by Sportfive to a consortium of three Russian broadcasters; Channel One, VGTRK, and NTV Plus.In the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a new, US$4.38 billion contract with NBCUniversal, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020.In Canada, after losing the 2010 and 2012 Games to Bell Media and Rogers Media, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation re-gained broadcast rights to the Olympics for the first time since 2008, gaining rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games. Bell and Rogers sub-licensed pay-TV rights for their TSN, Sportsnet and R\u00e9seau des sports networks, as well as TVA Group's TVA Sports.In Australia, after all three major commercial networks pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Games due to cost concerns, the IOC awarded broadcast rights to just the 2014 Winter Olympics to Network Ten for A$20 million.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nSeveral broadcasters used the Games to trial the emerging ultra high definition television (UHDTV) standard. Both NTV Plus and Comcast filmed portions of the Games in 4K resolution; Comcast offered its content through smart TV apps, while NTV+ held public and cinema viewings of the content. NHK filmed portions of the Games in 8K resolution for public viewing. Olympic sponsor Panasonic filmed the opening ceremony in 4K.\n\n\n== Concerns and controversies ==\n\nA variety of concerns over the Games, or Russia's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities. Concerns were shown over Russia's policies surrounding the LGBT community, including the government's denial of a proposed Pride House for the Games on moral grounds, and a federal law passed in June 2013 which criminalized the distribution of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors. Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history; with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials, and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms.\n\nSome Circassian organizations objected to the Games being held on land their ancestors held until 1864, when most of them were vanquished at the end of the Russian-Circassian War (1763\u20131864), in what they consider to be ethnic cleansing or genocide. The use of Krasnaya Polyana (\"Red Hill\" or \"Red Glade\") as an event site was considered sensitive, as it was named for a group of Circassians who were defeated in a bloody battle with Russians while attempting to return home over it in 1864. Some Circassian groups demanded that the Games be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for their actions. Other groups did not outright object to the Games, but suggested that symbols of Circassian history and culture be incorporated into the Games, as Australia, the United States and Canada did for their indigenous cultures in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively.\nU.S. broadcaster NBC largely avoided broadcasting material critical of Russia, although several segments deemed \"overly friendly to Russia\" were criticized by some commentators. However, following the closing ceremony, commentators evaluated the Games to have been successful overall.\n\n\n=== Russian doping scandal ===\n\nFollowing the Games, reports began to emerge that the Russian Olympic team had participated in a state-run doping program, which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. These allegations first emerged in a December 2014 documentary by German public broadcaster ARD, and were detailed further in a May 2016 report by The New York Times\u2014which published allegations by Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory. Rodchenkov alleged that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games. Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won in Sochi were the result of doping.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) commissioned an independent report by Richard McLaren, which corroborated claims that Russian authorities had been discreetly swapping out urine samples that tested positive for performance-enhancing substances. The report concluded that the program had been operating from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\", and had covered up 643 positive samples across Olympic and non-Olympic sports. As a result, WADA considered the Russian Anti-Doping Agency to be non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.Russia was not banned from the 2016 Olympics by the IOC, the decision that was widely criticized by both athletes and writers; the IOC only required Russia's athletes to be cleared by an internal panel and their respective sports federations. The IAAF had suspended Russia from international track and field events due to the scandal, but did allow Darya Klishina to participate in the Olympics because she was confirmed not to be a part of a doping program. The International Paralympic Committee suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee and banned the team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics.On 5 December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, thus banning it from sending athletes under the Russian flag to the 2018 Winter Olympics. Cleared Russian athletes were allowed to participate as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR). Two of them, curler Alexander Krushelnitskiy, who won a bronze medal, and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva, failed drug tests during the Games.\nThe IOC's Oswald Commission disqualified and banned 43 Russian athletes, and stripped thirteen medals they earned in Sochi. On 1 February 2018, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) found that the IOC provided insufficient evidence for 28 athletes, and overturned their IOC sanctions. For 11 other athletes, the CAS decided that there was sufficient evidence to uphold their Sochi sanctions, but reduced their lifetime bans to only the 2018 Winter Olympics. The IOC said in a statement that \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the [2018 Winter Olympic] Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\u201d and that \u201cthis [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\u201d. The IOC found it important to note that the CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\u201d and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. Later that month, the Russian Olympic Committee was reinstated by the IOC, despite failed doping tests during the 2018 Olympics, and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency was re-certified in September, despite the Russian officials not accepting the McLaren report.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n2014 Winter Paralympics\n2014 Summer Youth Olympics\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Sochi 2014\".

The park occupies the Greater Sochi area, from the border with the Tuapsinsky District, between the mouths of Shepsi River and Magri River in the north-west, to the border with Abkhazia along the Psou River in the south-east, and between the Black Sea to the water divide crest of the Greater Caucasus.\nFrom this territory, the park does not include the areas of settlement, such as the city of Sochi and various urban and rural settlements. The area of the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve is also distinct.   Immediately to the north is the Caucasus Nature Reserve.\n\n\n== Persian leopard re-introduction ==\nIn 2009, a Persian leopard reintroduction centre was created in Sochi National Park, where two male leopards from Turkmenistan are being kept since September 2009, and two females from Iran since May 2010. Their descendants will be released into the wild in the Caucasus Biosphere Reserve.In 2012, a pair of Persian leopards were brought to the Sochi National park from Portugal's Lisbon Zoo. In July 2013, the pair had a litter, the first Persian Leopard cubs known to be born in Russia in 50 years. The cubs will be released into the wild after learning survival skills from their parents, according to Natalia Dronova, the WWF-Russia species coordinator.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCaucasus mixed forests\nCaucasian Wisent\nNational parks of Russia\nNature reserves of Russia (zapovedniks)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMinistry of Natural Resources of Russian Federation: Sochi National Park website - detailed park profile\nMap of Sochi National Park - ProtectedPlanet.net",

Roza Khutor, IPA: [\u02c8roz\u0259 \u02c8xut\u0259r]) is an alpine ski resort in Krasnodar Krai, Russia, located at the Aibga Ridge of the Western Caucasus along the Roza Khutor plateau near Krasnaya Polyana. Constructed from 2003 to 2011, it hosted the alpine skiing events for the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, based in nearby Sochi. The resort is 50 kilometers (30 mi) east of the Black Sea at Sochi; the majority of the slopes at Rosa Khutor face northeast, with the backside slopes facing southwest.\n\n\n== Elevations ==\n\nThe lower base area of Roza Valley at the Mzymta River is at an elevation of 560 meters (1,840 ft) above sea level. The highest lift is the Caucasus Express gondola, which climbs to the summit of Roza Peak at 2,320 m (7,610 ft), yielding a total vertical drop of over a mile at 1,760 m (5,770 ft). The main base area for skiing is at Roza Plateau at 1,170 m (3,840 ft), a vertical drop of 1,150 m (3,770 ft) from the summit. Besedka, the mid-mountain area, is at 1,350 m (4,430 ft) and is the lower loading station of the Caucasus Express; which has a mid-lift loading station at Roza-1600, about a mile above sea level at 1,600 m (5,200 ft).

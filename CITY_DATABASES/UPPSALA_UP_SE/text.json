        "wiki": "Gamla Uppsala (Swedish: [\u02c8\u0261\u00e2m\u02d0la \u02c8\u0275\u0302p\u02d0\u02ccs\u0251\u02d0la], Old Uppsala) is a parish and a village outside Uppsala in Sweden. It had 17,973 inhabitants in 2016.As early as the 3rd century AD and the 4th century AD and onwards, it was an important religious, economic and political centre. Early written sources claim that already during pre-history, Gamla Uppsala was well known in Northern Europe as the residence of Swedish kings of the legendary Yngling dynasty. In fact, the oldest Scandinavian sources, such as Ynglingatal, the Westrogothic law and the Gutasaga talk of the King of the Swedes (Suiones) as the \"King at Uppsala\".During the Middle Ages, it was the largest village of Uppland, the eastern part of which probably originally formed the core of the complex of properties belonging to the Swedish Crown, the so-called Uppsala \u00f6d, of which the western part consisted of the royal estate itself, kungsg\u00e5rden.It was also the location of the Thing of all Swedes which was a thing (general assembly) held from pre-historic times to the Middle Ages, at the end of February or early March.\nIt was held in conjunction with a great fair called Disting, and a Norse religious celebration called D\u00edsabl\u00f3t.\nThe Law of Uppland says that it was at this assembly that the king proclaimed that the leidang would be summoned for warfare during the summer, and all the crews, rowers, commanders and ships were decided.It was not only the Norse cultic centre, it also became Sweden's archbishopric in 1164.\n\n\n== Geographical description ==\nGamla Uppsala lies on Fyris Wolds, a cultivated plain in the valley of the River Fyris which is densely populated in its southern part, while the northern part consists of farms.\n\n\n== Religious importance ==\n\nMedieval Scandinavians held Gamla Uppsala as one of the oldest and most important locations in Scandinavia. The Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus held Odin himself to have resided in Gamla Uppsala far back in the mists of time:\n\nAt this time there was one Odin, who was credited over all Europe with the honour, which was false, of godhead, but used more continually to sojourn at Uppsala; and in this spot, either from the sloth of the inhabitants or from its own pleasantness, he vouchsafed to dwell with somewhat especial constancy.\nThis tradition was also known by the Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson, who, however had Odin reside in nearby Fornsigtuna, whereas the god Freyr lived in Gamla Uppsala. Freyr is also said to have founded two of the central institutions of Iron Age Sweden, the Uppsala \u00f6d and the Temple at Uppsala:\n\nFrey took the kingdom after Njord, and was called drot by the Swedes, and they paid taxes to him. He was, like his father, fortunate in friends and in good seasons. Frey built a great temple at Uppsala, made it his chief seat, and gave it all his taxes, his land, and goods. Then began the Upsal domains, which have remained ever since.Saxo Grammaticus adds that Freyr began the human sacrifices at Gamla Uppsala:\n\nAlso Frey, the regent of the gods, took his abode not far from Uppsala, where he exchanged for a ghastly and infamous sin-offering the old custom of prayer by sacrifice, which had been used by so many ages and generations. For he paid to the gods abominable offerings, by beginning to slaughter human victims.\nThe sacrifices at the Temple at Uppsala are described by Adam of Bremen:\n\nIn the scolia, there is an additional description:\n\nNear that temple is a very large tree with widespread branches which are always green both in winter and summer. What kind of tree it is nobody knows. There is also a spring there where the pagan are accustomed to perform sacrifices and to immerse a human being alive. As long as his body is not found, the request of the people will be fulfilled. A golden chain encircles that temple and hangs over the gables of the building. Those who approach see its gleam from afar off because the shrine, which is located on a plain, is encircled by mountains so situated as to give the effect of a theatre. For nine days feasts and sacrifices of this kind are celebrated. Every day they sacrifice one human being in addition to other animals, so that in nine days there are 72 victims which are sacrificed. This sacrifice takes place about the time of the vernal equinox.\nIt was a symbolic moment when Pope John Paul II visited Scandinavia in 1989 and held an open-air mass at the royal mounds in Gamla Uppsala, as this was a Norse religion cultic centre, which became Sweden's first archbishopric in 1164.In 2000, the Swedish AsatruSociety restarted the tradition of holding bl\u00f3ts at Gamla Uppsala.The 16th-century Archbishop of Uppsala Johannes Magnus asserted that the city was anciently founded by, and named for, an early Swedish king named Ubbo (Uppsala = Ubbo's Hall), who would have supposedly reigned ca. 2300 BC.  However, in the absence of any corroborating evidence, Magnus' accounts no longer enjoy widespread acceptance among scholars today.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt is a testimony to the sanctity of the location in the mindset of followers of medieval Norse religion that Gamla Uppsala was the last stronghold of pre-Christian, Norse Germanic kingship. During the 1070s and 1080 there appears to have been a renaissance of Norse religion with the magnificent Temple at Uppsala described in a contested account through an eye-witness by Adam of Bremen. Adam of Bremen relates of the Uppsala of the 1070s and describes it as a pagan cult centre with the enormous Temple at Uppsala containing wooden statues of Odin, Thor and Freyr.\nSometime in the 1080s the Christian king Ingi was exiled for refusing to perform the sacrifices. Instead Blot-Sweyn was elected, but he was killed by Ingi who could then reclaim his throne.\nIts great importance in Swedish tradition led to the location of Sweden's first Archbishopric in Gamla Uppsala in 1164. In practice, however, it had lost its strategic importance when it gradually lost ready access to navigable waters as the land rose owing to the constant post-glacial rebound.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\nPeople have been buried in Gamla Uppsala for 2,000 years, since the area rose above water. Originally there were between 2,000 and 3,000 mounds in the area but most have become farmland, gardens and quarries. Today only 250 barrows remain.\nIn the parish there are more than 1,000 preserved archaeological remains, but many more have been removed by agriculture. There are cairns of splintered stone that reveal that the area was settled during the Nordic Bronze Age, but most of the grave fields are from the Iron Age and the Viking Age.\nThe great grave field south of the Royal Mounds is from the Roman Iron Age and the Germanic Iron Age. Near the vicarage, a few unburnt graves from the Viking Age have been excavated.\nUnder the present church in Gamla Uppsala have been found the remains of one or several large wooden buildings. Some archaeologists believe that they are the remains of the Temple of Uppsala, while others hold that comes from an early Christian wooden church. Churches were often built on pre-Christian sacred sites, though.\nAdjacent to the present church there is a plateau of clay, the Plateau of the Royal Estate (Kungsg\u00e5rdsplat\u00e5n), on which archaeologists have found the remains of a large hall.\n\n\n== The Royal Mounds ==\n\nThe Royal Mounds (Swedish: Kungsh\u00f6garna) is the name of the three large barrows located in Gamla Uppsala. According to ancient mythology and folklore, the three gods Thor, Oden and Freyr would be at rest in Kungsh\u00f6garna or Uppsala h\u00f6gar (from the Old Norse word Haugr meaning mound or barrow; cognate English Howe). In the 19th and 20th centuries, they were speculated to hold the remains of three kings of the semi-legendary House of Ynglings and were thus known as Aun's Mound, Adils's Mound and Egil's Mound. Today their geographical locations are used instead and they are called the Eastern mound, Middle Mound and Western Mound.\nThey are dated to the 5th and 6th centuries. As Sweden's oldest national symbols they are even depicted on the covers of books about the Swedish national identity. In the 6th century, Gamla Uppsala was the location of royal burials. The location was chosen carefully and in order to make them majestic. The tumuli were constructed on top of the ridge.\nBy burning the dead king and his armour, he was moved to Valhalla by the consuming force of the fire. The fire could reach temperatures of 1500 \u00b0C. The remains were covered with cobblestones and then a layer of gravel and sand and finally a thin layer of turf.\n\nThus he (Odin) established by law that all dead men should be burned, and their belongings laid with them upon the pile, and the ashes be cast into the sea or buried in the earth.  Thus, said he, every one will come to Valhalla with the riches he had with him upon the pile; and he would also enjoy whatever he himself had buried in the earth. For men of consequence a mound should be raised to their memory, and for all other warriors who had been distinguished for manhood a standing stone; which custom remained long after Odin's time. [...] It was their faith that the higher the smoke arose in the air, the higher he would be raised whose pile it was; and the richer he would be, the more property that was consumed with him.\n\u2014Ynglinga saga\n\n\n=== An old controversy and its solution ===\nIn the 1830s, some scholars claimed that the mounds were pure natural formations and not barrows. This affront to ancient Swedish national symbols could not be accepted by the future Swedish king Karl XV and in order to remove any doubt, he decided to start an excavation.The task was given to Bror Emil Hildebrand, the director-general of the National Archives. In 1846, he undertook the excavation of the nine-metres-tall (30 ft) Eastern mound with the hope of finding the grave of a Swedish king of old.\n\n\n==== The eastern mound ====\n\nThe excavation was complex and generated a lot of publicity. A 25-metre-long (82 ft) tunnel was dug into the mound, where they found a pot of clay filled with burnt bones and around it there were the remains of the charred grave offerings.\nAmong the most important finds in the eastern mound were many fragments of decorated bronze panels with a dancing warrior carrying a spear. These panels have probably adorned a helmet of the Vendel Age type, common in Uppland (the only foreign examples being the Sutton Hoo and Staffordshire helmets). There were also finds of gold which probably had adorned a scramasax, but according to another interpretation, they were part of a belt. The dead was also given several glass beakers, a tafl game, a comb and a hone.\nMost scholars agree that the mound was either raised for a woman or for a young man and a woman as the remains of a woman and boy were found. Hildebrand reburied most of the remains, so a new excavation will need to be undertaken before the controversy can be settled. What is quite certain is that the dead belonged to a royal dynasty.\n\n\n==== The western mound ====\n\nIn 1874, Hildebrand started an excavation of the western mound and opened an enormous shaft right into the cairn in the centre of the mound. Under the cobble stones, there were the charred remains of the funeral fire.\nIn the western mound were found the remains of a man and animals, probably for food during the journey. The remains of a warrior's equipment were found. Luxurious weapons and other objects, both domestic and imported, show that the buried man was very powerful. These remains include a Frankish sword adorned with gold and garnets and a board game with Roman pawns of ivory. He was dressed in a costly suit made of Frankish cloth with golden threads, and he wore a belt with a sumptuous buckle. There were four cameos from the Middle East which were probably part of a casket. The finds show the distant contacts of the people of Uppland in the 6th century.\n\n\n== Gamla Uppsala Church ==\nGamla Uppsala Church (Gamla Uppsala kyrka) was the Archbishopric of Sweden prior to 1273, when the archbishopric was moved to \u00d6stra Aros (\u00d6stra Aros was then renamed Uppsala due to a papal request). The old cathedral was probably built in the 11th century, but finished in the 12th century. The stone building may have been preceded by a wooden church and probably by the large Temple at Uppsala. After a fire in 1240, the nave and transepts of the cathedral were removed, leaving only the choir and central tower, and with the addition of the sacristy and the porch gave the church its present outer appearance. In the 15th century, vaults were added as well as chalk paintings. Among the medieval wooden sculptures there are three crucifixes from the 12th, 13th and 15th centuries. Archbishop Valerius  was buried here. King Eric IX of Sweden was as well, before being moved to Uppsala Cathedral. Astronomer, physicist and mathematician Anders Celsius (1701\u20131744) was also buried at Gamla Uppsala Church next to his grandfather Magnus Celsius (1621\u20131679).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKlingmark, Elisabeth: Gamla Uppsala, Svenska kulturminnen 59, Riksantikvarie\u00e4mbetet.\nNationalencyklopedin\n\n\n== External links ==\nVirtual tour of Gamla Uppsala Church\nArcheological information on Gamla Uppsala, by the Swedish National Heritage Board.\nUppsala official site.\nHistorical Reference from Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum, Book IV, with Facing Latin and English text.",

          "The cathedral is the tallest church building in Scandinavia. The exterior design looks authentic. The interior looks impressive - the floor is devided by cells. Each large window is decorated by stained-glass. English guided tour is available. Multi-lingual (including Japanese)",
          "Ben herr before on one wedding and two baptisms and a few concerts. But it certainly deserves a visit just for the building itself.",
          "The physical building is marvelous to be hold. The sermons are, of course in Swedish - theologically liberal, spiritually vacuous, and damning to the searching soul. Still the church's architecture and history is worth a visit.",

          "A magnificent church with rich history and a beautiful interior. We had a weekend in uppsala and the first to do was the uppsala domkyrka. We were lucky with the weather and had a beautiful autumn day with colourful trees and a refreshing temperature. And the church really does",
          "And nothing wow inside, looks much better on the exterior, except the gypsies cooking on the grass behind the church. The authorities should do something about them. I liked the church, dont get me wrong, but I have seen better in my treks through Sweden. It just looks like",

          "I'm not a church expert all though I've been to many famous ones. This one is old and big but not super pretty. Still a place to visit if you're in Uppsala.",
          "Impressive cathedral. Worth your attention. Take your time and walk through the different chambers. Won't regret it",
          "Large, very impressive cathedral, though the stern interior is somewhat uninspiring. The extremely ornate pulprit seems oddly out of place.",

          "We took the train from Stockholm central to Uppsala. It took about 40 minutes. The City is a small one. There is a castle and some museums to see. The museums were free but the castle cost 100 SEK each. There are shops and cafes too too visit. Worth a visit for half a day.",

          "This is worth a visit if you have been to Gamla Uppsala and allows the viewer some context to the two sites. As a place to visit in its own right I felt this to be of average interest. On the upside the cafe was definitely worth a visit.",
          "The cathedral is the largest in Scandinavia and one of the oldest one. If the Gothic interior makes you think of French cathedrals, it is because one of the first architect worked on Notre Dame in Paris. That said, as any cathedral, it has been built and renovated over",

          "As a building this church never ceases to amaze me. It was built in a time when power tools weren't available and the result is a true masterpiece. Whether you are visiting for a concert, a service or just for having a quick look you will see that a lot of effort has gone into",
          "If you have traveled to Europe, then you have been to an old church or two. If you need to check the largest one in Sweden off your list, then here it is. Honestly, I found that the Protestant conversion led to the building of a bastion with cannons pointed at this church than",

          "I go there a lot, especially with my pupils. All the children sort of hold their breath when they pass through the giant front entrance. Before that we use to stay outside close to the towers looking up. It feels like the towers are swaying.... Inside, I tell them about",
          "There really is no reason to not visit the Cathedral if you are visiting Uppsala. Its impressive architecture is worth seeing for that alone. However, there are also many important and influential people from Swedish history buried in the Cathedral and as a historical site there",

          "This cathedral is an amazing place to visit. It is free to enter, but a minor inconvenience is the fee for a pamphlet. There isn't a lot of information on tombs and art in the church since it's still primarily a church in use daily, so bring information with you to fully enjoy",
          "The size of this cathedral is really impressive you can distinctly from the Royal Mounds in Gamla Uppsala.",

          "We wandered into this church with no expectations, just killing a little time. It was amazing! Beautiful example of a middle ages church that has been adapted to fit the many eras it has seen. King Vasa is buried here, a fact that isn't prominently noted. There have been",
          "The Uppsala Domkyrka is not merely worthy of your attention because it is Sweden's largest cathedral. There are a number of interesting tombs, including Carl Linnaus and Emmanuel Swedenborg. The astonishing surprise is the \"Treasury\", situated in the north-west tower. It costs",

          "This is a huge cathedral, you can't miss it in Uppsala. Entry seems to be free, it was for me anyway, as I couldn't see how I would pay. I planned to spend 20 minutes and ended up staying over an hour. Every few feet has something interesting to see, use Google Translate App",

          "This church, the largest in Scandanavia, dominates the Uppsala skyline and is the premiere sight to see in the city. walk around for an hour or two and take it in. Often there were be choirs practicing or someone playing the organ which adds to the effect. The vault is 40",
          "Swedens largest dome. Of course you have to see it. Dont miss the dirty brick in the first chamber on the left side. It is left uncleaned at the last refurbishing. They cleaned the church inside with a loaf of bread.",
          "We started in Gamla Uppsala at the burial mounds but the things we really wanted to see where moved to the Uppsala Domkyrka. The cathedral is gorgeous and here you can see ancient runestones. If you only do 1 thing in Uppsala, go here!",

          "Visited with grandchildren, the small girls loved the grandeur of this temple with its long story. Gustavianum tomb is amazing",
          "Dominating the area and sitting just above the town, the cathedral is most impressive inside and out. Exceptionally high ceilings, huge concrete pillars, patterned ceiling, stained glass, chandeliers, crypts and artefacts - a lot to take in. Certainly captures your attention and",
          "If you visit Uppsala no doubt you should visit the Cathedral. It's high two towers are seen from the palace hill and a nice walk downhill will lead you to the old town and the cathedral square. Built of red bricks as many important buildings in Scandinavia. Inside an impressive",
          "From a non believer point of view it was an interesting way to learn a little bit about Uppsala and Sweden. Beautiful, huge architecture, worth the visit if that is your cup of tea.",
          "I compare this Cathedral with the Cathedral in Antwerp (Belgium) and the one in York (UK). I was impressed by both of them and I was certainly impressed by this one in Uppsala. It is certainly worth a visit, and if possible go also in one of the towers.",
          "First thing my wife said (she's Catholic) was that this was a Catholic cathedral. I told her that Sweden was a Lutheran country (for the most part). She said it had much of the Catholic iconography. So we asked about it and true enough, it WAS a Catholic cathedral until the",
          "The size of the Cathedral is indeed impressive. The interior is very nice, although it cannot compare with the (much older) cathedrals in central and western Europe. You will pass by anyway when strolling through Uppsala's old town, so why not make a stop?",
          "If you visit Uppsala, the Catheadral is a must see. Very impressive and beauty full. Also take the chance to enter the one of the towers if opened.",
          "Very impressive Cathedral, particularly on the interior. The exterior is also massive, but the finishes are from different styles and era, mainly of brick. Very historic building and many associations with Scandinavian royalty.",
          "Gorgeous cathedral with stained glass, paintings, carvings, statues and crypts including Linnaeus, bishops and some Swedish royalty. Well worth the time to explore.",
          "It's a beautiful cathederal both inside and out. The staff are very friendly and accomodating. Just be mindful that if a wedding or church services is happening you won't be able to tour the interior. If you find yourself in that situation Uppsala is a beautiful city to walk",
          "The church is impressive and located in the heart of Uppsala. The surrounding blocks have another feel and look comparing to the rest of the city. The outside is just as impressive as the inside of the old church.",
          "A very beautifully decorated Lutheran church whose spires dominate the skyline for miles around. It may not be open if church services are in progress. In the castle grounds by the Gunilla bell tower above the church, a row of cannons are placed to show that the king was",

          "It was a nice walk through town and uphill hike on the edge of the Uppsala University campus but once there indeed it was another large European cathedral. Once Catholic, now a place of worship for the church of Sweden. A quick visit on an afternoon walk about.",
          "This cathedral is really something to see in Uppsala - not only that is huge and therefore breathtaking, but also the inside of it is worth checking out. There are some magnificent tombs, the walls are also the work of art, with the motives of swedish history, etc. And next to",

          "A big beautiful building that shows from different parts of the city...gives Uppsala a more intimidating appearance...wonderful place...must visit while there",
          "I didn't experience this as overly spiritual. One, it's poorly lit. And it doesn't help that the walls and side rooms are dark too. Two, there are many tombstones inside, sitting above ground. There is also this freaky mannequin of a woman up front, and I\"m quite certain",
          "Must visit if you are visiting uppsala. Very commanding structure beautifully located. Go as a tourist or with religious inclinations it is worth visiting",
          "Interesting Gothic church, made of brick, instead of stone, like the one you usually see elsewhere in Europe. It's by the University, but it's difficult to miss, since we were told it's the tallest church building in Scandinavia. Some renovations were done in the 1700s and late",

          "We unfortunately got here too late to see inside but even so it was worth a visit. It's so incredibly tall you have to crane your neck up. This building makes you feel so small. The infomation boards placed around were great at giving an insight to Uppsala's history.",

          "A somewhat rugged version of your basic cathedral. If you are from scandinavia its worth the visit, if for nothing else, just from a historical viewpoint. One can only wonder what the poor clergymen from the outreaches of kingdom must have thought of its majesty a century after",

        "wiki": "Uppsala University (Swedish: Uppsala universitet) is a research university in Uppsala, Sweden. Founded in 1477, it is the oldest university in Sweden and all of the Nordic countries still in operation. It ranks among the world's 100 best universities in several high-profile international rankings. The university uses \"Gratiae veritas naturae\" as its motto and embraces natural sciences.\nThe university rose to pronounced significance during the rise of Sweden as a great power at the end of the 16th century and was then given a relative financial stability with the large donation of King Gustavus Adolphus in the early 17th century. Uppsala also has an important historical place in Swedish national culture, identity and for the Swedish establishment: in historiography, literature, politics, and music. Many aspects of Swedish academic culture in general, such as the white student cap, originated in Uppsala. It shares some peculiarities, such as the student nation system, with Lund University and the University of Helsinki.\nUppsala belongs to the Coimbra Group of European universities and to the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities. The university has nine faculties distributed over three \"disciplinary domains\". It has about 44,000 registered students and 2,300 doctoral students. It has a teaching staff of roughly 1,800 (part-time and full-time) out of a total of 6,900 employees. Twenty-eight per cent of the 716 professors at the university are women. Of its turnover of SEK 6.6 billion (approx. USD 775 million) in 2016, 29% was spent on education at Bachelor's and Master's level, while 70% was spent on research and research programs.Architecturally, Uppsala University has traditionally had a strong presence in Fj\u00e4rdingen, the neighbourhood around the cathedral on the western side of the River Fyris. Despite some more contemporary building developments further away from the centre, Uppsala's historic centre continues to be dominated by the presence of the university.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 15th century: origins ===\nAs with most medieval universities, Uppsala University initially grew out of an ecclesiastical center. The archbishopric of Uppsala had been one of the most important sees in Sweden proper since Christianity first spread to this region in the ninth century. Uppsala had also long been a hub for regional trade, and had contained settlements dating back into the deep Middle Ages. As was also the case with most medieval universities, Uppsala had initially been chartered through a papal bull. Uppsala's bull, which granted the university its corporate rights, was issued by Pope Sixtus IV in 1477, and established a number of provisions. Among the most important of these was that the university was officially given the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna. This included the right to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor's, master's, licentiate, and doctoral degrees. The archbishop of Uppsala was also named as the university's Chancellor, and was charged with maintaining the rights and privileges of the university and its members.\n\n\n=== 16th century: Turbulent times ===\n\nThe turbulent period of the reformation of King Gustavus Vasa resulted in a drop in the already relatively insignificant number of students in Uppsala, which was seen as a center of Catholicism and of potential disloyalty to the Crown. Swedish students generally travelled to one of the Protestant universities in Germany, especially Wittenberg. There is some evidence of academic studies in Uppsala during the 16th century; the Faculty of Theology is mentioned in a document from 1526, King Eric XIV appointed Laurentius Petri Gothus (later archbishop) rector of the university in 1566, and his successor and brother John III appointed a number of professors in the period 1569\u20131574. At the end of the century the situation had changed, and Uppsala became a bastion of Lutheranism, which Duke Charles, the third of the sons of Gustavus Vasa to eventually become king (as Charles IX) used to consolidate his power and eventually oust his nephew Sigismund from the throne. The Meeting of Uppsala in 1593 established Lutheran orthodoxy in Sweden, and Charles and the Council of state gave new privileges to the university on 1 August of the same year.\nTheology still had precedence, but in the privileges of 1593, the importance of a university to educate secular servants of the state was also emphasized. Three of the seven professorial chairs which were established were in Theology; of the other four, three were in Astronomy, Physics (or general natural sciences) and Latin eloquence. A fourth chair was given to Ericus Jacobi Skinnerus, who was also appointed rector, but whose discipline was not mentioned in the charter. Of the professors, several were taken over from the Collegium Regium in Stockholm, which had been functioning for a few years but closed in 1593. An eighth chair, in Medicine, was established in 1595 but received no appointee for several years. In 1599 the number of students was approximately 150. In 1600 the first post-reformation conferment of degrees took place. In the same year, the antiquarian and mystic Johannes Bureus designed and engraved the seal of the university, which is today used as part of the logotype.\n\n\n=== 17th century: Expansion ===\nThe medieval university had mainly been a school for theology. The aspirations of the emergent new great power of Sweden demanded a different kind of learning. Sweden both grew through conquests and went through a complete overhaul of its administrative structure. It required a much larger class of civil servants and educators than before. Preparatory schools, gymnasiums, were also founded during this period in various cathedral towns, notably V\u00e4ster\u00e5s (the first one) in 1623. Beside Uppsala, new universities were founded in more distant parts of the Swedish Realm, the University of Dorpat (present-day Tartu) in Estonia (1632) and the University of \u00c5bo in Finland (1640). After the Scanian provinces were taken from Denmark, Lund University was founded in 1666.\nInstrumental in the reforms of the early 17th-century Swedish state was the long-dominant Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, who had spent his own student days in German universities and who for the last years before his death was also chancellor of the university. King Gustavus Adolphus showed the university a keen interest and increased the professorial chairs from eight to thirteen in 1620, and again to seventeen in 1621. In 1624 the king donated \"for all eternity\" all his own inherited personal property in the provinces of Uppland and V\u00e4stmanland, some 300 farms, mills and other sources of income. The king's former private tutor, Johan Skytte, who was made chancellor of the university in 1622, donated the Skyttean chair in Eloquence and Government which still exists. The university received a stable structure with its constitution of 1626. The head of the university was to be the chancellor, his deputy was the \"pro-chancellor\" (always the archbishop ex officio). The immediate rule was the responsibility of the consistory, to which belonged all the professors of the university, and the rector magnificus, who was elected for a semester at the time; the latter position circulated among the professors, each of whom sometimes held it several times.\nDuring the late 16th and early 17th centuries (and perhaps even earlier), the university was located to the old chapter house parallel to the south side of the cathedral, later renamed the Academia Carolina. In 1622\u20131625 a new university building was built east of the cathedral, the so-called Gustavianum, named after the reigning king. In the 1630s, the total number of students were about one thousand.\n\nQueen Christina was generous to the university, gave scholarships to Swedish students to study abroad and recruited foreign scholars to Uppsala chairs, among them several from the University of Strassburg, notably the philologist Johannes Schefferus (professor skytteanus), whose little library and museum building at S:t Eriks torg now belongs to the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala. The Queen, who would eventually declare her abdication in the great hall of Uppsala Castle, visited the university on many occasions; in 1652 she was present at an anatomical demonstration arranged at the castle for the young physician Olaus Rudbeck. Rudbeck, one of several sons of Johannes Rudbeckius, a former Uppsala professor who became Bishop of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, was sent for a year to the progressive University of Leiden in the Netherlands. Returning in 1654, he received an assistantship in Medicine in 1655, and had already gone to work on a program of improving aspects of the university. He planted the first botanical garden, the one which would eventually be tended by Carl Linnaeus and is kept today as a museum of 18th century botany under the name Linnaeus' Garden. With the patronage of the university chancellor Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, Rudbeck was made full professor in 1660, was elected rector for two terms, despite his youth, and started a revision of the work of the other professors and a building spree with himself as architect. His most significant remaining architectural work is the anatomical theatre, which was added to Gustavianum in the 1660s and crowned with the characteristic cupola for which the building is today known.\nA gifted scientist, architect and engineer, Rudbeck was the dominant personality of the university in the late 17th century who laid some of the groundwork for Linnaeus and others, but he is perhaps more known today for the pseudohistorical speculations of his Atlantica, which consumed much of his later life. When large parts of Uppsala burned down in 1702, Gustavianum, which contained the university library and its many valuable manuscripts, escaped the fire; local lore has it that the aging Rudbeck stood on the roof directing the work of fighting the fire.\n\n\n=== 18th century: Enlightenment and mercantilism ===\nThe early part of the 18th century was still characterized by the combination of Lutheran orthodoxy and classical philology of the previous century, but eventually a larger emphasis on sciences and practically useful knowledge developed. The innovative mathematician and physicist Samuel Klingenstierna (1698\u20131765) was made a professor in 1728, the physicist and astronomer Anders Celsius in 1729, and Carl Linnaeus was made professor of Medicine with Botany in 1741. The university was not immune to the parliamentary struggle between the parties known as the \"Hats\" and the \"Caps\", with the former having a preference for hard sciences and practical knowledge. The Hat government then in power established a chair in economics (\u0152conomia publica) in 1741 and called Anders Berch as its first incumbent. This was the first professorship in economics outside Germany, and possibly the third in Europe (the first chairs having been established in Halle and Frankfurt (Oder) in 1727). In 1759, following a donation, another chair in economy was established, the Borgstr\u00f6mian professorship in \"practical economy\", by which was meant the practical application of the natural sciences for economic purposes (it eventually developed into a chair for physiological botany).\nThere were very radical attempts at reforms which were never implemented, but important changes took place. University studies had until this time been very informal in their overall organization, with the all-purpose philosophi\u00e6 magister-degree being the only one frequently conferred and many never graduating, as there were no degree applicable to their intended area of work (and well-connected aristocratic students often not graduating as they did not need to). A few professional degrees for various purposes were introduced in 1749\u20131750, but the radical suggestion of binding students to a single program of study adapted to a particular profession was never implemented. The reforms of this era have been compared to those of the 1960s and 1970s (Sten Lindroth).\nAlthough it took some time after the fire of 1702, Uppsala Cathedral and Uppsala Castle were both eventually restored, both by Carl H\u00e5rleman, perhaps the most important Swedish architect of the era. He also modified Gustavianum, designed a new conservatory for Linnaeus' botanical garden and built the new Consistory house, which was to be the administrative core of the university.\nAnother magnificent royal donation was that of the large baroque garden of the castle, given by Gustavus III to the university when it was obvious that the old botanical garden was insufficient. A large new conservatory was built by the architect Louis Jean Desprez. Additional grounds adjacent to the baroque garden has since been added. The old garden of Rudbeck and Linnaeus was largely left to decay, but was reconstructed in the years between 1918 and 1923 according to the specifications of Linnaeus in his work Hortus Upsaliensis from 1745.\n\n\n=== Women at the university ===\nThe issue of women's right to study at universities was raised during the very last session of the estate parliament in 1865 in a motion from Carl Johan Svens\u00e9n, a member of the farmers' estate. The reception was mixed, with the most negative views coming from the clergy. In the following years the issue continued to be debated at the universities. In 1870, it was decided to let women take the secondary school examination (\"studentexamen\") that gave the right to entry at universities and the right to study and complete degrees at the faculties of Medicine in Uppsala and Lund and at the Caroline Institute of Medicine and Surgery in Stockholm. A common view was that the female sensitivity and compassion would make women capable of working as physicians, but their right to work was still restricted to private practice. Women's rights to higher education was extended in 1873, when all degrees except those in the faculties of theology and the licentiate degree in Law were made accessible for women.\nThe first female student in Sweden was Betty Pettersson (1838\u20131885), who had already worked as a private tutor for several years when she took \"studentexamen\" in 1871. With a royal dispensation, she was allowed to enter university in Uppsala in 1872, the year before studies at the Philosophical faculty would actually be made generally available to women. She studied modern European languages and was the first woman in Sweden to complete an academic degree when she finished a fil. kand. in 1875. She became the first woman to be employed as a teacher in a public school for boys. The first woman in Sweden to complete a doctoral degree was Ellen Fries (1855\u20131900), who entered Uppsala university in 1877 and became a PhD in history in 1883. Other female students of this period includes Lydia Wahlstr\u00f6m (1869\u20131954) who later became a noted educator, activist and writer on women's emancipation and suffrage. Defending a dissertation in history in 1900, she became the second woman to finish a doctorate at a Swedish university. In 1892, she founded the Uppsala Women's Student Association, who set up spex performances and other things enjoyed by male students but from which the women were excluded at the time. The members of the Association were the first woman to wear the student caps in public, an important sign of their status. Elsa Eschelsson (1861\u20131911) was the first Swedish woman to finish a law degree, and the first to become a \"docent\", but was not permitted to even hold the position of acting professor despite being formally qualified for this in everything but her sex. After years of conflicts with the professor of civil law A. O. Winroth, who wrote the paper on \"Om tjenstehjonsf\u00f6rh\u00e5llandet\" and with the university board, she died in 1911 from an overdose of sleeping-powder.\nAccording to the constitution of 1809, only \"native Swedish men\" could be appointed to higher civil servant positions, including professorships. This was changed in 1925, and the first woman to hold a professorial chair at Uppsala University was Gerd Enequist, appointed professor of human geography in 1949.\nHildegard Bj\u00f6rck who studied in the university became the first Swedish woman to receive an academic degree.\n\n\n== Administration and organisation ==\n\n\n=== Central administration ===\nThe governing board of the university is the consistory, with representatives of the faculties as well as members representing the students and non-academic employees (three professors and three students), and ten university outsiders appointed by the Swedish government. All these members in the consistory have the right to vote.\nThe unions active at the university also have three representatives in the consistory; these members have the right to speak but not any right to vote.\nSince the last reorganization in 1999 the university has a separate body called the academic senate, which is a wider, but mostly advisory group representing teaching staff / researchers and students. The executive head of the university is the rector magnificus, whose deputy is the prorector. There are (also since 1999) three vice rectors, each heading one of the three \"disciplinary domains\" (Arts and Social Sciences, Medicine and Pharmacy, and Science and Technology) into which the nine faculties are divided. Each faculty has a faculty board and is headed by a dean (dekanus). The position of dean is held part-time by a professor of the faculty.\n\n\n=== Faculties ===\nThrough division of faculties and the addition of a previously independent school of Pharmacy as a new faculty, the traditional four-faculty organization of European universities has evolved into the present nine faculties:\n\nThe disciplinary domain of Arts and Social Sciences includes the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Social Sciences, the Faculty of Languages, the Faculty of Theology, the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Educational Sciences (formerly the Department of Education, that was raised to the status of a faculty in its own right in 2002).\nThe disciplinary domain of Medicine and Pharmacy includes the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Pharmacy. The Faculty of Pharmacy was originally an independent \"royal institute\" in Stockholm, which was moved to Uppsala and incorporated with the university between 1968 and 1972.\nThe disciplinary domain of Science and Technology includes only the Faculty of Science and Technology. The engineering programs have from 1982 been marketed as the Uppsala School of Engineering (Uppsala Tekniska H\u00f6gskola). This has however never been a separate institution, but only a unit within the Faculty of Science and Technology and use of the term has been phased out after the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was renamed the Faculty of Sciences and Technology in the 1990s.Uppsala University also hosts the Forum for South Asia Studies, a collaborative academic effort by its six faculties: Theology, Law, History and Philosophy, Social Sciences, Languages, and Educational Sciences. The Forum aims facilitate and promote research and education related to the South Asian countries: India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, the Maldives and Afghanistan, on the national and international level, with Ferdinando Sardella, Faculty of Theology, serving as the Forum's director.\n\n\n=== Faculty of Law ===\nThe Faculty of Law (Juridiska fakulteten) is the oldest one in the Nordic countries and existed before 1477 (when the University of Uppsala was founded).\nThe activities of the faculty include a wide range of research areas and specializations. This Faculty has one department: the Department of Law.\n\n\n=== University Library ===\n\nThe university library holds about 5.25 million volumes of books and periodicals (131,293 shelf meters), 61,959 manuscripts, 7,133 music prints, and 345,734 maps and other graphic documents. The holdings of the collection of manuscripts and music includes, among other things, the Gothic Bible manuscript Codex Argenteus.\n\nThe most widely recognized building of the university library is Carolina Rediviva, the \"revived Carolina\", thus named in reference to Academia Carolina (see illustration), which held the university library from the earliest times until 1691, when it was moved to the upper floor of Gustavianum, where it miraculously survived the great city fire of 1702. In the mid-18th century, there were plans to move it back to the Academia Carolina or a new building on the same spot. The building was demolished in 1778 to make place for a new library, but this was never built and the area next to the cathedral where it stood is today a lawn. The present Carolina Rediviva was built in a different place and completed in 1841.\nThe present university library system comprises 19 branches, including the one in the Carolina building.\n\n\n=== Uppsala University Hospital ===\n\nThe Uppsala Academic Hospital or Akademiska sjukhuset, which functions as a teaching hospital for the Faculty of Medicine and the Nursing School, is run by the Uppsala County Council in cooperation with the university. As of 2003, the hospital had 7,719 employees and as of 2004 1,079 places for patients.\nThe university hospital is actually older than the university, as it goes back to the earliest hospital, founded in Uppsala in 1302, much later merged with the university clinic. This was used for 400 years until the great fire of 1702 which destroyed large parts of central Uppsala. A new hospital, which later became the Uppsala county hospital, was built in its place, but was moved out of the town in 1811.\n\nThe first clinic with the specific intention to facilitate the practical education of medical students was the Nosocomium Academicum, founded in 1708 and located to the Oxenstierna Palace at Riddartorget beside the cathedral (see illustration above). The building (the former residence of the President of the Royal Chancellery Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna) today houses the Faculty of Law.\nThe present Akademiska sjukhuset was founded in 1850 as an organizational merger of the county hospital and the university clinic, and a new building was inaugurated in 1867 on the hill below Uppsala Castle to the southeast. From this building, which is still in use, the present hospital complex has grown.\n\n\n=== The Svedberg Laboratory ===\nThe Svedberg Laboratory (named after Theodore The Svedberg) is a university facility that contains the Gustaf Werner cyclotron, which is used for research as well as for proton therapy for the treatment of cancer with close cooperation with the oncology clinic at Uppsala University Hospital. Such an accelerator and its gantries costs between $60 million and $100 million, and makes Uppsala University Hospital one of the approximately 40 centers in the world to provide such cancer treatment.\n\n\n== Campus ==\nThe buildings and locations where the university has activities or which are significantly connected to its history are listed below. Some of the historic buildings in central Uppsala have had to be retired, as their protected status has made it impossible to make modifications necessary to meet requirements to adjust to the needs for students with disabilities.\n\nUniversity Park and Cathedral area\n\nGustavianum\nThe Old Consistory building\nThe University Hall\nThe Ekerman House\nThe Dean's House (or Julinsk\u00f6ld Palace)\nSkytteanum\nThe Oxenstierna House (Juridicum \u2013 Faculty of Law)\nRegnellianum\nCarolina RedivivaWest of Central Uppsala\n\nEnglish Park Campus \u2013 Centre for the Humanities (including the Centre for Language Studies)\nCentre for Evolutionary Biology (EBC) including the Museum of Evolution\nUniversity of Uppsala Botanical Garden\nSegerstedthuset \u2013 administrative building\nBl\u00e5senhus - Centre for pedagogy, didactics, educational studies and psychologyOther locations in wider Central Uppsala\n\nTheatrum Oeconomicum and Gamla Torget (\"The Old Forum\")\nThe Observatory Park with the old observatory\nCentre for Economic Sciences (Ekonomikum)\nThe Linnaeus Garden\nAnders Celsius's former house and observatory\nSouth of central Uppsala\n\nUppsala University Hospital\nThe Rudbeck Laboratory\nUppsala Biomedical Centre (BMC)\nGeo Centre\nInformation Technology Centre (ITC) Pollax\nThe \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m LaboratoryNorth of Central Uppsala\n\nTeacher TrainingOutside of Uppsala\n\nCampus Gotland\n\n\n=== Ekonomikum ===\nEkonomikum is a building that is part of Uppsala University. The building, designed by Swedish modernist architect Peter Celsing, was completed in 1976, and housed departments for languages, humanities, and social sciences.\nSince the early 2000s, Ekonomikum is a multidisciplinary centre specialized in economics and financial studies, information science, and human geography. It has approximately 2,500 students and 500 faculty and staff members, a library, KPH print shop, a restaurant, and several students' associations.\n\n\n== Student life ==\n\n\n=== Nations and student union ===\n\nUp until June 2010 students at Uppsala University were obliged to become members of one of the nations, corporations of students traditionally according to province of origin (not strictly upheld now, for practical reasons). The system of dividing students into nations according to origin can ultimately be traced back to the nations at the medieval University of Paris and other early medieval universities, but the Uppsala nations appear only about 1630\u20131640, most likely under influence of the Landsmannschaften which existed at some of the German universities visited by Swedish students. In Sweden, nations exist only in Uppsala and Lund. The nations were originally seen as subversive organisations promoting less virtuous aspects of student life, but in 1663 the consistory made membership in a nation legal, each nation being placed under the inspectorship of a professor.\nThe current thirteen nations all have a history stretching back to the early-to-mid 17th century, but some of them are the result of mergers of older, smaller nations that took place in the early 19th century to facilitate the financing of building projects.\nThe nations at Uppsala University are:\n\nSince the 1960s there is a fourteenth nation, the Sk\u00e5nelandens nation (referring to the Scanian lands) which has no membership fee and exists as a legal device to get around the compulsory membership for students who prefer not to become affiliated with the traditional nations.\nThe Uppsala Student Union was founded in 1849 as a corporation representing all students except those attending the faculty of Pharmacy, irrespective of nation. The students at the faculty of Pharmacy were also exempt from the compulsory membership in the nations, but most pharmacy-students belonged to one. However they were obliged to take up membership in the Pharmaceutical Association of Uppsala Students, an organisation having the same role as the nations and the student union at the rest of the university.\nThe compulsory membership in a student union was abolished 1 July 2010; however, the unions will still be the representing organisations in the university boards and committees. The status as a student union will be decided upon by the university board for periods of three years at a time. In a decision by the university board February 20, 2013, there will be four student unions at the university during July 2013 \u2013 June 2016: the Uppsala Student Union (for students at the faculties of Art, Social Sciences, Languages, Theology, Law, Educational Sciences and Medicine), the Pharmaceutical Association of Uppsala Students (for students at the Faculty of Pharmacy), the Uppsala Union of Engineering and Science Students (at the Faculty of Science and Technology), and Rindi (the union for students at Campus Gotland).\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe University's Royal Academic Orchestra was founded in 1627. Its main purpose is to play at academic ceremonies, but holds concerts on other occasions as well. Its leader has the title of director musices. The position has been held by composers such as Wilhelm Stenhammar, Hugo Alfv\u00e9n and Lars-Erik Larsson. Affiliated with the University are three choirs, the mixed Uppsala University Choir (Allm\u00e4nna S\u00e5ngen), founded in 1830, the male choir Orphei Dr\u00e4ngar, founded in 1853, and the Academy Chamber Choir of Uppsala, founded in 1957. A number of other choirs and orchestras are affiliated with the nations.\nAn important name in the recent history of the choirs is Eric Ericson, who was conductor of both Orphei Dr\u00e4ngar and the Chamber Choir. In honour of Ericson, the F\u00f6reningsSparbanken endowed the Eric Ericson Chair in Choral Directing, and the Uppsala University Choral Centre was inaugurated in 2000. The centre arranges courses in choral directing.[1]\n\n\n=== Housing crisis ===\nLike many cities there is a shortage of housing in Uppsala, a problem which has existed for many years. Both native Swedes and foreign students are finding it difficult to find accommodation when first enrolling into the university. This problem is however not as bad as it was with several major housing construction projects having been completed after 2010.There has never been a custom in Sweden for the universities to arrange housing for students, in fact universities are not allowed by law to own housing. Students are expected to arrange their own living accommodations on the private market. To make it easier for students to find moderately priced housing, special student rooms and student apartments have been built by the student nations and student unions. However, the student housing is insufficient to accommodate all students. About 40,000 students are eligible to live in the 11,000 available rooms and apartments. Because of the low rent in these apartments and the general lack of housing in Uppsala the student apartments are highly attractive and many try to hold on to the contracts as long as possible even after graduating.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\nOne of the most popular housing accommodations for the students are Flogsta, Kantorsgatan, Studentstaden, Studentv\u00e4gen, Klostergatan, Rackarbergsgatan and many more. \nFlogsta is one of the biggest and most popular housing choice for international students.\n\n\n== Athletics ==\nSports play a very small role in the life of the university, compared to British and especially U.S. universities, but have existed in various forms since the early 17th century. Uppsala University is more noted for its musical and choral traditions. Both have partial roots in the 17th century institution of extracurricular exercises for students from the nobility.\n\n\n=== The exercitiae ===\n\nTo ease the recruitment of students from the nobility, the university started in the 1630s to offer training in a number of exercitiae or \"exercises\" (Swedish: exercitier) deemed necessary for the well-rounded education of a young nobleman: riding, fencing, dance, drawing and modern languages such as French and Italian. The initiative came from Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, who saw the value in a well-educated class of civil servants and the danger to his own class if its members would fall behind in academic education compared to those students who came from the lower estates. An \"exercise yard\", built for the riding and fencing exercises, was demolished in the late 19th century to give place to the new University Hall. The modern languages were made part of the regular academic curriculum in the 19th century. The surviving \"exercises\" include:\n\nFencing \u2013 Arranged in collaboration with Upsala F\u00e4ktning, a private fencing club. Fencing master as of 2005 is Igor Tsikinjov, captain of the Swedish Fencing Federation\nGymnastics and sports \u2013 Located to the Art Nouveau University Gymnastics Hall, colloquially known as Svettis (from the Swedish word for sweat)\nRiding \u2013 Arranged by the equestrian department of the University, which has its own stables. Leaders of the activities are the Academy Stable Master and the Inspector Equitandi\nMusic \u2013 Leader of the musical activities is the director musices, who is the conductor of the Royal Academic Orchestra; the current Director Musices is Professor Stefan Karpe\nDrawing \u2013 The university appoints an established artist as Drawing Master; free weekly croquis and other lessons are offered in the southern tower of Uppsala Castle\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\nBesides the exercitiae, other sports have had a presence in Uppsala student life. The Upsala Sims\u00e4llskap, \"Uppsala Swimming Society\", which is the oldest swimming club in the world, was founded in 1796 by the mathematician J\u00f6ns Svanberg. It had no formal connection to the university, but all its earliest members came from academic life. Svanberg even arranged a mock graduation ceremony, a simpromotion, in parody of the university ceremonies, where those who had graduated from its swimming training were awarded \"degrees\" of master (magister) and bachelor (kandidat). These degrees stuck, and Swedish swimming schools still use these degrees for different levels of swimming skills.\nAn attempt was made in the 1870s to introduce academic rowing after the Oxbridge model. The Stockholm Nation acquired a rowing boat in 1877, soon followed by the Gothenburg Nation, and for a number of years rowing competitions were held between teams from the two nations. Although rowing never got the strong position it has at the English universities, an annual Uppsala-Lund regatta has been arranged since 1992, between rowing teams from Uppsala and Lund University. The race is held on the Fyris River in Uppsala on even years, and on a river in the vicinity of Lund on odd years. Each year there is at least one full eight crew with cox competing, with both men's and women's teams present. With the recent victory for Uppsala in 2005, the score stands 24\u201323 in Uppsala's favor.\n\n\n== Rankings ==\nUppsala University places well in many rankings. For over ten years, it has been ranked among the 80 best universities in the world the Academic Ranking of World Universities.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nUppsala University is associated with 8 Nobel Prize laureates, and numerous royalty, academics and public figures.\nAs the dominant academic institution in Sweden for several centuries, Uppsala University has educated a large proportion of Swedish politicians and civil servants ever since its first period of expansion in the early part of the 17th century. These range from Chancellor of the Realm (rikskansler) Johan Oxenstierna (1611\u20131657) and Lord Chief Justice (riksdrots) Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie (1622\u20131686) to the first Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden, Hjalmar Branting (1860\u20131925). Other alumni are Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld (1905\u20131961), United Nations Secretary General who was (posthumously) awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1961, and the Swedish diplomat Hans Blix (born 1928), who was Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency 1981\u20131997, of the UNMOVIC 2000\u20132003, and previously Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs 1978\u20131979. Hammarskj\u00f6ld and Blix both graduated from the Uppsala Faculty of Law, as did the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh, who was assassinated in 2003.\nMost Swedish clergymen, including most bishops and archbishops, have been educated at the university, including, in more recent times, Nathan S\u00f6derblom (1866\u20131931), Professor of the History of Religions in the Faculty of Theology, later Archbishop of Uppsala, and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1930 for his work as leader of the ecumenical movement.\nThe university became prominent in the sciences in the 18th century with names such as the physician and botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707\u20131778), the father of biological and mineralogical taxonomy, and his numerous important pupils, the physicist and astronomer Anders Celsius (1701\u20131744), inventor of the Celsius scale the predecessor of the Celsius scale, and the chemist Torbern Bergman (1735\u20131784). Another scientist from this era is Emanuel Swedenborg (1688\u20131772), better remembered today as a religious mystic. Several of the elements were discovered by Uppsala scientists during this period or later. J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius, one of the fathers of modern chemistry, received his doctorate in medicine in Uppsala in 1804, but later moved to Stockholm. Uppsala scientists of the 19th century include the physicist Anders Jonas \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m (1814\u20131874). During the 20th century several Nobel laureates in the sciences have been Uppsala alumni or professors at the university.\nMany well-known Swedish writers have studied in Uppsala: Georg Stiernhielm (1598\u20131672) is often called the father of Swedish poetry. The poet and song composer Carl Michael Bellman (1740\u20131795), without doubt the best-loved and best-remembered of Swedish 18th-century poets, matriculated but left the university after less than a year. The writer, historian and composer Erik Gustaf Geijer (1783\u20131847), professor of history, and the poet Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom (1790\u20131855), professor of poetry, were principal figures of early 19th-century Swedish romanticism. The less than happy experiences of the Uppsala student life of novelist and playwright August Strindberg (1849\u20131912), resulted in his Fr\u00e5n Fj\u00e4rdingen och Svartb\u00e4cken (1877), a collection of short stories set in Uppsala (\"From Fj\u00e4rdingen and Svartb\u00e4cken\", the title refers to two districts in Uppsala). Other Uppsala alumni are the poet Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1864\u20131931), who refused the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1918, but received it posthumously in 1931, the novelist and playwright P\u00e4r Lagerkvist (1891\u20131974), Nobel laureate in 1951, and the poet and novelist Karin Boye (1900\u20131941), for whom one branch of the university library has been named. The Communist leader Ture Nerman (1886\u20131969) wrote a novel called Olympen, based on his experience as a student in Uppsala. Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, co-founder of KaZaA and Skype is also a former student at Uppsala University. On 15 August 2008 Zennstr\u00f6m donated 15 million SEK to Uppsala University for climate research. The late Jan Stenbeck, a Nordic media mogul who controlled Modern Times Group, was also an alumnus of Uppsala University.\n\n\n== International cooperation ==\n\nUppsala University has signed student exchange agreements with about 400 universities across all parts of the world. It takes part in the Erasmus programme and the Nordplus programme. It also benefits from its membership of the Coimbra Group of universities.\nIn May 2010 Uppsala joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Dartmouth College (USA), Durham University (UK), Queen's University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of T\u00fcbingen (Germany), and University of Western Australia (Australia).\n\n\n== In fiction and popular culture ==\nAlong with Lund, Uppsala is the historic and traditional centre of Swedish academic life, making it a popular object of reference in Swedish literature, art, and film. Specifically, Uppsala University has appeared notably in M\u00e4n som hatar kvinnor or The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson.\nThe Norwegian pop singer Kirsti Sparboe dedicated one of her biggest successes to Uppsala University, publishing in 1969 the song \"Ein Student aus Uppsala\". The song, originally written in German, lasted 14 weeks in the German charts.\nUppsala University appears as a research centre in the strategy game Empire: Total War.\nUppsala University appears in the novel S. by Doug Dorst and J. J. Abrams. The fictional author V. M. Straka of Ship of Theseus sends Mr. Grahn a confidential letter on Uppsala Universitet letterhead and stamps his signature with \"Straka Uppsala Arkiv\" (included as an insert to the book).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of medieval universities\nList of universities in Sweden\nSwedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala\nJohannelunds Teologiska H\u00f6gskola in Uppsala\nFlogsta \u2013 student residential area in Uppsala\nCategory:Uppsala University alumni\nS*, a collaboration between seven universities and the Karolinska Institutet for training in bioinformatics and genomics\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLindroth, Sten.

          "On a hill above Uppsala one can see the pink castle with round corner turrets on each side and one is tempted to walk up to this edifice, which was constructed in the 18th century. Once up there one will find out that most of the palace interior is not open to the public, since",

          "Took a walk up to the castle on a damp November Saturday to see the view of the town. We could see a moderate amount despite the mist. Told the story of how Gustav Vasa placed the cannons towards the bishop's palace and the cathedral to show who was boss. Fridens hus is now at",
          "It is a stretch to call this a castle.it was built as a fort to offer protection to the city. One can only go inside as part of a tour and these run irregularly in the off season.. It is interesting to wander around and gives s good overview of the city. There are information",
          "Really enjoyed seeing this fantastic castle which faced across from the Cathedral. The castle itself has a art museum inside which is free, and had some great exhibitions on show. The view from here was amazing and I would totally recommend you visiting here. The castle itself",
          "Having walked through the centre of the old town in Uppsala, we made our way firstly to the former seat of royal power above Uppsala. Being fairly accostomed to hills, would suggest that if you don't enjoy uphill walks, it may be worthwhile getting a bus from directly outside",
          "This surprising castle qua archtecture lies on a hill in the center of Uppsala, Sweden. The view over the city is fantastic. In the right wing you find a museum for modern arts. Very nice old building. There is a lift in the museum. Entrance is free!",
          "Frankly it's not at all a beautiful building, and you can't enter the \"castle\" (it's more like a mansion to me) itself. The region around it surely is very nice, but you should just go to the botanical garden across the street. You can see the \"castle\" well enough from there and",
          "Location is really nice. Its on the top of Uppsala. You can view whole of uppsala city from here. Location marked in here is wrong.",
          "We did not purchase the castle tour,however the surrounding area is very pretty. It is good place to walk and may be have a picnic basket.",
          "Can only review the gardens (which are nice) as we did not enter any buildings here. It was a brief stop on a tour of Uppsala. But one thing to note is that a very nice monument to Dag Hammarskjold (second UN sec gen) is to be found on the grounds. You might have to ask.",
          "Another must see landmark in Uppsala is the castle. It is still in use so there are no tours but you can admire it from the outside as well as visit the art museum in one of the castle wings. There is also an excavation museum taking you back to the original fortifications",
          "Put on your walking shoes and hike up to the castle. You get a beautiful view of Uppsala city in one direction and the botanical garden the other way. Inside rikssalen you enjoy the history of the house. There are a crostatas market in December.",
          "Worth to when you visit Uppsala It is situated on the hill on walking distance from the town center. The castle was built by the king Gustav Vasa in the 1550s. It was also the scene of a brutal murder in 1567, when King Erik XIV and his guards killed Nils Sture and his two sons,",

          "I expected more from this castle. It looks very big from the outside, but the art exhibition takes up a lot of space. I wish it was more about the castle and its history. Its nice to have a walk around tho.",
          "Take your time inside, and use your imagination while you study the exhibition. You will get a more meagre impression if you just browse around in a hurry, so prepare to use some time there. But you must have the motivation to that. You may park your car at the courtyard.",

          "Commanding view of the city, the grounds were well maintained. The only open part is an art museum, which we found somewhat lacking as far as art. Also quite the climb to get to the museum area; felt like we had missed a turn of something.",
          "The castle, which doesn't even look like a castle is big and red, that's all that will strike you but it has no other value or attributes. It is a long building with no character . It stands tall on the hill, you can see it from everywhere but i guess only curiosity brings you",

          "The castle itself is not particularly noteworthy. The original fortification burned in a city-wide fire in 1702 and this is more of a palace than anything. Money concerns kept it from being built to the full extent originally envisioned. There are two great things to do at the",
          "The castle has a nice view of the city and the botanical garden, but the castle itself is not a big deal. You can't go inside, since they are still using the building and it's not worth paying to enter in the old part of the castle because there isn't much to see.",
          "Art Museum is here: it houses the university's art collection, which includes an entire portico and part of a wall of a church that used to be attached to this castle, Johan III expanded it, but it was destroyed in a fire in 1702, and here you get to see what was saved ... all",
          "The tour is a touch pricey, but it was quite good. Lots of interesting history and you get to see interesting parts of the castle. The ruins were pricey as well but interesting to see what the very old part of the castle looked like. The art gallery is free, but if you like",
          "The castle is situated a bit outside the city center but no problem to get there with a car or bike. You can walk aroung the building and you will find nice views across Uppsala and the country around. I haven't been inside the castle but it's sgtill worth it.",

          "We spent our time at the castle building visiting the House of Peace.Tthrough numerous exhibits we learned about Sweden's history of international peacemaking and human rights efforts. Special exhibits recognize such well known figures as Dag Hammarskjold as well as lesser known",
          "With the way the garden is designed up here you get a great view of its geometric formation. There are also some informative info boards and the Castle itself is much more interesting up close than from afar. There is parking at the castle entrance.",

          "I would call this castle \ud83c\udff0 a pink castle. I suppose they don\u2019t just change the color every year. There are museum (museums? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) that I couldn\u2019t enter, because it was closed. I think you can just enjoy the surroundings.

          "Nice views, a cozy cafe and a nicely sized art museum with rotating exhibitions. Definitely worth a visit",
          "This high castle dominates Uppsala skyline, and has the highest of the city with great views over the city.",
          "Great ruins with lovely hour-long guided tour. Amazing how much of the original stonework remains from the mid-1500s. Spent 90 minutes here, very enjoyable. Cafe inside is excellent, plenty of rooms to find a seat and each room was a \u2026",

Having said that, the views over the amazing city of Uppsala compensates beautifully and then some. Best thing about the place is to appreciate the BEST of northern cities.",
          "Sight seeing from the top part of the castle is a great pleasure",
          "It's a castle with a hideous colour, but a lot of nice history and architecture. The view is the best in town, and if you're willing to pay there are guided tours up on the roof, so that view should be spectacular. There's also the art's museum, where I've seen baby interesting exhibitions",
          "With mazing views of Uppsala and its Botanical Garden, the Uppsala Slott (Castle) retains much of its 1675 charm, despite the heavy fire of 1702 and long reconstruction. The courtyard features ramparts, slim guns, and a bust of King Gustav. \u2026",

        "wiki": "Uppsala University (Swedish: Uppsala universitet) is a research university in Uppsala, Sweden. Founded in 1477, it is the oldest university in Sweden and all of the Nordic countries still in operation. It ranks among the world's 100 best universities in several high-profile international rankings. The university uses \"Gratiae veritas naturae\" as its motto and embraces natural sciences.\nThe university rose to pronounced significance during the rise of Sweden as a great power at the end of the 16th century and was then given a relative financial stability with the large donation of King Gustavus Adolphus in the early 17th century. Uppsala also has an important historical place in Swedish national culture, identity and for the Swedish establishment: in historiography, literature, politics, and music. Many aspects of Swedish academic culture in general, such as the white student cap, originated in Uppsala. It shares some peculiarities, such as the student nation system, with Lund University and the University of Helsinki.\nUppsala belongs to the Coimbra Group of European universities and to the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities. The university has nine faculties distributed over three \"disciplinary domains\". It has about 44,000 registered students and 2,300 doctoral students. It has a teaching staff of roughly 1,800 (part-time and full-time) out of a total of 6,900 employees. Twenty-eight per cent of the 716 professors at the university are women. Of its turnover of SEK 6.6 billion (approx. USD 775 million) in 2016, 29% was spent on education at Bachelor's and Master's level, while 70% was spent on research and research programs.Architecturally, Uppsala University has traditionally had a strong presence in Fj\u00e4rdingen, the neighbourhood around the cathedral on the western side of the River Fyris. Despite some more contemporary building developments further away from the centre, Uppsala's historic centre continues to be dominated by the presence of the university.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 15th century: origins ===\nAs with most medieval universities, Uppsala University initially grew out of an ecclesiastical center. The archbishopric of Uppsala had been one of the most important sees in Sweden proper since Christianity first spread to this region in the ninth century. Uppsala had also long been a hub for regional trade, and had contained settlements dating back into the deep Middle Ages. As was also the case with most medieval universities, Uppsala had initially been chartered through a papal bull. Uppsala's bull, which granted the university its corporate rights, was issued by Pope Sixtus IV in 1477, and established a number of provisions. Among the most important of these was that the university was officially given the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna. This included the right to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor's, master's, licentiate, and doctoral degrees. The archbishop of Uppsala was also named as the university's Chancellor, and was charged with maintaining the rights and privileges of the university and its members.\n\n\n=== 16th century: Turbulent times ===\n\nThe turbulent period of the reformation of King Gustavus Vasa resulted in a drop in the already relatively insignificant number of students in Uppsala, which was seen as a center of Catholicism and of potential disloyalty to the Crown. Swedish students generally travelled to one of the Protestant universities in Germany, especially Wittenberg. There is some evidence of academic studies in Uppsala during the 16th century; the Faculty of Theology is mentioned in a document from 1526, King Eric XIV appointed Laurentius Petri Gothus (later archbishop) rector of the university in 1566, and his successor and brother John III appointed a number of professors in the period 1569\u20131574. At the end of the century the situation had changed, and Uppsala became a bastion of Lutheranism, which Duke Charles, the third of the sons of Gustavus Vasa to eventually become king (as Charles IX) used to consolidate his power and eventually oust his nephew Sigismund from the throne. The Meeting of Uppsala in 1593 established Lutheran orthodoxy in Sweden, and Charles and the Council of state gave new privileges to the university on 1 August of the same year.\nTheology still had precedence, but in the privileges of 1593, the importance of a university to educate secular servants of the state was also emphasized. Three of the seven professorial chairs which were established were in Theology; of the other four, three were in Astronomy, Physics (or general natural sciences) and Latin eloquence. A fourth chair was given to Ericus Jacobi Skinnerus, who was also appointed rector, but whose discipline was not mentioned in the charter. Of the professors, several were taken over from the Collegium Regium in Stockholm, which had been functioning for a few years but closed in 1593. An eighth chair, in Medicine, was established in 1595 but received no appointee for several years. In 1599 the number of students was approximately 150. In 1600 the first post-reformation conferment of degrees took place. In the same year, the antiquarian and mystic Johannes Bureus designed and engraved the seal of the university, which is today used as part of the logotype.\n\n\n=== 17th century: Expansion ===\nThe medieval university had mainly been a school for theology. The aspirations of the emergent new great power of Sweden demanded a different kind of learning. Sweden both grew through conquests and went through a complete overhaul of its administrative structure. It required a much larger class of civil servants and educators than before. Preparatory schools, gymnasiums, were also founded during this period in various cathedral towns, notably V\u00e4ster\u00e5s (the first one) in 1623. Beside Uppsala, new universities were founded in more distant parts of the Swedish Realm, the University of Dorpat (present-day Tartu) in Estonia (1632) and the University of \u00c5bo in Finland (1640). After the Scanian provinces were taken from Denmark, Lund University was founded in 1666.\nInstrumental in the reforms of the early 17th-century Swedish state was the long-dominant Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, who had spent his own student days in German universities and who for the last years before his death was also chancellor of the university. King Gustavus Adolphus showed the university a keen interest and increased the professorial chairs from eight to thirteen in 1620, and again to seventeen in 1621. In 1624 the king donated \"for all eternity\" all his own inherited personal property in the provinces of Uppland and V\u00e4stmanland, some 300 farms, mills and other sources of income. The king's former private tutor, Johan Skytte, who was made chancellor of the university in 1622, donated the Skyttean chair in Eloquence and Government which still exists. The university received a stable structure with its constitution of 1626. The head of the university was to be the chancellor, his deputy was the \"pro-chancellor\" (always the archbishop ex officio). The immediate rule was the responsibility of the consistory, to which belonged all the professors of the university, and the rector magnificus, who was elected for a semester at the time; the latter position circulated among the professors, each of whom sometimes held it several times.\nDuring the late 16th and early 17th centuries (and perhaps even earlier), the university was located to the old chapter house parallel to the south side of the cathedral, later renamed the Academia Carolina. In 1622\u20131625 a new university building was built east of the cathedral, the so-called Gustavianum, named after the reigning king. In the 1630s, the total number of students were about one thousand.\n\nQueen Christina was generous to the university, gave scholarships to Swedish students to study abroad and recruited foreign scholars to Uppsala chairs, among them several from the University of Strassburg, notably the philologist Johannes Schefferus (professor skytteanus), whose little library and museum building at S:t Eriks torg now belongs to the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala. The Queen, who would eventually declare her abdication in the great hall of Uppsala Castle, visited the university on many occasions; in 1652 she was present at an anatomical demonstration arranged at the castle for the young physician Olaus Rudbeck. Rudbeck, one of several sons of Johannes Rudbeckius, a former Uppsala professor who became Bishop of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, was sent for a year to the progressive University of Leiden in the Netherlands. Returning in 1654, he received an assistantship in Medicine in 1655, and had already gone to work on a program of improving aspects of the university. He planted the first botanical garden, the one which would eventually be tended by Carl Linnaeus and is kept today as a museum of 18th century botany under the name Linnaeus' Garden. With the patronage of the university chancellor Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, Rudbeck was made full professor in 1660, was elected rector for two terms, despite his youth, and started a revision of the work of the other professors and a building spree with himself as architect. His most significant remaining architectural work is the anatomical theatre, which was added to Gustavianum in the 1660s and crowned with the characteristic cupola for which the building is today known.\nA gifted scientist, architect and engineer, Rudbeck was the dominant personality of the university in the late 17th century who laid some of the groundwork for Linnaeus and others, but he is perhaps more known today for the pseudohistorical speculations of his Atlantica, which consumed much of his later life. When large parts of Uppsala burned down in 1702, Gustavianum, which contained the university library and its many valuable manuscripts, escaped the fire; local lore has it that the aging Rudbeck stood on the roof directing the work of fighting the fire.\n\n\n=== 18th century: Enlightenment and mercantilism ===\nThe early part of the 18th century was still characterized by the combination of Lutheran orthodoxy and classical philology of the previous century, but eventually a larger emphasis on sciences and practically useful knowledge developed. The innovative mathematician and physicist Samuel Klingenstierna (1698\u20131765) was made a professor in 1728, the physicist and astronomer Anders Celsius in 1729, and Carl Linnaeus was made professor of Medicine with Botany in 1741. The university was not immune to the parliamentary struggle between the parties known as the \"Hats\" and the \"Caps\", with the former having a preference for hard sciences and practical knowledge. The Hat government then in power established a chair in economics (\u0152conomia publica) in 1741 and called Anders Berch as its first incumbent. This was the first professorship in economics outside Germany, and possibly the third in Europe (the first chairs having been established in Halle and Frankfurt (Oder) in 1727). In 1759, following a donation, another chair in economy was established, the Borgstr\u00f6mian professorship in \"practical economy\", by which was meant the practical application of the natural sciences for economic purposes (it eventually developed into a chair for physiological botany).\nThere were very radical attempts at reforms which were never implemented, but important changes took place. University studies had until this time been very informal in their overall organization, with the all-purpose philosophi\u00e6 magister-degree being the only one frequently conferred and many never graduating, as there were no degree applicable to their intended area of work (and well-connected aristocratic students often not graduating as they did not need to). A few professional degrees for various purposes were introduced in 1749\u20131750, but the radical suggestion of binding students to a single program of study adapted to a particular profession was never implemented. The reforms of this era have been compared to those of the 1960s and 1970s (Sten Lindroth).\nAlthough it took some time after the fire of 1702, Uppsala Cathedral and Uppsala Castle were both eventually restored, both by Carl H\u00e5rleman, perhaps the most important Swedish architect of the era. He also modified Gustavianum, designed a new conservatory for Linnaeus' botanical garden and built the new Consistory house, which was to be the administrative core of the university.\nAnother magnificent royal donation was that of the large baroque garden of the castle, given by Gustavus III to the university when it was obvious that the old botanical garden was insufficient. A large new conservatory was built by the architect Louis Jean Desprez. Additional grounds adjacent to the baroque garden has since been added. The old garden of Rudbeck and Linnaeus was largely left to decay, but was reconstructed in the years between 1918 and 1923 according to the specifications of Linnaeus in his work Hortus Upsaliensis from 1745.\n\n\n=== Women at the university ===\nThe issue of women's right to study at universities was raised during the very last session of the estate parliament in 1865 in a motion from Carl Johan Svens\u00e9n, a member of the farmers' estate. The reception was mixed, with the most negative views coming from the clergy. In the following years the issue continued to be debated at the universities. In 1870, it was decided to let women take the secondary school examination (\"studentexamen\") that gave the right to entry at universities and the right to study and complete degrees at the faculties of Medicine in Uppsala and Lund and at the Caroline Institute of Medicine and Surgery in Stockholm. A common view was that the female sensitivity and compassion would make women capable of working as physicians, but their right to work was still restricted to private practice. Women's rights to higher education was extended in 1873, when all degrees except those in the faculties of theology and the licentiate degree in Law were made accessible for women.\nThe first female student in Sweden was Betty Pettersson (1838\u20131885), who had already worked as a private tutor for several years when she took \"studentexamen\" in 1871. With a royal dispensation, she was allowed to enter university in Uppsala in 1872, the year before studies at the Philosophical faculty would actually be made generally available to women. She studied modern European languages and was the first woman in Sweden to complete an academic degree when she finished a fil. kand. in 1875. She became the first woman to be employed as a teacher in a public school for boys. The first woman in Sweden to complete a doctoral degree was Ellen Fries (1855\u20131900), who entered Uppsala university in 1877 and became a PhD in history in 1883. Other female students of this period includes Lydia Wahlstr\u00f6m (1869\u20131954) who later became a noted educator, activist and writer on women's emancipation and suffrage. Defending a dissertation in history in 1900, she became the second woman to finish a doctorate at a Swedish university. In 1892, she founded the Uppsala Women's Student Association, who set up spex performances and other things enjoyed by male students but from which the women were excluded at the time. The members of the Association were the first woman to wear the student caps in public, an important sign of their status. Elsa Eschelsson (1861\u20131911) was the first Swedish woman to finish a law degree, and the first to become a \"docent\", but was not permitted to even hold the position of acting professor despite being formally qualified for this in everything but her sex. After years of conflicts with the professor of civil law A. O. Winroth, who wrote the paper on \"Om tjenstehjonsf\u00f6rh\u00e5llandet\" and with the university board, she died in 1911 from an overdose of sleeping-powder.\nAccording to the constitution of 1809, only \"native Swedish men\" could be appointed to higher civil servant positions, including professorships. This was changed in 1925, and the first woman to hold a professorial chair at Uppsala University was Gerd Enequist, appointed professor of human geography in 1949.\nHildegard Bj\u00f6rck who studied in the university became the first Swedish woman to receive an academic degree.\n\n\n== Administration and organisation ==\n\n\n=== Central administration ===\nThe governing board of the university is the consistory, with representatives of the faculties as well as members representing the students and non-academic employees (three professors and three students), and ten university outsiders appointed by the Swedish government. All these members in the consistory have the right to vote.\nThe unions active at the university also have three representatives in the consistory; these members have the right to speak but not any right to vote.\nSince the last reorganization in 1999 the university has a separate body called the academic senate, which is a wider, but mostly advisory group representing teaching staff / researchers and students. The executive head of the university is the rector magnificus, whose deputy is the prorector. There are (also since 1999) three vice rectors, each heading one of the three \"disciplinary domains\" (Arts and Social Sciences, Medicine and Pharmacy, and Science and Technology) into which the nine faculties are divided. Each faculty has a faculty board and is headed by a dean (dekanus). The position of dean is held part-time by a professor of the faculty.\n\n\n=== Faculties ===\nThrough division of faculties and the addition of a previously independent school of Pharmacy as a new faculty, the traditional four-faculty organization of European universities has evolved into the present nine faculties:\n\nThe disciplinary domain of Arts and Social Sciences includes the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Social Sciences, the Faculty of Languages, the Faculty of Theology, the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Educational Sciences (formerly the Department of Education, that was raised to the status of a faculty in its own right in 2002).\nThe disciplinary domain of Medicine and Pharmacy includes the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Pharmacy. The Faculty of Pharmacy was originally an independent \"royal institute\" in Stockholm, which was moved to Uppsala and incorporated with the university between 1968 and 1972.\nThe disciplinary domain of Science and Technology includes only the Faculty of Science and Technology. The engineering programs have from 1982 been marketed as the Uppsala School of Engineering (Uppsala Tekniska H\u00f6gskola). This has however never been a separate institution, but only a unit within the Faculty of Science and Technology and use of the term has been phased out after the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was renamed the Faculty of Sciences and Technology in the 1990s.Uppsala University also hosts the Forum for South Asia Studies, a collaborative academic effort by its six faculties: Theology, Law, History and Philosophy, Social Sciences, Languages, and Educational Sciences. The Forum aims facilitate and promote research and education related to the South Asian countries: India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, the Maldives and Afghanistan, on the national and international level, with Ferdinando Sardella, Faculty of Theology, serving as the Forum's director.\n\n\n=== Faculty of Law ===\nThe Faculty of Law (Juridiska fakulteten) is the oldest one in the Nordic countries and existed before 1477 (when the University of Uppsala was founded).\nThe activities of the faculty include a wide range of research areas and specializations. This Faculty has one department: the Department of Law.\n\n\n=== University Library ===\n\nThe university library holds about 5.25 million volumes of books and periodicals (131,293 shelf meters), 61,959 manuscripts, 7,133 music prints, and 345,734 maps and other graphic documents. The holdings of the collection of manuscripts and music includes, among other things, the Gothic Bible manuscript Codex Argenteus.\n\nThe most widely recognized building of the university library is Carolina Rediviva, the \"revived Carolina\", thus named in reference to Academia Carolina (see illustration), which held the university library from the earliest times until 1691, when it was moved to the upper floor of Gustavianum, where it miraculously survived the great city fire of 1702. In the mid-18th century, there were plans to move it back to the Academia Carolina or a new building on the same spot. The building was demolished in 1778 to make place for a new library, but this was never built and the area next to the cathedral where it stood is today a lawn. The present Carolina Rediviva was built in a different place and completed in 1841.\nThe present university library system comprises 19 branches, including the one in the Carolina building.\n\n\n=== Uppsala University Hospital ===\n\nThe Uppsala Academic Hospital or Akademiska sjukhuset, which functions as a teaching hospital for the Faculty of Medicine and the Nursing School, is run by the Uppsala County Council in cooperation with the university. As of 2003, the hospital had 7,719 employees and as of 2004 1,079 places for patients.\nThe university hospital is actually older than the university, as it goes back to the earliest hospital, founded in Uppsala in 1302, much later merged with the university clinic. This was used for 400 years until the great fire of 1702 which destroyed large parts of central Uppsala. A new hospital, which later became the Uppsala county hospital, was built in its place, but was moved out of the town in 1811.\n\nThe first clinic with the specific intention to facilitate the practical education of medical students was the Nosocomium Academicum, founded in 1708 and located to the Oxenstierna Palace at Riddartorget beside the cathedral (see illustration above). The building (the former residence of the President of the Royal Chancellery Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna) today houses the Faculty of Law.\nThe present Akademiska sjukhuset was founded in 1850 as an organizational merger of the county hospital and the university clinic, and a new building was inaugurated in 1867 on the hill below Uppsala Castle to the southeast. From this building, which is still in use, the present hospital complex has grown.\n\n\n=== The Svedberg Laboratory ===\nThe Svedberg Laboratory (named after Theodore The Svedberg) is a university facility that contains the Gustaf Werner cyclotron, which is used for research as well as for proton therapy for the treatment of cancer with close cooperation with the oncology clinic at Uppsala University Hospital. Such an accelerator and its gantries costs between $60 million and $100 million, and makes Uppsala University Hospital one of the approximately 40 centers in the world to provide such cancer treatment.\n\n\n== Campus ==\nThe buildings and locations where the university has activities or which are significantly connected to its history are listed below. Some of the historic buildings in central Uppsala have had to be retired, as their protected status has made it impossible to make modifications necessary to meet requirements to adjust to the needs for students with disabilities.\n\nUniversity Park and Cathedral area\n\nGustavianum\nThe Old Consistory building\nThe University Hall\nThe Ekerman House\nThe Dean's House (or Julinsk\u00f6ld Palace)\nSkytteanum\nThe Oxenstierna House (Juridicum \u2013 Faculty of Law)\nRegnellianum\nCarolina RedivivaWest of Central Uppsala\n\nEnglish Park Campus \u2013 Centre for the Humanities (including the Centre for Language Studies)\nCentre for Evolutionary Biology (EBC) including the Museum of Evolution\nUniversity of Uppsala Botanical Garden\nSegerstedthuset \u2013 administrative building\nBl\u00e5senhus - Centre for pedagogy, didactics, educational studies and psychologyOther locations in wider Central Uppsala\n\nTheatrum Oeconomicum and Gamla Torget (\"The Old Forum\")\nThe Observatory Park with the old observatory\nCentre for Economic Sciences (Ekonomikum)\nThe Linnaeus Garden\nAnders Celsius's former house and observatory\nSouth of central Uppsala\n\nUppsala University Hospital\nThe Rudbeck Laboratory\nUppsala Biomedical Centre (BMC)\nGeo Centre\nInformation Technology Centre (ITC) Pollax\nThe \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m LaboratoryNorth of Central Uppsala\n\nTeacher TrainingOutside of Uppsala\n\nCampus Gotland\n\n\n=== Ekonomikum ===\nEkonomikum is a building that is part of Uppsala University. The building, designed by Swedish modernist architect Peter Celsing, was completed in 1976, and housed departments for languages, humanities, and social sciences.\nSince the early 2000s, Ekonomikum is a multidisciplinary centre specialized in economics and financial studies, information science, and human geography. It has approximately 2,500 students and 500 faculty and staff members, a library, KPH print shop, a restaurant, and several students' associations.\n\n\n== Student life ==\n\n\n=== Nations and student union ===\n\nUp until June 2010 students at Uppsala University were obliged to become members of one of the nations, corporations of students traditionally according to province of origin (not strictly upheld now, for practical reasons). The system of dividing students into nations according to origin can ultimately be traced back to the nations at the medieval University of Paris and other early medieval universities, but the Uppsala nations appear only about 1630\u20131640, most likely under influence of the Landsmannschaften which existed at some of the German universities visited by Swedish students. In Sweden, nations exist only in Uppsala and Lund. The nations were originally seen as subversive organisations promoting less virtuous aspects of student life, but in 1663 the consistory made membership in a nation legal, each nation being placed under the inspectorship of a professor.\nThe current thirteen nations all have a history stretching back to the early-to-mid 17th century, but some of them are the result of mergers of older, smaller nations that took place in the early 19th century to facilitate the financing of building projects.\nThe nations at Uppsala University are:\n\nSince the 1960s there is a fourteenth nation, the Sk\u00e5nelandens nation (referring to the Scanian lands) which has no membership fee and exists as a legal device to get around the compulsory membership for students who prefer not to become affiliated with the traditional nations.\nThe Uppsala Student Union was founded in 1849 as a corporation representing all students except those attending the faculty of Pharmacy, irrespective of nation. The students at the faculty of Pharmacy were also exempt from the compulsory membership in the nations, but most pharmacy-students belonged to one. However they were obliged to take up membership in the Pharmaceutical Association of Uppsala Students, an organisation having the same role as the nations and the student union at the rest of the university.\nThe compulsory membership in a student union was abolished 1 July 2010; however, the unions will still be the representing organisations in the university boards and committees. The status as a student union will be decided upon by the university board for periods of three years at a time. In a decision by the university board February 20, 2013, there will be four student unions at the university during July 2013 \u2013 June 2016: the Uppsala Student Union (for students at the faculties of Art, Social Sciences, Languages, Theology, Law, Educational Sciences and Medicine), the Pharmaceutical Association of Uppsala Students (for students at the Faculty of Pharmacy), the Uppsala Union of Engineering and Science Students (at the Faculty of Science and Technology), and Rindi (the union for students at Campus Gotland).\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe University's Royal Academic Orchestra was founded in 1627. Its main purpose is to play at academic ceremonies, but holds concerts on other occasions as well. Its leader has the title of director musices. The position has been held by composers such as Wilhelm Stenhammar, Hugo Alfv\u00e9n and Lars-Erik Larsson. Affiliated with the University are three choirs, the mixed Uppsala University Choir (Allm\u00e4nna S\u00e5ngen), founded in 1830, the male choir Orphei Dr\u00e4ngar, founded in 1853, and the Academy Chamber Choir of Uppsala, founded in 1957. A number of other choirs and orchestras are affiliated with the nations.\nAn important name in the recent history of the choirs is Eric Ericson, who was conductor of both Orphei Dr\u00e4ngar and the Chamber Choir. In honour of Ericson, the F\u00f6reningsSparbanken endowed the Eric Ericson Chair in Choral Directing, and the Uppsala University Choral Centre was inaugurated in 2000. The centre arranges courses in choral directing.[1]\n\n\n=== Housing crisis ===\nLike many cities there is a shortage of housing in Uppsala, a problem which has existed for many years. Both native Swedes and foreign students are finding it difficult to find accommodation when first enrolling into the university. This problem is however not as bad as it was with several major housing construction projects having been completed after 2010.There has never been a custom in Sweden for the universities to arrange housing for students, in fact universities are not allowed by law to own housing. Students are expected to arrange their own living accommodations on the private market. To make it easier for students to find moderately priced housing, special student rooms and student apartments have been built by the student nations and student unions. However, the student housing is insufficient to accommodate all students. About 40,000 students are eligible to live in the 11,000 available rooms and apartments. Because of the low rent in these apartments and the general lack of housing in Uppsala the student apartments are highly attractive and many try to hold on to the contracts as long as possible even after graduating.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\nOne of the most popular housing accommodations for the students are Flogsta, Kantorsgatan, Studentstaden, Studentv\u00e4gen, Klostergatan, Rackarbergsgatan and many more. \nFlogsta is one of the biggest and most popular housing choice for international students.\n\n\n== Athletics ==\nSports play a very small role in the life of the university, compared to British and especially U.S. universities, but have existed in various forms since the early 17th century. Uppsala University is more noted for its musical and choral traditions. Both have partial roots in the 17th century institution of extracurricular exercises for students from the nobility.\n\n\n=== The exercitiae ===\n\nTo ease the recruitment of students from the nobility, the university started in the 1630s to offer training in a number of exercitiae or \"exercises\" (Swedish: exercitier) deemed necessary for the well-rounded education of a young nobleman: riding, fencing, dance, drawing and modern languages such as French and Italian. The initiative came from Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, who saw the value in a well-educated class of civil servants and the danger to his own class if its members would fall behind in academic education compared to those students who came from the lower estates. An \"exercise yard\", built for the riding and fencing exercises, was demolished in the late 19th century to give place to the new University Hall. The modern languages were made part of the regular academic curriculum in the 19th century. The surviving \"exercises\" include:\n\nFencing \u2013 Arranged in collaboration with Upsala F\u00e4ktning, a private fencing club. Fencing master as of 2005 is Igor Tsikinjov, captain of the Swedish Fencing Federation\nGymnastics and sports \u2013 Located to the Art Nouveau University Gymnastics Hall, colloquially known as Svettis (from the Swedish word for sweat)\nRiding \u2013 Arranged by the equestrian department of the University, which has its own stables. Leaders of the activities are the Academy Stable Master and the Inspector Equitandi\nMusic \u2013 Leader of the musical activities is the director musices, who is the conductor of the Royal Academic Orchestra; the current Director Musices is Professor Stefan Karpe\nDrawing \u2013 The university appoints an established artist as Drawing Master; free weekly croquis and other lessons are offered in the southern tower of Uppsala Castle\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\nBesides the exercitiae, other sports have had a presence in Uppsala student life. The Upsala Sims\u00e4llskap, \"Uppsala Swimming Society\", which is the oldest swimming club in the world, was founded in 1796 by the mathematician J\u00f6ns Svanberg. It had no formal connection to the university, but all its earliest members came from academic life. Svanberg even arranged a mock graduation ceremony, a simpromotion, in parody of the university ceremonies, where those who had graduated from its swimming training were awarded \"degrees\" of master (magister) and bachelor (kandidat). These degrees stuck, and Swedish swimming schools still use these degrees for different levels of swimming skills.\nAn attempt was made in the 1870s to introduce academic rowing after the Oxbridge model. The Stockholm Nation acquired a rowing boat in 1877, soon followed by the Gothenburg Nation, and for a number of years rowing competitions were held between teams from the two nations. Although rowing never got the strong position it has at the English universities, an annual Uppsala-Lund regatta has been arranged since 1992, between rowing teams from Uppsala and Lund University. The race is held on the Fyris River in Uppsala on even years, and on a river in the vicinity of Lund on odd years. Each year there is at least one full eight crew with cox competing, with both men's and women's teams present. With the recent victory for Uppsala in 2005, the score stands 24\u201323 in Uppsala's favor.\n\n\n== Rankings ==\nUppsala University places well in many rankings. For over ten years, it has been ranked among the 80 best universities in the world the Academic Ranking of World Universities.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nUppsala University is associated with 8 Nobel Prize laureates, and numerous royalty, academics and public figures.\nAs the dominant academic institution in Sweden for several centuries, Uppsala University has educated a large proportion of Swedish politicians and civil servants ever since its first period of expansion in the early part of the 17th century. These range from Chancellor of the Realm (rikskansler) Johan Oxenstierna (1611\u20131657) and Lord Chief Justice (riksdrots) Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie (1622\u20131686) to the first Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden, Hjalmar Branting (1860\u20131925). Other alumni are Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld (1905\u20131961), United Nations Secretary General who was (posthumously) awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1961, and the Swedish diplomat Hans Blix (born 1928), who was Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency 1981\u20131997, of the UNMOVIC 2000\u20132003, and previously Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs 1978\u20131979. Hammarskj\u00f6ld and Blix both graduated from the Uppsala Faculty of Law, as did the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh, who was assassinated in 2003.\nMost Swedish clergymen, including most bishops and archbishops, have been educated at the university, including, in more recent times, Nathan S\u00f6derblom (1866\u20131931), Professor of the History of Religions in the Faculty of Theology, later Archbishop of Uppsala, and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1930 for his work as leader of the ecumenical movement.\nThe university became prominent in the sciences in the 18th century with names such as the physician and botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707\u20131778), the father of biological and mineralogical taxonomy, and his numerous important pupils, the physicist and astronomer Anders Celsius (1701\u20131744), inventor of the Celsius scale the predecessor of the Celsius scale, and the chemist Torbern Bergman (1735\u20131784). Another scientist from this era is Emanuel Swedenborg (1688\u20131772), better remembered today as a religious mystic. Several of the elements were discovered by Uppsala scientists during this period or later. J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius, one of the fathers of modern chemistry, received his doctorate in medicine in Uppsala in 1804, but later moved to Stockholm. Uppsala scientists of the 19th century include the physicist Anders Jonas \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m (1814\u20131874). During the 20th century several Nobel laureates in the sciences have been Uppsala alumni or professors at the university.\nMany well-known Swedish writers have studied in Uppsala: Georg Stiernhielm (1598\u20131672) is often called the father of Swedish poetry. The poet and song composer Carl Michael Bellman (1740\u20131795), without doubt the best-loved and best-remembered of Swedish 18th-century poets, matriculated but left the university after less than a year. The writer, historian and composer Erik Gustaf Geijer (1783\u20131847), professor of history, and the poet Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom (1790\u20131855), professor of poetry, were principal figures of early 19th-century Swedish romanticism. The less than happy experiences of the Uppsala student life of novelist and playwright August Strindberg (1849\u20131912), resulted in his Fr\u00e5n Fj\u00e4rdingen och Svartb\u00e4cken (1877), a collection of short stories set in Uppsala (\"From Fj\u00e4rdingen and Svartb\u00e4cken\", the title refers to two districts in Uppsala). Other Uppsala alumni are the poet Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1864\u20131931), who refused the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1918, but received it posthumously in 1931, the novelist and playwright P\u00e4r Lagerkvist (1891\u20131974), Nobel laureate in 1951, and the poet and novelist Karin Boye (1900\u20131941), for whom one branch of the university library has been named. The Communist leader Ture Nerman (1886\u20131969) wrote a novel called Olympen, based on his experience as a student in Uppsala. Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, co-founder of KaZaA and Skype is also a former student at Uppsala University. On 15 August 2008 Zennstr\u00f6m donated 15 million SEK to Uppsala University for climate research.

        "wiki": "The University of Uppsala Botanical Garden (in Swedish Botaniska tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden), near Uppsala Castle, is the principal botanical garden belonging to Uppsala University. It was created on land donated to the university in 1787 by Sweden's King Gustav III, who also laid the cornerstone of Linneanum, its orangery.\nUppsala University also maintains two satellite botanical gardens. The older of these is its original botanical garden, created in 1655 by Olaus Rudbeck, now called the Linnaean Garden (in Swedish Linn\u00e9tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden). The other satellite is Linnaeus Hammarby (Linn\u00e9s Hammarby), the former summer home of  Carl Linnaeus and his family.\n\n\n== The first botanical garden in Uppsala ==\n\nEarly botanical gardens focused on educating and supplying physicians, as had the medicinal gardens of medieval monasteries. Medical training remained the primary purpose of university botanical gardens throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.In 1655, Uppsala University's Olaus Rudbeck the elder created the university's first botanical garden on Svartb\u00e4cksgatan in Uppsala. By the end of the 17th century, the garden contained about 1,800 different species. Unfortunately, the Uppsala city fire in 1702 seriously damaged Rudbeck's garden. Because there was no money for needed repairs, the garden languished for nearly 40 years until, in 1741, Rudbeck's student Carolus Linnaeus took over. Linnaeus improved and rearranged it according to his own ideas, documenting his work in Hortus Upsaliensis (1748).Although the main botanical garden of the University of Uppsala has been moved to the Botaniska tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden, the historic Linn\u00e9tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden remains under the care of the university, which maintains it as Linnaeus had organized it in 1745.\n\n\n== Gift of land from King Gustav III ==\n\nAfter the death of Linnaeus in 1778, his disciple and successor Carl Peter Thunberg became dissatisfied with the Linnaean Garden. Its location, near the river Fyris, kept the soil  too wet for many species of plants. Thunberg approached King Gustav III, whose castle in Uppsala stood upon much higher ground, to request the use of the castle's large formal garden for Uppsala University's botanical plantings.Uppsala castle's large formal garden had been laid out in baroque style in 1744, based on a plan by Carl H\u00e5rleman.  The king agreed to give not only this land but also an additional area south of Norbyv\u00e4gen, and to pay for the university's costs in transforming it to its new mission.King Gustav III signed the official grant on August 17, 1787. That day also, in a ceremony marked by the firing of 128 cannons, the king himself laid a foundation stone for the conservatory (Swedish Orangeriet), which had inside it a full set of Swedish coins as well as medals showing the King, Crown Prince, and Linnaeus.After the death of Gustav III in 1792, work on the garden and its conservatory became difficult due to lack of money for the garden. The conservatory was finally officially opened on May 25, 1807, honoring the centennial of the birth of Linnaeus.\n\n\n== The making of the modern Botaniska Tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden ==\n\nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century, botanical gardens had expanded from their medicinal origins. They were increasingly seen as research centers and as museums showing the diversity of life. Linnaeus had displayed many animals from his own menagerie in the Linn\u00e9tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden, including a tame raccoon and six monkeys who lived in small huts set on poles.  In 1802, King Gustav IV Adolf gave to the Botaniska Tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden many biological curiosities collected by his grandmother Lovisa Ulrika, who had been an important patron of Linnaeus.A living lion named Leo also arrived from the king in 1802. It was housed in the Orangeriet, but did not thrive, not even when offered (according to the best scientific advice of the day) live chickens. It died from unknown causes in 1803. The University of Uppsala continued to display its zoological collections in the Orangeriet until 1856, when it moved them to its Gustavianum.As the nineteenth century progressed, botanical gardens were increasingly seen as potential public spaces whose openness would offer civic benefits. Although Botaniska Tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden remains a center for university teaching and research, its goals have expanded to include public education and recreation. In return, at least since 1897 it has received substantial support from governmental sources. In 1935, the garden and orangery building were designated national monuments.As of 2011, the University of Uppsala opens to public visits all three of its botanical gardens, including the Botaniska Tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden, whose extensive grounds, orangery (now housing a museum called the Linnaeanum), tropical greenhouses (built in the 1930s), and baroque garden (restored in the 1970s to the original design by H\u00e5rleman) attract more than 100,000 visitors every year.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUppsala University's official site for its three botanical gardens\nOfficial listing at BCGI (Botanic Gardens Conservation International)",

        "wiki": "Carl Linnaeus (; 23 May 1707 \u2013 10 January 1778), also known after his ennoblement as Carl von Linn\u00e9 (Swedish pronunciation: [\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0\u026d f\u0254n l\u026a\u02c8ne\u02d0] (listen)), was a Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician who formalised binomial nomenclature, the modern system of naming organisms. He is known as the \"father of modern taxonomy\". Many of his writings were in Latin, and his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us (after 1761 Carolus a Linn\u00e9).\nLinnaeus was born in the countryside of Sm\u00e5land in southern Sweden. He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. In the 1750s and 1760s, he continued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, while publishing several volumes. He was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe at the time of his death.\nPhilosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message: \"Tell him I know no greater man on earth.\" Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote: \"With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza, I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly.\" Swedish author August Strindberg wrote: \"Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist.\" Linnaeus has been called Princeps botanicorum (Prince of Botanists) and \"The Pliny of the North\". He is also considered as one of the founders of modern ecology.In botany and zoology, the abbreviation L. is used to indicate Linnaeus as the authority for a species' name. In older publications, the abbreviation \"Linn.\" is found. Linnaeus's remains comprise the type specimen for the species Homo sapiens following the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, since the sole specimen that he is known to have examined was himself.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Childhood ===\n\nLinnaeus was born in the village of R\u00e5shult in Sm\u00e5land, Sweden, on 23 May 1707. He was the first child of Nicolaus (Nils) Ingemarsson (who later adopted the family name Linnaeus) and Christina Brodersonia. His siblings were Anna Maria Linn\u00e6a, Sofia Juliana Linn\u00e6a, Samuel Linn\u00e6us (who would eventually succeed their father as rector of Stenbrohult and write a manual on beekeeping), and Emerentia Linn\u00e6a. His father taught him Latin as a small child.One of a long line of peasants and priests, Nils was an amateur botanist, a Lutheran minister, and the curate of the small village of Stenbrohult in Sm\u00e5land. Christina was the daughter of the rector of Stenbrohult, Samuel Brodersonius.A year after Linnaeus's birth, his grandfather Samuel Brodersonius died, and his father Nils became the rector of Stenbrohult. The family moved into the rectory from the curate's house.Even in his early years, Linnaeus seemed to have a liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given a flower, which immediately calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names. Soon Linnaeus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants.Carl's father was the first in his ancestry to adopt a permanent surname. Before that, ancestors had used the patronymic naming system of Scandinavian countries: his father was named Ingemarsson after his father Ingemar Bengtsson. When Nils was admitted to the University of Lund, he had to take on a family name. He adopted the Latinate name Linn\u00e6us after a giant linden tree (or lime tree), lind in Swedish, that grew on the family homestead. This name was spelled with the \u00e6 ligature. When Carl was born, he was named Carl Linn\u00e6us, with his father's family name. The son also always spelled it with the \u00e6 ligature, both in handwritten documents and in publications. Carl's patronymic would have been Nilsson, as in Carl Nilsson Linn\u00e6us.\n\n\n=== Early education ===\nLinnaeus's father began teaching him basic Latin, religion, and geography at an early age. When Linnaeus was seven, Nils decided to hire a tutor for him. The parents picked Johan Telander, a son of a local yeoman. Linnaeus did not like him, writing in his autobiography that Telander \"was better calculated to extinguish a child's talents than develop them\".Two years after his tutoring had begun, he was sent to the Lower Grammar School at V\u00e4xj\u00f6 in 1717. Linnaeus rarely studied, often going to the countryside to look for plants. He reached the last year of the Lower School when he was fifteen, which was taught by the headmaster, Daniel Lannerus, who was interested in botany. Lannerus noticed Linnaeus's interest in botany and gave him the run of his garden.\nHe also introduced him to Johan Rothman, the state doctor of Sm\u00e5land and a teacher at Katedralskolan (a gymnasium) in V\u00e4xj\u00f6. Also a botanist, Rothman broadened Linnaeus's interest in botany and helped him develop an interest in medicine. By the age of 17, Linnaeus had become well acquainted with the existing botanical literature. He remarks in his journal that he \"read day and night, knowing like the back of my hand, Arvidh M\u00e5nsson's Rydaholm Book of Herbs, Tillandz's Flora \u00c5boensis, Palmberg's Serta Florea Suecana,  Bromelii Chloros Gothica and Rudbeckii Hortus Upsaliensis\".Linnaeus entered the V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Katedralskola in 1724, where he studied mainly Greek, Hebrew, theology and mathematics, a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood. In the last year at the gymnasium, Linnaeus's father visited to ask the professors how his son's studies were progressing; to his dismay, most said that the boy would never become a scholar. Rothman believed otherwise, suggesting Linnaeus could have a future in medicine. The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live with his family in V\u00e4xj\u00f6 and to teach him physiology and botany. Nils accepted this offer.\n\n\n== University studies ==\n\n\n=== Lund ===\n\nRothman showed Linnaeus that botany was a serious subject. He taught Linnaeus to classify plants according to Tournefort's system. Linnaeus was also taught about the sexual reproduction of plants, according to S\u00e9bastien Vaillant. In 1727, Linnaeus, age 21, enrolled in Lund University in Sk\u00e5ne. He was registered as Carolus Linn\u00e6us, the Latin form of his full name, which he also used later for his Latin publications.Professor Kilian Stob\u00e6us, natural scientist, physician and historian, offered Linnaeus tutoring and lodging, as well as the use of his library, which included many books about botany. He also gave the student free admission to his lectures. In his spare time, Linnaeus explored the flora of Sk\u00e5ne, together with students sharing the same interests.\n\n\n=== Uppsala ===\n\nIn August 1728, Linnaeus decided to attend Uppsala University on the advice of Rothman, who believed it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: Olof Rudbeck the Younger and Lars Roberg. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state. In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, Olof Celsius, who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist. He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, which was one of the richest botanical libraries in Sweden.In 1729, Linnaeus wrote a thesis, Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum on plant sexual reproduction. This attracted the attention of Rudbeck; in May 1730, he selected Linnaeus to give lectures at the University although the young man was only a second-year student. His lectures were popular, and Linnaeus often addressed an audience of 300 people. In June, Linnaeus moved from Celsius's house to Rudbeck's to become the tutor of the three youngest of his 24 children. His friendship with Celsius did not wane and they continued their botanical expeditions. Over that winter, Linnaeus began to doubt Tournefort's system of classification and decided to create one of his own. His plan was to divide the plants by the number of stamens and pistils. He began writing several books, which would later result in, for example, Genera Plantarum and Critica Botanica. He also produced a book on the plants grown in the Uppsala Botanical Garden, Adonis Uplandicus.Rudbeck's former assistant, Nils Ros\u00e9n, returned to the University in March 1731 with a degree in medicine. Ros\u00e9n started giving anatomy lectures and tried to take over Linnaeus's botany lectures, but Rudbeck prevented that. Until December, Ros\u00e9n gave Linnaeus private tutoring in medicine. In December, Linnaeus had a \"disagreement\" with Rudbeck's wife and had to move out of his mentor's house; his relationship with Rudbeck did not appear to suffer. That Christmas, Linnaeus returned home to Stenbrohult to visit his parents for the first time in about three years. His mother had disapproved of his failing to become a priest, but she was pleased to learn he was teaching at the University.\n\n\n== Expedition to Lapland ==\n\nDuring a visit with his parents, Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to Lapland; Rudbeck had made the journey in 1695, but the detailed results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus's hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people, reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey.\n\nLinnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala on 12 May 1732, just before he turned 25. He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near G\u00e4vle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite. He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rock and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common and economically important animal in Lapland.Linnaeus travelled clockwise around the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, making major inland incursions from Ume\u00e5, Lule\u00e5 and Tornio. He returned from his six-month-long, over 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) expedition in October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks. Although Lapland was a region with limited biodiversity, Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book Flora Lapponica. However, on the expedition to Lapland, Linnaeus used Latin names to describe organisms because he had not yet developed the binomial system.In Flora Lapponica Linnaeus's ideas about nomenclature and classification were first used in a practical way, making this the first proto-modern Flora. The account covered 534 species, used the Linnaean classification system and included, for the described species, geographical distribution and taxonomic notes. It was Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who attributed Linnaeus with Flora Lapponica as the first example in the botanical genre of Flora writing. Botanical historian E. L. Greene described Flora Lapponica as \"the most classic and delightful\" of Linnaeus's works.It was also during this expedition that Linnaeus had a flash of insight regarding the classification of mammals. Upon observing the lower jawbone of a horse at the side of a road he was travelling, Linnaeus remarked: \"If I only knew how many teeth and of what kind every animal had, how many teats and where they were placed, I should perhaps be able to work out a perfectly natural system for the arrangement of all quadrupeds.\"In 1734, Linnaeus led a small group of students to Dalarna. Funded by the Governor of Dalarna, the expedition was to catalogue known natural resources and discover new ones, but also to gather intelligence on Norwegian mining activities at R\u00f8ros.\n\n\n== Doctorate ==\n\nHis relations with Nils Ros\u00e9n having worsened, Linnaeus accepted an invitation from Claes Sohlberg, son of a mining inspector, to spend the Christmas holiday in Falun, where Linnaeus was permitted to visit the mines.In April 1735, at the suggestion of Sohlberg's father, Linnaeus and Sohlberg set out for the Dutch Republic, where Linnaeus intended to study medicine at the University of Harderwijk while tutoring Sohlberg in exchange for an annual salary. At the time, it was common for Swedes to pursue doctoral degrees in the Netherlands, then a highly revered place to study natural history.On the way, the pair stopped in Hamburg, where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them a supposed wonder of nature in his possession: the taxidermied remains of a seven-headed hydra. Linnaeus quickly discovered the specimen was a fake cobbled together from the jaws and paws of weasels and the skins of snakes. The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus that it had been manufactured by monks to represent the Beast of Revelation. Even at the risk of incurring the mayor's wrath, Linnaeus made his observations public, dashing the mayor's dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum. Linnaeus and Sohlberg were forced to flee from Hamburg.\n\nLinnaeus began working towards his degree as soon as he reached Harderwijk, a university known for awarding degrees in as little as a week. He submitted a dissertation, written back in Sweden, entitled Dissertatio medica inauguralis in qua exhibetur hypothesis nova de febrium intermittentium causa, in which he laid out his hypothesis that malaria arose only in areas with clay-rich soils. Although he failed to identify the true source of disease transmission, (i.e., the Anopheles mosquito), he did correctly predict that Artemisia annua (wormwood) would become a source of antimalarial medications.Within two weeks he had completed his oral and practical examinations and was awarded a doctoral degree.That summer Linnaeus reunited with Peter Artedi, a friend from Uppsala with whom he had once made a pact that should either of the two predecease the other, the survivor would finish the decedent's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in the canals of Amsterdam, leaving behind an unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish.\n\n\n== Publishing of Systema Naturae ==\nOne of the first scientists Linnaeus met in the Netherlands was Johan Frederik Gronovius to whom Linnaeus showed one of the several manuscripts he had brought with him from Sweden. The manuscript described a new system for classifying plants. When Gronovius saw it, he was very impressed, and offered to help pay for the printing. With an additional monetary contribution by the Scottish doctor Isaac Lawson, the manuscript was published as Systema Naturae (1735).Linnaeus became acquainted with one of the most respected physicians and botanists in the Netherlands, Herman Boerhaave, who tried to convince Linnaeus to make a career there. Boerhaave offered him a journey to South Africa and America, but Linnaeus declined, stating he would not stand the heat. Instead, Boerhaave convinced Linnaeus that he should visit the botanist Johannes Burman. After his visit, Burman, impressed with his guest's knowledge, decided Linnaeus should stay with him during the winter. During his stay, Linnaeus helped Burman with his Thesaurus Zeylanicus. Burman also helped Linnaeus with the books on which he was working: Fundamenta Botanica and Bibliotheca Botanica.\n\n\n== George Clifford, Philip Miller, and Johann Jacob Dillenius ==\n\nIn August 1735, during Linnaeus's stay with Burman, he met George Clifford III, a director of the Dutch East India Company and the owner of a rich botanical garden at the estate of Hartekamp in Heemstede. Clifford was very impressed with Linnaeus's ability to classify plants, and invited him to become his physician and superintendent of his garden. Linnaeus had already agreed to stay with Burman over the winter, and could thus not accept immediately. However, Clifford offered to compensate Burman by offering him a copy of Sir Hans Sloane's Natural History of Jamaica, a rare book, if he let Linnaeus stay with him, and Burman accepted. On 24 September 1735, Linnaeus moved to Hartekamp to become personal physician to Clifford, and curator of Clifford's herbarium. He was paid 1,000 florins a year, with free board and lodging. Though the agreement was only for a winter of that year, Linnaeus practically stayed there until 1738. It was here that he wrote a book Hortus Cliffortianus, in the preface of which he described his experience as \"the happiest time of my life\". (A portion of Hartekamp was declared as public garden in April 1956 by the Heemstede local authority, and was named \"Linnaeushof\". It eventually became, as it is claimed, the biggest playground in Europe.)\nIn July 1736, Linnaeus travelled to England, at Clifford's expense. He went to London to visit Sir Hans Sloane, a collector of natural history, and to see his cabinet, as well as to visit the Chelsea Physic Garden and its keeper, Philip Miller. He taught Miller about his new system of subdividing plants, as described in Systema Naturae. Miller was in fact reluctant to use the new binomial nomenclature, preferring the classifications of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and John Ray at first. Linnaeus, nevertheless, applauded Miller's Gardeners Dictionary, The conservative Scot actually retained in his dictionary a number of pre-Linnaean binomial signifiers discarded by Linnaeus but which have been retained by modern botanists. He only fully changed to the Linnaean system in the edition of The Gardeners Dictionary of 1768.  Miller ultimately was impressed, and from then on started to arrange the garden according to Linnaeus's system.Linnaeus also travelled to Oxford University to visit the botanist Johann Jacob Dillenius. He failed to make Dillenius publicly fully accept his new classification system, though the two men remained in correspondence for many years afterwards. Linnaeus dedicated his Critica botanica to him, as \"opus botanicum quo absolutius mundus non vidit\". Linnaeus would later name a genus of tropical tree Dillenia in his honour. He then returned to Hartekamp, bringing with him many specimens of rare plants. The next year, he published Genera Plantarum, in which he described 935 genera of plants, and shortly thereafter he supplemented it with Corollarium Generum Plantarum, with another sixty (sexaginta) genera.His work at Hartekamp led to another book, Hortus Cliffortianus, a catalogue of the botanical holdings in the herbarium and botanical garden of Hartekamp. He wrote it in nine months (completed in July 1737), but it was not published until 1738. It contains the first use of the name Nepenthes, which Linnaeus used to describe a genus of pitcher plants.Linnaeus stayed with Clifford at Hartekamp until 18 October 1737 (new style), when he left the house to return to Sweden. Illness and the kindness of Dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in Holland. In May 1738, he set out for Sweden again. On the way home, he stayed in Paris for about a month, visiting botanists such as Antoine de Jussieu. After his return, Linnaeus never left Sweden again.\n\n\n== Return to Sweden ==\n\nWhen Linnaeus returned to Sweden on 28 June 1738, he went to Falun, where he entered into an engagement to Sara Elisabeth Mor\u00e6a. Three months later, he moved to Stockholm to find employment as a physician, and thus to make it possible to support a family. Once again, Linnaeus found a patron; he became acquainted with Count Carl Gustav Tessin, who helped him get work as a physician at the Admiralty. During this time in Stockholm, Linnaeus helped found the Royal Swedish Academy of Science; he became the first Praeses of the academy by drawing of lots.Because his finances had improved and were now sufficient to support a family, he received permission to marry his fianc\u00e9e, Sara Elisabeth Mor\u00e6a. Their wedding was held 26 June 1739. Seventeen months later, Sara gave birth to their first son, Carl. Two years later, a daughter, Elisabeth Christina, was born, and the subsequent year Sara gave birth to Sara Magdalena, who died when 15 days old. Sara and Linnaeus would later have four other children: Lovisa, Sara Christina, Johannes and Sophia.\n\nIn May 1741, Linnaeus was appointed Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University, first with responsibility for medicine-related matters. Soon, he changed place with the other Professor of Medicine, Nils Ros\u00e9n, and thus was responsible for the Botanical Garden (which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand), botany and natural history, instead. In October that same year, his wife and nine-month-old son followed him to live in Uppsala.\n\n\n=== \u00d6land and Gotland ===\nTen days after he was appointed Professor, he undertook an expedition to the island provinces of \u00d6land and Gotland with six students from the university, to look for plants useful in medicine. First, they travelled to \u00d6land and stayed there until 21 June, when they sailed to Visby in Gotland. Linnaeus and the students stayed on Gotland for about a month, and then returned to Uppsala. During this expedition, they found 100 previously unrecorded plants. The observations from the expedition were later published in \u00d6l\u00e4ndska och Gothl\u00e4ndska Resa, written in Swedish. Like Flora Lapponica, it contained both zoological and botanical observations, as well as observations concerning the culture in \u00d6land and Gotland.During the summer of 1745, Linnaeus published two more books: Flora Suecica and Fauna Suecica. Flora Suecica was a strictly botanical book, while Fauna Suecica was zoological. Anders Celsius had created the temperature scale named after him in 1742. Celsius's scale was inverted compared to today, the boiling point at 0 \u00b0C and freezing point at 100 \u00b0C. In 1745, Linnaeus inverted the scale to its present standard.\n\n\n=== V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland ===\nIn the summer of 1746, Linnaeus was once again commissioned by the Government to carry out an expedition, this time to the Swedish province of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland. He set out from Uppsala on 12 June and returned on 11 August. On the expedition his primary companion was Erik Gustaf Lidbeck, a student who had accompanied him on his previous journey. Linnaeus described his findings from the expedition in the book W\u00e4stg\u00f6ta-Resa, published the next year. After returning from the journey the Government decided Linnaeus should take on another expedition to the southernmost province Scania. This journey was postponed, as Linnaeus felt too busy.In 1747, Linnaeus was given the title archiater, or chief physician, by the Swedish king Adolf Frederick\u2014a mark of great respect. The same year he was elected member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin.\n\n\n=== Scania ===\nIn the spring of 1749, Linnaeus could finally journey to Scania, again commissioned by the Government. With him he brought his student, Olof S\u00f6derberg. On the way to Scania, he made his last visit to his brothers and sisters in Stenbrohult since his father had died the previous year. The expedition was similar to the previous journeys in most aspects, but this time he was also ordered to find the best place to grow walnut and Swedish whitebeam trees; these trees were used by the military to make rifles. The journey was successful, and Linnaeus's observations were published the next year in Sk\u00e5nska Resa.\n\n\n=== Rector of Uppsala University ===\n\nIn 1750, Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University, starting a period where natural sciences were esteemed. Perhaps the most important contribution he made during his time at Uppsala was to teach; many of his students travelled to various places in the world to collect botanical samples. Linnaeus called the best of these students his \"apostles\". His lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the Botanical Garden. He tried to teach the students to think for themselves and not trust anybody, not even him. Even more popular than the lectures were the botanical excursions made every Saturday during summer, where Linnaeus and his students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of Uppsala.\n\n\n=== Philosophia Botanica ===\nLinnaeus published Philosophia Botanica in 1751. The book contained a complete survey of the taxonomy system he had been using in his earlier works. It also contained information of how to keep a journal on travels and how to maintain a botanical garden.\n\n\n=== Nutrix Noverca ===\n\nDuring Linnaeus's time it was normal for upper class women to have wet nurses for their babies. Linnaeus joined an ongoing campaign to end this practice in Sweden and promote breast-feeding by mothers. In 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg, a physician student, based on their experiences. In the tradition of the period, this dissertation was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer (prases) expounded upon by the student. Linnaeus's dissertation was translated into French by J.E. Gilibert in 1770 as La Nourrice mar\u00e2tre, ou Dissertation sur les suites funestes du nourrisage merc\u00e9naire. Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk. He admired the child care practices of the Lapps and pointed out how healthy their babies were compared to those of Europeans who employed wet nurses. He compared the behaviour of wild animals and pointed out how none of them denied their newborns their breastmilk. It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for the class of organisms.\n\n\n=== Species Plantarum ===\n\nLinnaeus published Species Plantarum, the work which is now internationally accepted as the starting point of modern botanical nomenclature, in 1753. The first volume was issued on 24 May, the second volume followed on 16 August of the same year. The book contained 1,200 pages and was published in two volumes; it described over 7,300 species. The same year the king dubbed him knight of the Order of the Polar Star, the first civilian in Sweden to become a knight in this order. He was then seldom seen not wearing the order's insignia.\n\n\n=== Ennoblement ===\n\nLinnaeus felt Uppsala was too noisy and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and S\u00e4vja. The next year, he bought a neighbouring farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added. In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants that could not be grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.Since the initial release of Systema Naturae in 1735, the book had been expanded and reprinted several times; the tenth edition was released in 1758. This edition established itself as the starting point for zoological nomenclature, the equivalent of Species Plantarum.The Swedish King Adolf Frederick granted Linnaeus nobility in 1757, but he was not ennobled until 1761. With his ennoblement, he took the name Carl von Linn\u00e9 (Latinised as Carolus a Linn\u00e9), 'Linn\u00e9' being a shortened and gallicised version of 'Linn\u00e6us', and the German nobiliary particle 'von' signifying his ennoblement. The noble family's coat of arms prominently features a twinflower, one of Linnaeus's favourite plants; it was given the scientific name Linnaea borealis in his honour by Gronovius. The shield in the coat of arms is divided into thirds: red, black and green for the three kingdoms of nature (animal, mineral and vegetable) in Linnaean classification; in the centre is an egg \"to denote Nature, which is continued and perpetuated in ovo.\" At the bottom is a phrase in Latin, borrowed from the Aeneid, which reads \"Famam extendere factis\": we extend our fame by our deeds. Linnaeus inscribed this personal motto in books that were gifted to him by friends.After his ennoblement, Linnaeus continued teaching and writing. His reputation had spread over the world, and he corresponded with many different people. For example, Catherine II of Russia sent him seeds from her country. He also corresponded with Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, \"the Linnaeus of the Austrian Empire\", who was a doctor and a botanist in Idrija, Duchy of Carniola (nowadays Slovenia). Scopoli communicated all of his research, findings, and descriptions (for example of the olm and the dormouse, two little animals hitherto unknown to Linnaeus). Linnaeus greatly respected Scopoli and showed great interest in his work. He named a solanaceous genus, Scopolia, the source of scopolamine, after him, but because of the great distance between them, they never met.\n\n\n== Final years ==\n\nLinnaeus was relieved of his duties in the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in 1763, but continued his work there as usual for more than ten years after. He stepped down as rector at Uppsala University in December 1772, mostly due to his declining health.Linnaeus's last years were troubled by illness. He had suffered from a disease called the Uppsala fever in 1764, but survived thanks to the care of Ros\u00e9n. He developed sciatica in 1773, and the next year, he had a stroke which partially paralysed him. He suffered a second stroke in 1776, losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory; while still able to admire his own writings, he could not recognise himself as their author.In December 1777, he had another stroke which greatly weakened him, and eventually led to his death on 10 January 1778 in Hammarby. Despite his desire to be buried in Hammarby, he was buried in Uppsala Cathedral on 22 January.His library and collections were left to his widow Sara and their children. Joseph Banks, an English botanist, wanted to buy the collection, but his son Carl refused and moved the collection to Uppsala. In 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She tried to sell it to Banks, but he was no longer interested; instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection. The acquaintance was a 24-year-old medical student, James Edward Smith, who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books. Smith founded the Linnean Society of London five years later.The von Linn\u00e9 name ended with his son Carl, who never married. His other son, Johannes, had died aged 3. There are over two hundred descendants of Linnaeus through two of his daughters.\n\n\n== Apostles ==\n\nDuring Linnaeus's time as Professor and Rector of Uppsala University, he taught many devoted students, 17 of whom he called \"apostles\". They were the most promising, most committed students, and all of them made botanical expeditions to various places in the world, often with his help. The amount of this help varied; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a scholarship or a place on an expedition. To most of the apostles he gave instructions of what to look for on their journeys. Abroad, the apostles collected and organised new plants, animals and minerals according to Linnaeus's system. Most of them also gave some of their collection to Linnaeus when their journey was finished. Thanks to these students, the Linnaean system of taxonomy spread through the world without Linnaeus ever having to travel outside Sweden after his return from Holland. The British botanist William T. Stearn notes without Linnaeus's new system, it would not have been possible for the apostles to collect and organise so many new specimens. Many of the apostles died during their expeditions.\n\n\n=== Early expeditions ===\nChristopher T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m, the first apostle and a 43-year-old pastor with a wife and children, made his journey in 1746. He boarded a Swedish East India Company ship headed for China. T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m never reached his destination, dying of a tropical fever on C\u00f4n S\u01a1n Island the same year. T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m's widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless, causing Linnaeus to prefer sending out younger, unmarried students after T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m. Six other apostles later died on their expeditions, including Pehr Forssk\u00e5l and Pehr L\u00f6fling.Two years after T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m's expedition, Finnish-born Pehr Kalm set out as the second apostle to North America. There he spent two-and-a-half years studying the flora and fauna of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Canada. Linnaeus was overjoyed when Kalm returned, bringing back with him many pressed flowers and seeds. At least 90 of the 700 North American species described in Species Plantarum had been brought back by Kalm.\n\n\n=== Cook expeditions and Japan ===\n\nDaniel Solander was living in Linnaeus's house during his time as a student in Uppsala. Linnaeus was very fond of him, promising Solander his eldest daughter's hand in marriage. On Linnaeus's recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760, where he met the English botanist Joseph Banks. With Banks, Solander joined James Cook on his expedition to Oceania on the Endeavour in 1768\u201371. Solander was not the only apostle to journey with James Cook; Anders Sparrman followed on the Resolution in 1772\u201375 bound for, among other places, Oceania and South America. Sparrman made many other expeditions, one of them to South Africa.Perhaps the most famous and successful apostle was Carl Peter Thunberg, who embarked on a nine-year expedition in 1770. He stayed in South Africa for three years, then travelled to Japan. All foreigners in Japan were forced to stay on the island of Dejima outside Nagasaki, so it was thus hard for Thunberg to study the flora. He did, however, manage to persuade some of the translators to bring him different plants, and he also found plants in the gardens of Dejima. He returned to Sweden in 1779, one year after Linnaeus's death.\n\n\n== Major publications ==\n\n\n=== Systema Naturae ===\n\nThe first edition of Systema Naturae was printed in the Netherlands in 1735. It was a twelve-page work. By the time it reached its 10th edition in 1758, it classified 4,400 species of animals and 7,700 species of plants. People from all over the world sent their specimens to Linnaeus to be included. By the time he started work on the 12th edition, Linnaeus needed a new invention\u2014the index card\u2014to track classifications.In Systema Naturae, the unwieldy names mostly used at the time, such as \"Physalis annua ramosissima, ramis angulosis glabris, foliis dentato-serratis\", were supplemented with concise and now familiar \"binomials\", composed of the generic name, followed by a specific epithet\u2014in the case given, Physalis angulata. These binomials could serve as a label to refer to the species. Higher taxa were constructed and arranged in a simple and orderly manner. Although the system, now known as binomial nomenclature, was partially developed by the Bauhin brothers (see Gaspard Bauhin and Johann Bauhin) almost 200 years earlier, Linnaeus was the first to use it consistently throughout the work, including in monospecific genera, and may be said to have popularised it within the scientific community.\nAfter the decline in Linnaeus's health in the early 1770s, publication of editions of Systema Naturae went in two different directions. Another Swedish scientist, Johan Andreas Murray issued the Regnum Vegetabile section separately in 1774 as the Systema Vegetabilium, rather confusingly labelled the 13th edition. Meanwhile a 13th edition of the entire Systema appeared in parts between 1788 and 1793. It was through the Systema Vegetabilium that Linnaeus's work became widely known in England, following its translation from the Latin by the Lichfield Botanical Society as A System of Vegetables (1783\u20131785).\n\n\n=== Orbis eruditi judicium de Caroli Linnaei MD scriptis ===\n('Opinion of the learned world on the writings of Carl Linnaeus, Doctor')                                  Published in 1740, this small octavo-sized pamphlet was presented to the State Library of New South Wales by the Linnean Society of NSW in 2018. This is considered among the rarest of all the writings of Linnaeus, and crucial to his career, securing him his appointment to a professorship of medicine at Uppsala University.  From this position he laid the groundwork for his radical new theory of classifying and naming organisms for which he was considered the founder of modern taxonomy.\n\n\n=== Species Plantarum ===\n\nSpecies Plantarum (or, more fully, Species Plantarum, exhibentes plantas rite cognitas, ad genera relatas, cum differentiis specificis, nominibus trivialibus, synonymis selectis, locis natalibus, secundum systema sexuale digestas) was first published in 1753, as a two-volume work. Its prime importance is perhaps that it is the primary starting point of plant nomenclature as it exists today.\n\n\n==== Genera Plantarum ====\n\nGenera plantarum: eorumque characteres naturales secundum numerum, figuram, situm, et proportionem omnium fructificationis partium was first published in 1737, delineating plant genera. Around 10 editions were published, not all of them by Linnaeus himself; the most important is the 1754 fifth edition. In it Linnaeus divided the plant Kingdom into 24 classes. One, Cryptogamia, included all the plants with concealed reproductive parts (algae, fungi, mosses and liverworts and ferns).\n\n\n==== Philosophia Botanica ====\n\nPhilosophia Botanica (1751) was a summary of Linnaeus's thinking on plant classification and nomenclature, and an elaboration of the work he had previously published in Fundamenta Botanica (1736) and Critica Botanica (1737). Other publications forming part of his plan to reform the foundations of botany include his Classes Plantarum and Bibliotheca Botanica: all were printed in Holland (as were Genera Plantarum (1737) and Systema Naturae (1735)), the Philosophia being simultaneously released in Stockholm.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\nAt the end of his lifetime the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744\u20131745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerstr\u00f6m (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alstr\u00f6mer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum. Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 \"the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers\". He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.In April 1766 parts of the town were destroyed by a fire and the Linnean private collection was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town, and shortly afterwards to a single-room stone building close to his country house at Hammarby near Uppsala. This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections; the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university. Some material which needed special care (alcohol specimens) or ample storage space was moved from the private collection to the museum.\nIn Hammarby the Linnean private collections suffered seriously from damp and the depredations by mice and insects. Carl von Linn\u00e9's son (Carl Linnaeus) inherited the collections in 1778 and retained them until his own death in 1783. Shortly after Carl von Linn\u00e9's death his son confirmed that mice had caused \"horrible damage\" to the plants and that also moths and mould had caused considerable damage. He tried to rescue them from the neglect they had suffered during his father's later years, and also added further specimens. This last activity however reduced rather than augmented the scientific value of the original material.\nIn 1784 the young medical student James Edward Smith purchased the entire specimen collection, library, manuscripts, and correspondence of Carl Linnaeus from his widow and daughter and transferred the collections to London. Not all material in Linn\u00e9's private collection was transported to England. Thirty-three fish specimens preserved in alcohol were not sent and were later lost.In London Smith tended to neglect the zoological parts of the collection; he added some specimens and also gave some specimens away. Over the following centuries the Linnean collection in London suffered enormously at the hands of scientists who studied the collection, and in the process disturbed the original arrangement and labels, added specimens that did not belong to the original series and withdrew precious original type material.Much material which had been intensively studied by Linn\u00e9 in his scientific career belonged to the collection of Queen Lovisa Ulrika (1720\u20131782) (in the Linnean publications referred to as \"Museum Ludovicae Ulricae\" or \"M. L. U.\"). This collection was donated by his grandson King Gustav IV Adolf (1778\u20131837) to the museum in Uppsala in 1804. Another important collection in this respect was that of her husband King Adolf Fredrik (1710\u20131771) (in the Linnean sources known as \"Museum Adolphi Friderici\" or \"Mus. Ad. Fr.\"), the wet parts (alcohol collection) of which were later donated to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and is today housed in the Swedish Museum of Natural History at Stockholm. The dry material was transferred to Uppsala.\n\n\n== System of taxonomy ==\n\nThe establishment of universally accepted conventions for the naming of organisms was Linnaeus's main contribution to taxonomy\u2014his work marks the starting point of consistent use of binomial nomenclature. During the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge, Linnaeus also developed what became known as the Linnaean taxonomy; the system of scientific classification now widely used in the biological sciences. A previous zoologist Rumphius (1627\u20131702) had more or less approximated the Linnaean system and his material contributed to the later development of the binomial scientific classification by Linnaeus.The Linnaean system classified nature within a nested hierarchy, starting with three kingdoms. Kingdoms were divided into classes and they, in turn, into orders, and thence into genera (singular: genus), which were divided into species (singular: species). Below the rank of species he sometimes recognised taxa of a lower (unnamed) rank; these have since acquired standardised names such as variety in botany and subspecies in zoology. Modern taxonomy includes a rank of family between order and genus and a rank of phylum between kingdom and class that were not present in Linnaeus's original system.Linnaeus's groupings were based upon shared physical characteristics, and not simply upon differences. Of his higher groupings, only those for animals are still in use, and the groupings themselves have been significantly changed since their conception, as have the principles behind them. Nevertheless, Linnaeus is credited with establishing the idea of a hierarchical structure of classification which is based upon observable characteristics and intended to reflect natural relationships. While the underlying details concerning what are considered to be scientifically valid \"observable characteristics\" have changed with expanding knowledge (for example, DNA sequencing, unavailable in Linnaeus's time, has proven to be a tool of considerable utility for classifying living organisms and establishing their evolutionary relationships), the fundamental principle remains sound.\n\n\n=== Human taxonomy ===\n\nLinnaeus's system of taxonomy was especially noted as the first to include humans (Homo) taxonomically grouped with apes (Simia), under the header of Anthropomorpha.\nGerman biologist Ernst Haeckel speaking in 1907 noted this as the \"most important sign of Linnaeus's genius\".\nLinnaeus classified humans among the primates beginning with the first edition of Systema Naturae. During his time at Hartekamp, he had the opportunity to examine several monkeys and noted similarities between them and man. He pointed out both species basically have the same anatomy; except for speech, he found no other differences. Thus he placed man and monkeys under the same category, Anthropomorpha, meaning \"manlike.\" This classification received criticism from other biologists such as Johan Gottschalk Wallerius, Jacob Theodor Klein and Johann Georg Gmelin on the ground that it is illogical to describe man as human-like. In a letter to Gmelin from 1747, Linnaeus replied:\nIt does not please [you] that I've placed Man among the Anthropomorpha, perhaps because of the term 'with human form', but man learns to know himself. Let's not quibble over words. It will be the same to me whatever name we apply. But I seek from you and from the whole world a generic difference between man and simian that [follows] from the principles of Natural History. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.\n\nThe theological concerns were twofold: first, putting man at the same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the great chain of being, and second, because the Bible says man was created in the image of God (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept. The conflict between world views that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation\u2013evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859.\nAfter such criticism, Linnaeus felt he needed to explain himself more clearly. The 10th edition of Systema Naturae introduced new terms, including Mammalia and Primates, the latter of which would replace Anthropomorpha as well as giving humans the full binomial Homo sapiens. The new classification received less criticism, but many natural historians still believed he had demoted humans from their former place of ruling over nature and not being a part of it. Linnaeus believed that man biologically belongs to the animal kingdom and had to be included in it. In his book Dieta Naturalis, he said, \"One should not vent one's wrath on animals, Theology decree that man has a soul and that the animals are mere 'aoutomata mechanica,' but I believe they would be better advised that animals have a soul and that the difference is of nobility.\"\n\nLinnaeus added a second species to the genus Homo in Systema Naturae based on a figure and description by Jacobus Bontius from a 1658 publication: Homo troglodytes (\"caveman\") and published a third in 1771: Homo lar. Swedish historian Gunnar Broberg states that the new human species Linnaeus described were actually simians or native people clad in skins to frighten colonial settlers, whose appearance had been exaggerated in accounts to Linnaeus.In early editions of Systema Naturae, many well-known legendary creatures were included such as the phoenix, dragon, manticore, and satyrus, which Linnaeus collected into the catch-all category Paradoxa. Broberg thought Linnaeus was trying to offer a natural explanation and demystify the world of superstition. Linnaeus tried to debunk some of these creatures, as he had with the hydra; regarding the purported remains of dragons, Linnaeus wrote that they were either derived from lizards or rays. For Homo troglodytes he asked the Swedish East India Company to search for one, but they did not find any signs of its existence. Homo lar has since been reclassified as Hylobates lar, the lar gibbon.\n\nIn the first edition of Systema Naturae, Linnaeus subdivided the human species into four varieties based on continent and skin colour: \"Europ\u00e6us albus\" (white European), \"Americanus rubescens\" (red American), \"Asiaticus fuscus\" (brown Asian) and \"Africanus niger\" (black African).\nIn the tenth edition of Systema Naturae he further detailed phenotypical characteristics for each variety, based on the concept of the four temperaments from classical antiquity, and changed the description of Asians' skin tone to \"luridus\" (yellow). Additionally, Linnaeus created a wastebasket taxon \"monstrosus\" for \"wild and monstrous humans, unknown groups, and more or less abnormal people\".In 1959, W. T. Stearn designated Linnaeus to be the lectotype of H. sapiens.\n\n\n== Influences and economic beliefs ==\n\nLinnaeus's applied science was inspired not only by the instrumental utilitarianism general to the early Enlightenment, but also by his adherence to the older economic doctrine of Cameralism. Additionally, Linnaeus was a state interventionist.  He supported tariffs, levies, export bounties, quotas, embargoes, navigation acts, subsidised investment capital, ceilings on wages, cash grants, state-licensed producer monopolies, and cartels.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\n\nAnniversaries of Linnaeus's birth, especially in centennial years, have been marked by major celebrations. Linnaeus has appeared on numerous Swedish postage stamps and banknotes. There are numerous statues of Linnaeus in countries around the world. The Linnean Society of London has awarded the Linnean Medal for excellence in botany or zoology since 1888. Following approval by the Riksdag of Sweden, V\u00e4xj\u00f6 University and Kalmar College merged on 1 January 2010 to become Linnaeus University. Other things named after Linnaeus include the twinflower genus Linnaea, the crater Linn\u00e9 on the Earth's moon, a street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the cobalt sulfide mineral Linnaeite.\n\n\n== Commentary ==\nAndrew Dickson White wrote in A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896):\n\nLinnaeus ... was the most eminent naturalist of his time, a wide observer, a close thinker; but the atmosphere in which he lived and moved and had his being was saturated with biblical theology, and this permeated all his thinking. ... Toward the end of his life he timidly advanced the hypothesis that all the species of one genus constituted at the creation one species; and from the last edition of his Systema Natur\u00e6 he quietly left out the strongly orthodox statement of the fixity of each species, which he had insisted upon in his earlier works. ... warnings came speedily both from the Catholic and Protestant sides.\n\nThe mathematical PageRank algorithm, applied to 24 multilingual Wikipedia editions in 2014, published in PLOS ONE in 2015, placed Carl Linnaeus at the top historical figure, above Jesus, Aristotle, Napoleon, and Adolf Hitler (in that order).\n\n\n== Standard author abbreviation ==\n\n\n== Selected publications by Linnaeus ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiographies\n\nBiography at the Department of Systematic Botany, University of Uppsala\nBiography at The Linnean Society of London\nBiography from the University of California Museum of Paleontology\nA four-minute biographical video from the London Natural History Museum on YouTube\nBiography from Taxonomic Literature, 2nd Edition. 1976\u20132009.Resources\n\nWorks by Carl von Linn\u00e9 at Project Gutenberg\nWorks by or about Carl Linnaeus at Internet Archive\nThe Linnean Society of London\nThe Linnaeus Apostles\nThe Linnean Collections\nThe Linnean Correspondence\nLinnaeus' Disciples and Apostles\nThe Linnaean Dissertations\nLinnean Herbarium\nThe Linnaeus Tercentenary\nWorks by Carl von Linn\u00e9 at the Biodiversity Heritage Library\nDigital edition: \"Critica botanica\" by the University and State Library D\u00fcsseldorf\nDigital edition: \"Classes plantarum seu systemata plantarum\" by the University and State Library D\u00fcsseldorf\nOratio de telluris habitabilis incremento (1744) \u2013 full digital facsimile from Linda Hall LibraryOther\n\nLinnaeus was depicted by Jay Hosler in a parody of Peanuts titled \"Good ol' Charlie Darwin\".\nThe 15 March 2007 issue of Nature featured a picture of Linnaeus on the cover with the heading \"Linnaeus's Legacy\" and devoted a substantial portion to items related to Linnaeus and Linnaean taxonomy.\nA tattoo of Linnaeus's definition of the order Primates mentioned by Carl Zimmer\nGinkgo biloba tree at the University of Harderwijk, said to have been planted by Linnaeus in 1735\nSL Magazine, Spring 2018 features an article by Nicholas Sparks, Librarian, Collection Strategy and Development titled Origins of Taxonomy, describing a generous donation from the Linnean Society of NSW to supplement the State Library of New South Wales's collections on Carl Linnaeus of documents, photographs, prints and drawings as well as a fine portrait of Linnaeus painted about 1800.",

        "wiki": "Fj\u00e4rdingen is a neighbourhood in the inner city of Uppsala, Sweden, situated on the western banks of the river Fyris. It has been the ecclesiastical centre of Sweden since the 13th century and contains many of the historical sights and landmarks of Uppsala, notably Uppsala Cathedral on the Domberget hill, with the Archbishop's residence and Church of Sweden offices, as well as the historical university district of Sweden's oldest university, Uppsala University. Notable university buildings in the area include University Hall, Gustavianum and Carolina Rediviva, as well as most of the student nation buildings. To the south, Uppsala Castle, the University Hospital and the Stadstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden city park form the boundary of the historical inner city.\n\n\n== Boundaries ==\nFj\u00e4rdingen's natural border to the north-east is the River Fyris; to the south-east the neighbourhood is limited by Sjukhusv\u00e4gen and the southern end of the city park, to the south-west by Dag Hammarskj\u00f6lds v\u00e4g and Kyrkog\u00e5rdsgatan and to the north-west by Skolgatan.\nThere are several bridge crossings over to the modern city centre. Further south along the opposite side of the river, to the south-east of Fj\u00e4rdingen, is Kungs\u00e4ngen. To the south of Uppsala Castle and the University Hospital along the river is Polacksbacken. To the south-west is K\u00e5bo and to the north-west is Luthagen. The toponym Fr\u00e4mre (Near) Luthagen is sometimes applied to the area between Luthagsesplanaden and Skolgatan.\nIn the early 19th century, the entirety of the city of Uppsala used to encompass the three inner city neighbourhoods of Fj\u00e4rdingen west of the river, Svartb\u00e4cken east of the river north of Stora torget and Kungs\u00e4ngen to the south of Stora torget. Today, the toponyms Svartb\u00e4cken and Kungs\u00e4ngen are mainly used for the neighbourhoods further to the north and south of Stora torget, respectively, as the city centre around Stora torget is considered an administrative subdivision in its own right, also unofficially known as Dragarbrunn.\n\n\n== Streets, places and parks ==\n\n\n=== Domberget ===\nUppsala Cathedral on Domberget, the cathedral hill, is the city's main landmark since its construction in the 13th century and the seat of the Primate of the Lutheran Church of Sweden, the Archbishop of Uppsala. The remains of the medieval fortifications surrounding the cathedral have been incorporated into later buildings, partially encircling the cathedral. Across from the main western entrance to the cathedral is Gustavianum, the former main building of Uppsala University which today remains in use by the university as a lecture building and university museum. The Gustavianum cupola contains a restored baroque anatomical theatre, the second oldest remaining of its kind in the world.  \n\n\n=== Drottninggatan ===\nDrottninggatan is the main avenue and shopping street in the area, leading southwest from the modern city centre across River Fyris and past Fyristorg uphill to the university library, Carolina Rediviva. The final climb uphill through the park landscape to the library is commonly referred to as Carolinabacken, the site of yearly student festivities during the traditional Valborg celebrations on April 30. \n\n\n=== Sysslomansgatan / V\u00e4stra \u00c5gatan ===\nSysslomansgatan/V\u00e4stra \u00c5gatan are the main north-south business streets, running parallel to the river past Fyristorg and joining at Sankt Olofsgatan. The former University Mill building presently houses a restaurant and the Upplandsmuseet regional museum. The triangular Sankt Eriks torg north of the cathedral is home to Uppsala's market hall. The southern end of Sysslomansgatan at the intersection with Sankt Olofsgatan has been the site of Uppsala's oldest caf\u00e9, Ofvandahls, since 1878.\n\n\n=== University Park ===\n\nThe University Park with the monument to Erik Gustaf Geijer is situated centrally in the neighbourhood, a short distance west of the cathedral. The main building of the university and the park was created in the 19th century on the site of the former Archbishop's Castle and the baroque horse riding courts. University Hall, Gustavianum, the Archbishop's Residence, S\u00f6dermanlands-Nerikes nation, Sm\u00e5lands nation and the Church of Sweden office building are situated around the park. Other student societies in the area between Sankt Olofsgatan and Skolgatan north of the University Park include Uplands nation, V\u00e4stmanlands-Dala nation and Kalmar nation.\n\n\n=== \u00d6vre Slottsgatan ===\n\nThe western part of the neighbourhood is situated around \u00d6vre Slottsgatan, which contains many well-preserved 18th century and 19th century buildings. The street runs from Skolgatan in the northern part of the district to Carolina Rediviva. The street widens to form a tree-shaded open space west of University Park, named posthumously after Martin Luther King. The space, shaped like a church, and artwork is the creation of local artist Olof Hellstr\u00f6m.\n\n\n=== Odinslund ===\n\nSouth of the cathedral, the Odinslund park connects Carolina Rediviva and the cathedral hill. In front of the entrance to the Archbishop's residence there is a small statue commemorating Nobel Peace Price Laureate and Archbishop Nathan S\u00f6derblom. The Holy Trinity Church is situated next to the park, the only other remaining medieval church in the historical inner city apart from the cathedral itself. The obelisk in front of the church was raised in 1832 during the reign of King Charles XIV John of Sweden to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of L\u00fctzen and the death of King Gustav II Adolph. The 18th century palace south of the cathedral has been known as Dekanhuset since the 1930s. It housed the controversial State Institute for Racial Biology during the interwar period in the 1920s and 1930s. Presently it is used by the National Property Board of Sweden.\n\n\n=== Valvgatan and Riddartorget ===\n\nA short cobbled street, Valvgatan, connects the Dombron bridge and Fyristorg with Riddartorget, the open place in front of the stairs leading up to the southern cathedral entrance. A vaulted underpass leads under the historical Skytteanum building, traditionally home to the Skyttean Professor of Eloquence and Government since the 1620s. Other buildings situated in the block between Riddartorget and Drottninggatan include V\u00e4rmlands nation, Oxenstierna House with the Faculty of Law and Stockholms nation.\n\n\n=== Nedre Fj\u00e4rdingen ===\nTr\u00e4dg\u00e5rdsgatan leads from Riddartorget to the south through the neighbourhood Nedre (Lower) Fj\u00e4rdingen. Tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rdsgatan south of Drottninggatan is home to many student societies, among them G\u00e4strike-H\u00e4lsinge nation, \u00d6stg\u00f6ta nation, V\u00e4stg\u00f6ta nation and Norrlands nation. Svandammen, the swan pond below the castle, is the southern limit of the inner city; here the city park, the University Hospital grounds and Uppsala Castle on top of Kas\u00e5sen have limited urban expansion. Svandammen has been the entertainment and recreation district of Uppsala since the 19th century, with the Stadstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden city park and the Parksn\u00e4ckan outdoor concert venue, the former student gymnastics building as well as several caf\u00e9s and restaurants, among them Flustret which is the oldest nightclub in Uppsala, founded in 1842.\n\n\n== In film and literature ==\nAs the district of Sweden's oldest university, Fj\u00e4rdingen features prominently in Swedish literature. August Strindberg wrote of his recollections of university life in the short story collection From Fjerdingen and Svartb\u00e4cken (1877). The writer and poet Karin Boye lived in Fj\u00e4rdingen during her undergraduate studies in Uppsala and wrote several works partially inspired by her own student experience. G\u00f6sta Knutsson's (1908\u20131973) children's book series about the cat Pelle No-Tail are mainly set in Fj\u00e4rdingen, as are some of crime writer Kjell Eriksson's Ann Lindell novels.\nSome scenes for the 2011 Hollywood adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo were shot in Fj\u00e4rdingen. Ingmar Bergman spent part of his childhood at his grandmother's apartment in Tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rdsgatan and watched his first silent films in the Slottsbiografen cinema, which has been restored to its early 20th century state and today is used for events. His semi-autobiographical work Fanny and Alexander was also partially shot in Fj\u00e4rdingen, with the University Mill doubling as the home of the severe bishop.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nIngmar Bergman, director, was born in Uppsala and spent part of his early years at his grandmother's apartment in Tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rdsgatan 12.\nDag Hammarskj\u00f6ld (1905\u20131961), U.N. Secretary-General, lived as a child in the governor's residence of Uppsala Castle.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Gamla Uppsala (Swedish: [\u02c8\u0261\u00e2m\u02d0la \u02c8\u0275\u0302p\u02d0\u02ccs\u0251\u02d0la], Old Uppsala) is a parish and a village outside Uppsala in Sweden. It had 17,973 inhabitants in 2016.As early as the 3rd century AD and the 4th century AD and onwards, it was an important religious, economic and political centre. Early written sources claim that already during pre-history, Gamla Uppsala was well known in Northern Europe as the residence of Swedish kings of the legendary Yngling dynasty. In fact, the oldest Scandinavian sources, such as Ynglingatal, the Westrogothic law and the Gutasaga talk of the King of the Swedes (Suiones) as the \"King at Uppsala\".During the Middle Ages, it was the largest village of Uppland, the eastern part of which probably originally formed the core of the complex of properties belonging to the Swedish Crown, the so-called Uppsala \u00f6d, of which the western part consisted of the royal estate itself, kungsg\u00e5rden.It was also the location of the Thing of all Swedes which was a thing (general assembly) held from pre-historic times to the Middle Ages, at the end of February or early March.\nIt was held in conjunction with a great fair called Disting, and a Norse religious celebration called D\u00edsabl\u00f3t.\nThe Law of Uppland says that it was at this assembly that the king proclaimed that the leidang would be summoned for warfare during the summer, and all the crews, rowers, commanders and ships were decided.It was not only the Norse cultic centre, it also became Sweden's archbishopric in 1164.\n\n\n== Geographical description ==\nGamla Uppsala lies on Fyris Wolds, a cultivated plain in the valley of the River Fyris which is densely populated in its southern part, while the northern part consists of farms.\n\n\n== Religious importance ==\n\nMedieval Scandinavians held Gamla Uppsala as one of the oldest and most important locations in Scandinavia. The Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus held Odin himself to have resided in Gamla Uppsala far back in the mists of time:\n\nAt this time there was one Odin, who was credited over all Europe with the honour, which was false, of godhead, but used more continually to sojourn at Uppsala; and in this spot, either from the sloth of the inhabitants or from its own pleasantness, he vouchsafed to dwell with somewhat especial constancy.\nThis tradition was also known by the Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson, who, however had Odin reside in nearby Fornsigtuna, whereas the god Freyr lived in Gamla Uppsala. Freyr is also said to have founded two of the central institutions of Iron Age Sweden, the Uppsala \u00f6d and the Temple at Uppsala:\n\nFrey took the kingdom after Njord, and was called drot by the Swedes, and they paid taxes to him. He was, like his father, fortunate in friends and in good seasons. Frey built a great temple at Uppsala, made it his chief seat, and gave it all his taxes, his land, and goods. Then began the Upsal domains, which have remained ever since.Saxo Grammaticus adds that Freyr began the human sacrifices at Gamla Uppsala:\n\nAlso Frey, the regent of the gods, took his abode not far from Uppsala, where he exchanged for a ghastly and infamous sin-offering the old custom of prayer by sacrifice, which had been used by so many ages and generations. For he paid to the gods abominable offerings, by beginning to slaughter human victims.\nThe sacrifices at the Temple at Uppsala are described by Adam of Bremen:\n\nIn the scolia, there is an additional description:\n\nNear that temple is a very large tree with widespread branches which are always green both in winter and summer. What kind of tree it is nobody knows. There is also a spring there where the pagan are accustomed to perform sacrifices and to immerse a human being alive. As long as his body is not found, the request of the people will be fulfilled. A golden chain encircles that temple and hangs over the gables of the building. Those who approach see its gleam from afar off because the shrine, which is located on a plain, is encircled by mountains so situated as to give the effect of a theatre. For nine days feasts and sacrifices of this kind are celebrated. Every day they sacrifice one human being in addition to other animals, so that in nine days there are 72 victims which are sacrificed. This sacrifice takes place about the time of the vernal equinox.\nIt was a symbolic moment when Pope John Paul II visited Scandinavia in 1989 and held an open-air mass at the royal mounds in Gamla Uppsala, as this was a Norse religion cultic centre, which became Sweden's first archbishopric in 1164.In 2000, the Swedish AsatruSociety restarted the tradition of holding bl\u00f3ts at Gamla Uppsala.The 16th-century Archbishop of Uppsala Johannes Magnus asserted that the city was anciently founded by, and named for, an early Swedish king named Ubbo (Uppsala = Ubbo's Hall), who would have supposedly reigned ca. 2300 BC.  However, in the absence of any corroborating evidence, Magnus' accounts no longer enjoy widespread acceptance among scholars today.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt is a testimony to the sanctity of the location in the mindset of followers of medieval Norse religion that Gamla Uppsala was the last stronghold of pre-Christian, Norse Germanic kingship. During the 1070s and 1080 there appears to have been a renaissance of Norse religion with the magnificent Temple at Uppsala described in a contested account through an eye-witness by Adam of Bremen. Adam of Bremen relates of the Uppsala of the 1070s and describes it as a pagan cult centre with the enormous Temple at Uppsala containing wooden statues of Odin, Thor and Freyr.\nSometime in the 1080s the Christian king Ingi was exiled for refusing to perform the sacrifices. Instead Blot-Sweyn was elected, but he was killed by Ingi who could then reclaim his throne.\nIts great importance in Swedish tradition led to the location of Sweden's first Archbishopric in Gamla Uppsala in 1164. In practice, however, it had lost its strategic importance when it gradually lost ready access to navigable waters as the land rose owing to the constant post-glacial rebound.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\nPeople have been buried in Gamla Uppsala for 2,000 years, since the area rose above water. Originally there were between 2,000 and 3,000 mounds in the area but most have become farmland, gardens and quarries. Today only 250 barrows remain.\nIn the parish there are more than 1,000 preserved archaeological remains, but many more have been removed by agriculture. There are cairns of splintered stone that reveal that the area was settled during the Nordic Bronze Age, but most of the grave fields are from the Iron Age and the Viking Age.\nThe great grave field south of the Royal Mounds is from the Roman Iron Age and the Germanic Iron Age. Near the vicarage, a few unburnt graves from the Viking Age have been excavated.\nUnder the present church in Gamla Uppsala have been found the remains of one or several large wooden buildings. Some archaeologists believe that they are the remains of the Temple of Uppsala, while others hold that comes from an early Christian wooden church. Churches were often built on pre-Christian sacred sites, though.\nAdjacent to the present church there is a plateau of clay, the Plateau of the Royal Estate (Kungsg\u00e5rdsplat\u00e5n), on which archaeologists have found the remains of a large hall.\n\n\n== The Royal Mounds ==\n\nThe Royal Mounds (Swedish: Kungsh\u00f6garna) is the name of the three large barrows located in Gamla Uppsala. According to ancient mythology and folklore, the three gods Thor, Oden and Freyr would be at rest in Kungsh\u00f6garna or Uppsala h\u00f6gar (from the Old Norse word Haugr meaning mound or barrow; cognate English Howe). In the 19th and 20th centuries, they were speculated to hold the remains of three kings of the semi-legendary House of Ynglings and were thus known as Aun's Mound, Adils's Mound and Egil's Mound. Today their geographical locations are used instead and they are called the Eastern mound, Middle Mound and Western Mound.\nThey are dated to the 5th and 6th centuries. As Sweden's oldest national symbols they are even depicted on the covers of books about the Swedish national identity. In the 6th century, Gamla Uppsala was the location of royal burials. The location was chosen carefully and in order to make them majestic. The tumuli were constructed on top of the ridge.\nBy burning the dead king and his armour, he was moved to Valhalla by the consuming force of the fire. The fire could reach temperatures of 1500 \u00b0C. The remains were covered with cobblestones and then a layer of gravel and sand and finally a thin layer of turf.\n\nThus he (Odin) established by law that all dead men should be burned, and their belongings laid with them upon the pile, and the ashes be cast into the sea or buried in the earth.  Thus, said he, every one will come to Valhalla with the riches he had with him upon the pile; and he would also enjoy whatever he himself had buried in the earth. For men of consequence a mound should be raised to their memory, and for all other warriors who had been distinguished for manhood a standing stone; which custom remained long after Odin's time. [...] It was their faith that the higher the smoke arose in the air, the higher he would be raised whose pile it was; and the richer he would be, the more property that was consumed with him.\n\u2014Ynglinga saga\n\n\n=== An old controversy and its solution ===\nIn the 1830s, some scholars claimed that the mounds were pure natural formations and not barrows. This affront to ancient Swedish national symbols could not be accepted by the future Swedish king Karl XV and in order to remove any doubt, he decided to start an excavation.The task was given to Bror Emil Hildebrand, the director-general of the National Archives. In 1846, he undertook the excavation of the nine-metres-tall (30 ft) Eastern mound with the hope of finding the grave of a Swedish king of old.\n\n\n==== The eastern mound ====\n\nThe excavation was complex and generated a lot of publicity. A 25-metre-long (82 ft) tunnel was dug into the mound, where they found a pot of clay filled with burnt bones and around it there were the remains of the charred grave offerings.\nAmong the most important finds in the eastern mound were many fragments of decorated bronze panels with a dancing warrior carrying a spear. These panels have probably adorned a helmet of the Vendel Age type, common in Uppland (the only foreign examples being the Sutton Hoo and Staffordshire helmets). There were also finds of gold which probably had adorned a scramasax, but according to another interpretation, they were part of a belt. The dead was also given several glass beakers, a tafl game, a comb and a hone.\nMost scholars agree that the mound was either raised for a woman or for a young man and a woman as the remains of a woman and boy were found. Hildebrand reburied most of the remains, so a new excavation will need to be undertaken before the controversy can be settled. What is quite certain is that the dead belonged to a royal dynasty.\n\n\n==== The western mound ====\n\nIn 1874, Hildebrand started an excavation of the western mound and opened an enormous shaft right into the cairn in the centre of the mound. Under the cobble stones, there were the charred remains of the funeral fire.\nIn the western mound were found the remains of a man and animals, probably for food during the journey. The remains of a warrior's equipment were found. Luxurious weapons and other objects, both domestic and imported, show that the buried man was very powerful. These remains include a Frankish sword adorned with gold and garnets and a board game with Roman pawns of ivory. He was dressed in a costly suit made of Frankish cloth with golden threads, and he wore a belt with a sumptuous buckle. There were four cameos from the Middle East which were probably part of a casket. The finds show the distant contacts of the people of Uppland in the 6th century.\n\n\n== Gamla Uppsala Church ==\nGamla Uppsala Church (Gamla Uppsala kyrka) was the Archbishopric of Sweden prior to 1273, when the archbishopric was moved to \u00d6stra Aros (\u00d6stra Aros was then renamed Uppsala due to a papal request). The old cathedral was probably built in the 11th century, but finished in the 12th century. The stone building may have been preceded by a wooden church and probably by the large Temple at Uppsala. After a fire in 1240, the nave and transepts of the cathedral were removed, leaving only the choir and central tower, and with the addition of the sacristy and the porch gave the church its present outer appearance. In the 15th century, vaults were added as well as chalk paintings. Among the medieval wooden sculptures there are three crucifixes from the 12th, 13th and 15th centuries. Archbishop Valerius  was buried here. King Eric IX of Sweden was as well, before being moved to Uppsala Cathedral. Astronomer, physicist and mathematician Anders Celsius (1701\u20131744) was also buried at Gamla Uppsala Church next to his grandfather Magnus Celsius (1621\u20131679).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKlingmark, Elisabeth: Gamla Uppsala, Svenska kulturminnen 59, Riksantikvarie\u00e4mbetet.\nNationalencyklopedin\n\n\n== External links ==\nVirtual tour of Gamla Uppsala Church\nArcheological information on Gamla Uppsala, by the Swedish National Heritage Board.\nUppsala official site.\nHistorical Reference from Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum, Book IV, with Facing Latin and English text.",

Carl Linnaeus was a scientist and professor at Uppsala University.  In 1762 Linnaeus bought the small estate of Hammarby in order to spend his holidays in a quiet place.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\nThe main house of Linnaeus has two floors, an attic and a cellar under part of the house. The house is constructed of horizontal logs.\nInside the house, the old wallpaper is distinguished, with flower design in dark red, gold and white. It was probably made c. 1880.There are two other buildings in the compound. The east wing building housed the bakehouse and brewery. The west wing building probably housed the estate's staff and workers.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe Linnaeus's Hammarby is a historic house and gardens museum. In 1935 the museum was declared a historical monument, and is administered by the National Property Board.

        "wiki": "The city of Uppsala is one of the oldest in Sweden. It has played a dominant role in the political, intellectual and historical development of the country. The two main institutions in the history of Uppsala are the Archdiocese which is located in the city, and Uppsala University, founded in the city in 1477. These have long been established on the western banks of the Fyris river with a bourgeois trading town on the other side of the river.\n\n\n== Pre-christian Uppsala ( \u20131087) ==\n\nThe site where Uppsala stands is a fertile plain. The city lies in the intersection of the esker Uppsala\u00e5sen and the river Fyris\u00e5n. In prehistoric times most of the area was below sea level. Therefore, the first communities in the area were established at a higher altitude in Gamla Uppsala (old Uppsala), about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) north of the current city. In the 3rd and 4th centuries old Uppsala grew into an important religious and political centre, with both the pagan Temple at Uppsala and the Thing of all Swedes in the town.\nAccording to the mythological Heimskringla the city was founded during the reign of Augustus by the pagan god Freyr.\n\n\n== Medieval Uppsala (1087\u20131520) ==\n\nIn 1087 the temple at Uppsala was burned as a part of the Christianisation of Sweden. In 1164 Gamla Uppsala became the seat of the Swedish Archdiocese. Due to isostasy the shoreline had moved down from Gamla Uppsala, and in the 6th century the Fyris River was unsailable north of Kvarnfallet in the current city of Uppsala. At this site the modern city of Uppsala was founded as a port city to Gamla Uppsala, under the name of Aros. In the first centuries of the second millennium the port city outgrew Gamla Uppsala, which became increasingly isolated. In 1273 the Archdiocese was moved from Gamla Uppsala to Aros, on the condition that the name Uppsala moved with the Archdiocese, which is how the city got its current name. After the relocation the construction of Uppsala cathedral began, continuing until 1435 when the cathedral was inaugurated.In 1477 Uppsala University was founded through a papal bull as the first university in northern Europe.\n\n\n== Vasa era (1520\u20131702) ==\n\nIn 1523 Gustav Vasa seized power in Sweden. During his reign Uppsala experienced a severe decline. The ecclesiastical city was largely affected by his reduction and the university closed due to lack of funds. As a result of the protestant reformation much of the church's power moved from Uppsala to the royal court in Stockholm. As a demonstration and consolidation of his power King Gustav began the building of a large fortification on Uppsala\u00e5sen, Uppsala Castle, in 1549.\nIn the 16th century several important church meetings were held in Uppsala. A new Church Ordinance was accepted in 1571, and in 1593 the Uppsala Synod took place. During the meeting the Augsburg Confession was accepted as the sole religious doctrine and the university was reopened. However, the university took several more decades to resume its full functioning.\nDuring the Swedish Empire Uppsala flourished and became viewed as the second capital of the empire. Through large donations from King Gustav II Adolf the university experienced a renaissance. The king realized the benefits of building his empire with not only military but also intellectual means. In the 1620s a new main building for the university was raised, Gustavianum, and in 1622 the world's first professorship in political science was founded, financed by Johan Skytte. In 1663 the student nations at Uppsala university were legalized by the Konsistorium (the University's decision-making body), and in the same year education in Exercitieinstitutionen was introduced, in an effort to provide the empire with competent military and civil servicemen.In 1643 Uppsala adopted its first city plan. The medieval town with irregular street patterns was to a large extent demolished and a new city with straight streets and diamond-shaped blocks was built within an 800 by 1,200 metres (0.50 by 0.75 mi) large urban square. The plan was mostly completed by 1660. The area near the cathedral was not included in the city plan, and therefore these buildings are the oldest still standing in the city.On 16 May 1702 much of the city was destroyed in a large fire. The cathedral was one of several buildings severely damaged. It took decades to rebuild the city and after the fire it lost its position as a second capital of Sweden.\n\n\n== Age of Liberty and the Gustavian era (1702\u20131809) ==\nUppsala was greatly affected by the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment. Many of Sweden's most eminent persons of the enlightenment lived and worked in the city. Among these were the mathematician Samuel Klingenstierna, the astronomer Anders Celsius, the physician Nils Ros\u00e9n von Rosenstein, the biologist Carl von Linn\u00e9 and the humanist and linguist Johan Ihre.In the 18th century the bourgeois trading town declined due to competition from the growing capital Stockholm. The university also experienced a set-back during the end of the century due to the deaths of many of its most prominent scientists and the political turmoil in Europe caused by the French revolution.\n\n\n== Uppsala in the union era (1809\u20131905) ==\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century the university was largely affected by the ideals of romanticism. A group of intellectuals in the city, including Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom, Lorenzo Hammarsk\u00f6ld and Erik Gustaf Geijer became known as the Uppsala romantics. By contrast, in the second half of the century the university was dominated by ideals of natural science. In the 50-year period 1820\u20131870 the number of students at the university tripled, from 500 persons to 1500. In 1870 women were allowed to study at the university and in 1872 Betty Pettersson became the first woman to graduate from a university in Sweden. During this era many university buildings were erected. In 1841 the new university library Carolina Rediviva was inaugurated, In 1867 the university hospital opened and in 1887 King Oscar II of Sweden inaugurated the university hall. During these years the student nations also obtained their own buildings. In 1843, 1856 and 1875 Uppsala hosted Nordic student meetings.\nIn 1866 Uppsala Central Station opened which made large scale industrialization in Uppsala possible. The area lacks typical natural resources such as ore and wood, but the soil is fertile. Therefore, the food industry and production of bricks from the muddy soil both grew as businesses in Uppsala.These factors caused a large population growth in the city. Between 1870 and 1900  the population doubled from 11,433 to 22,818 inhabitants. For the first time the city expanded outside of the old city square which was plotted in the city plan of 1643. The city expanded into the districts of Luthagen and Svartb\u00e4cken in the north, and Vaksala in the east.\n\n\n== War era (1905\u20131945) ==\n\nIn 1921 the State Institute for Racial Biology, known as the Statens institut f\u00f6r rasbiologi, was established in Uppsala as a governmental agency for eugenics. It was the world's first of its kind. The pro-Nazi physician Herman Bernhard Lundborg was appointed as the first head of the institute, but after he was removed and replaced by Gunnar Dahlberg in 1936 the institute developed towards a less racist and more medicinal and statistical direction. In 1939 Bollhusm\u00f6tet, \"the ball house meeting\", took place in Uppsala. It was organized by the student body at the university. A majority of the assembly made an official protest against accepting ten Jewish academic refugees from Nazi Germany.During the war era the philosophy faculty at the university grew, and new subjects like archaeology, art history and modern languages were introduced. Among the most eminent professors at the university were The Svedberg, Arne Tiselius, Harald Hj\u00e4rne, Adolf Noreen and Nathan S\u00f6derblom. A meta-ethical emotivistic view called Uppsalafilosofin, the Uppsala school, was introduced by Axel H\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m and his students, which inspired the development of the legal view Uppsalaskolan. Between the years 1880 and 1945 the number of students at the university tripled from 1500 to 4500, and Uppsala was one of the fastest growing cities in Sweden.\n\n\n== Modern Uppsala (1945\u2013 ) ==\nIn the post-war era Uppsala has experienced comprehensive urban renewal. Unlike most of Europe, Sweden never participated in World War II, so its pre-war infrastructure was intact. But due to severe repair needs and modernistic ideals most of the old city was demolished. Instead, a new city centre was erected, mostly in modernistic and functionalistic style. However, similarly to the demolition and redesign of the city in 1643 the area around the cathedral were left standing.In the 50-year period between 1940 and 1990 the population of Uppsala municipality more than doubled, growing from 74,000 inhabitants to 156,000. This increased the need for city expansion, which was made possible due to the post\u2013World War II economic expansion. In the Million Programme-era of the 1960s and 1970s several new districts such as Flogsta, Gottsunda, Nyby, Sunnersta and Gr\u00e4nby were built.\nThe number of university students increased rapidly, from 8,000 in 1960 to 21,000 in 1970. During the tenure of the principal Torgny T:son Segerstedt from 1955 to 1978 more students were admitted to the university than during its entire earlier history combined. Simultaneously Uppsala underwent severe de-industrialisation, with many of the 19th century enterprises shutting down.In 2011 the population of Uppsala municipality surpassed 200,000 persons.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "Uppsala (, also US:  or all ending in , Swedish: [\u02c8\u0275\u0302p\u02d0\u02ccs\u0251\u02d0la] (listen); archaically spelled Upsala) is the county seat of Uppsala County and the fourth-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malm\u00f6. It had 168,096 inhabitants in 2017.Located 71 km (44 mi) north of the capital Stockholm it is also the seat of Uppsala Municipality. Since 1164, Uppsala has been the ecclesiastical centre of Sweden, being the seat of the Archbishop of the Church of Sweden. Uppsala is home to Scandinavia's largest cathedral \u2013 Uppsala Cathedral. Founded in 1477, Uppsala University is the oldest centre of higher education in Scandinavia. Among many achievements, the Celsius scale for temperature was invented there.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nUppsala was originally located a few kilometres north of its current location at a place now known as Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala). Today's Uppsala was then called \u00d6stra Aros (Eastern Aros, to differentiate it from Western Aros). (Old) Uppsala was, according to medieval writer Adam of Bremen, the main pagan centre of Sweden, and the Temple at Uppsala contained magnificent idols of the Norse gods. The Fyrisvellir plains along the river south of Old Uppsala, in the area where the modern city is situated today, was the site of the Battle of Fyrisvellir in the 980s.\nThe present-day Uppsala was at that time known as \u00d6stra Aros and was a port town of Gamla Uppsala. In 1160, King Eric Jedvardsson was attacked and killed outside the church of \u00d6stra Aros, and later became venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church. In 1274, \u00d6stra Aros overtook Gamla Uppsala as the main regional centre, and when the cathedral of Gamla Uppsala burnt down, the archbishopric and the relics of Saint Eric were moved to \u00d6stra Aros, where the present-day Uppsala Cathedral was erected; it was inaugurated in 1435. The cathedral is built in the Gothic style and is one of the largest in northern Europe, with towers reaching 118.70 metres (389.4 ft).\nThe city is the site of the oldest university in Scandinavia, founded in 1477, and is where Carl Linnaeus, one of the renowned scholars of Uppsala University, lived for many years; both his house and garden can still be visited. Uppsala is also the site of the 16th-century Uppsala Castle. The city was severely damaged by a fire in 1702. Historical and cultural treasures were also lost, as in many Swedish cities, from demolitions during the 1960s and 1970s, but many historic buildings remain, especially in the western part of the city. The arms bearing the lion can be traced to 1737 and have been modernised several times, most recently in 1986. The meaning of the lion is uncertain, but is likely connected to the royal lion, also depicted on the Coat of Arms of Sweden.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSituated on the fertile Uppsala flatlands of muddy soil, the city features the small Fyris River (Fyris\u00e5n) flowing through the landscape surrounded by lush vegetation. Parallel to the river runs the glacial ridge of Uppsala\u00e5sen at an elevation around 30 m (98 ft), the site of Uppsala's castle, from which large parts of the town can be seen. The central park Stadsskogen (literally \"City Forest\") stretches from the south far into town, with opportunities for recreation for many residential areas within walking distance.\nOnly some 70 km (43 mi) or 40 minutes by train from the capital, many Uppsala residents work in Stockholm. The train to Stockholm-Arlanda Airport takes only 17 minutes, rendering the city easily accessible by air.\nThe commercial centre of Uppsala is quite compact. The city has a distinct town and gown divide with clergy, royalty, and academia historically residing in the Fj\u00e4rdingen neighbourhood on the river's western shore, somewhat separated from the rest of the city, and the ensemble of cathedral, castle and university buildings has remained mostly undisturbed until today. While some historic buildings remain on the periphery of the central core, retail commercial activity is geographically focused on a small number of blocks around the pedestrianized streets and main square on the eastern side of the river, an area that was subject to a large-scale metamorphosis during the economically booming years in the 1960s in particular. During recent decades, a significant part of retail commercial activity has shifted to shopping malls and stores situated in the outskirts of the city. Meanwhile, the built-up areas have expanded greatly, and some suburbanization has taken place.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUppsala lies immediately south of the 60th parallel north and has a humid continental climate, with cold winters and warm summers. Due to its northerly location, Uppsala experiences over 18 hours of visible sunshine during the summer solstice, and under 6 hours of sunshine during the winter solstice.  Despite Uppsala's northerly location, the winter is not as cold as other cities at similar latitudes, mainly due to the Gulf Stream. For example, in January Uppsala has a daily mean of \u22122.7 \u00b0C (27.1 \u00b0F). In Canada, at the same latitude, Fort Smith experiences a daily mean of \u221222.4 \u00b0C (\u22128.3 \u00b0F).\n\nWith respect to record temperatures, the difference between the highest and lowest is relatively large. Uppsala\u2019s highest recorded temperature was 37.4 \u00b0C (99.3 \u00b0F), recorded in July 1933. On the same day Ultuna, which lies a few kilometres south of the centre of Uppsala, recorded a temperature of 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F). This is the highest temperature ever recorded in the Scandinavian Peninsula, although the same temperature was recorded in M\u00e5lilla, Sweden, 14 years later. Uppsala\u2019s lowest temperature was recorded in January 1875, when the temperature dropped to \u221239.5 \u00b0C (\u221239.1 \u00b0F). The second-lowest temperature recorded is \u221233.1 \u00b0C (\u221227.6 \u00b0F), which makes the record one of the hardest to beat, due to the fact that temperatures in Uppsala nowadays rarely goes below \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u00b0F). The difference between the two records is 76.9 \u00b0C (138.4 \u00b0F).\nThe warmest month ever recorded is July 2018, with a daily mean of 22.0 \u00b0C (70.5 \u00b0F). Since 2002 Uppsala has experienced 6 months where the daily mean was 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) or warmer, the most recent in July 2018 when the daily mean was 22.0 \u00b0C (68.9 \u00b0F). The coldest month ever recorded is January 1814, when the daily mean was \u221214.9 \u00b0C (5.2 \u00b0F). Between January 1814 and January 1987, Uppsala experienced 23 months that were colder than \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F). Since February 1987, the coldest month recorded is \u22128.6 \u00b0C (16.5 \u00b0F). The warmest year ever recorded was 2014, with an average temperature of 8.1 \u00b0C (46.6 \u00b0F). The second warmest is 2018, with 8.0 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). Since 1991, Uppsala has recorded 15 years with an average temperature of 7 \u00b0C (44.6 \u00b0F) or warmer. The coldest year ever recorded was 1867, with an average temperature of 2.5 \u00b0C (36.5 \u00b0F). 1987 was the last year Uppsala recorded a year with an average temperature below 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F).\nThe climate table below presents weather data from 1981\u20132010. According to ongoing measurements, the temperature has increased during  1981\u20132010 as compared with the 1951\u20131980 series. This increase is on an annual basis around 0.9 \u00b0C. Warming is most pronounced during the winter and spring. January, February, and March have had the most pronouncing increase in temperature, with each month increasing 1.5 \u00b0C or more. The only month that did not get warmer is June, which got 0.3 \u00b0C colder. During the 20th century, Uppsala has warmed drastically, especially the winter. If compared to the period 1861\u20131890, the annual increase in temperature is 1.8 \u00b0C. March is the month with the biggest increase, where the temperature has increased more than 3 \u00b0C since the latter parts of the 19th century.\nWinter normally arrives in late November, and lasts until the middle of March when spring arrives. Summer usually arrives in the middle of May, and lasts until late September when autumn arrives. Precipitation is most common between June and November, in all these months it falls 50 mm (2.0 in) or more on average. August receives most precipitation with 74 mm (2.9 in). Between January and May precipitation levels fall a bit, with all months receiving less than 40 mm (1.6 in) on average. Annual precipitation is 576 mm (22.6 in). Rainfall can occur all year round, although it is less common in January and February. Snowfall mainly occurs between November and March. Snowfall in October and April can happen from time to time, but not every year. During the night between 30 April and 1 May 2014 it fell approximately 15 cm (5.9 in) of snow in Uppsala, the first recorded snowfall in May since 1981.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe total population of Uppsala has been steadily increasing from 190,668 to 225,164 between 2008 and 2018. According to the official statistics 21 per cent of the population was born in foreign countries, which is 2 per cent higher than the average of Sweden.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nUppsala has economic development in many sectors. Today Uppsala is well established in medical research and recognised for its leading position in biotechnology.\n\nAbbott Medical Optics (AMO)\nGE Healthcare\nPfizer (see Pharmacia)\nPhadia, an offshoot of Pharmacia, now a part of Thermo Fisher Scientific\nFresenius\nQ-Med (bioscience)\nBiotage\nSkandion Kliniken, proton therapy centre\n\n\n== Crime ==\n\nIn its 2017 report, Police in Sweden placed the Gottsunda district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates. Regional chief of police Carin G\u00f6tblad stated that the classification was due to having a number of criminal gangs, many illegal weapons in circulation and families where a criminal lifestyle is inherited from generation to generation.In 2019, a poll by the council found that four out of five girls in Uppsala felt unsafe walking alone outside due to harassment by gangs of males. This represented a doubling since five years earlier.\n\n\n== Higher education ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nUppsala University. Founded in 1477, under bishop Jakob Ulvsson. Originally a Catholic institution, after limited activity following the Reformation it was re-organised as a Lutheran institution in 1595, following the Uppsala Synod in 1593. The university has a famous anatomical theatre, constructed by the scientist and polymath Olof Rudbeck (1630\u20131702), in the old university building Gustavianum. The building is now a museum. The university has 13 student fraternities, known as \"nations\", each traditionally representing a geographical region of Sweden.\nSwedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU, Sveriges Lantbruksuniversitet, main campus).\n\n\n=== Other higher education ===\nJohannelunds Teologiska H\u00f6gskola. A Lutheran theological seminary established in 1862, located in Uppsala since 1970.\nThe Newman Institute. A Catholic institution founded in 2001.\nPingstr\u00f6relsens teologiska seminarium. A Pentecostal theological seminary, which does not have accreditation from the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education and cannot confer Swedish academic degrees.\n\n\n== Museums and sights ==\n\nThe Fyris river (Fyris\u00e5n) neatly divides the city into two different parts: the historic quarter to the west of the river and the modern administrative, residential and commercial city centre to the east. Most of the historical sights and university buildings are in the western part, with a medieval street layout, river views and parks and dominated by the cathedral.\nThe most outstanding building in Uppsala is the Domkyrka (Uppsala Cathedral), Scandinavia's largest church building (118.70 m (389.44 ft) high). Together with Uppsala Castle it has dominated Uppsala's skyline since its construction in the 13th century and can be seen from a long distance outside the city, other tall buildings being rare.\nFacing the west end of the cathedral is the Gustavianum, built in 1625 to be the main building of the University, and served as such through most of the 19th century. It contains the Museum of Nordic Antiquities, the Victoria Museum (of Egyptian antiquities) and the University's cultural history collections. It also houses a perfectly preserved 17th-century anatomical theatre (used in its time for public dissections). Next to Gustavianum is the 18th century Archbishop's Palace, the official residence of the Lutheran Archbishop of Uppsala and the primate of the Church of Sweden.\nAcross the street from the Gustavianum in the University Park stands the University Hall, erected in 1879\u201386 in Italian renaissance style. The Uppsala University Coin Cabinet is located in the university main building.\n\nNot far from the University stands the Uppsala University Library (Carolina Rediviva), the largest library in Sweden, with over 5 million volumes and some 60,000 manuscripts. The building was built in 1820\u201341.\nOn a circa 35-metre high hill to the southwest of the University Library stands Uppsala Castle. Its construction was initiated in 1549 by King Gustav Vasa, founder of the Vasa royal dynasty. Today the castle holds several museums, among them the regional art museum, and is the residence of the Uppsala County Governor (landsh\u00f6vding).\nThere are several botanical museums in Uppsala related to the world-famous 18th century botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus; the Botanic Garden next to the castle, the Linnaean Garden in the city centre, and Linnaeus Hammarby, Linnaeus' summer house in the countryside village of Danmarks Hammarby south of the city.\n5 kilometres (3 miles) north of Uppsala city lies Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala), the location of the pre-Christian settlement of Uppsala which later provided the new name for the medieval settlement further south. There are few remains, with the exception of several huge burial mounds of pre-Christian monarchs and the previous cathedral from 1164 A.D., traditionally said to be built over the old heathen temple (and recent archaeological investigations seems to support this notion). The site was a major religious centre in Scandinavia in pre-Christian times. After the old cathedral church burned down around 1240 it was only partially restored to a more modest size as it no longer was the seat of the Archbishop. The Gamla Uppsala Museum exhibits archeological finds made during excavations in Gamla Uppsala and related finds from other parts of Uppland, as well as exhibitions on the history of the site itself.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nTrains depart Uppsala Central Station in three directions. There are trains to the south , Arlanda, Stockholm and Link\u00f6ping, to the northwest, Dalarna and Sala, and to the north G\u00e4vle, Sundsvall, \u00d6stersund and to the northern half of Sweden as well as sleeper trains to Narvik in Norway.\nWhile Uppsala has no airport of its own, Arlanda Airport is located about 30 km south of Uppsala. \u00c4rna Airport north of Uppsala is a military airport.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe largest arena in Uppsala is Fyrishov and is Sweden's fourth most visited, specialized in swimming, sports events, meetings and recreation. The facility includes areas for indoor sports, summer sport and a generous waterpark with waterslides, 50-meter pool, training pool, relaxation area and a large outdoor swimming pool. Accommodation is offered at the Fyrishov cabin area, and at the resort restaurants a good lunch or dinner can be enjoyed. Fyrishov AB's business also includes the operation of Gottsundabadet in which there is a 25-metre pool, a 10-metre children's pool and gym. The entire facility is open all year round and a large number of meetings and various events are held here annually.\nIn addition to activities within the arena Fyrishov AB runs T\u00e4vlingsstaden Uppsala in a collaboration between the sports organizers, Fyrishov AB, Uppsala, Uppsala Tourism and hotel business. Co-founded in 2006 by Fyrishov AB under the name SM-town Uppsala in 2007 but was expanded to include international events and competitions at high national level. The project aims to develop Uppsala, a leading sports town in Sweden. In 2009 there were 24 SM-competitions and major national and international competitions in Uppsala.\nAt Fyrishov the city's basketball team Uppsala Basket also plays, former KFUM Uppsala, their home games in the Swedish basketball league. There are also athletic club Uppsala, Uppsala, fencing club, Uppsala Judo Club, Sweden's oldest judo club, Uppsala volleyball companion, Upsala weightlifting club and Upsala Sims\u00e4llskap, one of the world's oldest swimmingclubs. The sport that draws the most audience is floorball. Uppsala's two teams in the Swedish Super League, Storvreta IBK and IK Sirius IBK, have Fyrishov as their home.\nOne of the most classical sports events, the Swedish bandy final, took place at Studenternas IP 1991-2012. After being played indoors in Stockholm 2013-2017, from 2018 it is again played in Uppsala. It usually attracts a spectator crowd of more than 20,000.Once every year, the Uppsala Union of Science and Engineering Students arrange a river rafting in the Fyris river with rafts built from styrofoam.\nOther sports clubs located in Uppsala include:\n\nAlmtuna IS\nGamla Upsala SK\nIF Vindhemspojkarna\nIK Sirius\nIK Sirius Fotboll\nUnik FK\nUpsala IF\nUppsala Judoklubb\nUppsala 86ers, American football club\nUpsala F\u00e4ktning, fencing club\nUpsala allm\u00e4nna schacks\u00e4llskap (UASS), chess club\n\n\n== Notable locals ==\n\nAmelia Andersdotter* (1987\u2013), politician\nMagdalena Andersson* (1967\u2013), politician\nAnders Jonas \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m (1814\u20131874), physicist\nSvante Arrhenius* (1859\u20131927), scientist\nIngmar Bergman* (1918\u20132007), filmmaker\nJ\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius (1779\u20131848), chemist\nHans Blix* (1928\u2013), diplomat\nEmilia Brodin* (1990\u2013), football player\nArvid Carlsson* (1923\u20132018), neuropharmacologist\nAnders Celsius* (1701\u20131744), astronomer\nHans Dahlgren* (1948\u2013), politician\nAdiam Dymott* (1982\u2013), musician\nLars Edlund (1922\u20132013), composer\nUlf Ekman (1950\u2013), pastor\nStefan Eriksson* (1961\u2013), criminal\nMartin Eriksson* (1965\u2013), musician\nMalena Ernman* (1970\u2013), opera singer\nRobert H\u00e4gg (1995\u2013), ice hockey player for the Philadelphia Flyers\nTorsten Hallman* (1939\u2013), former motocross world champion\nLars Hollmer (1948\u20132008), composer\nDag Hammarskj\u00f6ld (1905\u20131961), diplomat\nMagnus Hellberg* (1991\u2013), hockey player\nMattias Klum* (1968\u2013), photographer\nG\u00f6sta Knutsson (1903\u20131973), author and radio producer\nCarl-Bertil Laurell* (1919\u20132001), medical doctor and researcher\nDave Lepard* (1980\u20132006), musician\nBruno Liljefors* (1860\u20131939), painter\nRuben Liljefors* (1871\u20131936), composer and conductor\nViveca Lindfors* (1920\u20131995), actress\nCarolus Linnaeus (1707\u20131778), scientist\nAndreas Lundstedt* (1972\u2013), singer\nVeronica Maggio* (1981\u2013), singer\nJan M\u00e5rtenson* (1933\u2013), diplomat and author\nH\u00e5kan Nesser (1950\u2013), author\nStefan Parkman* (1952\u2013), conductor\nBo Johan Renck* (1966\u2013), music artist and music video director\nEmma Rendel* (1976\u2013), author and illustrator\nHillevi Rombin* (1933\u20131996), Miss Sweden 1955, Miss Universe 1955\nHans Rosling* (1948\u20132017), physician and statistician\nOlaus Rudbeckius (1630\u20131702), scientist\nDina Schneidermann, (1930/1931\u20132016), musician\nMartin S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m* (1990\u2013), professional mountain biker\nRoine Stolt* (1956\u2013), musician\nAnders Tegnell* (1956\u2013), physician and civil servant\nOwe Th\u00f6rnqvist* (1929\u2013), artist\nRebecka T\u00f6rnqvist* (1964\u2013), artist\nWatain, black metal band(* = born in Uppsala)\n\n\n== References in popular culture ==\nIn the History Channel's Canadian-Irish TV series Vikings, Uppsala is visited by Ragnar Lothbrok and his entourage to worship the Aesir Gods and offer a human sacrifice to appease them.

        "wiki": "The Temple at Uppsala was a religious center in the ancient Norse religion once located at what is now Gamla Uppsala (Swedish \"Old Uppsala\"), Sweden attested in Adam of Bremen's 11th-century work Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum and in Heimskringla, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. Theories have been proposed about the implications of the descriptions of the temple and the findings (or lack thereof) of the archaeological excavations in the area, along with recent findings of extensive wooden structures and log lines that may have played a supporting role to activities at the site, including ritual sacrifice.\n\n\n== Adam of Bremen ==\nIn Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum, Adam of Bremen provides a description of the temple. Adam records that a \"very famous temple called Ubsola\" exists in a town close to Sigtuna. Adam details that the temple is \"adorned with gold\" and that the people there worship statues of three specific gods that sit on a triple throne. Thor, whom Adam refers to as \"the mightiest,\" sits in the central throne, while Wodan (Odin) and Fricco (Freyr) are seated on the thrones to the sides of him. Adam provides information about the characteristics of the three gods, including that Fricco is depicted with an immense erect penis, Wodan in armor (\"as our people depict Mars,\" Adam notes) and that Thor has a mace, a detail which Adam compares to that of the Roman god Jupiter. Adam adds that, in addition, \"they also worship gods who were once men, whom they reckon to be immortal because of their heroic acts [...].\"Adam says that the three gods have a priest appointed to them each who offer up sacrifices to the deities from the people. If famine or plague occurs, a sacrifice is made to Thor; if there is war, a sacrifice is made to Wodan; if a marriage is to be held, a sacrifice is made to Fricco. Adam continues that \"every nine years there is a communal festival of every province in Sweden held in Ubsola; and those already converted to Christianity have to buy themselves off from the ceremonies.\"Adam details sacrificial practices held at the temple; Adam describes that nine males of \"every living creature\" are offered up for sacrifice, and tradition dictates that their blood placates the gods. The corpses of the nine males are hung within the grove beside the temple. Adam says that the grove is considered extremely sacred to the heathens, so much so that each singular tree \"is considered to be divine,\" due to the death of those sacrificed or their rotting corpses hanging there, and that dogs and horses hang within the grove among the corpses of men. Adam reveals that \"one Christian\" informed him that he had seen seventy-two cadavers of differing species hanging within the grove. Adam expresses disgust at the songs they sing during these sacrificial rites, quipping that the songs are \"so many and disgusting that it is best to pass over them in silence.\"Adam describes that near the temple stands a massive tree with far-spreading branches, which is evergreen both in summer and winter. At the tree is also a spring where sacrifices are also held. According to Adam, a custom exists where a man, alive, is thrown into the spring, and if he fails to return to the surface, \"the wish of the people will be fulfilled.\"Adam writes that a golden chain surrounds the temple that hangs from the gables of the building. The chain is very visible to those approaching the temple from a distance due to the landscape where the temple was built; it is surrounded by hills, \"like an amphitheatre.\" The feasts and sacrifices continue for a total of nine days, and during the course of each day a man is sacrificed along with two animals. Therefore, in a total of nine days twenty-seven sacrifices occur, and, Adam notes, these sacrifices occur \"about the time of the spring equinox.\"\n\nRudolf Simek says that, regarding Adam of Bremen's account of the temple, \"Adam's sources for this information are of extremely varying reliability, but the existence of a temple at Uppsala is undisputed.\" The question is if this temple was pagan or Christian. Simek says that details of Adam's accounts have been cited as potentially influenced by the description of Solomon's Temple in the Old Testament. Simek notes, at the same time, similar chains as described by Adam appear on some European churches dating from the 8th to 9th centuries, although the description of the temple chain having been made of gold may be an exaggeration. Simek says that the numerous attempts at reconstructing the temple based on the postholes may overestimate the size of the temple, and that notes that \"more recent\" research indicates that the site of the 11th-century temple probably adjoined the choir of the church standing there today, while the postholes discovered by Lindqvist may instead point to an earlier, burnt-down temple at the same site.Building on previous critical discussions about Adam of Bremen's description of the temple by the archaeologists Harald Wideen and Olaf Olsen, Henrik Janson in his fundamental study on the European background of Adam's work, came to the conclusion that Adam used the case of Uppsala to display some of the more prominent lines of conflict at the outbreak of the investiture controversy. These lines of conflict reached deep into Scandinavia. Papacy and Empire were competing about the control of the Northern parts of Europe, and the Empire, through the Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen, claimed subjugation of the Scandinvian kingdoms under the Imperial church. These rights were however challenged by some political actors in the North, and a particularly strong resistance came from the kingdom of the Swedes where another Church, called Gallicana ecclesia by Pope Gregory VII, had the support of the Papacy. This Church can be connected to the M\u00e4lar-region and indeed Uppsala. It is not totally clear where the representatives of this \"Gallican Church\" came from, but one part of these influences can certainly be recognized in later Swedish saint lives remembering bishops from England, connected to the Cluniac reform movement, active in the M\u00e4lar-region in the 11th century - obviously in opposition to the Imperial Church of Hamburg-Bremen for which Adam of Bremen was trying to build up divine historical legitimacy. An important part of the picture is the fact that in these years it became feasible to accuse opponents of paganism even if it was obvious that they were perfectly good Christians. The key concepts here were faith, fides, meaning faithfulness, and obedience, obedientia, as was explicitly stated by Gregory VII in precisely these years: \"anyone falls into the sin of heathenism [paganitas] who, while claiming that he is a Christian, disdains to obey the apostolic see\". Previously these measures had mainly been directed against socially inferior groups \u2013 e.g. the Saxons against the Slavs and for that matter Scandinavians \u2013 but now this theological weapon was fired against the highest representatives of the Imperial Church. The first one to be hit was Archbishop Liemar of Hamburg Bremen, in whose service and defense Adam of Bremen was writing his work. Pointing to the lack of sources that could confirm Adam's description about a pagan temple in Uppsala, and bringing forth other sources, such as the over one thousand Christian rune stones in the area, showing that Christianity was well established in the there when Adam was writing, Janson concluded that the Uppsala Temple was nothing but a Christian church resisting The Sacred Roman Empire, with support from the Papacy and enemies of Henry IV that gathered around Gregory VII at the very outbreak of the Investiture contest.Orchard (1997) states that \"it is unclear to what extent Adam's description has a basis in historical fact rather than lurid fiction\" yet that Adam's account contains \"a good deal of useful information (as well as considerable speculation).\" Orchard points out that Adam's description of the temple has often been questioned \"on several levels\" and that Thietmar of Merseburg produced a considerably less detailed but similar account of sacrifices held in Lejre, Denmark earlier in the 11th century. Thietmar's account, however, concerns the religious situation in Denmark in the early 10th century, almost a century before he was writing, and he actually states that these pagan rites were extinguished in the 930's. Thus, there are good reasons to doubt that he could \"give a fair representation of pre-Christian religion\" in Scandinavia.\n\n\n== Heimskringla ==\n\nIn the Ynglinga saga compiled in Heimskringla, Snorri presents a euhemerized origin of the Norse gods and rulers descending from them. In chapter 5, Snorri asserts that the \u00e6sir settled in what is now Sweden and built various temples. Snorri writes that\n\"Odin took up his residence at the\nMaelare lake, at the place now called Old Sigtun.  There he erected a large farm shrine (hof), where there were offerings (bl\u00f3t) according to the customs of the Asaland people.  He appropriated to himself the whole of that district, and called it Sigtun.  To the shrine spirits (hofgo\u00f0unum) he gave also dwelling places.  Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r dwelt in N\u00f3at\u00fan, Frey in Upsal, Heimdal in the  Himinbergs, Thor in Thrudvang, Balder in Breidablik; to all of them he gave good estates.\"In chapter 10, after Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r has died, his son Freyr comes to power and \"he was called the king of Swedes and received tribute from them.\" Freyr's subjects loved him greatly, and he was \"blessed by good seasons like his father.\" According to the saga, Freyr \"erected a great shrine at Uppsala and made his chief residence there, directing it to all tribute due to him, both lands and chattels. This was the origin of the Uppsala crown goods, which have been kept up ever since.\"\n\n\n== Archaeological record ==\nIn 1926, Sune Lindqvist conducted archaeological investigations in Gamla Uppsala and discovered postholes beneath the church in Gamla Uppsala. These postholes may be lined up with the result of concentric rectangles, and subsequently various attempts at reconstructions of the temple have been attempted based on this discovery.\nPrice and Alkarp (2005) have been among those who dispute the 1926 interpretation:  Though still maintained today in school textbooks and elsewhere, this conclusion is clearly erroneous as the postholes can be shown stratigraphically to belong to several different phases of construction. \nUsing ground penetrating radar and other geophysical methods, Price and Alkarp found the remains of what they interpreted as a wooden construction located directly under the northern transept of the medieval cathedral, and two other buildings, one of them a Bronze Age building, and the other possibly a Viking Age feasting hall.\nOrchard (1997) says that archaeological digs in the area \"have failed to reveal anything on the scale proposed for the temple\" yet that three burial mounds at the location reveal the importance of the site.In 2013, the remains of two lines of large wooden poles were discovered. One line is approximately a kilometer long consisting of 144 poles and the other half a kilometer with each pole being separated by 5\u20136 meters. The line probably continues but was not excavated due to lack of funds. The shorter line is perpendicular to the first, located a kilometer to the south and broken into a corner which indicates that if the lines mark an enclosure, as the one at Jelling Denmark, the enclosed area would be gigantic and by far the biggest structure north of the Alps at this time. The poles were very wide and have been estimated to be at least 7 meters in length.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDomalde\nFyrisvellir\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Uppsala University (Swedish: Uppsala universitet) is a research university in Uppsala, Sweden. Founded in 1477, it is the oldest university in Sweden and all of the Nordic countries still in operation. It ranks among the world's 100 best universities in several high-profile international rankings. The university uses \"Gratiae veritas naturae\" as its motto and embraces natural sciences.\nThe university rose to pronounced significance during the rise of Sweden as a great power at the end of the 16th century and was then given a relative financial stability with the large donation of King Gustavus Adolphus in the early 17th century. Uppsala also has an important historical place in Swedish national culture, identity and for the Swedish establishment: in historiography, literature, politics, and music. Many aspects of Swedish academic culture in general, such as the white student cap, originated in Uppsala. It shares some peculiarities, such as the student nation system, with Lund University and the University of Helsinki.\nUppsala belongs to the Coimbra Group of European universities and to the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities. The university has nine faculties distributed over three \"disciplinary domains\". It has about 44,000 registered students and 2,300 doctoral students. It has a teaching staff of roughly 1,800 (part-time and full-time) out of a total of 6,900 employees. Twenty-eight per cent of the 716 professors at the university are women. Of its turnover of SEK 6.6 billion (approx. USD 775 million) in 2016, 29% was spent on education at Bachelor's and Master's level, while 70% was spent on research and research programs.Architecturally, Uppsala University has traditionally had a strong presence in Fj\u00e4rdingen, the neighbourhood around the cathedral on the western side of the River Fyris. Despite some more contemporary building developments further away from the centre, Uppsala's historic centre continues to be dominated by the presence of the university.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 15th century: origins ===\nAs with most medieval universities, Uppsala University initially grew out of an ecclesiastical center. The archbishopric of Uppsala had been one of the most important sees in Sweden proper since Christianity first spread to this region in the ninth century. Uppsala had also long been a hub for regional trade, and had contained settlements dating back into the deep Middle Ages. As was also the case with most medieval universities, Uppsala had initially been chartered through a papal bull. Uppsala's bull, which granted the university its corporate rights, was issued by Pope Sixtus IV in 1477, and established a number of provisions. Among the most important of these was that the university was officially given the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna. This included the right to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor's, master's, licentiate, and doctoral degrees. The archbishop of Uppsala was also named as the university's Chancellor, and was charged with maintaining the rights and privileges of the university and its members.\n\n\n=== 16th century: Turbulent times ===\n\nThe turbulent period of the reformation of King Gustavus Vasa resulted in a drop in the already relatively insignificant number of students in Uppsala, which was seen as a center of Catholicism and of potential disloyalty to the Crown. Swedish students generally travelled to one of the Protestant universities in Germany, especially Wittenberg. There is some evidence of academic studies in Uppsala during the 16th century; the Faculty of Theology is mentioned in a document from 1526, King Eric XIV appointed Laurentius Petri Gothus (later archbishop) rector of the university in 1566, and his successor and brother John III appointed a number of professors in the period 1569\u20131574. At the end of the century the situation had changed, and Uppsala became a bastion of Lutheranism, which Duke Charles, the third of the sons of Gustavus Vasa to eventually become king (as Charles IX) used to consolidate his power and eventually oust his nephew Sigismund from the throne. The Meeting of Uppsala in 1593 established Lutheran orthodoxy in Sweden, and Charles and the Council of state gave new privileges to the university on 1 August of the same year.\nTheology still had precedence, but in the privileges of 1593, the importance of a university to educate secular servants of the state was also emphasized. Three of the seven professorial chairs which were established were in Theology; of the other four, three were in Astronomy, Physics (or general natural sciences) and Latin eloquence. A fourth chair was given to Ericus Jacobi Skinnerus, who was also appointed rector, but whose discipline was not mentioned in the charter. Of the professors, several were taken over from the Collegium Regium in Stockholm, which had been functioning for a few years but closed in 1593. An eighth chair, in Medicine, was established in 1595 but received no appointee for several years. In 1599 the number of students was approximately 150. In 1600 the first post-reformation conferment of degrees took place. In the same year, the antiquarian and mystic Johannes Bureus designed and engraved the seal of the university, which is today used as part of the logotype.\n\n\n=== 17th century: Expansion ===\nThe medieval university had mainly been a school for theology. The aspirations of the emergent new great power of Sweden demanded a different kind of learning. Sweden both grew through conquests and went through a complete overhaul of its administrative structure. It required a much larger class of civil servants and educators than before. Preparatory schools, gymnasiums, were also founded during this period in various cathedral towns, notably V\u00e4ster\u00e5s (the first one) in 1623. Beside Uppsala, new universities were founded in more distant parts of the Swedish Realm, the University of Dorpat (present-day Tartu) in Estonia (1632) and the University of \u00c5bo in Finland (1640). After the Scanian provinces were taken from Denmark, Lund University was founded in 1666.\nInstrumental in the reforms of the early 17th-century Swedish state was the long-dominant Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, who had spent his own student days in German universities and who for the last years before his death was also chancellor of the university. King Gustavus Adolphus showed the university a keen interest and increased the professorial chairs from eight to thirteen in 1620, and again to seventeen in 1621. In 1624 the king donated \"for all eternity\" all his own inherited personal property in the provinces of Uppland and V\u00e4stmanland, some 300 farms, mills and other sources of income. The king's former private tutor, Johan Skytte, who was made chancellor of the university in 1622, donated the Skyttean chair in Eloquence and Government which still exists. The university received a stable structure with its constitution of 1626. The head of the university was to be the chancellor, his deputy was the \"pro-chancellor\" (always the archbishop ex officio). The immediate rule was the responsibility of the consistory, to which belonged all the professors of the university, and the rector magnificus, who was elected for a semester at the time; the latter position circulated among the professors, each of whom sometimes held it several times.\nDuring the late 16th and early 17th centuries (and perhaps even earlier), the university was located to the old chapter house parallel to the south side of the cathedral, later renamed the Academia Carolina. In 1622\u20131625 a new university building was built east of the cathedral, the so-called Gustavianum, named after the reigning king. In the 1630s, the total number of students were about one thousand.\n\nQueen Christina was generous to the university, gave scholarships to Swedish students to study abroad and recruited foreign scholars to Uppsala chairs, among them several from the University of Strassburg, notably the philologist Johannes Schefferus (professor skytteanus), whose little library and museum building at S:t Eriks torg now belongs to the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala. The Queen, who would eventually declare her abdication in the great hall of Uppsala Castle, visited the university on many occasions; in 1652 she was present at an anatomical demonstration arranged at the castle for the young physician Olaus Rudbeck. Rudbeck, one of several sons of Johannes Rudbeckius, a former Uppsala professor who became Bishop of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, was sent for a year to the progressive University of Leiden in the Netherlands. Returning in 1654, he received an assistantship in Medicine in 1655, and had already gone to work on a program of improving aspects of the university. He planted the first botanical garden, the one which would eventually be tended by Carl Linnaeus and is kept today as a museum of 18th century botany under the name Linnaeus' Garden. With the patronage of the university chancellor Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, Rudbeck was made full professor in 1660, was elected rector for two terms, despite his youth, and started a revision of the work of the other professors and a building spree with himself as architect. His most significant remaining architectural work is the anatomical theatre, which was added to Gustavianum in the 1660s and crowned with the characteristic cupola for which the building is today known.\nA gifted scientist, architect and engineer, Rudbeck was the dominant personality of the university in the late 17th century who laid some of the groundwork for Linnaeus and others, but he is perhaps more known today for the pseudohistorical speculations of his Atlantica, which consumed much of his later life. When large parts of Uppsala burned down in 1702, Gustavianum, which contained the university library and its many valuable manuscripts, escaped the fire; local lore has it that the aging Rudbeck stood on the roof directing the work of fighting the fire.\n\n\n=== 18th century: Enlightenment and mercantilism ===\nThe early part of the 18th century was still characterized by the combination of Lutheran orthodoxy and classical philology of the previous century, but eventually a larger emphasis on sciences and practically useful knowledge developed. The innovative mathematician and physicist Samuel Klingenstierna (1698\u20131765) was made a professor in 1728, the physicist and astronomer Anders Celsius in 1729, and Carl Linnaeus was made professor of Medicine with Botany in 1741. The university was not immune to the parliamentary struggle between the parties known as the \"Hats\" and the \"Caps\", with the former having a preference for hard sciences and practical knowledge. The Hat government then in power established a chair in economics (\u0152conomia publica) in 1741 and called Anders Berch as its first incumbent. This was the first professorship in economics outside Germany, and possibly the third in Europe (the first chairs having been established in Halle and Frankfurt (Oder) in 1727). In 1759, following a donation, another chair in economy was established, the Borgstr\u00f6mian professorship in \"practical economy\", by which was meant the practical application of the natural sciences for economic purposes (it eventually developed into a chair for physiological botany).\nThere were very radical attempts at reforms which were never implemented, but important changes took place. University studies had until this time been very informal in their overall organization, with the all-purpose philosophi\u00e6 magister-degree being the only one frequently conferred and many never graduating, as there were no degree applicable to their intended area of work (and well-connected aristocratic students often not graduating as they did not need to). A few professional degrees for various purposes were introduced in 1749\u20131750, but the radical suggestion of binding students to a single program of study adapted to a particular profession was never implemented. The reforms of this era have been compared to those of the 1960s and 1970s (Sten Lindroth).\nAlthough it took some time after the fire of 1702, Uppsala Cathedral and Uppsala Castle were both eventually restored, both by Carl H\u00e5rleman, perhaps the most important Swedish architect of the era. He also modified Gustavianum, designed a new conservatory for Linnaeus' botanical garden and built the new Consistory house, which was to be the administrative core of the university.\nAnother magnificent royal donation was that of the large baroque garden of the castle, given by Gustavus III to the university when it was obvious that the old botanical garden was insufficient. A large new conservatory was built by the architect Louis Jean Desprez. Additional grounds adjacent to the baroque garden has since been added. The old garden of Rudbeck and Linnaeus was largely left to decay, but was reconstructed in the years between 1918 and 1923 according to the specifications of Linnaeus in his work Hortus Upsaliensis from 1745.\n\n\n=== Women at the university ===\nThe issue of women's right to study at universities was raised during the very last session of the estate parliament in 1865 in a motion from Carl Johan Svens\u00e9n, a member of the farmers' estate. The reception was mixed, with the most negative views coming from the clergy. In the following years the issue continued to be debated at the universities. In 1870, it was decided to let women take the secondary school examination (\"studentexamen\") that gave the right to entry at universities and the right to study and complete degrees at the faculties of Medicine in Uppsala and Lund and at the Caroline Institute of Medicine and Surgery in Stockholm. A common view was that the female sensitivity and compassion would make women capable of working as physicians, but their right to work was still restricted to private practice. Women's rights to higher education was extended in 1873, when all degrees except those in the faculties of theology and the licentiate degree in Law were made accessible for women.\nThe first female student in Sweden was Betty Pettersson (1838\u20131885), who had already worked as a private tutor for several years when she took \"studentexamen\" in 1871. With a royal dispensation, she was allowed to enter university in Uppsala in 1872, the year before studies at the Philosophical faculty would actually be made generally available to women. She studied modern European languages and was the first woman in Sweden to complete an academic degree when she finished a fil. kand. in 1875. She became the first woman to be employed as a teacher in a public school for boys. The first woman in Sweden to complete a doctoral degree was Ellen Fries (1855\u20131900), who entered Uppsala university in 1877 and became a PhD in history in 1883. Other female students of this period includes Lydia Wahlstr\u00f6m (1869\u20131954) who later became a noted educator, activist and writer on women's emancipation and suffrage. Defending a dissertation in history in 1900, she became the second woman to finish a doctorate at a Swedish university. In 1892, she founded the Uppsala Women's Student Association, who set up spex performances and other things enjoyed by male students but from which the women were excluded at the time. The members of the Association were the first woman to wear the student caps in public, an important sign of their status. Elsa Eschelsson (1861\u20131911) was the first Swedish woman to finish a law degree, and the first to become a \"docent\", but was not permitted to even hold the position of acting professor despite being formally qualified for this in everything but her sex. After years of conflicts with the professor of civil law A. O. Winroth, who wrote the paper on \"Om tjenstehjonsf\u00f6rh\u00e5llandet\" and with the university board, she died in 1911 from an overdose of sleeping-powder.\nAccording to the constitution of 1809, only \"native Swedish men\" could be appointed to higher civil servant positions, including professorships. This was changed in 1925, and the first woman to hold a professorial chair at Uppsala University was Gerd Enequist, appointed professor of human geography in 1949.\nHildegard Bj\u00f6rck who studied in the university became the first Swedish woman to receive an academic degree.\n\n\n== Administration and organisation ==\n\n\n=== Central administration ===\nThe governing board of the university is the consistory, with representatives of the faculties as well as members representing the students and non-academic employees (three professors and three students), and ten university outsiders appointed by the Swedish government. All these members in the consistory have the right to vote.\nThe unions active at the university also have three representatives in the consistory; these members have the right to speak but not any right to vote.\nSince the last reorganization in 1999 the university has a separate body called the academic senate, which is a wider, but mostly advisory group representing teaching staff / researchers and students. The executive head of the university is the rector magnificus, whose deputy is the prorector. There are (also since 1999) three vice rectors, each heading one of the three \"disciplinary domains\" (Arts and Social Sciences, Medicine and Pharmacy, and Science and Technology) into which the nine faculties are divided. Each faculty has a faculty board and is headed by a dean (dekanus). The position of dean is held part-time by a professor of the faculty.\n\n\n=== Faculties ===\nThrough division of faculties and the addition of a previously independent school of Pharmacy as a new faculty, the traditional four-faculty organization of European universities has evolved into the present nine faculties:\n\nThe disciplinary domain of Arts and Social Sciences includes the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Social Sciences, the Faculty of Languages, the Faculty of Theology, the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Educational Sciences (formerly the Department of Education, that was raised to the status of a faculty in its own right in 2002).\nThe disciplinary domain of Medicine and Pharmacy includes the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Pharmacy. The Faculty of Pharmacy was originally an independent \"royal institute\" in Stockholm, which was moved to Uppsala and incorporated with the university between 1968 and 1972.\nThe disciplinary domain of Science and Technology includes only the Faculty of Science and Technology. The engineering programs have from 1982 been marketed as the Uppsala School of Engineering (Uppsala Tekniska H\u00f6gskola). This has however never been a separate institution, but only a unit within the Faculty of Science and Technology and use of the term has been phased out after the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was renamed the Faculty of Sciences and Technology in the 1990s.Uppsala University also hosts the Forum for South Asia Studies, a collaborative academic effort by its six faculties: Theology, Law, History and Philosophy, Social Sciences, Languages, and Educational Sciences. The Forum aims facilitate and promote research and education related to the South Asian countries: India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, the Maldives and Afghanistan, on the national and international level, with Ferdinando Sardella, Faculty of Theology, serving as the Forum's director.\n\n\n=== Faculty of Law ===\nThe Faculty of Law (Juridiska fakulteten) is the oldest one in the Nordic countries and existed before 1477 (when the University of Uppsala was founded).\nThe activities of the faculty include a wide range of research areas and specializations. This Faculty has one department: the Department of Law.\n\n\n=== University Library ===\n\nThe university library holds about 5.25 million volumes of books and periodicals (131,293 shelf meters), 61,959 manuscripts, 7,133 music prints, and 345,734 maps and other graphic documents. The holdings of the collection of manuscripts and music includes, among other things, the Gothic Bible manuscript Codex Argenteus.\n\nThe most widely recognized building of the university library is Carolina Rediviva, the \"revived Carolina\", thus named in reference to Academia Carolina (see illustration), which held the university library from the earliest times until 1691, when it was moved to the upper floor of Gustavianum, where it miraculously survived the great city fire of 1702. In the mid-18th century, there were plans to move it back to the Academia Carolina or a new building on the same spot. The building was demolished in 1778 to make place for a new library, but this was never built and the area next to the cathedral where it stood is today a lawn. The present Carolina Rediviva was built in a different place and completed in 1841.\nThe present university library system comprises 19 branches, including the one in the Carolina building.\n\n\n=== Uppsala University Hospital ===\n\nThe Uppsala Academic Hospital or Akademiska sjukhuset, which functions as a teaching hospital for the Faculty of Medicine and the Nursing School, is run by the Uppsala County Council in cooperation with the university. As of 2003, the hospital had 7,719 employees and as of 2004 1,079 places for patients.\nThe university hospital is actually older than the university, as it goes back to the earliest hospital, founded in Uppsala in 1302, much later merged with the university clinic. This was used for 400 years until the great fire of 1702 which destroyed large parts of central Uppsala. A new hospital, which later became the Uppsala county hospital, was built in its place, but was moved out of the town in 1811.\n\nThe first clinic with the specific intention to facilitate the practical education of medical students was the Nosocomium Academicum, founded in 1708 and located to the Oxenstierna Palace at Riddartorget beside the cathedral (see illustration above). The building (the former residence of the President of the Royal Chancellery Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna) today houses the Faculty of Law.\nThe present Akademiska sjukhuset was founded in 1850 as an organizational merger of the county hospital and the university clinic, and a new building was inaugurated in 1867 on the hill below Uppsala Castle to the southeast. From this building, which is still in use, the present hospital complex has grown.\n\n\n=== The Svedberg Laboratory ===\nThe Svedberg Laboratory (named after Theodore The Svedberg) is a university facility that contains the Gustaf Werner cyclotron, which is used for research as well as for proton therapy for the treatment of cancer with close cooperation with the oncology clinic at Uppsala University Hospital. Such an accelerator and its gantries costs between $60 million and $100 million, and makes Uppsala University Hospital one of the approximately 40 centers in the world to provide such cancer treatment.\n\n\n== Campus ==\nThe buildings and locations where the university has activities or which are significantly connected to its history are listed below. Some of the historic buildings in central Uppsala have had to be retired, as their protected status has made it impossible to make modifications necessary to meet requirements to adjust to the needs for students with disabilities.\n\nUniversity Park and Cathedral area\n\nGustavianum\nThe Old Consistory building\nThe University Hall\nThe Ekerman House\nThe Dean's House (or Julinsk\u00f6ld Palace)\nSkytteanum\nThe Oxenstierna House (Juridicum \u2013 Faculty of Law)\nRegnellianum\nCarolina RedivivaWest of Central Uppsala\n\nEnglish Park Campus \u2013 Centre for the Humanities (including the Centre for Language Studies)\nCentre for Evolutionary Biology (EBC) including the Museum of Evolution\nUniversity of Uppsala Botanical Garden\nSegerstedthuset \u2013 administrative building\nBl\u00e5senhus - Centre for pedagogy, didactics, educational studies and psychologyOther locations in wider Central Uppsala\n\nTheatrum Oeconomicum and Gamla Torget (\"The Old Forum\")\nThe Observatory Park with the old observatory\nCentre for Economic Sciences (Ekonomikum)\nThe Linnaeus Garden\nAnders Celsius's former house and observatory\nSouth of central Uppsala\n\nUppsala University Hospital\nThe Rudbeck Laboratory\nUppsala Biomedical Centre (BMC)\nGeo Centre\nInformation Technology Centre (ITC) Pollax\nThe \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m LaboratoryNorth of Central Uppsala\n\nTeacher TrainingOutside of Uppsala\n\nCampus Gotland\n\n\n=== Ekonomikum ===\nEkonomikum is a building that is part of Uppsala University. The building, designed by Swedish modernist architect Peter Celsing, was completed in 1976, and housed departments for languages, humanities, and social sciences.\nSince the early 2000s, Ekonomikum is a multidisciplinary centre specialized in economics and financial studies, information science, and human geography. It has approximately 2,500 students and 500 faculty and staff members, a library, KPH print shop, a restaurant, and several students' associations.\n\n\n== Student life ==\n\n\n=== Nations and student union ===\n\nUp until June 2010 students at Uppsala University were obliged to become members of one of the nations, corporations of students traditionally according to province of origin (not strictly upheld now, for practical reasons). The system of dividing students into nations according to origin can ultimately be traced back to the nations at the medieval University of Paris and other early medieval universities, but the Uppsala nations appear only about 1630\u20131640, most likely under influence of the Landsmannschaften which existed at some of the German universities visited by Swedish students. In Sweden, nations exist only in Uppsala and Lund. The nations were originally seen as subversive organisations promoting less virtuous aspects of student life, but in 1663 the consistory made membership in a nation legal, each nation being placed under the inspectorship of a professor.\nThe current thirteen nations all have a history stretching back to the early-to-mid 17th century, but some of them are the result of mergers of older, smaller nations that took place in the early 19th century to facilitate the financing of building projects.\nThe nations at Uppsala University are:\n\nSince the 1960s there is a fourteenth nation, the Sk\u00e5nelandens nation (referring to the Scanian lands) which has no membership fee and exists as a legal device to get around the compulsory membership for students who prefer not to become affiliated with the traditional nations.\nThe Uppsala Student Union was founded in 1849 as a corporation representing all students except those attending the faculty of Pharmacy, irrespective of nation. The students at the faculty of Pharmacy were also exempt from the compulsory membership in the nations, but most pharmacy-students belonged to one. However they were obliged to take up membership in the Pharmaceutical Association of Uppsala Students, an organisation having the same role as the nations and the student union at the rest of the university.\nThe compulsory membership in a student union was abolished 1 July 2010; however, the unions will still be the representing organisations in the university boards and committees. The status as a student union will be decided upon by the university board for periods of three years at a time. In a decision by the university board February 20, 2013, there will be four student unions at the university during July 2013 \u2013 June 2016: the Uppsala Student Union (for students at the faculties of Art, Social Sciences, Languages, Theology, Law, Educational Sciences and Medicine), the Pharmaceutical Association of Uppsala Students (for students at the Faculty of Pharmacy), the Uppsala Union of Engineering and Science Students (at the Faculty of Science and Technology), and Rindi (the union for students at Campus Gotland).\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe University's Royal Academic Orchestra was founded in 1627. Its main purpose is to play at academic ceremonies, but holds concerts on other occasions as well. Its leader has the title of director musices. The position has been held by composers such as Wilhelm Stenhammar, Hugo Alfv\u00e9n and Lars-Erik Larsson. Affiliated with the University are three choirs, the mixed Uppsala University Choir (Allm\u00e4nna S\u00e5ngen), founded in 1830, the male choir Orphei Dr\u00e4ngar, founded in 1853, and the Academy Chamber Choir of Uppsala, founded in 1957. A number of other choirs and orchestras are affiliated with the nations.\nAn important name in the recent history of the choirs is Eric Ericson, who was conductor of both Orphei Dr\u00e4ngar and the Chamber Choir. In honour of Ericson, the F\u00f6reningsSparbanken endowed the Eric Ericson Chair in Choral Directing, and the Uppsala University Choral Centre was inaugurated in 2000. The centre arranges courses in choral directing.[1]\n\n\n=== Housing crisis ===\nLike many cities there is a shortage of housing in Uppsala, a problem which has existed for many years. Both native Swedes and foreign students are finding it difficult to find accommodation when first enrolling into the university. This problem is however not as bad as it was with several major housing construction projects having been completed after 2010.There has never been a custom in Sweden for the universities to arrange housing for students, in fact universities are not allowed by law to own housing. Students are expected to arrange their own living accommodations on the private market. To make it easier for students to find moderately priced housing, special student rooms and student apartments have been built by the student nations and student unions. However, the student housing is insufficient to accommodate all students. About 40,000 students are eligible to live in the 11,000 available rooms and apartments. Because of the low rent in these apartments and the general lack of housing in Uppsala the student apartments are highly attractive and many try to hold on to the contracts as long as possible even after graduating.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\nOne of the most popular housing accommodations for the students are Flogsta, Kantorsgatan, Studentstaden, Studentv\u00e4gen, Klostergatan, Rackarbergsgatan and many more. \nFlogsta is one of the biggest and most popular housing choice for international students.\n\n\n== Athletics ==\nSports play a very small role in the life of the university, compared to British and especially U.S. universities, but have existed in various forms since the early 17th century. Uppsala University is more noted for its musical and choral traditions. Both have partial roots in the 17th century institution of extracurricular exercises for students from the nobility.\n\n\n=== The exercitiae ===\n\nTo ease the recruitment of students from the nobility, the university started in the 1630s to offer training in a number of exercitiae or \"exercises\" (Swedish: exercitier) deemed necessary for the well-rounded education of a young nobleman: riding, fencing, dance, drawing and modern languages such as French and Italian. The initiative came from Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, who saw the value in a well-educated class of civil servants and the danger to his own class if its members would fall behind in academic education compared to those students who came from the lower estates. An \"exercise yard\", built for the riding and fencing exercises, was demolished in the late 19th century to give place to the new University Hall. The modern languages were made part of the regular academic curriculum in the 19th century. The surviving \"exercises\" include:\n\nFencing \u2013 Arranged in collaboration with Upsala F\u00e4ktning, a private fencing club. Fencing master as of 2005 is Igor Tsikinjov, captain of the Swedish Fencing Federation\nGymnastics and sports \u2013 Located to the Art Nouveau University Gymnastics Hall, colloquially known as Svettis (from the Swedish word for sweat)\nRiding \u2013 Arranged by the equestrian department of the University, which has its own stables. Leaders of the activities are the Academy Stable Master and the Inspector Equitandi\nMusic \u2013 Leader of the musical activities is the director musices, who is the conductor of the Royal Academic Orchestra; the current Director Musices is Professor Stefan Karpe\nDrawing \u2013 The university appoints an established artist as Drawing Master; free weekly croquis and other lessons are offered in the southern tower of Uppsala Castle\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\nBesides the exercitiae, other sports have had a presence in Uppsala student life. The Upsala Sims\u00e4llskap, \"Uppsala Swimming Society\", which is the oldest swimming club in the world, was founded in 1796 by the mathematician J\u00f6ns Svanberg. It had no formal connection to the university, but all its earliest members came from academic life. Svanberg even arranged a mock graduation ceremony, a simpromotion, in parody of the university ceremonies, where those who had graduated from its swimming training were awarded \"degrees\" of master (magister) and bachelor (kandidat). These degrees stuck, and Swedish swimming schools still use these degrees for different levels of swimming skills.\nAn attempt was made in the 1870s to introduce academic rowing after the Oxbridge model. The Stockholm Nation acquired a rowing boat in 1877, soon followed by the Gothenburg Nation, and for a number of years rowing competitions were held between teams from the two nations. Although rowing never got the strong position it has at the English universities, an annual Uppsala-Lund regatta has been arranged since 1992, between rowing teams from Uppsala and Lund University. The race is held on the Fyris River in Uppsala on even years, and on a river in the vicinity of Lund on odd years. Each year there is at least one full eight crew with cox competing, with both men's and women's teams present. With the recent victory for Uppsala in 2005, the score stands 24\u201323 in Uppsala's favor.\n\n\n== Rankings ==\nUppsala University places well in many rankings. For over ten years, it has been ranked among the 80 best universities in the world the Academic Ranking of World Universities.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nUppsala University is associated with 8 Nobel Prize laureates, and numerous royalty, academics and public figures.\nAs the dominant academic institution in Sweden for several centuries, Uppsala University has educated a large proportion of Swedish politicians and civil servants ever since its first period of expansion in the early part of the 17th century. These range from Chancellor of the Realm (rikskansler) Johan Oxenstierna (1611\u20131657) and Lord Chief Justice (riksdrots) Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie (1622\u20131686) to the first Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden, Hjalmar Branting (1860\u20131925). Other alumni are Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld (1905\u20131961), United Nations Secretary General who was (posthumously) awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1961, and the Swedish diplomat Hans Blix (born 1928), who was Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency 1981\u20131997, of the UNMOVIC 2000\u20132003, and previously Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs 1978\u20131979. Hammarskj\u00f6ld and Blix both graduated from the Uppsala Faculty of Law, as did the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh, who was assassinated in 2003.\nMost Swedish clergymen, including most bishops and archbishops, have been educated at the university, including, in more recent times, Nathan S\u00f6derblom (1866\u20131931), Professor of the History of Religions in the Faculty of Theology, later Archbishop of Uppsala, and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1930 for his work as leader of the ecumenical movement.\nThe university became prominent in the sciences in the 18th century with names such as the physician and botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707\u20131778), the father of biological and mineralogical taxonomy, and his numerous important pupils, the physicist and astronomer Anders Celsius (1701\u20131744), inventor of the Celsius scale the predecessor of the Celsius scale, and the chemist Torbern Bergman (1735\u20131784). Another scientist from this era is Emanuel Swedenborg (1688\u20131772), better remembered today as a religious mystic. Several of the elements were discovered by Uppsala scientists during this period or later. J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius, one of the fathers of modern chemistry, received his doctorate in medicine in Uppsala in 1804, but later moved to Stockholm. Uppsala scientists of the 19th century include the physicist Anders Jonas \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m (1814\u20131874). During the 20th century several Nobel laureates in the sciences have been Uppsala alumni or professors at the university.\nMany well-known Swedish writers have studied in Uppsala: Georg Stiernhielm (1598\u20131672) is often called the father of Swedish poetry. The poet and song composer Carl Michael Bellman (1740\u20131795), without doubt the best-loved and best-remembered of Swedish 18th-century poets, matriculated but left the university after less than a year. The writer, historian and composer Erik Gustaf Geijer (1783\u20131847), professor of history, and the poet Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom (1790\u20131855), professor of poetry, were principal figures of early 19th-century Swedish romanticism. The less than happy experiences of the Uppsala student life of novelist and playwright August Strindberg (1849\u20131912), resulted in his Fr\u00e5n Fj\u00e4rdingen och Svartb\u00e4cken (1877), a collection of short stories set in Uppsala (\"From Fj\u00e4rdingen and Svartb\u00e4cken\", the title refers to two districts in Uppsala). Other Uppsala alumni are the poet Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1864\u20131931), who refused the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1918, but received it posthumously in 1931, the novelist and playwright P\u00e4r Lagerkvist (1891\u20131974), Nobel laureate in 1951, and the poet and novelist Karin Boye (1900\u20131941), for whom one branch of the university library has been named. The Communist leader Ture Nerman (1886\u20131969) wrote a novel called Olympen, based on his experience as a student in Uppsala. Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, co-founder of KaZaA and Skype is also a former student at Uppsala University. On 15 August 2008 Zennstr\u00f6m donated 15 million SEK to Uppsala University for climate research. The late Jan Stenbeck, a Nordic media mogul who controlled Modern Times Group, was also an alumnus of Uppsala University.\n\n\n== International cooperation ==\n\nUppsala University has signed student exchange agreements with about 400 universities across all parts of the world. It takes part in the Erasmus programme and the Nordplus programme. It also benefits from its membership of the Coimbra Group of universities.\nIn May 2010 Uppsala joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Dartmouth College (USA), Durham University (UK), Queen's University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of T\u00fcbingen (Germany), and University of Western Australia (Australia).\n\n\n== In fiction and popular culture ==\nAlong with Lund, Uppsala is the historic and traditional centre of Swedish academic life, making it a popular object of reference in Swedish literature, art, and film. Specifically, Uppsala University has appeared notably in M\u00e4n som hatar kvinnor or The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson.\nThe Norwegian pop singer Kirsti Sparboe dedicated one of her biggest successes to Uppsala University, publishing in 1969 the song \"Ein Student aus Uppsala\". The song, originally written in German, lasted 14 weeks in the German charts.\nUppsala University appears as a research centre in the strategy game Empire: Total War.\nUppsala University appears in the novel S. by Doug Dorst and J. J. Abrams. The fictional author V. M. Straka of Ship of Theseus sends Mr. Grahn a confidential letter on Uppsala Universitet letterhead and stamps his signature with \"Straka Uppsala Arkiv\" (included as an insert to the book).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of medieval universities\nList of universities in Sweden\nSwedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala\nJohannelunds Teologiska H\u00f6gskola in Uppsala\nFlogsta \u2013 student residential area in Uppsala\nCategory:Uppsala University alumni\nS*, a collaboration between seven universities and the Karolinska Institutet for training in bioinformatics and genomics\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLindroth, Sten.

Theories have been proposed about the implications of the descriptions of the temple and the findings (or lack thereof) of the archaeological excavations in the area, along with recent findings of extensive wooden structures and log lines that may have played a supporting role to activities at the site, including ritual sacrifice.\n\n\n== Adam of Bremen ==\nIn Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum, Adam of Bremen provides a description of the temple. Adam records that a \"very famous temple called Ubsola\" exists in a town close to Sigtuna. Adam details that the temple is \"adorned with gold\" and that the people there worship statues of three specific gods that sit on a triple throne. Thor, whom Adam refers to as \"the mightiest,\" sits in the central throne, while Wodan (Odin) and Fricco (Freyr) are seated on the thrones to the sides of him. Adam provides information about the characteristics of the three gods, including that Fricco is depicted with an immense erect penis, Wodan in armor (\"as our people depict Mars,\" Adam notes) and that Thor has a mace, a detail which Adam compares to that of the Roman god Jupiter. Adam adds that, in addition, \"they also worship gods who were once men, whom they reckon to be immortal because of their heroic acts [...].\"Adam says that the three gods have a priest appointed to them each who offer up sacrifices to the deities from the people. If famine or plague occurs, a sacrifice is made to Thor; if there is war, a sacrifice is made to Wodan; if a marriage is to be held, a sacrifice is made to Fricco. Adam continues that \"every nine years there is a communal festival of every province in Sweden held in Ubsola; and those already converted to Christianity have to buy themselves off from the ceremonies.\"Adam details sacrificial practices held at the temple; Adam describes that nine males of \"every living creature\" are offered up for sacrifice, and tradition dictates that their blood placates the gods. The corpses of the nine males are hung within the grove beside the temple. Adam says that the grove is considered extremely sacred to the heathens, so much so that each singular tree \"is considered to be divine,\" due to the death of those sacrificed or their rotting corpses hanging there, and that dogs and horses hang within the grove among the corpses of men. Adam reveals that \"one Christian\" informed him that he had seen seventy-two cadavers of differing species hanging within the grove. Adam expresses disgust at the songs they sing during these sacrificial rites, quipping that the songs are \"so many and disgusting that it is best to pass over them in silence.\"Adam describes that near the temple stands a massive tree with far-spreading branches, which is evergreen both in summer and winter. At the tree is also a spring where sacrifices are also held. According to Adam, a custom exists where a man, alive, is thrown into the spring, and if he fails to return to the surface, \"the wish of the people will be fulfilled.\"Adam writes that a golden chain surrounds the temple that hangs from the gables of the building. The chain is very visible to those approaching the temple from a distance due to the landscape where the temple was built; it is surrounded by hills, \"like an amphitheatre.\" The feasts and sacrifices continue for a total of nine days, and during the course of each day a man is sacrificed along with two animals. Therefore, in a total of nine days twenty-seven sacrifices occur, and, Adam notes, these sacrifices occur \"about the time of the spring equinox.\"\n\nRudolf Simek says that, regarding Adam of Bremen's account of the temple, \"Adam's sources for this information are of extremely varying reliability, but the existence of a temple at Uppsala is undisputed.\" The question is if this temple was pagan or Christian. Simek says that details of Adam's accounts have been cited as potentially influenced by the description of Solomon's Temple in the Old Testament. Simek notes, at the same time, similar chains as described by Adam appear on some European churches dating from the 8th to 9th centuries, although the description of the temple chain having been made of gold may be an exaggeration. Simek says that the numerous attempts at reconstructing the temple based on the postholes may overestimate the size of the temple, and that notes that \"more recent\" research indicates that the site of the 11th-century temple probably adjoined the choir of the church standing there today, while the postholes discovered by Lindqvist may instead point to an earlier, burnt-down temple at the same site.Building on previous critical discussions about Adam of Bremen's description of the temple by the archaeologists Harald Wideen and Olaf Olsen, Henrik Janson in his fundamental study on the European background of Adam's work, came to the conclusion that Adam used the case of Uppsala to display some of the more prominent lines of conflict at the outbreak of the investiture controversy. These lines of conflict reached deep into Scandinavia. Papacy and Empire were competing about the control of the Northern parts of Europe, and the Empire, through the Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen, claimed subjugation of the Scandinvian kingdoms under the Imperial church. These rights were however challenged by some political actors in the North, and a particularly strong resistance came from the kingdom of the Swedes where another Church, called Gallicana ecclesia by Pope Gregory VII, had the support of the Papacy. This Church can be connected to the M\u00e4lar-region and indeed Uppsala. It is not totally clear where the representatives of this \"Gallican Church\" came from, but one part of these influences can certainly be recognized in later Swedish saint lives remembering bishops from England, connected to the Cluniac reform movement, active in the M\u00e4lar-region in the 11th century - obviously in opposition to the Imperial Church of Hamburg-Bremen for which Adam of Bremen was trying to build up divine historical legitimacy. An important part of the picture is the fact that in these years it became feasible to accuse opponents of paganism even if it was obvious that they were perfectly good Christians. The key concepts here were faith, fides, meaning faithfulness, and obedience, obedientia, as was explicitly stated by Gregory VII in precisely these years: \"anyone falls into the sin of heathenism [paganitas] who, while claiming that he is a Christian, disdains to obey the apostolic see\". Previously these measures had mainly been directed against socially inferior groups \u2013 e.g. the Saxons against the Slavs and for that matter Scandinavians \u2013 but now this theological weapon was fired against the highest representatives of the Imperial Church. The first one to be hit was Archbishop Liemar of Hamburg Bremen, in whose service and defense Adam of Bremen was writing his work. Pointing to the lack of sources that could confirm Adam's description about a pagan temple in Uppsala, and bringing forth other sources, such as the over one thousand Christian rune stones in the area, showing that Christianity was well established in the there when Adam was writing, Janson concluded that the Uppsala Temple was nothing but a Christian church resisting The Sacred Roman Empire, with support from the Papacy and enemies of Henry IV that gathered around Gregory VII at the very outbreak of the Investiture contest.Orchard (1997) states that \"it is unclear to what extent Adam's description has a basis in historical fact rather than lurid fiction\" yet that Adam's account contains \"a good deal of useful information (as well as considerable speculation).\" Orchard points out that Adam's description of the temple has often been questioned \"on several levels\" and that Thietmar of Merseburg produced a considerably less detailed but similar account of sacrifices held in Lejre, Denmark earlier in the 11th century. Thietmar's account, however, concerns the religious situation in Denmark in the early 10th century, almost a century before he was writing, and he actually states that these pagan rites were extinguished in the 930's. Thus, there are good reasons to doubt that he could \"give a fair representation of pre-Christian religion\" in Scandinavia.\n\n\n== Heimskringla ==\n\nIn the Ynglinga saga compiled in Heimskringla, Snorri presents a euhemerized origin of the Norse gods and rulers descending from them. In chapter 5, Snorri asserts that the \u00e6sir settled in what is now Sweden and built various temples. Snorri writes that\n\"Odin took up his residence at the\nMaelare lake, at the place now called Old Sigtun.  There he erected a large farm shrine (hof), where there were offerings (bl\u00f3t) according to the customs of the Asaland people.  He appropriated to himself the whole of that district, and called it Sigtun.  To the shrine spirits (hofgo\u00f0unum) he gave also dwelling places.  Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r dwelt in N\u00f3at\u00fan, Frey in Upsal, Heimdal in the  Himinbergs, Thor in Thrudvang, Balder in Breidablik; to all of them he gave good estates.\"In chapter 10, after Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r has died, his son Freyr comes to power and \"he was called the king of Swedes and received tribute from them.\" Freyr's subjects loved him greatly, and he was \"blessed by good seasons like his father.\" According to the saga, Freyr \"erected a great shrine at Uppsala and made his chief residence there, directing it to all tribute due to him, both lands and chattels. This was the origin of the Uppsala crown goods, which have been kept up ever since.\"\n\n\n== Archaeological record ==\nIn 1926, Sune Lindqvist conducted archaeological investigations in Gamla Uppsala and discovered postholes beneath the church in Gamla Uppsala. These postholes may be lined up with the result of concentric rectangles, and subsequently various attempts at reconstructions of the temple have been attempted based on this discovery.\nPrice and Alkarp (2005) have been among those who dispute the 1926 interpretation:  Though still maintained today in school textbooks and elsewhere, this conclusion is clearly erroneous as the postholes can be shown stratigraphically to belong to several different phases of construction. \nUsing ground penetrating radar and other geophysical methods, Price and Alkarp found the remains of what they interpreted as a wooden construction located directly under the northern transept of the medieval cathedral, and two other buildings, one of them a Bronze Age building, and the other possibly a Viking Age feasting hall.\nOrchard (1997) says that archaeological digs in the area \"have failed to reveal anything on the scale proposed for the temple\" yet that three burial mounds at the location reveal the importance of the site.In 2013, the remains of two lines of large wooden poles were discovered. One line is approximately a kilometer long consisting of 144 poles and the other half a kilometer with each pole being separated by 5\u20136 meters. The line probably continues but was not excavated due to lack of funds. The shorter line is perpendicular to the first, located a kilometer to the south and broken into a corner which indicates that if the lines mark an enclosure, as the one at Jelling Denmark, the enclosed area would be gigantic and by far the biggest structure north of the Alps at this time. The poles were very wide and have been estimated to be at least 7 meters in length.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDomalde\nFyrisvellir\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The graves and the museum gives a good learning experience about vikings if you are interested in that. The old church is also nice. But, I think the best experience is to walk around the area and maybe up to the hill beside the graves. It is also allowed to walk on the grave",

        "wiki": "Uppsala Cathedral (Swedish: Uppsala domkyrka) is a cathedral located between the University Hall of Uppsala University and the Fyris river in the centre of Uppsala, Sweden. A church of the Church of Sweden, the national church, in the Lutheran tradition, Uppsala Cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Uppsala, the primate of Sweden. It is also the burial site of King Eric IX (c. 1120\u20131160, reigned 1156\u20131160), who became the patron saint of the nation, and it was the traditional location for the coronation of new Kings of Sweden.\nThe current archbishop is Antje Jackel\u00e9n and the current bishop is Karin Johannesson.\nThe cathedral dates to the late 13th century and, at a height of 118.7 metres (389 ft), it is the tallest church in the Nordic countries. Originally built under Roman Catholicism, it was used for coronations of Swedish monarchs for a lengthy period following the Protestant Reformation. Several of its chapels were converted to house the tombs of Swedish monarchs, including Gustav Vasa and John III. Carl Linnaeus, Olaus Rudbeck, Emanuel Swedenborg, and several archbishops are also buried here.\nThe church was designed in the French Gothic style by French architects including \u00c9tienne de Bonneuil. It is in the form of a cross formed by the nave and transept. Most of the structure was built between 1272 and 1420 but the western end was completed only in the middle of the 15th century. Twin towers were built shortly afterwards on the west end of the church. High spires were added later, but after a fire in 1702, they were adorned with low helms by Carl H\u00e5rleman in 1735. They were completely redesigned by Helgo Zetterwall who undertook substantial changes to the building in the 1880s. The cathedral's principal construction material is brick but the pillars and many details are of Gotland limestone.\nThe vaults were all built according to the original 13th-century plan although some of them were erected as late as around 1440. In addition to the artwork in the funeral chapels, several of the church's older furnishings can be seen in the Treasury Museum. In 1702, many features were destroyed in a major fire. During the renovation work carried out in the 1970s, many of the medieval frescoes which had been whitewashed over after the Reformation were uncovered and restored.\n\n\n== History ==\nAt the end of the Viking Era, the pagan temple at Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala), about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) to the north of today's Uppsala, was replaced by a Christian church. Although the exact date of its construction is not known, in 1123 Siward was ordained Bishop of Uppsala by the Archbishop of Bremen-Hamburg. It is however uncertain if Siward ever assumed office, as he had been expelled and was in Germany in the early 1130s. The catalogue of bishops mentions Severeinus as the first bishop, and he may have been the replacement for Siward. Henrik, 'Finland's Apostle', was the fourth bishop. In 1164, Sweden became an archbishopric under the control of Lund. The first archbishop was the Cistercian monk Stefan of Alvastra.After the cathedral in Gamla Uppsala was damaged by fire in 1204, the Chapter sought permission from the Holy See to move the building to a larger site. Pope Alexander IV granted this request in 1258 on condition that the name of Uppsala be maintained. At a meeting in S\u00f6derk\u00f6ping in September 1270, Archbishop Fulco Angelus and the cathedral chapter decided the site should be in \u00d6stra Aros. Formal authorization of the move was issued in 1271 by Bishop Carolus of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s whom the Pope had appointed to oversee the case.\n\nAbout 1272, work began on building a new cathedral in \u00d6stra Aros near the Fyris River to the south. It was constructed on the site of the earlier stone church dedicated to the Holy Trinity, located almost exactly where the cathedral's chancel now stands. It was here that Sweden's patron saint Eric Jedvardsson had attended mass before he was murdered in 1160. The name of Uppsala was kept, and the surrounding town \u00d6stra Aros soon changed its name accordingly. The relics of Saint Eric, the treasure of Uppsala, were moved from Gamla Uppsala to the new site in 1273, along with the formal move of the archbishopric. The church was designed by French architects although the name of the author of the detailed initial plans who supervised work until 1281 has not been recorded. In 1287, a promissory note drawn up by the provost of Paris covers the expenses to be incurred by master builder \u00c9tienne de Bonneuil and his assistants in travelling to Sweden to work on the construction of a cathedral at Uppsala. \u00c9tienne is credited with work at the east and south chapels of the chancel, the transepts and probably the south portal, although in most of his work he appears to have meticulously followed the plans of his predecessor. Progress was slow as a result of the cold climate, the plague and many financial difficulties. It was not until the end of the 14th century that work on the initial plans was completed, thanks in particular to the contribution of the master builder Nikolaus fr\u00e5n V\u00e4ster\u00e5s who began construction of the nave.When consecrated in 1435 by Archbishop Olaus Laurentii, the cathedral still was not complete. It was dedicated to Saint Lawrence, highly cherished in all of Sweden at that time; Saint Eric, the patron saint of Sweden (though never canonised by the Roman Catholic Church); and Saint Olaf, the patron saint of Norway. It was completed over the following decades. Although there are no documentary records of the consecration, there are several references from the same period to the cathedral's chapels, including their altars which were dedicated to the Holy Cross, to the Virgin Mary or to other saints. The last main component of the cathedral, the towers, were built between 1470 and 1489. The cathedral was damaged by fire on several occasions, especially during the great fire of 1702 which destroyed much of the city. Restoration work was not completed until the middle of the century.\n\nThe church was not the regular place of worship of laypeople until the Reformation. It was reserved for official services of the Catholic Church hierarchy (by the cathedral's canons). The parish churches in Uppsala were the Holy Trinity Church or Bondkyrkan, 'Peasant Church', as it was often called; Church of Saint Peter; Church of Our Lady; and a Franciscan friary. The last three had been built on the east side of the Fyris River, which was the central business district, and remains so to date. They were successively torn down during the Reformation. The Cathedral was also the coronation church for many of Sweden's kings and queens until 1719. It was the site of celebrating coronations from the Middle Ages until the end of the 17th century. Stockholm's Cathedral Storkyrkan became the official coronation church.\n\nFrom 1885 to 1893, the architect Helgo Zettervall (1831\u20131907) undertook comprehensive restoration work, seeking to give the cathedral a French High Gothic appearance although he has been criticized for not respecting the building's original Baltic Gothic style. He also added pointed French spires to the towers, bringing the cathedral up to a height of 118.7 m (389 ft), so making it as high as it was long. In an attempt to give the cathedral a slimmer appearance, Zettervall significantly altered large portions of the medieval outer brick walls and removed the decorative white-washed 'blind windows' on the gables which had been similar to those on the nearby Holy Trinity Church.\nFurther renovation work in the early 1970s led to improvements in the building's structure and included restoration of the walls and windows. Large portions of cement additions by Zettervall to the exterior structure of the cathedral were removed decades later as they adversely affected the building's fabric. In 1989, Pope John Paul II took part in an ecumenical service in Uppsala Cathedral with Archbishop Bertil Werkstr\u00f6m. Fire protection equipment was installed in 2010 and the electrical and heating systems have been replaced.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe cathedral is the tallest church building in Scandinavia. Its height of 118.7 m (389 ft) is the same as its length while it has a breadth of 45 m (148 ft). The height inside is 27 metres (89 ft). The church was designed in the French High Gothic style by French master builders including \u00c9tienne de Bonneuil. Built high on a gravel ridge southwest of the River Fyris, its Latin cross ground plan consists of a three-aisled basilica (a central nave flanked by two lateral aisles) with single-aisle transepts, and a four-bay chancel with an ambulatory surrounded by five chapels. The seven-bay nave is bordered by chantry chapels on either side. Starting with the eastern end of the church and the chapels surrounding the chancel, most of the structure was built between 1270 and 1420 but the western end of the nave was completed only in the middle of the 15th century while the towers took decades more to complete. The principal material is red brick but the cathedral was built on a stone foundation and the chancel pillars and many details are of Gotland limestone. (The nave pillars were originally of brick but were replaced with limestone as part of the restoration work carried out under Helgo Zettervall from 1885 to 1893.)The twin towers at the west end of the church were first mentioned in 1563.  Several additions to both the interior and exterior of the church were made after a fire in 1572 under the leadership of Franciscus Pahr, known for his work on castles. The turret and pinnacles which can be seen in older drawings were added as well as the first spires on the west towers which were designed by Antonius Watz. In the 1690s, Nicodemus Tessin designed a new burial chapel to the east of the south transept, the most significant alteration to the plan of the cathedral since the Middle Ages. From the outside, his design respected the traditions of medieval architecture with tall Gothic windows but the interior was decorated in Tessin's usual Classical Baroque style.\n\nIn the 17th century, the towers were redesigned in the Dutch Renaissance style but after the serious fire of 1702 they were temporarily replaced by low wooden tops. At the same time, the buttresses were removed giving the cathedral the rather plain look conveyed by pictures of the period. Only in 1740 were copper-faced spires installed, designed by Carl H\u00e5rleman. At the same time, H\u00e5rleman carried out significant work on the west fa\u00e7ade. Today's towers are the work of Helgo Zettervall who completely rebuilt them in the 1880s, substantially increasing their height. After the serious fire of 1702, the original flying buttresses were removed and a higher roof was built.\n\nAlthough the cathedral was designed by French architects, it exhibits a number of differences from the cathedrals of northern France. Above all, it is essentially constructed of brick rather than stone. Brick could easily be produced locally but stone had to be imported from the distant quarries of Gotland. As bricks and mortar are not as strong as stone, the walls had to be thicker although the pillars needed to support the vaulted ceiling of the chancel were made of limestone (although those in the nave are of brick). The north transept portal is also built of limestone, no doubt as it was needed to support the rose window, also structured in limestone itself. While the chancel and the transept are clearly of French design, the nave which was built somewhat later displays German and Swedish characteristics. Constructed in about 1330, the rose window over the northeast portal is still entirely French. Nicolaus from V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, the Swede who directed work on the nave from the 1360s, appears to have slightly modified the original plans, adding confessional side-chapels and including a few features of German origin. Cross-vaults were nevertheless installed, rather than star-shaped vaults which were more common at the time. Work on the western end of the building began in 1431 with the construction of the west portal which was influenced by the style of Vadstena Abbey. The towers, however, still exhibited features typical of 13th-century French architecture, indicating that the original plans were still in use at the time. Overall, despite minor differences, Uppsala Cathedral still reflects the style of the 13th-century cathedrals of northern France.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nThe Coronation Vault stands 27 m (89 ft) above the point at which the transept crosses the nave. It is where most of Sweden's monarchs were crowned from the Middle Ages until 1719. During the restoration in the 1880s, the interior ceiling and walls of the cathedral were decorated in the Neo-Gothic style. Some depictions, such as one of the Reformation's Martin Luther, added figures beyond the cathedral's medieval heritage. During the renovation work carried out in the 1970s, many of the medieval frescoes which had been whitewashed over after the Reformation were uncovered and restored.\nThe high altar is used for the cathedral's services on the most important feast days in the church calendar. It is also here that all Swedish bishops are ordained. The silver chandelier is from 1647. The large crucifix in silver and crystal from Orrefors was installed in 1976.\n\n\n=== Chapels ===\n\nThe cathedral's largest chapel, the Vasa Chapel, at the eastern end of the chancel, was originally known as the Chapel of the Virgin Mary. It later became a burial monument for Gustav Vasa and his family. Completed in 1583, it is decorated with the national arms of Sweden as well as with some of the oldest known Swedish and Finnish coats of arms.\nThe Finsta Chapel or St Eric's Chapel on the north-west corner of the chancel houses the relics of Eric the Holy, the patron saint of Sweden, who was killed in 1160 on the site where Uppsala Cathedral was later built. His shrine was moved from the first cathedral in Gamla Uppsala as soon as work began on the new building. In 1580, King John III melted his shrine down but replaced it with a new gold-plated one which still contains Eric's relics and crown. The name Finsta originates from the Uppland estate where Judge Birger Persson and his wife were born. They were entombed in the chapel in 1328. A relic of their daughter Saint Bridget housed in a small gold-plated shrine was donated by the Saint Bridget Order in 1990.Next to the Finsta Chapel, the Sture Chapel is the memorial tomb of the three members of the Sture family who were murdered in by King Eric XIV in 1567. The reredos (1520) depicts the story of Mary's parents, Anne and Joachim. At the end of the 16th century, the church's sacristy was converted into a burial chapel for Queen Catherine Jagiellon or Katarina Jagiellonica, the wife of King John III, who is also entombed there. The Jagellonica Chapel takes its name from her. The monument, crowned by a marble vault, was designed by Willem Boy.\n\n\n=== Windows ===\n\nSeveral windows maintain their original shape and size. The original stained-glass decorations were almost all lost in the 1702 fire and were simply replaced by normal glass. The current stained-glass designs were added during the renovation at the end of the 19th century, most of them by the Gothenburg firm, Svenska Glasm\u00e5leri. The large windows above the portals depict the Trinity: God the Father over the west door, God the Son above the south door (the largest in the church), and God the Holy Spirit above the north door. Crafted in limestone, the rose window at the north portal is the oldest, unchanged since the 13th century.\n\n\n=== Treasury and artefacts ===\n\nLocated in the north tower, the cathedral Treasury Museum displays a number of gold and silver articles used in the religious services. There is also a collection of textiles including Queen Margaret's golden gown. The burial regalia of Gustav Vasa, John III and their wives can also be seen.Other artefacts in the cathedral include tapestries in the Chapel of Remembrance from 1976 which record important events in the cathedral's history. The ornate pulpit (1710), the largest in Sweden, was designed by Nicodemus Tessin and carved by Burchard Precht. It was a gift from Queen Hedvig Eleonora after the fire of 1702. Decorations include John the Baptist preaching in the desert, Saint Paul in Athens and the parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard.One of the new bells installed after the devastating fire of 1702 is called Thornan. It was taken from Toru\u0144, Poland as war booty in 1703 by the Swedish forces of Carl XII during the Great Northern War.In the Vasa Chapel, there are seven large fresco paintings executed by Johan Gustaf Sandberg (1782\u20131854) over a period of several years. They depict important events in the life of Gustav Vasa. One of the most famous is Talet till dalkarlarna vid Mora kyrka (Speech to the people of Dalarna outside Mora Church). Frescos also decorate the vaults of the nave.Initially, as in some of the continental cathedrals, the interior was decorated with designs emphasizing the arch ribs and portal components. Even the brick was painted with red and white stripes. In the 15th century, frescos of figures in the Late Gothic style with decorative vine leaves were painted in various parts of the church. Traces of these have been found in the chancel and in the chapel which was originally dedicated to St Eric and St Olaf. They have now been heavily restored. The frescos in the chancel were probably painted by Albertus Pictor's workshop.\n\n\n== Interred notables ==\n\nA number of Swedish monarchs and other notable people were buried inside the cathedral: \n\nGustav Vasa, 16th-century King of Sweden. Nearly a decade before his death, he had expressed a wish to be buried in the cathedral. He is buried with his three wives, although only two are depicted on the sarcophagus designed by Willem Boy. The king and his wives are interred in what was once the Chapel of the Virgin Mary. The only remaining indication of the original intention of the chapel are the painted yellow stars against a blue background on its vaulted ceiling, symbols of Saint Mary in Catholic tradition.\nJohn III (died 1592), the second son of Gustav Vasa, and his second wife Gunilla Bielke are also buried in the Virgin Mary Chapel. His first wife, Catherine Jagiellon from Poland, has a burial chapel of her own on the north side of the chancel.\nPrincess Elizabeth (died 1597), Gustav Vasa's youngest daughter is buried in the Finsta Chapel adjacent to Virgin Mary's Chapel.\nThe noblemen Svante Sture (1517\u20131567) and his sons Nils (1543\u20131567) and Erik (1546\u20131567) who were all killed by Erik XIV in the Sture Murders are entombed in the Sture Chapel. The clothes they were wearing at the time of their death are displayed in the Treasury Museum.\nCarl Linnaeus (1707\u20131778), the 18th-century world-famous botanist and professor at Uppsala University, has a memorial designed by Tobias Sergel next to the Chapel of Remembrance.\nOlaus Rudbeck, Swedish polymath and one of the discoverers of the lymphatic system.\nEmanuel Swedenborg, 18th-century scientist and mystic. He was not originally interred here, but his remains were transported to Uppsala from England in 1908.\nNathan S\u00f6derblom (1866\u20131931), archbishop of Uppsala and Nobel Peace Prize recipient. His tomb is at the foot of the steps to the high altar.\nEric the Saint, 12th-century king and national saint, whose relics are in the Finsta Chapel.\nLaurentius Petri (1499\u20131573), Sweden's first Lutheran archbishop, buried at the foot of the altar steps.\nRelics of Saint Bridget or Heliga Birgitta (1303\u20131373) have been placed in a shrine in the Finsta Chapel inspired by the clothing of the Saint Bridget Order.\nFolke Johansson \u00c4ngel, Archbishop of Uppsala (1267\u20131277)\n\n\n=== Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld memorial ===\nIn the cathedral there is a small memorial to Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, former Secretary-General of the United Nations, who was posthumously awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  A stone bears the inscription:\n\nIcke jag\nutan Gud i mig\nDag Hammarskj\u00f6ld 1905 \u2013 1961\nThe English translation is \"Not I, but God in me.\"\n\n\n== Open to visitors ==\nThe cathedral is located on Domkyrkoplan in the centre of Uppsala. It is open to visitors most days from 8 am to 6 pm. The Treasury Museum in the north tower is open from 10 am to 4 pm, Sundays from 12.30 pm.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchbishop of Uppsala\nChurch of Sweden\nTemple at Uppsala\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAugustsson, Jan-Erik; Blennow, Anna-Maria; Piltz, Anders;  et al.

        "wiki": "Danmark Church (Swedish: Danmarks kyrka) is a church located in the minor locality of Danmark in Uppsala Municipality, Sweden, some 8 kilometers southeast of Uppsala.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church is first attested in writing in 1291. In proximity to the church are several runestones, featuring Christian inscriptions and crosses. The church itself is a brick building, the oldest parts of which stem from the 14th century. By the late 15th century, the church had roughly the same appearance as today, but has since been modified and expanded, notably after being ravaged by fires caused by lightning strikes in 1699 and 1889. After the 1889 fire, the Neo-Gothic spire was added.The church is situated near Linnaeus Hammarby and was, in 1758-1778, the parish church of Carl Linnaeus; however, Linnaeus received complaints for his tendency to leave before the service had ended. He would also on occasion send his dog, Pompe, in his place, who would also leave early.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the name Danmark is unclear, but several theories have been proposed. The explanation most commonly accepted by modern name research is that the name consists of the prefix dan-, derived from Old Norse dank, meaning \"wet\" or \"boggy\", and the suffix -mark meaning \"forest\" or \"forest's edge\". Danmark would thus mean \"the forest by the wetlands\".Olaus Magnus offers another explanation in A Description of the Northern Peoples (7:15), stating that the church \"took its name from the homeland of the enemy [Denmark], as the mighty building was funded by loot taken from him, and thus stands as an eternal memorial for those who have fallen.\" A third theory postulates that the name translates as \"wood of the Danes\", suggesting it may have been a settlement for Danes. However, later research asserts that any connection to Denmark is unlikely.\n\n\n== The building ==\nThe church features frescos by Johannes Rosenrod and Albertus Pictor. The weathercock is from the late 19th century and was named \"weathercock of the year\" in 1989. The choir windows were made in 1958 by Julia L\u00fcning.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Literature ==\nV\u00e5ra kyrkor, p. 24, Klarkullens F\u00f6rlag AB, V\u00e4stervik, 1990, ISBN 91-971561-0-8\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

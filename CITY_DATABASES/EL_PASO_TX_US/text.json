        "wiki": "El Paso\u2013Ju\u00e1rez, also known as Ju\u00e1rez\u2013El Paso, the Borderplex or Paso del Norte, is a transborder agglomeration, on the border between Mexico and the United States. The region is centered on two large cities: Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua, Mexico and El Paso, Texas, U.S. Additionally, nearby Las Cruces, New Mexico, U.S. is sometimes included as part of the region, referred to as El Paso\u2013Ju\u00e1rez\u2013Las Cruces or El Paso\u2013Ju\u00e1rez\u2013Southern New Mexico. With over 2.7 million people, this binational region is the 2nd largest conurbation (San Diego\u2013Tijuana being the largest) on the United States\u2013Mexico border. The El Paso\u2013Ju\u00e1rez region is the largest bilingual, binational work force in the Western Hemisphere.This region is commonly subdivided into the Ju\u00e1rez Metropolitan Area (Zona Metropolitana de Ju\u00e1rez) in Chihuahua, greater El Paso in Texas and greater Las Cruces in New Mexico. These sub-regions are typically defined by state borders, even though some New Mexico towns in the region like Sunland Park are significantly closer to El Paso than to Las Cruces.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nJu\u00e1rez is the largest city in the region (population 1,321,004 as of 2010). El Paso is the next largest (682,669 as of 2018), and Las Cruces is the third largest (102,296 as of 2018).Major American suburbs are Fabens, Texas, San Elizario, Texas, Socorro, Texas and Sunland Park, New Mexico. Smaller communities include Anthony, New Mexico; Anthony, Texas; Canutillo, Texas; Chaparral, New Mexico; Horizon City, Texas; Mesilla, New Mexico; Santa Teresa, New Mexico; University Park, New Mexico; Vado, New Mexico; and Westway, Texas.The population of El Paso has historically been dominated by Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic white Americans; in recent decades the former group has come to dominate the population. In 1970 El Paso was 57.3% Hispanic and 40.4% non-Hispanic white; in 2010 it was 80.7% Hispanic and 14.2% non-Hispanic white. In the same year El Paso County was 82.2% Hispanic.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Franklin Mountains region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks. The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. At the time of the arrival of the Spanish the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area and today form the basis of the Mestizo culture in the area. The Mescalero Apache roamed the region as well.\nSpanish explorer Don Juan de O\u00f1ate was the first European explorer to arrive at the Rio Grande near modern Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso in 1598, celebrating Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (several decades before the Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). El Paso del Norte (the present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), was founded on the south bank of the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande) in 1659 by Spanish conquistadors. The Mission Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe became its first major settlement. Being a grassland then, agriculture flourished and vineyards and fruits constituted the bulk of the regional production. The Spanish Crown and the local authorities of El Paso del Norte had made several land concessions to bring agricultural production to the northern bank of the river in present-day El Paso. However, the Apaches dissuaded settlement and development across the river. The water provided a natural defense against them.\n\nEl Paso became the southernmost locality of the Provincia de Nuevo Mexico (modern New Mexico). It remained largest city in New Mexico until its north side was ceded to the US in 1850. It communicated with Santa Fe and Mexico City by the Royal Road. American spies, traders and fur trappers visited the area since 1804 and some intermarried with the area's Hispanic elite. Although there was no combat in the region during the Mexican War of Independence, El Paso del Norte experienced the negative effects it had on its wine trade.\nThe Texas Revolution (1836) was not felt in the region as the area was never considered part of Texas until 1848.  Given the blurry reclamations of the Texas Republic that wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river a formal American settlement, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas-New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.The communities on both sides of the border continued to function, in large part, as a single community. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the thirty-second parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1854. Further west, a settlement on Coons' Rancho called Franklin became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas.  A year later pioneer Anson Mills completed his plan of the town, calling it El Paso and the town was incorporated in 1873. During the French intervention in Mexico (1862\u20131867), El Paso del Norte served as a temporary stop for republican forces of rebel leader Benito Ju\u00e1rez until he established his government-in-exile in Chihuahua. In 1888, El Paso del Norte was renamed in honor of Ju\u00e1rez.\n\nIn the later 19th century the population in the region began to grow rapidly. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, trade with the rest of the U.S. increased substantially. The area attracted newcomers ranging from businessmen and priests, to gunfighters and prostitutes. In the U.S. El Paso became known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness. Prostitution and gambling flourished. During World War I, the U.S. Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice, creating a tourist boom in Ju\u00e1rez whose vice businesses continued to thrive.\nMining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city partially enabled by Prohibition era bootlegging with the area becoming a significant port of entry for liquor. The Depression era hit the region hard and population declined through the end of World War II. Following the war, military expansion in the area as well as oil discoveries in the Texas Permian Basin helped spur redevelopment in the mid 1900s. Disparities in wages and cost of living between the U.S. and Mexico helped encourage many businesses to establish manufacturing operations in Mexico during the mid 20th century, thus making El Paso\u2013Ju\u00e1rez an attractive location for manufacturing. The signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) helped spur this trend even further.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTypical elevation in the El Paso\u2013Ju\u00e1rez region is approximately 4,000 feet (1,200 m) though the Franklin Mountains which run through the region have peaks rising much higher. North Franklin Peak, for example, rises to 7,192 feet (2,192 m).The most well-known feature of the area is the Rio Grande which divides the U.S. from Mexico. The river flows through the Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains.  West of Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso the river turns away from the border, connecting these cities with Las Cruces, New Mexico.\nMt. Cristo Rey, a volcanic peak (an example of a pluton) rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Other volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (48 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.\nThe area lies in the Chihuahuan Desert, which itself is the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe area has an arid climate because it is located in the Chihuahuan desert. The area experiences hot summers, cool winters and a mild spring and fall. In Ju\u00e1rez the average high is 31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F) with lows of 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F). The winter high is 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) with lows of 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F). Because of the high altitude the region is cooler than many desert areas in Mexico and the American Southwest. Rainfall is scarce and concentrated in the summer months. Snowfall is not a rare event\u2014it normally snows once or twice every winter.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nEl Paso\u2013Ju\u00e1rez is a major center for manufacturing and international trade. It is one of the largest ports of entry on the U.S./Mexico border. The region is also the second most important trade point on the border and the 14th largest trading center in the U.S. In 2018, US$81.88 billion in trade took place in the region.As of 2010 the region holds offices for more than 70 Fortune 500 companies. It is also home to more than 320 manufacturing plants (those in Ju\u00e1rez are commonly referred to as maquiladoras) and more than 1,100 manufacturing operations total. The largest sectors of manufacturing are automobiles and automobile components, and consumer electronic components. Apparel and textile manufacturing, though, are important sectors as well, particularly north of the border. The area employs approximately 262,000 people in manufacturing with 85% of those in Ju\u00e1rez. Many of the workers in Ju\u00e1rez, however, live in the United States.An important pillar of the economy of El Paso has been Fort Bliss and Biggs Army Airfield. Since frontier days military spending, directly and indirectly, has provided a significant source of money to El Paso and to the region as a whole. As of 2018 the economic impact of Fort Bliss is estimated at more than US$23.13 billion.Call centers are additionally major employers in El Paso and neighboring communities in the U.S.With the opening of Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso in 2009, the school became the first medical school to open in 30 years. The university in 2013 became the fourth freestanding institution of the TTU System, and since its opening, the university has expanded to include the Paul L. Foster School of Medicine, the Gayle Greve Hunt School of Nursing, and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. A fourth school, the Woody L. Hunt School of Dental Medicine is expected to open in 2021. The new medical school has become a great contributor to the region's economy, in 2015 the school contributed US$227 million to the local economy. \n\n\n=== Regional cooperation ===\nThough the national boundaries are an important point of separation, efforts at regional planning and economic integration exist in the local governments and the business communities. Regional business advocacy groups such as El Paso Regional Economic Development Corporation and World Trade Center El Paso/Ju\u00e1rez serve to attract businesses to the area and market its benefits. Efforts at community and environmental cooperation including the Paso del Norte Clean Cities Coalition exist as well.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe largest universities in the region are the University of Texas at El Paso and the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez (Autonomous University of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). These universities have strong ties to each other (as well as to the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Chihuahua) with formal programs of exchange for scholars and students. Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso plays a major part in the region because it is one of the few stand alone Medical Schools, where they work closely with Doctors Without Borders. New Mexico State University in Las Cruces is an additional major university in the area. \nOther area colleges include Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez (Technological University of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), Howard Payne University-El Paso, Park University, Southwest University at El Paso, Strayer University, Vista College (El Paso and Las Cruces), Webster University, and Western Technical College-El Paso. El Paso Community College and Do\u00f1a Ana Community College provide supplemental higher-education opportunities for students in the region.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Community contact ===\nUntil the 1920s and 1930s the communities of Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso enjoyed largely unfettered access to one another, maintaining a sense of unity. Prohibition and World War II brought about more strict enforcement of the border in this region, making access between the communities more difficult. Nevertheless, the communities have continued to share ethnic and cultural bonds particularly as economic integration in the later 20th century has re-opened much of the access between the communities. Even today the cities still see themselves as a single, closely tied community.The violence in Ju\u00e1rez that erupted in 2008\u20132009 has forced the U.S. to tighten its policies regarding allowing Ju\u00e1rez residents access to El Paso. Tourists, workers, and students who were once allowed regular access across the border have been restricted to much tighter schedules for travel.\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\nThe area is home to numerous parks and venues for outdoor recreation. The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park in El Paso is the largest urban park in the United States. Other urban parks in the area include Ascarate Park (El Paso), Parque Central (Ju\u00e1rez), Parque Chamizal (Ju\u00e1rez), Preciado Park (Las Cruces), and Rio Bosque Park (Socorro, TX).\nOutside the metropolitan area there are major state and national parks in the vicinity. The most well-known of these is Big Bend National Park, which is adjacent to Big Bend Ranch State Park. Closer to the cities are Guadalupe Mountains National Park, Lincoln National Forest, and Gila National Forest.\n\n\n=== Crime and safety ===\n\nWhile violent crime has been an increasingly serious issue in Cd. Ju\u00e1rez since the 1990s, El Paso has remained one of the safest large cities in the United States. In January 2014, El Paso was ranked as the safest large city in the United States for the fourth straight year according to the annual City Crime Rankings by CQ Press.  El Paso has been in the study's top three large cities with the lowest crime rates since 1997. Though violent crime on the U.S. side of the border has remained very low, murders in Ju\u00e1rez related to the drug cartels began to grow rapidly after 2007. In 2008, officials reported more than 5,400 drug-related murders in Mexico, many in and near Ju\u00e1rez. On 20 February 2009, the U.S. State Department announced in an updated travel alert that \"Mexican authorities report that more than 1,800 people have been killed in the city since January 2008.\" CNN listed the city among the ten most dangerous in the world in 2010. The deteriorating situation caused drastic changes in daily life for citizens in Ju\u00e1rez after 2008.\nAfter the homicide rates escalated to the point of making Cd. Ju\u00e1rez the most violent city in the world, the city has seen a significant and steady decline in violent crime since then.\nIn 2012, homicides were at their lowest rate since 2007 when drug violence flared between the Sinaloa cartel and the Juarez Cartel. That trend has continued in 2013 when 497 homicides were reported, the lowest amount since 2007, dropping Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the 37th spot of most dangerous cities.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n\nEl Paso is the medical hub of West Texas and Southern New Mexico, hosting numerous state-of-the-art medical centers.  Some of the city's top hospitals include University Medical Center of El Paso, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Sierra Medical Center, Las Palmas Medical Center, Del Sol Medical Center, Sierra Providence East Medical Center, El Paso Children's Hospital, Providence Memorial Hospital, and The Hospitals of Providence Transmountain Campus. University Medical Center is the only level I trauma center in the region. William Beaumont Army Medical Center will be replaced by a new state of the art $1.2 billion Fort Bliss Replacement Hospital that will keep the same name and is expected to open in September 2020.El Paso is also home to the Medical Center of the Americas, an integrated complex of medical facilities anchored by Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at El Paso, Paul L. Foster School of Medicine, University Medical Center, the El Paso Psychiatric Center and by the El Paso Children\u2019s Hospital. It is also site to the Cardwell Collaborative biomedical research building, the Gayle Greve Hunt School of Nursing, and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. The Woody L. Hunt School of Dental Medicine is expected to open in 2021 in the MCA area as well.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nEl Paso is served by El Paso International Airport, Amtrak via the historic Union Depot, Interstate 10, US Highway 54 (known locally as \"54\", the \"North-South Freeway\" or officially as the Patriot Freeway), Spur 601 (Liberty Expressway), US Highway 180 and US Highway 62 (Montana Avenue), US Highway 85 (Paisano Drive), Loop 375, Loop 478 (Copia Street-Pershing Drive-Dyer Street), numerous Texas Farm-to-Market roads (a class of state highway commonly abbreviated to FM) and the city's original thoroughfare, State Highway 20, the eastern portion of which is known locally as Alameda Avenue (formerly US Highway 80). Texas 20 also includes portions of Texas Avenue in central El Paso, Mesa Street from Downtown to the West Side, and Doniphan Drive on the West Side. Northeast El Paso is connected to West El Paso by Transmountain Road(Loop 375). The city also shares four international bridges and one railbridge with Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico.  In 2009, El Paso was home to number 52, number 98, and number 100 of the 100 most congested roads in Texas, which are, respectively: North Zaragoza Road between Sun Fire Boulevard and Interstate 10; Lee Trevino Drive between Montana Avenue and Interstate 10; and Interstate 10 between Patriot Freeway and Loop 375.\n\n\n=== BRT system ===\nThe ViveBus BRT system opened to the public in November 2013 with the first route of 5 planned. The project was made a reality with the collaboration of the local municipal government, the private enterprise of Integradora de Transporte de Juarez (INTRA) as well as other city government agencies.  Studies have shown that the current bus system averages 8 mph while the new system is projected to average 16 mph.  The BRT system studies conducted by the Instituto Municipal de Investigacion Y Planeacion project a daily ridership of 40,000.\nThe first of the 5 routes opened to users in late 2013 and is officially named Presidencia-Tierra Nueva and has 34 stations distributed along the north to south corridor.  The route starts at Avenida Francisco Villa, follows north to Eje Vial Norte-Sur then veers left at Zaragoza Blvd. and ends at Avenida Independencia and the elevated Carretera Federal 2.\n\n\n==== El Paso Streetcar ====\n\nThe El Paso Streetcar is a streetcar system in El Paso, Texas, that opened for service on November 9, 2018, and uses a fleet of restored PCC streetcars that had served the city's previous system until its closure in 1974. The system covers 4.8 miles (7.7 km) (round trip) in two loops from Downtown El Paso to University of Texas at El Paso. The system was constructed under the authority of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, but when the major construction was completed, around spring 2018, it was transferred to Sun Metro, for operation and maintenance. As of 2016, construction of the system was projected to cost $97 million.\n\n\n==== Airports ====\n \nEl Paso International AirportEl Paso International Airport, a public airport four miles northeast of downtown El Paso, has fifteen gates on two concourses and is served by seven major airlines, Alaska, Allegiant, American, Delta, Frontier, Southwest, and United Airlines and has flights to fourteen direct destinations. In 2018, the airport accommodated 3,260,556 commercial passengers, an 11.3% increase or a little over 331,000 passenger increase from the previous year. The El Paso International Airport is home to the US/Mexico border largest cargo facilities and continues to have steady annual growth in air freight traffic through the airport. In 2018 El Paso International Airport was ranked 38th in air cargo traffic among American airports, it handled 700,728,342 lbs of air cargo, an increase of 33.45% from the previous year. \nAbraham Gonz\u00e1lez International AirportAbraham Gonzalez International Airport is located at the southern end of Cd. Juarez. It accommodates the national and international air traffic of the city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. The airport is served by five major airlines Aerom\u00e9xico, Interjet, TAR Aerol\u00edneas, VivaAerobus, and Volaris and has non-stop flights to twelve destinations. In 2017, Abraham Gonz\u00e1lez International Airport handled 1,173,135  passengers, and in 2018 it handled 1,364,028 passengers, an increase of 16.3%. \nBiggs Army Airfield\nHorizon Airport\nDona Ana International Jetport\nLas Cruces International Airport\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of Nueva Espa\u00f1a, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe.  Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area in addition to the Paso Del Norte Bridge also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge, including the Bridge of the Americas, Stanton Street Bridge, and the Ysleta Bridge also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.\nThere is also a land crossing at nearby Santa Teresa, New Mexico, and the Fabens-Caseta International Bridge in nearby Fabens, Texas.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n=== Pictures of El Paso, Texas ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Pictures of Cd.

          "hot or cold days, it is big enough to spend a half day with kids. well kept and managed animals there. happy to have the zoo in town.",
          "Moved here from a big city with huge zoos so we had heard this place was small and expected such. Well,went on a random weekday (no crowds) with perfect weather and had a blast!! Yes the Cafe is expensive if you choose to eat lunch there but it was quite tasty and not a long",
          "What a fun smaller zoo with actual chefs running their cafe with gourmet selections that are reasonably priced!",
          "Our zoo keeps getting better. It's growing and adding so many amazing exhibits. The playground and splash pad are awesome, too. Getting a membership is a great idea. You can enjoy the zoo when you want and how you want- some days, you can pack a lunch and play in the splash pad,",
          "Ok so I visited the zoo on a family trip on October. The giraffe show was closed for maintenance ( they informed us before buying the tickets ). The first thing we did was buy a train ticket to see part of the zoo (train tickets are additional to zoo entrance ticket)",
          "The zoo is laid out nicely and sections are well marked and logical. The grounds are well maintained and there are places that serve food. Staff members are very friendly. I was there to photograph animals and found most exhibits were good viewing.",
          "We arrived on a Sunday about 10:00 in the morning. Not many had arrived so we got close parking to the zoo entrance. The prices our cheap compared to some of the many other zoos we\u2019ve been to. Which for the small size it\u2019s a reasonable rate. We spent 6 hours in zoo and we",
          "This zoo is small but if offers a more in depth experience with the animals the way they had it set up. It was my first time here and we didn't expect much cause the parking lot was pretty small but I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of animals. Right as you walk in you",
          "Very disappointed. Went on a Sunday at 2:00pm. Were told the giraffe exhibit would be closed. The bird show was closed at 2:00pm. Elephants were let out at 3:30 for a short while. Took the train ride for additional $2 which turned out to be a 15 minute ride through a bunch",
          "Many people do not even know that El Paso has a Zoo, but to be honest is a very complete zoo. I really recommend it. El Paso gets hot so bring comfortable clothing.",
          "Visited the zoo recently , I was pleased to see some more improvements and exhibits . Actually enjoyed the afternoon there. Looked like there was ongoing construction and something was being added very impressed with the zoo and would recommend a visit.",
          "Being a small zoo, you can see most of it and not feel overwhelmed. Check on the times for the various shows so you can plan to get the most out of your visit.",
          "The zoo itself is very nice and clean but not worth the price of admission. I have gone on several occasions and they always some construction or remodeling going on. Sometimes a large portion of the exhibits are closed. If you have large sections of the zoo closed, sorry but",
          "The zoo is small, but has a wide range of displays and animals. Food prices inside are not bad. The new carousel is a great addition! Elephants and giraffes are my favorite.",

          "If you have seen zoo's around the world, this is a nice attempt to becoming a great zoo. Right now, anybody over 12 will probably not be very interested and done within about 1 hour. Because the price is reasonable and parking is free, 3 stars, otherwise it would have been 2.",
          "Do NOT come here when it\u2019s hot out unless your from elpaso . I was here in late September and it was hot. Besides that It was sad to see the tiny enclosure that the ocelot had and to see that it looked like it was out of its mind and obviously not happy . AND ...it was very",
          "While the exhibits are interesting and the staff both friendly and informative, whomever designed this zoo NEVER visited it during the blazing El Paso summer! The almost total lack of shade, either natural or man-made, over most of the walkways renders the entire sweltering",
          "An educational little zoo that will soon be expanding. Makes for a great date, but go first thing in the am before it gets hot & you will see more animal activity. Wear a hat & sunscreen. The cafe food is good, but they need to do a better job of cleaning the tables. Especially",
          "I hadn't been to zoo here in el paso for years but now with grandkids I had to return. I loved it has been updated clean and it was lots of fun I also liked the snack restaurant there was entertainment 4 grandkids so we were busy they were happy and so were we",
          "The only couple of nice things in this God forsaken land was the zoo. Its spread out into different groupings of the planet. Certain areas have different animals. Nice merry go round on the grounds. Passport cafe was decent and a fair price for the food. I suggest going first",
          "We were not allowed entrance because we had our service dog. She\u2019s an 8lb imperial ShihTzu that stays inside her portable carrying case. This has been the ONE and ONLY place from the Rio Grande Valley to here that has NOT ALLOWED admittance. We were looking forward to this visit",
          "The number of animals cannot be compared with the big famous zoos in Washington, New York or San Diego. But taking into consideration that El Paso is not a tourist \"must see\" destination and visitors usually come from the area, one has to admit that they do a really good job. It",
          "My husband is stationed on Fort Bliss and we share a love for animals and decided to check out El Paso\u2019s zoo!!! Had so much fun!!! Loved watching people get to feed the tortoises!!!",

          "We went on a Thursday & it was pretty busy with larger groups of small kids. Facilities were all clean, friendly staff, they're adding more exhibits for 2019. Exhibits looked a little rough & quite a few animals were out of their exhibits. My son loved the birds of the world",
          "We visited during the heat of the day in June, so we were prepared to melt. We were pleasantly surprised with the way the zoo was constructed - there was lots of shade and lots of cooler spaces (i.e. indoor exhibits) to keep us cooled down. The animals were all active on the day",
          "We took our 9 and 10 year olds and spent about 2 hours touring the zoo. Animals were interesting. Both the wolves and the wild horses were our favorite animals. There was a playground and a small splash park in the middle of the zoo that was a lot of fun for our kids. Lots of",

          "Most animals were not out. A lot of \u201cconstruction\u201d and \u201cmaintenance\u201d. If they are trying to improve zoo, that\u2019s great. But don\u2019t have it open in the meantime without a warning before purchasing a ticket. Train closed due to \u201cmaintenance\u201d Majority of exhibits closed (lions,",

          "The El Paso Zoo hosted \"May the fourth be with you \" The zoo was full of Star Wars characters. It was like a Halloween party. My 7 year old son had a great time. The atmosphere and weather was perfect. I haven't been to the zoo in sometime. I was impressed by the renovations",
          "This is a smaller zoo with very nice habitats and cool animals. Our kids liked the lions and elephants the most. The sea lion was also great. Apart from the animals our kids loved playing in the tree-house playground area. The playground gave my wife and I some time to sit and",
          "This was one of the attractions that the kids were looking forward to when visiting El Paso for the weekend. Its not a big zoo, but all the major animals, with good keeper talks that were not crowded. Many different shows as well and a playground to keep the kids occupied.",
          "The EP Zoo is great for kids. We were visiting the city and took our 2 year old. Glad we did because she had a great time. It took about two hours.",
          "Such a beautiful zoo! I was even able to watch how they care for their large elephants. The animals were very playful and looked very happy.",
          "Took my daughters and grand daughter there, I was pleasantly surprised with there exhibits. Nice place to go for a half day excursion",
          "This is a good place to spend a half of a day with the children or grandchildren. Is it the best zoo I have been too, not even close. Is it pretty good, convenient, and has room for improvement, absolutely! The exhibits are good but some are looking tired. There is a train,",
          "Went on a Saturday and was really packed, and was told at the entrance an area to go park at because the parking area was full.. walked to zoo, looked small. Bigger than i thought, but decent. Train ride is very cute and nice for the kids, but short. Nice prices for the train",
          "We have a soon to be 4 year old so while there is so much to do in El Paso; we decided to bring him to the zoo. I was presently surprised after our visit. We went during a weekday so it was not busy at all. We rode the train around the \"Safari\" portion and it was cute; very",

          "My friend and I took her son to the zoo as none of us had been before. We went on a day when the weather was perfect, which is a plus. For people who don't like hot weather, make sure you check the forecast before you go. Please note the following: 1. The parking was great. We",
          "This is a must see in El Paso! The El Paso Zoo is a great day trip for adults and kids. Tickets are reasonably priced and they actually have a lot of animals. There is a nice playground for any child ages 2-12 and they have a small train that gives an exclusive look at some",
          "We go to the zoo every other year when we drive through El Paso. It's not a large zoo but is well taken care of and easy to navigate. The food in the zoo cafeteria is average, (but really pricey) and there are several places to stop and grab just drinks along the paths. The",
          "This is a good little zoo with animals looking healthy and happy. Was a little cold for some who were kept inside our of the weather. It's always worth visiting zoos because they feature fauna from the surrounding country.",
          "We had time to waste before our flight back home so we decided to go to the zoo. Weather was great, security staff was great and helpful when we were lost, animals were awesome. Little sad some of the exhibits were closed down though (prairie dogs).",
          "We like it so much we own the pass. The best part for small children is the tree house playground and the splash pad in the summer. The exhibits are nice. Not a ton of exhibits so you can see the whole zoo in a couple hours. Wish the added some chimps or gorillas",
          "Nice, laid back place. Lots of different animals. New attractions coming! Got some great pictures! Definitely worth a visit.",
          "The El Paso zoo is a fun, friendly place to visit. It has large, clean enclosures with interactive obstacles for the animals. The layout of the park is easy to navigate and facilities are placed at convient intetvals. There is a very well appointed food court and souvinere",

          "This was a really nice zoo. We spent about two hours here, walking around to see all the exhibits. We also caught a show they did on all kinds of birds, and that was very cool. The cafe was busy, and had your typical zoo food; burgers, chicken strips, fries. The staff was",

          "Reviews had me worried, but I really liked the zoo. It took my husband and I 3 hours to see everything, and the animals seemed just fine. The aviaries were really cool, where the birds could fly freely around us. There was a good variety of animals, and lots of different",

          "It rained the day we went in July, 2017 but the zoo was huge and very well kept. The workers were very friendly. I would encourage anyone who visits El Paso to stop in and visit this pleasant place. They have a little of every kind of animal.",
          "It's being improving every time we visit it. But no matter that today is great in comparisson of 18 years ago, still is a small zoo, but is ok to take your childrens on a Weekend with nothing to do..",
          "Although small, the layout is very nice and animals have space. My grandson really liked the kiddy water attraction.",
          "Had fun seeing all the animals, birds and all the other residents. Food is good and drink souvenir cups are cool. Gift shop has wide variety of gifts",
          "We went to this over-priced over-rated museum of horror one afternoon because we had friend in town and needed to find something child friendly to do with them. The animals all look sick, the habitats are disturbingly inadequate. A lot of the animals look like they were once in",
          "Not huge, but alot of different species to see. I still easily spent over a hour here. I would go back for sure. I saw alot of animals I've never seen before.",
          "We took our 3rd graders to visit the zoo, El Paso has a very extreme weather and most of the animals were resting under shade. The students had a good time though. The concessions offer food but takes forever to serve.",
          "Small zoo with a lot of enclosures being redone. Not a lot of animals out on the day I went. The aviary had just a few birds in a tree. Giraffe encounter was the best I've seen, very up-close and personal!! Lots of keeper activities that I think are important. Did not find a",
          "The zoo has come a long way in the past few years and is better than ever. It's small but very nice, and homey, family place. They have some new attractions that kids love. A manmade tree house and a splash pad...not to mention animals. A nice way to spend time under trees",
          "We were disappointed by the quality of this zoo. We have been to zoos in towns a third the size of El Paso and found the zoos to be better kept and fewer empty areas. El Paso needs to invest in the zoo if they want to have a great place for children to see, experience and",
          "So, El Paso is growing no doubt. The zoo is one of the smaller zoo's that I've visited. There aren't to many animals at this zoo. If you have little kids though, they will definitely enjoy it here.",
          "We all had a blast at the zoo. Great exhibits and so much to see. Loved seeing the animals, great water play area to stay cool, and bonus playground. Even my 15 year old couldn't resist playing in the tree house. $cost was really reasonable as well. We didnt do the train ride so",
          "If you're looking to have fun and save money: Buy yourself the annual pass. It cost 95-99 dollars. Tickets are 12 for adults and 7.50 kids. Price for the pass includes two adults and five kids. You can take friends of your kids. They don't have to be your own. Another thing you",

          "The zoo itself was amazing. I feel like we were up close and personal with the animals. We also got to watch their bird show. It was amazing! Make sure you get a chance to check it out. My only suggestion would be to bring an umbrella or fan with to keep cool. I wish I would",
          "My husband and I travel to zoos all over the US. We very much enjoyed the El Paso Zoo. We tried to make as many animal experience talks as we could. I was able to see some live cam exhibits before we ever arrived due to their inner active site. They also have an inner active",
          "The El Paso zoo is a great place to visit with children. The zoo has many different animals that you don't get to see at other zoos. They also have a great historical exhibit about animals that the Spanish brought to the area with the actual animals on display. They have an",
          "We spent a couple of days at the zoo, about 4 hours in total. Sawa a fun bird show, but toddler loved the water feature. He was able to play in the fountains with many other kids. A great way to beat the blistering June heat",
          "I have lived in El Paso 5 years and never went to the zoo, thinking it could not be good for a place like El Paso. I was wrong. Good size, clean, nice place for animals as far as zoos go. I will go back. The Bengal tiger and it's habitat was excellent.",
          "It's a smaller zoo than others I've visited but very nice. Easy to navigate, great lil amenities for the children including a water fountain play area and tree house, if I had the kids with me there would have been some serious tree house fun. Good time even on a solo journey.",
          "So we decided to go to the on Sunday and take our 17mo old boy for his first visit. Of course not the first time we've been there. We've been to bigger zoo's but we still enjoy our little zoo. With all the recent renovations it is great for a day out with the family. Our two",
          "Hey Guys, Stop complaining that there is nothing to do in El Paso and go and visit El Paso Zoo. Take your kids and they are going to Love It!!! Nice environment, nice animals (at least better than the ones that you can find at the San Antonio or Albuquerque Zoo). Expensive well",
          "The el paso zoo is the place to go if u have kids and like animals. Theres a variety of animals and fun adventures u can do there at the zoo. They always give good prices when a big family goes it will be cheaper.",
          "very disappointing. sign says it should take 2-3hrs, but we were done in 45 minutes. most of the exhibits were empty, closed or under construction. bathrooms were filthy, no toilet paper. staff was rude, ignorant and unhelpful. we visit zoos everywhere we go, and have never had",
          "I went to the zoo with my kindergarten class. It was the first time I had been since all the renovations since my kids are older. I was pleasantly surprised at the updated exhibits and rooms and displays. I would recommend returning. Weather was nice too.",
          "This was a cute little zoo in the middle of town was one of the smallest zoos I've been to but it was pretty nice. Animals looked well taken care of and pretty happy.",
          "The wife likes going to zoo's. But I did not expect that the zoo at El Paso would be any good. It had a nice array of animals from all over. Glad we went.",

          "They keep growing, yet there was even less to see than there was a decade ago. We took our granddaughter and it was disappointing. Most of the exhibits were completely empty, and many others were under renovation. The water play area was not functioning either. And many of the",
          "Enjoyed seeing the zoo through the eyes of our young grandsons. The train is cute, but would have appreciated some tour commentary.",
          "We love the El Paso Zoo! We even bought memberships so we can go every week or two. I like how it's divided into different continents. It's always very clean. Our kids love the playground and splash pad! There are several different little picnic areas- we like the one between",

          "The staff couldn't offer help. On any level. The woman at the entrance didn't even know that the Birds Wings Show had been cancelled. And the WINGS SHOW was cancelled. The giraffes were put away for 4 hours. So many exhibits were closed. One staff member couldn't offer",
          "Nice place to take smaller children. Staff was not friendly or helpful at all. Animals were about what you would expect. Certainly nothing overly impressive as far as zoos go. If you are in town with children looking to kill time this fits the bill. If you are looking for a",

          "I visited with my 5 year old and 2 year old grand daughters. We saw the lions walrus prairie dogs and played in the park. The best thing was the free bird show. Which is only at certain times.",

          "Nice zoo, lots of room. Interaction with animals ( elephants, birds) was unexpected. Nicely done. Could use more animal exhibits",
          "Such a fun family event for a morning or afternoon. Lots of new additions, and areas still blossoming with upgrades and newer attractions. This a wonderful zoo, and the family will have a blast. The playground and splash pads are an added bonus. Second time here, and we love it!",
          "This is one of the best zoos for little kids. My two year old son loved the lions and was able to feed the giraffes for a small fee. Highly recommend for families with little kids.",
          "WE've been going to and are members of the El Paso Zoo for years. WE try and get down a couple of times a year, at least, and always enjoy our time there. It's a small zoo, but plenty big to have a nice, peaceful and enjoyable time for the day. And the membership also get's",

          "It was ok. The elephant, tiger, and orangutan looked really thin. It didn't really seem like there were a lot of animals. The food prices were a little spendy. All in all it was kinda a sucky visit. We have 4 kids.. Ages 13, 11, 9 and 8.",
          "My husband, my daughter and I visited the zoo right after it opened up on a Sunday morning. The time we selected was good as far as it not being crowded, however, a handful of the animals were not available for viewing until an hour or so after the zoo opened. It's not a very",
          "We first arrived in El Paso and where looking for things to do. This is a great little zoo you can come back to, especially with little kids. The enclosed playgrounds is great, as well as the splash park on good weather. We made a circuit of one area of the park and come back to",
          "Visited during a vacation.Many of the exhibits were closed and we never saw any open restaurants or food stands.It was sad to see so many animals that clearly should not have been alone in a cage. One lone sea lion swam in circles in a small tank. The elephants were separated",
          "This is a very nice zoo, perhaps we went at the wrong time of year (February) there weren't too many animals out and we were left disappointed as we are from the St. Louis Area and use to the Very Very Large and Free zoo. I would give it another shot if we were to travel there",
          "For several years we have been members and feel it's worth the money. The displays are very well put together and the staff very friendly.They have a successful breeding program and the baby Orangutan is their biggest coup. They are constantly working to improve and to be",

          "The zoo is small but it was incredibly well planned out. I was impressed by the amount of animals and their nice large settings. I went for Father's Day and had a really great day. You really do not need more than one day to see everything. But you do need a full day to see and",
          "Had a wonderful time at the zoo and the variety of animals for a smaller zoo then I'm use to was surprising. My daughter enjoyed it so much that she went back another time with her boyfriend.",

          "Being an El Paso Native, I have always felt that we can do so much more for our zoo. It is good for the kid's yet if they could expand it to be more enjoyable such as the San Diego Zoo. They would remember how awesome it was and go back. The pricing is affordable but they could",
          "We have been to a lot of zoos in large cities and we were dissapointed with the El Paso Zoo. I understand that it is winter, but the Zoo is small, only marginally kept, and what animals they do have are difficult to see. I am unable to recommend this Zoo.",
          "It was a good experience for the money. We were able to see the lions, zebras, elephants, meerkats, orangutans, monkeys, some reptiles, giraffes were hiding, reindeer, wolf, few other animals that I can't remember the names of...overall good. Would recommend- zoo was not",
          "Nice visit to the zoo. Had the opportunity to enjoy it. There were hardly anyone at the zoo. Early morning, kids in school. My kids could run around without me being concerned about them getting loss. The animals seem very friendly. They actually make eye contact.",
          "This zoo is a smaller in the southwest area not too far from the Juarez border. The zoo animals themselves seem happy and healthy but the maintenance and upkeep when attended was poor. There were spots throughout zoo that smelled like sewage, and mold. Food is higher price than",
          "This zoo has improved a lot in the last 8 years. It's a very nice zoo with a train and good play areas for kids. It's not a very big zoo, so it only takes a few hours to see everything. But for me, that means it's not overwhelming and you can see the animals at a relaxed",
          "my nephew had fun. lots of stuff for him to do and see. i went with my sister. i don't think i would go back alone because it was fun for kids",
          "Does not disappoint. Do some research though because you don't want to miss shows, feedings and other events that occur on a regular schedule. A lot to do and a lot to see. My family and I have been there 3 times in as many months and has not yet gotten old.",
          "The El Paso Zoo was completely renovated and offers a play area for children with a giant tree house, my son loved! There are many animals, and a reptile area. The Zoo is very clean and is a great place to take the kids on a cool day. We went to \"Boo at the Zoo\" before",
          "I felt so bad for all the animals. Most of the animals are alone, but on the endangered list...hmm, imagine that. The sea lion is my favorite, but again...alone. His pal died in 2012. Very depressing.",
          "We could definitely use more animals but the El Paso Zoo is nice, clean & fun for the kids. The new Foster Playground & Splash Pad is a real treat, makes it a lot nicer to go to the Zoo!",
          "It was okay most of the animals were sleeping though I was really eager to see the tigers and lions but sadly they were sleeping majority of the animals were hiding as well",
          "Love the variety snd layout of this zoo. The kids water feature was a blast snd we loved the exhibits.",
          "The best time to go the zoo its in the mornings especially during summer. you can cover the whole zoo in less than 3 hrs. My best part is the giraffes because you can see them very close and get a great pictures of them. House tree for the kids is fun but they only offer one",
          "The zoo in El Paso was a pleasant surprise for my family. It's not the biggest zoo we have been to but that was what we liked the best. Our two year old has about an hour time limit on him before he loses his mind and that was about how long it took us to see the whole zoo. They",
          "We visited, Thursday, Friday & Saturday. Crowds were very small on Thursday, ramping up, Friday & Saturday. Great keeper talks, enrichment for animals and animal encounters. Love the baby orangutan, wish we could have seen the new porcupine. Nice layout, with places to rest in",
          "Elephants do not have enough room. Wide variety of outdoor exhibits. Giraffe feedings. Some multi-species exhibits.",
          "We've been to a lot of urban zoos and thought this one was going to be really cool. The lady at the airport had told us it had been drastically improved over the past several years, so we were excited to see it. Well, we were slightly disappointed. The zoo itself was pretty",
          "I've grown up in texas going to the ft. Worth zoo, and dallas zoo, i was SO excited to be near a zoo again so I could go. I literally cried the whole time. Animals under mental stress, pack animals living in separate habitats, animals losing hair on their bodies. Half the",
          "Nice habitats and good variety of animals. Train is fun with good views. Staff very friendly. Good for a couple of hours.",
          "It was our first time going to the Texas zoo, we got some items at the gift shop and started our adventure, i was so surprise so much beautiful animal , part of the soon was in Remodeling but to improve . Seeing the kids running around so family friendly , we had a lot of fun",
          "El Paso is a small town with a big town feel. We have a Symphony Orchestra, an art museum, history museum, even a zoo! The El Paso Zoo is beautiful, fun, and plans many activities throughout the year to entertain, educate, and create awareness. We love it!",
          "Small but it's nice quite little zoo. Good to being the family to. They also have very fun events there like brew at the zoo, which I recommend.",
          "I've been going to the El Paso zoo all my life and it has really evolved. It's a great place to have a picnic with kids and have a nice family outing. It gets better and better every year and they continue to add different attractions.",
          "We enjoyed spending our afternoon here. Though I wouldn't come to town and this be on my list of \"must sees\". But, it is a nice zoo.",
          "Yes it's El Paso. Yes it's hot. Go to the zoo? Why not, seriously you're going to be hot anyways \ud83d\ude1c. I have two twelve year olds, one eleven (who thinks she's seventeen), and an eight year old. They all love it down here. Weather it's the monkeys, the elephants, or the",
          "The zoo has really gotten better over the years. It now has been enlarged and is great for children. Nice day activity for the family. Easy to get around. Easy parking.",
          "I compared this to the the Bronx zoo in NYC and I have say it was almost as enjoyable. The lion den had a large separation that puts you virtually next to the lions for a great interactive experience.",
          "This is an excellent zoo, especially if you are interested in primates. The exhibit is very well designed; no bored animals here. We also had a great conversation with a zoo keeper who was working on helping with the introduction of a new (to this zoo) lion. She gave us",
          "Great place to spend time with family.Plenty of places to rest. Children cam spend time playing and enjoying the animals.",
          "Just an overnight stay in El Paso but took the time to go to the zoo. Granddaughter needed something to do since we arrived early in the day. The zoo itself was just ok. I have seen better, but they tried to make it interesting. Some exhibits were closed. Most animals were",
          "The el paso zoo has been growing and improving over this decade. It has a fine knowledgeable staff that help present its exhibits well to our public. I enjoyed the zoo sleepovers for family and young children in the summer. You should enjoy that with your children.",
          "Visiting the zoo is awesome! The monkeys are my favorite and then the elephants. There is a nice show with the seals. The kids as well as the adults will enjoy. But drink lots of water to stay hydrated. Enjoy",
          "A little pricey for the amount of exhibits they are still upgrading and it is well needed. Would like to see more animals as well. Concessions are really pricey and not really worth the cost. But from where we started we are coming up in the world.",
          "It is not a bad zoo but I have been to better. They have a scarce selection of animals and they do not look very healthy. Also over all their exhibits are just ugly. They also had no employees to take care of the animals. They had barley any birds and let people harass their",
          "I was pleasantly surprised with the El Paso Zoo. It's small but nice with some nice areas for kids, including a splash pad a shaded area with treehouse slides. There is a picnic area close to this. We enjoyed the presentations and feeding the giraffes. A very affordable day.",
          "I grew up in El Paso and have been to this Zoo several times throughout the years and I have come to notice that it improves over time. The Zoo is not very big but for its size it provide a pleasant stroll for a family with younger children and even teens to look at a variety of",
          "Went to the zoo and was very disappointed many of the areas were closed. Sad to see many of the animals didn't have any shade to have an option to not have the hot sun beat on them. Wasn't thrilled we paid full price to get in and didn't get much out of it. I wouldn't recommend",
          "I received a year membership and used it well. It is not too big, so I was able to go with my two active kids. There are quite many things to do at the Zoo. It is more than what I expected. I will go as often as possible.",
          "This is a small zoo, it is fine since there is no much to do in El Paso. I liked the little water park they have, my three year old love it. You can see all the zoo in about 2-3 hours.",
          "The El Paso Zoo is a small oasis in the desert with exciting animals you would see at bigger zoo's. Your kids will love to feed the giraffes and watch the cute ground hogs and playful seals. It is a great way to relax with active kids and they have interactive exhibits to keep",
          "After my mother had a stroke and 5 months of recovery she decided one of her outings to be the El Paso Zoo. Well I was very disappointed at the fact that she could hardly see any of the amazing animals it holds. She really wanted to see the giraffes and that never happened. Most",
          "This is an easy zoo to cover in a morning or afternoon outing. There are a lot of attractions designed for young children including the mercats, prairie dogs and seals. Currently, the zoo is undergoing some construction in the African part of the zoo and the reptile exhibits.",
          "Attractions are scarce. It's so hot that animals look lazy and usually sleeping. Even the desert snakes and insect area is not exciting as they have empty habitats.",
          "A tiny nice Zoo for the kids to have a Good time... There is a place where they can splash and get wet which is very cool at this time of the year!! with temperatures up to 100 F!! nothing awesome, but good for a small town and affordable all year around.",
          "Loved seeing animals that were local to the area and Mexico. I wish we did research before we came bc there is a splash pad there and we didn't bring suits for kids. Playground was fun. Food was good. I would def do it again.",
          "A good portion was under construction. The rest of our excursion was uneventful and a nice experience. Expect to go through the whole zoo in under an hour. Did not see any shows or feedings.",
          "Took my grandson and he had a good time. Pricing was fair. Some construction going on and I will return when they are finished. The giraffe-feeding exhibit was the highlight of the day. My grandson also enjoyed the train ride around the zoo and the splash-pad area and playground.",
          "The El Paso Zoo has undergone many changes. If you haven't been there in a while , give it a try. Arrive early because it get hot. We packed lunch for our students. The zoo provides shade and tables for lunch. It also has a splash pad. We didn't allow our student get wet. We",
          "My wife and I visited in November 2015 and with the weather being cooler we expected more animal activity. It's a rather small zoo un comparison to other zoo's we've been to. We expected more exhibits because of the climate. All in all it was disappointing. It has a very nice",
          "Upon entering this zoo I was given a piece of paper showing all the training and feeding times in the zoo. The result was an amazing interactive experience where my wife and I got to not only interact with animals but with keepers, and learn about the various animals. I have",
          "This place is very large, lots of walking a little difficult when it is 100 degrees outside. Feeding the giraffes was awesome! Now I don't have to fly to Africa! LOL The elephants were great. The tiniest monkeys I have ever seen! the cutest in the whole world! I drove an hour",
          "I am glad to see that the El Paso Zoo is finally getting some much needed renovations. They have added the children's splash pad and tree house and also recently opened the new reptile house. They still have more additions to come. My kids enjoy it alot more now.",
          "My family and I visited this zoo June 23 and it was definitely a waste of money and time. They should consider lowering the entry prices or making it free. My family and I walked all around the zoo and literally only saw like 5 different animals. I was so disappointed about this",
          "Went with a large group of 7 year olds as a chaperone in the early morning. We got through most of the zoo in about 2 hours. Not the nicer or worst zoo I have been to. It was hot that morning- and not too crowded. Because of the small size- you can get pretty close-and that was",
          "Very small. Not much shade. Decent price Kids would love the park they have. Gps took us to the back door which is not an entrance and it's right on the border of Mexico so we were nervous as we didn't have our passports. Need better street signs around the town to find it",
          "the Zoo is ok. I have been there 2 times and I don't seem to have anything awesome to say. they do finally have the tree place up which is a little play ground for the kids. I do suggest you bring a cooler with drinks and snacks since they allow you to do so.",
          "Is one of the must stop places un \u00e9l paso . is smaller than your usual zoo. But, it has The esencial animals of a zoo. The tree house park is awsome and love the the water fountains",
          "Cost to get in is fair considering you can spend half a day here. They have several animal exhibits divided by continent. I find the schedule for meeting the animal keepers nice but too restraining to follow. There is a few vendors for ok prices but limited options. Kids",
          "The zoo in ElPaso is a fun place to spend time w\\family has lots of animals and attractions to keep u busy all day",
          "I take my kids here several times a year and they love it every time. Its a small zoo but there are always activities for kids to do. It is a growing zoo so they are always trying to add attractions. We always end the trip with the splash park so don't forget the bathing",
          "my husband n I enjoyed the visit to the zoo. Nice place with shaded paths , you don't need the excuse to take the kids to go there. We had a great time .",
          "The El Paso Zoo may be smaller than some other zoos we've visited, but it had plenty to do and lots of unique animals and exhibits. Highlights included feeding the giraffes and seeing sea lions for the first time. The splash pad area was a great way to cool off from the heat",
          "Construction that was underway you could tell was stressing the animals out and scaring them. And it was like 90 degrees outside at like 1:45pm and the dippin dots stand just closed really?? Sad times ?? Lost revenue!",
          "This was my first time to this zoo. I know it's an old zoo and wonder if the awkwardness of the layout is due to it's age. I found myself having to double back to go on to the next section of the zoo. I wish the layout flowed better. There also seemed to be a number of",
          "There was quite a bit to look at, however there seemed to be a lot of construction going on as well. It appears as though they are doing some needed expanding and hopefully it won't take to long to completel",
          "The El Paso Zoo was small (compared to some zoos I've been to) but it had a good variety of animals! The whole reptile section was under construction so we didn't get to see any.. :( The park itself was under construction I believe, because there was a lot of commercial vehicles",
          "The zoo was amazing this time around. Definitely go when they have events. There was something for kids to do along every corner of the zoo from coloring, painting, making compost, planting your own seeds to take home. There was also alot of local businesses promoting",
          "My family enjoyed a visit during the week following Easter break when it wasn't stifling crowded. It's a small zoo that can be easily navigated in a few hours. The food was a bit pricey so it's a good idea to come prepared with water and snacks. We homeschool our son so the zoo",
          "With young kids, the zoo is a great activity and this one is perfect. The zoo is not huge, but makes up for it in character and the number of animals they have. They have a Splash pad and large playground in the middle which is ideal for wearing out those little ones. I",
          "I saw more garbage than I did animals. Very disappointing because it has potential. This zoo does slot in the community so my fingers are crossed that they can change some things.",
          "El Paso isn't San Diego, and the El Paso Zoo isn't the San Diego Zoo, but the EPZ is a great medium sized zoo, reasonably priced, with lots to do for all ages. The zoo has upgraded its animal and \"people\" facilities over the last few years, and the zoo shows this. Animals are",
          "This is a small scale zoo, but it offers plenty in the way of family activities and fun. We were members when we lived in El Paso. They have some very unique animals that I have not seen at other zoos. But my biggest praise goes to the amount and awesomeness of the activities",
          "This zoo had a good admission price and a plethora of animals to see. The exhibits provided the animals with enough room and you could tell the animals were well taken care of.",
          "Our whole family enjoyed all the various animals. My boys even got to feed the giraffes! Great day and lots of places to eat.",
          "This is an awesome zoo, divided into 3 area (Americas, Asia, Africa) with short loop walks. I am a zoo docent so I am familiar with many zoos and this is a must see. One of the nicest things is that it is small enough to see in a few hours but comprehensive enough that you feel",
          "Had an awesome time!..it was a surprise to us 2 c the new tree house & not to mention the sprinklers nice way 2 kool the family down & encouraged us 2 keep on going the rest of the tour..",
          "This smallish facility is located near one of the international crossings to Juarez, Mexico and, on the day we visited, about 20% of the cars bore Chihuahua state license plates. It is laid out in two sectors, located on either side of a (dry) canal. African exhibits are east of",
          "Most of the animals were in a dirt pen. Some displays were nice others just a regular animal pen! Some of the displays were closed. Staff was friendly!",
          "Stopped by this zoo one day just driving by. The layout is horrible. Exhibits are small,very inhumane, you can see the freeway behind the zebras. Dirty place. I have been to MANY zoos and I wish no one to support this one.",
          "I took my 6 month daughter to the zoo for the first time. She absolutely loved it. She fed the Giraffe and had such a great time looking at all the other animals. We actually became members of the zoological society. Many exhibits are being revamped which is a good indication",
          "I really wanted to like El Paso Zoo but I was disappointed in our visit. A lot of the exhibits were closed or undergoing renovations - it would have been nice to be advised of that prior to purchasing admission (we would have come back another time). The Zoo looks like it has",
          "Many animals not on display. Lots of construction going on. Kind of a depressing sight. It probably took us all of an hour to walk through the place",
          "We went on a busy Spring Break day, and there's a bit of construction going on there. However, we've been before and opted for the season pass this year. It's a well kept, reasonably diverse, generally relaxing zoo.",
          "I've been here several times and each time has been very enjoyable. I strongly suggest going in season or calling ahead to see if everything is open- we went last week and there were quite a few exhibits closed. It's much nicer going during a work/school week as the crowds are",
          "This is not a huge zoo but it is fun! I love the mere cats. It is a really nice, though small zoo. The staff is friendly and it is a nice stroll with lots of interesting information.",
          "While this zoo is pretty small, it's a fun look at many desert animals we had never seen before. We enjoyed the hands on parts of the visit with the staff.",
          "Plan to get there early! Crowds of people show up a few hours after opening time. We got there right at opening and had two hours of excellent viewing of animals. The grounds are well maintained and the animal exhibits are of high standard for such a small zoo. It's a nice",
          "My favorite part of this experience was seeing the baby Orangutan! Other than that it was pretty sad. The enclosures were not big enough for the animals. A lot of habitats were closed and a lot of animals were not out. Many animals were pacing displaying stress and boredom-",
          "I read the reviews off of TripAdvisor, & I said I needed to see this for myself. The reviews are all correct. The zoo is under a lot of construction.... due to the construction, there are not a lot of exhibits to see. The parking is awful. We payed 12 bucks a piece to see less",
          "This is a small, neat zoo. About one-quarter of the exhibits were closed for maintenance and/or renovations. The train was not running either. There were several interesting species on display. Their programs are aimed at teaching kids how to recycle, reuse, and repurpose",
          "We visited while visiting our son at Ft Bliss. There was a lot of construction going on while we were there but we still had a good time. This Zoo is a easy walk. Most of the zoo is flat.",
          "It was no as good as I was hoping for. They are adding some new things and upgrading exhibits which is needed.",
          "wonderful little zoo, and a great way to spend some family time. took the gson and wife in jan, and although some of the park was under construction, we had a great day...my kiddo loved the seal show, highly recommended and the treehouse in the back of the park... takes about 2",
          "Although this is a small town zoo, it has a variety of animals. There's lions, a tiger, zebras, giraffes, most of the typical zoo animals. The food is extremely overpriced and doesn't taste good but you can bring your own. It's really good if you have small children or if you",
          "El Paso zoo is a little on the small side. That being said, it is a wonderful zoo. I have a four year old and a one year old who both love it. We go in the morning, are able to see the whole zoo, have lunch, play on the treehouse playground and are home in time for nap time.",
          "Nothing special but a way to spend some time while in town and of course the kids always enjoy a zoo experience. The seal lion educational show was nice.",
          "Poor excuse for a zoo!!! The exhibits are so sad and I feel bad for the poor animals. Most enclosures are so small. The only decent one is the sea lion show and even that is small. The kids do like the tree house play area.",
          "Small, not interactive enough, wont be visiting again.most animals are hidden or under construction...",
          "A wonderful zoo with a wide variety of animals. I found the architecture and layout of the zoo to be wonderful. Most importantly some of the areas were closed: which is a good thing! Closed areas (which were only the reptile house and the area by the zebra enclosure) means that",
          "We loved our trip! It is so refreshing to see a zoo be so about conservation efforts! I loved the signs posted with all the information on cool conservation projects and what they are doing for the animals. You can tell these animals are loved here. I can't wait to go again!",
          "Not a large zoo but the animal displays are well cared for and there is a variety of animals to enjoy. A family season pass allows our son's family to enjoy the zoo all year. Our grandsons love to go back and visit their favorite animals.",
          "Not too bad. The demonstrations are nice, particularly the sea lion and lions! Feeding the giraffes is super fun!!",
          "The zoo was very cute, small compared to other zoo's. The zoo was under construction during our visit, but signs at the gate let you know which animals you might not get to see due to the construction. Was disappointed that some animals weren't out, or areas were empty during",
          "As a stay at home mom of preschoolers, I LOVE this zoo. No, it's nowhere near as fancy as Phenix or Omaha, and that's why I love it so much! It's a great way to spend a low key morning looking at all the major animals. Not ghetto or small, it's well kept and sizable, but not",
          "Easy to walk the full park in a couple of hours. Well-tended animals, very clean walkways, There are nice rest areas and you can bring in food or a picnic if you like. There is a wonderful new tree house for climbing and sliding for young kids. And in the hot months there are",
          "We went during summer and the day was really hot. Maybe that is why the tour wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped for. Most of the biggest animals were asleep or hidden in their night rooms, because we didn't get to see as much. Some areas were empty and others ok. I would like to",
          "its great for kids and families, very small zoo with limited food available. The tree house is a blast for the little ones.",
          "What I like about the El Paso Zoo is that it's the perfect size for little ones. There is a nice variety of animals. My kids love this zoo. There's a cute little train to ride, a carousel, water conservation learning station, new and planned expansions. The staff is always",
          "For the size of El Paso the zoo is large and has a great amount of exotic animals. The animals are very well taken care of and the grounds are also clean and well maintained. Great place to take the kids.",
          "This zoo is very small and once you've seen it there really isn't a reason to go back. The park is normally decent when it comes to cleanliness but the gift shop is over priced and some days it's hard to see the animals, a lot of the smaller animals tend to not be available for",
          "The El Paso Zoo is not the best zoo I've been to, but it has potential. The seals are awesome and so is the prairie dog exhibit. I feel like work to the infrastructure and the cleanliness of the zoo with more activities and staff would make this zoo great.",
          "We really enjoyed the zoo. Coming from NYC, this zoo was a great morning adventure for us. The baby loved the giraffes and monkeys! Some exhibits were closed due to maintenance. You can complete the zoo in about 2-3 hours. It was a chilly-ish morning so we zipped our way",
          "For El Paso I thought this was a pretty good zoo. Not El Paso's hot spot considering hardly anyone was there but it gave us an opportunity to enjoy the animals and a quiet stroll. Worth a visit.",
          "This zoo is constantly upgrading exhibits. Recent Africa exhibit is a winner! Leopards are cool as is Mexican Wolf. Amenities are more than adequate.",
          "Felt like being a kid again, really enjoyed out time there. Walked the Zoo twice and stopped and ate a couple of times too. Facilities seemed clean and friendly staff.",
          "If you've been there before - try it again. The zoo received more funding and a complete facelift from the last time I'd been there. I hate seeing animals caged and it makes me happy that zoo officials have improved the pens for most of the animals. It;s a great education",
          "Who would of guessed El Paso has a decent zoo, sure took me by surprise, but low and behold there is a pretty nice zoo here. Totally worth a day trip.",
          "It's a nice place to hang out for a couple of hours but the problem is that some of the exhibitions were closed during my visit. It's not a big zoo, but has the most popular animals in there. It would be great to have a rail road along the park and not only in one section.",
          "Its a great place to take the kids. The train ride is fabulous. Animals are all well kept and easily visible.",
          "Took the grandchildren and they had a lot of fun. Price is o.k., Get your walkin shoes on as you will get good exercise. Big play area for the kids to take a break.",
          "This zoo is very nice, but it was just too hot out for my children to walk around for half of the day, the zoo does provide plenty of shady places but none of these are in an area where you can see the animals",
          "I guess coming from a big city I expected a little more. I was visiting my young people and need something to do with a 2 year old. Decided to go to the zoo since other \"tourist\" attractions are closed during the week. It was quiet and we were done within 45 minutes. The most",
          "I have been an El Paso Zoo member for several years now and enjoy my time there visit after visit. It is great to see all the upgrades they have done over the years. There is a good selection of animals to view and learn about. My absolute favorite event year after year is Boo",
          "One of the worst zoos I have ever visited. Animals are not well cared for. Staff is rude. Not a clean environment for the animals. The only thing this place had going for it was the toddler splash pad and even there I was concerned. No diaper rules. Avoid this place and",
          "The zoo is not expensive it was $24 for 2 adults it's a alright size :) the only thing that bothered me was not all the animals where there. The food was good to but expensive and takes long to be served. There is a train that takes you around the whole zoo. there is a big",
          "This zoo have a variety of animals, great entrance prices. Free parking. Have food to buy but you can also bring your own food.",
          "I understand that early Sept.Wednesday in the afternoon heat is not the prime time to visit the Zoo but seriously. The reptile exhibit was under construction, there was no place to get a snack or drink but at the entrance to the zoo, out of all the exhibits, I saw less than 10",
          "Loved it and would go there again. Many animals to see and lots of fun to have. Enjoy your churros and have a walk around the zoo.",
          "All the upgrades to the El Paso Zoo in the last few years have contributed to making a visit a wonderful family experience. The Zoo has a variety of exhibits, enough to keep everyone in the family interested. The new Treehouse and splashpad are a great hit with the younger",
          "It is a nice place to go and take the kids, they will enjoy it much more than an adult because of the amenities found. The price is not very high but I heard they are now rising. You can bring food and eat inside.",
          "Beautiful zoo. Good size and a nice oasis in the desert. Very nice playground. If you buy the season pass you can use it for most zoo's in the country and get in half price.",
          "My parents came to town on a visit from Tucson and we decided to enjoy the zoo for the day. The admission is decently priced and the set up of the enclosures is fantastic! You can easily go from one part of the general world to another and see what you came to see. I am",
          "Our El Paso Zoo has improved throughout the years so much! There are more things to look at and do. A good place for anyone to go!",
          "We took our grandkids to see the zoo several times when we were in El Paso. The museum is usually busy with lots of folks visiting. The animals are well cared for and the displays and habitats are of high quality.",
          "I grew up with this zoo and I can honestly say that it has been improved for the best. Although I am not a fan of zoos in general, I would prefer this zoo over the larger ones in big cities. The animals are well taken care of and the staff is very friendly. They offer military",
          "My daughter and I were pleasantly surprised with the biodiversity and activities offered at the El Paso Zoo. She fell in love with the giraffes that you can feed lettuce and played on the treehouse slides for an hour. Tiger, elephant, sea lion, leopard, wild horses, even a Gila",
          "The zoo was lots of fun... we ate at the restaurant and the burgers were good. Wish they had more mist hoses by where the elephants were and by where the big turtles were but overall great time to get away and see the animals and learn about them.",
          "Last day in town we needed something to do. We decided to hit up the zoo! Why not right. It too about 2 hours to tour the whole thing and was a good price. There are alot of animals and exhibits. There were quite a few under construction too but that just means improved and",
          "I was here with my husband and kids (8 &10) We made it on time for the giraffe encounter. Its worth your $3 . They have a new playhouse for kids and also a water splash area. We tried the hamburgers at the cafe and they're not bad.",
          "This zoo is not a huge zoo, but it's a nice place to visit. There is a good variety of animals and several animal encounters per day. The zoo staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The splash park in the middle of the zoo is a great place to cool off and the kids love it!",
          "Wonderful little zoo!! The new Africa exhibit area was very nicely done and the kids always have fun riding the train around it! There are currently some construction area but that does not interfered with the park's functioning. Check out the park's website for special shows/",
          "I I spend a great time with my family, the place its very clean and the prices are afordbale, poeple very kind",
          "The El Paso Zoo continues to grow and amaze me. They are making it more kid friendly with areas they can play in as well as getting wet. They have added a little train and more animals. There's enough to do to spend the whole day with your family there. Highly recommended.",
          "The El Paso zoo is fun, they have all the things that children and adults love, enough play space and enough variety of animals. The entrance costs are very reasonable, and my son loved the outdoor play areas. This is not the zoo to go to if you are expecting a world class",
          "This is an excellent zoo for kids. I am far past being a kid, but I still like this zoo. There are plenty of up close views of animal exhibits that provide lots of interest. Staff are very good at explanations in the shows involving cats and sea lions. The zoo is easily",
          "If you are in El Paso and have a weekend free go to the Zoo, I have been a few times and always fresh and educational. I am 55 and this is a good walk around place that is safe and clean fun.",
          "Nice family place to goto. They have different discounts available and parking is easy. Nice exhibits and educational. Worth the time for any family",
          "Very nice small zoo. Many different animals.The grounds are very well kept.The sea lion show was great!",
          "We visited the zoo and were totally disappointed due to many animals missing. Totally not worth it even with Military discount. It's a bit small and empty as well. The snack area was a bit to expensive for the quality they had. Won't go back again.",
          "Went to the Zoo with my husband shortly after moving to EP. I can't help but say that I was disappointed with the poor landscaping and exhibit of the animals. If your taking small children in strollers, they will have difficulty seeing the animals because of the high railings",
          "It had been a very long time since I had visited the zoo, and to my surprise many things had changed. For starters the landscape was different more of everything, how ever, even though that had changed many animals were missing, bIG space little to no animals showing. I",
          "Plenty of active animals and nice venues and habitats. The zoo was clean both inside the gate, the outside gathering area around the ticket area, and the parking lot. Plenty of parking and highway direction signs to the zoo were accurate and timely. Before moving to El Paso,",
          "We took our kids and toddler granddaughter for her first zoo trip. Since it's not a huge zoo it was a great \"first zoo\" for her. Plenty of variety and the water play area was certainly a hit.",
          "It was definitely worth the $12 per person. Our group consisted of adults and it was still fun. We missed the seal show (11am and 3pm). It would have been fun to see. It is decent size. Although they do sell refreshments and snacks, I will recommend bringing your own as it is",
          "I live in Las Cruces and I take my kids to this zoo about every other month. They love it. Their exhibits are great, and they have a lot of animals. The seal is especially fun, she loves showing off for visitors. The food there is great, it's a little expensive (which is normal",
          "This zoo is on the smaller side if you're used to the behemoths in Omaha and Dallas, but it's definitely one of the best family attractions in El Paso. You can bring in a picnic, which is a huge plus, and the pathways are big enough for strollers or wagons. There's a small",
          "The zoo is not large by big city standards, but it is a very nice zoo. Our grandchildren (ages 2 - 10) love going and the annual pass is very affordable. Besides seeing the animals, the children enjoy getting wet in the splash pad and playing in the outdoor playground. The zoo",
          "Small but very nice zoo. The animals seem well cared for and the habitats are nice. The zoo keepers give talks at various animal habitats while feeding the animals and always make time for questions, especially from the kids.",
          "This is a hidden gem in El Paso. We have season passes and go any chance we can get. My daughter loves to feed the giraffes. It very hot in the Summer but an awesome place for sure.",
          "This Zoo was a bit of a Disappointment when we walked in. I don't know if it was because of the construction being done or what. But, there was not much to see. We toured the Zoo within an Hour.",
          "It's not too big but my kids enjoy going. The new tree house is loads of fun for my boys. During the summer the new water feature is a great place to cool off.",
          "very fun for kids and parents to have family time . have a lot of animals ,lions,jiraffes etc ..... they have a gift shop and a playground full of excitement for kids",
          "The zoo was an afternoons adventure. El Paso, in June, is not a cool place to be in the middle of the day, and the animals agreed with us. They were finding as much cover/shade as possible. The ElPaso Zoo was very clean, friendly people smile and help make sure you are having",
          "I've been to alot of zoos. Everything as big as the Bronx Zoo in NY to Alamogordo Zoo in NM. I love zoos. There are good experiences and bad. Sometimes it's too hot for the animals to come out and be animated as we'd like. Sometimes it rains. Construction happens so we can enjoy",
          "Everyone is impressed with the quality of the El Paso Zoo. Reasonable memberships and lots of fun things for children. Like the tree house and the splash pad!",
          "We were here on a Wednesday. We arrived at opening time and did have to wait a little bit in line to buy our tickets due to the fact that about 5 schools were having field trips that day and a big number of parents were there for the kids. It did not seem at all crowded though",
          "It was awful! Everything seem to be under construction, even the animals just looked depressed. Paid $80.00 for our whole familly felt sorry we had to spend that money on something like this.",
          "The zoo is a decent size but many of the exhibits were closed for some reason. We waited for about 15 minutes for the sea lion show. The stands were packed. A few minutes after the show was supposed to start, people started leaving because some had heard that the show was",
          "I thought about giving this zoo 3 stars, but heres why I tacked another one on there: they have an awesome playground area that looks like you're climbing in trees. One of the slides actually twirls around within the tree trunk. They also have a splash park area where your kids",
          "elpaso is me & my wifes lil get away for a couple of days very nice zoo will be goin bak animals well kept zoo staff very friendly & helpful & the popcorn was very buttery the sea lion exhibit is the best thing @ the zoo",
          "This is a small zoo but little children won't notice. Small enough for little ones to walk around. Take time to feed the giraffes!",
          "It was nice to see the animals but very sad not enough room for these large fast animals to roam free",
          "Nice place to see some interesting animals, enjoyed the hills. Nicely kept zoo. Reasonable price. Parking was good.",
          "The place is great! They are adding so many new things and exhibits. I have been a member of the zoological society for the past 4 years, so I can visit as many times as I want. New events every year, some are for adults and after hours, like \"Brew at the zoo\". Love the place",
          "I haven't been to a zoo in a very long time but this place was amazing. The zoo was large and the animals were all great and most of them seemed to have nice enclosures. I didn't appreciate that the animals on the outer edges that see 'less traffic' were in small unsuitable",
          "Visited recently with my family. Had an amazing time walking around and seeing the different kind of animals from around the world. Be there early or else you will find a lot of the animals taking a nap.",
          "The zoo has made vast improvements in the last few years. You can visit the entire zoo in less than 2 hours. Most areas of the zoo have adequate shade; an essential thing in sunny El Paso. In the summer, my children wear their bathing suits for the spray pad. Tree house",
          "The zoo was fun. Bears. Tigers. Moneys. Train ride. Water show. Parking was easy. Fill your pockets with hotdogs and bananas to help feed the an l animals ;)",
          "It's too bad the other reviews are so negative. I come from a big city where the zoos are nicer/wealthier too. (Brookfield Zoo) For the cost of entrance and parking. It was a great place to spend a few hours with small kids. It's not comparable to other big city zoos. It",
          "I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. The zoo was clean and well maintained. You can get pretty close to the animals. There were giraffes, lions, tigers, elephants, monkeys and reptiles and birds. Keepers gave talks at various times and there was a sea link show.",
          "The zoo was fairly small. They did have a good selection of animals and a clean environment. They were undergoing some renovations while we were there so it may have improved some since we were there. There is plenty of parking so that was not a problem",
          "Had a pretty good time at the zoo. The weather was quite nice. The surroundings in general are nice, taken care of. The whole park was clean and peaceful. I would definitely recommend it.",
          "So my baby, boyfriend and I went to the Zoo today haven't been there since I was a kid... very exciting to go again.. but sad thing is the animals don't look happy. The tiger look very mad and skinny was pacing back and forth.. i wasn't the only one who noticed he was skinny",
          "The upgrades are very nice, decent parking. Good animal watching. Wished they would open later during summer. Food options OK. Like the mini-splash park for summer time cool downs.",
          "This is not an all day zoo. However this little zoo is very nice. If you have younger children they will love this zoo, there is a lot of touch & learn activities. They also have a small water fountain area to get cooled off in the heat. There is also a very large jungle gym",
          "Not a very big zoo, but very cute and they have quite a bit for their size! Loved the lions but my absolute favorite guy was the sea lion!!! He was super engaged and would hang out at the glass and try to interact with everyone! Oh yeah, this zoo also has a MASSIVE turtle!!!!",
          "This zoo has a wide variety of animals. The park is really well kept and clean. The staff is also very devoted to the animals.",
          "Convenient. El Paso has out-done itself with its zoo. It's nicely maintained and has some great exhibits.",
          "We had not been to the EP Zoo in about 6 years and for one of us in about 15 years. It's been redone and updated and the food is great! They have healthy options for everyone. The place is great and still growing. Good Family Fun.",
          "My husband and I were married there. So we obviously liked it!!The bird enclosure is pretty neat. My favorite is the large seal exhibit!",
          "I like this zoo a lot! It has many animals to see and the fact that it is relatively large compared to other zoos I've been to, makes it wonderful! You can have a GREAT time with the whole family!",
          "small, all animals sleeping, walked thur in less than an hour, and expensive not worth the time no good food in park itself",
          "This is a great place to spend time with the family and enjoy the zoo, you need to go early so you can check all of the animals, bring some water and snacks, and have fun.",
          "The zoo was larger than I expected, but definitely not the largest. It still had a decent amount of different animals, although some of the animals seemed very depressed, probably because of their lousy living conditions. Then again meerkats for example had lots of toys to play",
          "The zoo was larger than I expected which a good amount of animals. We went in the off season (December) so crowds were low, and there was some maintenance and some things were closed. It was a fun visit, and most of the exhibits are somewhere around 10-20 years old (newer",
          "The price wasa bit much for what we were able to see. I think it would be great in the warmer weather. Lots of things were closed or upgrading buildings. I dont think it was worth what we paid. Im sure its fantastic in the warmer months. Maybe they should consider",
          "It only took about three hours to tour this zoo but it was worth it. We were told up front that over half of the animals would not be out because it was so cold, so we didn't expect much. But, more animals were out than not so we had plenty to look at. They have Asian,",
          "Not a really big zoo, but they still do a great job with what they have. Awesome collection of animals, and they do a great job presenting them.",
          "It's a good zoo, small though. Mostly good exhibits, animals are cared for, everything looks maintained. The only exhibit I didn't like was the reptile house. It needs to be a real building with exhibit's on the inside. They take other zoos admissions as a discount. Giraffe's",
          "I had been away from el paso for 10 years. When I came to visit with relatives, I took the family and some out of town relatives to the zoo. Despite the lovely feeling of nostalgia, I was disappointed. We walked the zoo in 20 minutes. Most of the animals weren't in their cages",
          "This zoo has a Big City feel. Animals are well kept and park is nicely laid out. If you stay and see everything it would take you a couple of hours, stay for lunch and it's better than your regular buy at other zoo's. Just wish it had more options in picnicking. On hot days",
          "First time at Boo at the Zoo. Nice place to take the kids so they can get candy and see the animals. This is not the best zoo i have been to but is good enough. Seems like every zoo has problems keeping animals on display. I would go again but just not that often.",
          "This does not compare with the Phoenix zoo, but it is a nice day trip. The tiger is active and loves to attack the window to the delight of the kids sitting behind it. It is a two hour or so zoo, but if you have little ones, it has a great splash park and a great treehouse",
          "Great for a morning or afternoon trip. Perfect for small kids. It's not huge but it keeps the kids busy and occupied. Great activity to kill a couple of hours",
          "My fiance and I took our daughter to the El Paso Zoo for a family outing. The only thing I was displeased with was the person that we paid admissions to was very rude to us. We had looked up the prices online only to get there to find out the prices were much much higher than",
          "Our girls had a good time they loved to get wet in the water area and enjoyed the playground. They also enjoyed the walk around the zoo and the little train ride.",
          "This is one of the best-kept secrets of El Paso and the southwest. Well organized and well worth the trip. Kids really love it-and the adults will find it a positive experience.",
          "We love coming here with the kids... They love playing in the new playground after we visit all the animals.",
          "The El Paso Zoo is very nice to visit. They also have special themes at certain times. The only problem is, that you should go early in the morning, because at a raound noon it gets too hot and the animals go in their caves.",
          "Since we live here, of course, we have to visit this zoo. It is somewhat small for such a large city, but they do a good job with it. They have completed several large projects recently adding to the fun, family experience like the tree house area and the splash pad. I like",
          "I am from Las Cruces, NM. I had not visited the zoo in about 6 years at was not impressed the first time. Some friends came to visit from San Antonio with two small kids. We decided the Zoo would be a great thing for the kids to do. I thought \"wow taking them to El Paso Zoo",
          "The zoo is small, but when I see my kids how happy they are when we come, I think that tells me that is one their favorite trips. The animals are very well kept. and they try their best to mimic the animal's own environment. I do like simple things, and this zoo is simple to go",
          "We like to go and visit El Paso Zoo, but I think the price should be more cheap.... Actually they did change the prices, now are like 1 or 2 dllrs more, than before... Check online before you go.",
          "My 3 year old daughter likes going to the zoo. This zoo is not too big, not too small. Fun playground for the kids but way too crowded on weekend and holidays for my lil one to play safe. There are an okay amount of animals to see. Food is pricey in the restaurants. I wish",
          "We have been going to the El Paso Zoo for many years. At the end of the day, its about the kids. and my kids ALWAYS have a great time. Yes we know the zoo by memory, and see the same animals, but we always have fun. Nice day trip, its not the largest zoo in the US but it",
          "Our grandchildren love to go to the zoo. There is are different things for the kids to do. The water shoots from the ground and the kids just love it. Just make sure to take swimsuits and towels. Unless you mind getting you car sits wet!!!",
          "The price are high for the food and drinks they offer and not a lot of shade when walking thought the zoo it self but other wise it was fun",
          "For a relatively small zoo, this has a lot going on. There is a very good representation of several different animals, but not so many that the visit is overwhelming. You can see the whole zoo in a matter of a couple of hours, but can easily spend the whole day if you choose.",
          "I visited this Zoo many years ago. It is now double the size with a restaurant,a huge playground with artificial tree house, water fountains coming out of the ground to cool off and play.A gift shop. Loved all the new animal sections (3) Enjoyed watching the Giraffes playing",
          "The aviary was closed when we visited this place. Is really small that you don't need so much time. I was attracted by some animal called \"guanaco\" , then found out that it was just a llama, silly situation. The zoo is divided in three sections Africa, Asia and Americas. My son",
          "The zoo was enjoyable with enough animals to satisfy your curiosity and small enough to not exhaust yourself. As a life resident in El Paso, I have seen a great amount of change and am very pleased at the direction the zoo is heading. You will appreciate this zoo.",
          "Overall not a bad zoo to visit and have fun. I took our family of 8 from grandparents to the 4 year old. Lots of animals to see, not much ability for interaction with staff or exhibits. I think that would allow a better experience and education for all ages. They did have an",
          "Nice place to take young children. Very hot in the summer. Dress lightly and bring a sun hat or umbrella for shade. Would have liked to see more benches near each animal display. Felt sorry for most of the animals confined in smallish areas. Liked all the green trees and plants.",
          "Visited the zoo with two small children (just under three and five months. Zoo was easily accessed with strollers and we were able to get incredibly close to most of the exhibits. We have visited many zoos and we were impressed with the ease of navigation of this one. Some of",
          "Had a nice layout, but it was much smaller than some of the zoos that I have been to. Wasn't as crowded as some of the zoos I've been too either so that made it nice.",
          "The zoo alone is below average. No realistic exhibits. The best parts seem to be the Treehouse playground which is outstanding and the water pad which is great for the kids helping the zoo to break average. El Paso just has no infrastructure for continuous family",
          "Small enough to do in half a day, but nice enough to stay all day. Water area and large playground for the kids to spend all day. Lots of shade and places to sit along the way.",
          "Loved it! Not to crowded and prices were very reasonable. Nice for couples, kids, seniors! Would recommend to anyone visiting El Paso",
          "We just took two toddlers (2 & 4) through this zoo. Not too big that they couldn't walk through most of it. There are plenty of animals and shade for a summer visit. Plus a splash pad and tree house playground. Well worth the visit",
          "Very limited space for these animals to roam. It is just \"criminal\" to allow these zoos to exist, in areas that have little room or the severe weather, like El Paso. The workers are paid meager wages which makes a city resident ask: Where is the money going ?",
          "Nothing out of the ordinary, But We enjoyed our visit. The sheep looked a little matted which was disheartening. But other than that we saw a lot of animals and had a lovely afternoon. There was a train ride and a little \"water oasis\"which would have been nice if we were with",
          "Go early in the morning before the heat gets too bad. The zoo is nice, we loved the meer cats and prairie dogs. There are 3 sections to visit and a train.",
          "This zoo was a nice place to take the kids for the day. The staff was nice and the park was clean and well-priced. They also have a splash pad for the kids to get wet during the summer. If you do go during the summer months take an umbrella because you will not always find shade",
          "A great place to take the kids. Do go early in the day during the summer as the temperature can climb into the 100's.",
          "We went here not expecting a lot and were pretty blown away! We had a 16-month old and a 4 year old and they had a blast! There is a small train ride that goes around the Africa part of the zoo which looked like it would be a lot of fun for kids. We wanted to do it, but didn't",
          "Well the zoo has been improved over the years...but they could still fix some issues. For instance, the leopard or cheetah exhibit, is hard to really see sometimes. There is also a section with snakes perhaps or spiders, or frogs, I wouldnt know, it's placed where the sun makes",
          "Very surprised how awesome this zoo is. Very well laid out, clean, and many animal enclosures had multiple view points. Better than many zoos I've been to in larger cities.",
          "As a school volunteer I was asked if I would be interested in chaperoning the 2nd grade class. I agreed and I don't regret it. I had not visited the zoo in over 5 years, so this was a pleasant surprise to find all the new exhibits and the strong focus on climate change and",
          "They've just recently built a huge treehouse play park and it's awesome! My 7 year olds had a blast climbing up and going down the slides. If you're there on a weekend they have a small carousel and a train you can ride for a small fee. It's not a huge zoo but it's decent size",
          "I was not expecting such a great zoo in the middle of El Paso! It's small but really nicely done. There are a good amount of animals and I was really happy with the enclosures. There were a few larger areas where multiple species were roaming around. It was really nice too",
          "I discovered i could split the membership fee with another military wife and i was so glad i did! With the membership i could bring up to 6 kids every time!!! So my military friends wouldnt have to pay for the kiddos and we could go often! The train was a great addition to the",
          "I really appreciated this zoo. It was a wonderful place to have a little of fun. You can spend 2 hours and half to visit all the zoo with your family.",
          "We love coming here. The zoo is set up really well and exhibits are fun. Every time we visit El Paso we come here. We love the monkeys and the sea lions the best. Great for all ages.",
          "I went to the zoo with a friend on a Sunday afternoon. Not too surprisingly the zoo was packed and parking was difficult to find. We had to park a few blocks away and walk. The zoo isn't very large but it is set up pretty well. It is easy to navigate and overall was a lot of",
          "We have a very large zoo near our home in Minnesota and were delightfully surprised by the size and atmosphere of the El Paso Zoo. We spent about 2 hours here - well worth the $10. We went on a Monday - it was nice and quiet. Very clean and well maintained with a great",
          "I decided to take a trip on a warm Sunday afternoon to the El Paso Zoo. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprise of the beautiful zoo and it's adventures throughout its park. The giraffe encounter was the the highlight of my day. Everyone should visit this amazing zoo.",
          "With the accommodating help of the El Paso Hampton inn staff, I attended the winning El Paso Zoo, with numerous pathways leading to interior/nocturnal animals, as well as external ruminants, safari megafauna, and even some genuses I had never before seen, even on numerous trips",
          "What a great zoo. The presentations by staff to display the animals was really neat, they were friendly and fantastic when answering questions from the children. Lot's of nice exhibits, and I have to say one most unique to me was the prairie dog exhibit. Pretty fun to stick your",
          "We weren't expecting much, but this was a wonderful zoo! You can get so close to the animals and participate in activities. We fed the giraffes for $2 and watched a free elephant training. Great price for military!",
          "I like Zoos, I always go to zoos in every city or country I'm. is small, not really big, but has everything you need. Animals looks to be happy ...",
          "I wrote a review a few years ago about the zoo and had a terrible time. Since then, I decided to visit about the same time to see if there has been a change. And I am happy to say that there has been a great improvement in the quality of the exhibits and the care for the",
          "We live in Chicago, so we have access to two very nice zoos - Lincoln Park and Brookfield. So, I was very surprised by how much we liked the El Paso Zoo. Because the zoo is small, you really have close-up access to the animals. I was surprised at how close we were to the animals",
          "had not been to the zoo in years. i was very impressed with the El Paso zoo. was reasonably priced and fun for me, my girlfriend and her 12 year old son. Zoo had all the animals you would expect to see in a major city zoo and then some.",
          "For a smaller Zoo, I was pleasantly surprise how nice and fun it was at the zoo. My boys enjoyed it. It's great El Paso has this attraction.",
          "El Paso zoo is better than I expected. I think it's a good place to spend an afternoon when the weather is nice. A moment I will always remember is my 7 year old son's reaction to watching for the first time a Galapagos Tortoise. He jumped up and down saying he could not believe",
          "Within the last ten years, our El Paso Zoo has been upgraded. It's still a small zoo but very clean, the animals look happy and well cared for and it's happy place to go. Support our zoo because it's our visits that will will help the zoo continue to grow.",
          "I love trips to the zoo, we try to do it often, my daughter use a wheelchair and we have no troubles with space and i like even more when they have special events :) the only thing they're a little bit expensive..",
          "The zoo is very well done. The landscaping is nice, making it cooler and shady even on the hottest day.",
          "The El Paso Zoo is a small zoo with a nice family feel and atmosphere. My wife and I visited and she liked it so much she became a zoo volunteer.",
          "This zoo is small but really nice and well kept. It also has a splash pad for the kids. It has the animals you hope to see at a zoo. Our family enjoyed it.",
          "My wife and I recently visited the El Paso Zoo after moving to Las Cruces. The zoo was not at all crowded and the staff were particularly helpful and friendly. It was delightful encountering classes of children on school day field trips to the zoo. Nevertheless, this zoo was",

          "I've visited the El Paso Zoo many times during my childhood through my adulthood.However, it's been several years since my last visit; time to go back! I love zoos. There is something new to see at each attraction, even though I've seen the same attraction many times. A child's",
          "This zoo is the right size for a 2 or 3 hour visit. The selection of animals is great, and I like how they have them separated by region. The animal exhibits look natural. It's a lot of fun!",
          "The El Paso Zoo is small, but it has all of the main animals that kids want to see...giraffes, elephants, lions, bears, and snakes. Oh yeah...and some pretty entertaining monkeys. The zoo takes about 2 to 3 hours to see everything. You can feed giraffes for a small fee, ride a",
          "It has grown so much over the years. I love this place and being from El Paso and seeing it grow is so amazing. When I used to live there I remember it used to be much smaller, but when I went back it has expanded so much! Its a nice place for the kids to see some neat animals",
          "I liked the variety of animals. The giraffe exhibit is one of the nicest there. I found the prairie dogs interesting too. Saw a roadrunner for the first time! Some of the exhibits are closed during weekdays and you don't get the full experience. The price is right though.",
          "It is worth it to go, they have things like sleepover night to see animals in nocturnal habitats! Great trail to walk on and the animals are easy to see.",
          "Took me a few minutes to find it but I loved it. Has one of the best lion exhibits I've ever seen. And also tiger exhibits. Every animal was actively moving around. This made the visit even more enjoyable. I really enjoyed the entire visit!",
          "I have been to this zoo a couple of times and love it! It is not that large, which means you can see all the animals and exhibits without becoming exhausted. They have some critically endangered animals and great conservation information throughout the park. I love the way the",
          "Was really really impressed with El Paso Zoo. Great place to take a family. People there were really friendly and helpful",
          "Been here a million times! Nothing great. But it's a Zoo in a small city- kinda small! They rent wagons. You can take food in for a picnic lunch. They're trying to add to it... It's coming along.",
          "The zoo was clean and nicely laid out. The animals were out and the kiddos really enjoyed it. There are some areas were you can get out of the sun and work on puzzles and look at exhibits. As always, the concessions were outrageous, but the entry fee was not too bad. $10",
          "What a delightful jewel in the desert. The new Africa exhibit was a mini safari. We really loved the way the park was divided by region Africa, Asia, North and South America. You not only observed the animals and birds, you learned about the habitat in which they live. This",
          "The El Paso Zoo has progressed alot in the last few years. There are a multitude of animals and they're displayed in realistic environments. The entrance fee in affordable and the parking is free. Plan on spending at least 2-3 hours to truly enjoy the zoo.",
          "The El Paso Zoo is among the top 8 percent of zoos, and it just keeps getting better. Visitors can feed giraffes and learn about conservation that will protect animal habitats. The zoo educators are amazing at interacting with visitors. There are new projects on the horizon as",
          "My husband and I were able to see the entire zoo in less than 2 hours, it's quite small. It was extremely hot and many of the animals seemed to be feeling the heat (the orangutan and domestic sheep in particular). I wish they had more cooling mechanisms for the animals, but you",
          "Considering the environment, the water splash area was the best area of the whole place. Right under the giraffe area. The kids giggles so much they barely feed them. Overall it was fun but not anything to shout about.",
          "It is great to see the work that has been done on the zoo. The water feature for the kids is just right. We took a small snack lunch and enjoyed the monkeys while we ate and my grand daughter ran in water. Great to have a nice place to go out too. The cost is a little high for",
          "This zoo has been improving steadily over the last 20 years. I always enjoy my trips there. First thing in the morning is best. They have some wonderful plans for the future.",
          "The upgrades over the past few years have made tis a very good zoo. It is small and manageable with good exhibits. The animals are obviously well cared for.",
          "With little to no resources the change that has been made in the past 10-15 years is amazing. Nothing has lived up to the hype for the EP zoo but when u stop to consider what was here before its a nice change. Not an all day event by any stretch of the imagination. Go early",
          "The El Paso Zoo is a real surprise gem in the desert. It is very clean with well kept facilities and happy employees that really reflect their love of the animals.",
          "Not top of the line, but still quite educational for the kids. Not top, because our City spends money where they should not spend it.",
          "So many new improvements. Very nice time many, many exhibits. Would recommend to all visitors. Affordable for families, discounts for children and seniors. Easy access to all facalities.",
          "The El Paso Zoo is a very clean, well organized zoo. It is small by comparison to other larger city zoo's, but its well worth the money. Their is a very nice gift shop, cafeteria, ample parking and a great variety of animals. I like the bird section the best. I hope you",
          "We visited the EP Zoo and it is a zoo....I like it because it is nice and small in comparison to some I've been too...but it is a nice thing to do with the kids on the weekends and it doesn't have to take up all afternoon.",
          "The El Paso Zoo has a very good African exhibit and Sea lion exhibit. The elephant exhibit is worth seeing at feeding time. There is a wide variety of animals to observe from all of the continents. Good way to spend an afternoon with the family. My 18 year old grand",
          "I enjoy the new Africa area at the El Paso Zoo, it has all kind of new animals, zebras, giraffes, lions of course and other animals. It's a must see for everyone.",
          "It is a nice, smaller zoo. The upgrades have been wonderful. I have a difficult time walking long distances and for long periods of time, so this is a great venue to do. It is worth the visit. My son and his friends enjoy it.",
          "Many great updates at the zoo. The new splash area for the kids is great to cool off and it's awesome they allow you to take in your own food.",
          "This is on the small side for a zoo, but it's well laid out with plenty to see and do. Plan on at least two hours, and early in the morning is best because the animals are alert and awake. I like the small mammals exhibit...everything would fit in my purse, especially the slow",
          "The new attractions at the zoo make it a great family time. There are now more animals to see and the new spray area (water shooting out from the ground) is great for kids, especially when it's really hot outside. The new train ride is fun. The only thing that still news some",
          "I have been to a lot of zoos and Aquarians in the U.S. and this one was so perfect to take my little girls. It is on the smaller side, but it is really clean, lots if animal \"experiences\" (we fed a giraffe for 2$!) they have a fun water feature for the kids to play in and the",
          "Depending on when you go it's better then others great animals and its fun for everyone. If you go during summer go in the morning then the animals are more active it's hot::-) great time though",
          "Im not a zoo person at all, but took a friend of mine from out of town there. It is a neat and very clean zoo. Nothing extravagant or big, but perfect to spend a couple of hours at and comfortably take a stroll. I will definitely go back.",
          "The Zoo was a big surprise! It was very clean with great landscaping giving you lots of shade in the Americas/Asia section. The African area however does not have very many trees. However, there are buildings and shade structures for shade that help you keep cool. With the",
          "The El Paso Zoo was a very nice walk. Not too long with plenty of animals. We even saw two Giraffes fighting! The lion enclosure has you face to face with the animals.",
          "The zoo layout is a bit strange and they have a decent amount of animals, but not too much variety. They have the basics. There is quite a bit of shade here at the zoo. The animals also came out more as it got cooler though. The train ride is also pretty neat. I would say bring",
          "Had decent amount of animals. It was very hot when we went, but they had the splash/water area running which was a nice refresher after a long walk in the sun. Worth going, just do it early in the morning, or when the weather cools off.",
          "The El Paso Zoo is not a big zoo, but big enough. We spend about 2-3 hours and try to get there in the mornings before the heat kicks in. The train is up and running but I wouldn't recommend it, the cost is ok but the trip is very short. The little carousel is a bonus,",
          "Love the animals. New exhibits are amazing. Kids will love this place. watch the animals or ride the train. My kids love being a member.",
          "Way cheaper than other zoo's we have been to and the smaller size allowed my son to make it thru the whole thing without getting too tired. Great mix of animals and my 2 yr old LOVED the waterplay area, bring an extra set of clothes! Worth the trip! Just dont make a wrong turn",
          "I visted El Paso in March, my son is there in the military and has a 1 year old son. The zoo was affordable. The sea lion show was really good. A 3 year old was with us too and she loved it! It is good for young children. A lot of the attractions were not open because of the",
          "they have an amazing zoo here. Wide variety of animals. I was surprised they had sea lions here. Good price. and a good waste of 3 hours.",

          "It had been years since I had been to the El Paso Zoo, mainly because I was unimpressed with during my previous visits. Recently went to the zoo and was amazed at the updates. It's no San Diego Zoo, but it has definitely improved. Love the addition of the water play zone,",
          "Visited the zoo on our first weekend in El Paso, enjoyed the nice walk and the various exibits, was in time to see the Giraffe feeding time. Good idea for interaction with the animals, deffinately put a smile on my face. The food was a bit over priced, but it's like that at any",
          "The El Paso Zoo was another attraction my husband and I took in right away after moving here. We were both pretty skeptical at first, but were thoroughly impressed with the quality of the zoo. The landscaping is beautiful, the diversity of animals is impressive, and the day we",
          "The great people of EL Paso have made this our shinning star, besides the one on the mountain of course. The African Exhibit takes you to the places and with animals very close to their own habitat.Because of hte wonderful support of our citizens, this place is something to not",
          "We read the reviews and decided to be our own judge. It turns out this place was amazing for the size, location and money we spent. A great variety of animals, clean, and very friendly helpful staff to boot. I will definitely be going back.",
          "Last year we took our 2 year old grand daughter to the El Paso Zoo. She was very quite during the visit. But the next day she could not stop talking about the Zoo. So for her 3rd Birthday we took her back to the Zoo again.We had such a wonderful experience again. The Zoo is so",
          "Cool animals, very clean, great trainers! We got a membership, to help support them. The animals are very happy and healthy. Habitats are well kept. We will be visiting as much as we can while we are here.",
          "I'm not sure if November was the El Paso's zoo's off season but I was not very impressed at all with it! I'm from St. Louis and our zoo if very hard to compete with! I really don't like to give places bad reviews but there just wasn't a whole lot of animals. If I take another",
          "It's simply a great zoo for both grownups and kids. It makes for a fun afternoon and is very educational for all ages.",
          "Even though they recently lost a long time resident seal, I was very surprised when I took my out of town family to the zoo over Thanksgiving. I had no idea how nice it had become because I hadn't been there in years!",
          "A very neat small zoo. I would recommend to visit. I am not a big fan of zoos but this one left a positive impression.",
          "Many great improvements and more animals. The schedules for different shows made the visit more enjoyable.",
          "This zoo may be smaller than some of the most popular zoos in the US, but everything about it is interesting and nice. The animal variety is very interesting, and they have them grouped in sections like a world tour. A very cool aspect of this zoo is they have several",
          "I know this Zoo has been at this location for a while, but it was absolutely disappointing to see the new Giraffe's standing practically along side of I-10. This Zoo really should be relocated to a nicer area with less traffic.",
          "The El Paso Zoo is a very good zoo. It has a nice selection of animals for the very low admission price ($10.00 for adults). It has animals that other larger zoos often do not have. For example, the El Paso Zoo has lions, whereas the Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa, Florida did not the",
          "Its a small but ok zoo. Good for the family to go once. This zoo can do a whole lot better. It may feel like a waste of money when you enter, but after seeing the entire zoo its ok.",
          "This zoo is a lot of fun. Just make sure you go on a busy day. I chosed a Tuesday to go and it was empty. That led to have a lot of attractions that looked really fun to be closed as probably there were not many patrons. I have to go again on a busier day in order to fully enjoy",
          "great collection of animals, clean and educational and fun for kids and adults as well,. My grandkids really enjoyed it and were in awe of some of the animals.",
          "I was able to see them feed the animals and the newer giraffes were interesting. We bought some food and fed them out of hands.",
          "this was a perfect little zoo. It took us about 2 hours to see the entire zoo. it had nice animals (zebras, monkeys, giraffes, meerkats, lions, tiger, elephant) and you felt close enough to actually see them. would highly recommend!",
          "Kids will enjoy it. Staff informed us we might not see all animals since we arrived late and animals were being put up. No problem with that though. Still fun.",
          "While many improvements have been made its still very average at best. Kind of boring to be perfectly honest. The sea lion show was a joke. It lasted around 15 min and the entire time they just had somebody speaking about the animals, we saw one sea lion for all of 2 min.",
          "Can Be better and offer more programs i believe they have poor program planing that reflect in poor attnedance of the public, Beter choise of restoran tha is to expensive",
          "Clean place, it's grown and expanded a lot, there were many people. If you're into photography, there are great opportunities here to shoot close up. The gift shop is great. It would be nice if they opened up an aquarium kind of restaurant like the one in Albuquerque. It would",
          "I was pleasantly surprised about the number and variety of animals there. There was places to have a picnic and it was reasonably priced to get in. Very good family day outing.",
          "The El Paso zoo has giraffes now !!! How cool is that. I'm very proud of this local zoo. New exhibits, more animals and plenty of activities planned at the zoo throughout the year. Hope they decide to decorate the zoo in lights again for the holidays.",
          "I think the zoo is looking great the only thing it may need is more shops and shade. But overall they have done a wonderful job with it. I think we have the best sea lion show around.",
          "The zoo is pretty small, we were able to see everything in about 2.5 hours. There are the typical exhibits. The train was ot of service but the zoo is small enough to walk pretty easily. They offer discounts for military and their families. The entrance fee is pretty",
          "We went to the zoo rather late in the day. The selection of animals was nice; the staff was very friendly. We wanted to ride the train, but that was not in operation. The pictures we took were quite endearing. We really enjoyed the zoo. I recomend it.",

          "I went to the zoo when we first moved here and I wasn't expecting much because I came from a bigger city with a big zoo. But I was pleasantly surprised. The viewing areas for the lions and tigers were very cool because they were right in front of the glass. The seal show was",

          "This was a sad zoo. It is very small and located within sight of the Mexican Border crossing into Juarez. Not many animals were able to be seen as alot of cages and enclosures had signs indicating the animals were off exhibit. Admission was $10 for adults and teenagers.",
          "Thay are in constant expansion, they take good care of the animals and you can tell they love their animals because of how the elephants & see lions responds during presentations. The installations are clean, nice & you can take your own food there and have a family picnic. It",
          "The improvements that have been made to this zoo have really turned it into a great destination for the family. It's still on the small side however they keep expanding and the quality of this attraction is starting to show through. Even though it's small, it still has a great",
          "The reason that I am giving a very good instead of an average rating is because the zoo is very military friendly and offer entry discounts. The zoo is very nice and we go often. There isn't a great variety of animals, but they seem to have new exhibits each time. The enclosures",
          "The El Paso Zoo is one of the best zoos I have ever been to. There are way more animals there then described above. And yes there is a leopard, actually two rare Amur leopards, with only 40-50 individuals in the wild these are the most endangered cats in the world. Not to",

          "We have been zoological members for many years now and will always be because this is such a wonderful place for family time. They work hard on creating new attractions and bringing new animals and they have done a great job! We love to visit the zoo and can enjoy many hours",
          "Definitely I have to start with the price, which is so cheap. The place is great to have a nice time, they do not have very exotic animals but have some common ones. You can take out great pictures and buy souvenirs. Great for a visit with the family, your couple or if you have",
          "We visited this zoo 3-4 times during our two-month stay in el paso. We enjoyed it very much. Nice size, great stores, educational and has variety. I like that there are signs explaining how we can save the animals, seems like they really care for animals.",
          "I really had a great experience at this zoo. It is small and you get through it in about an hour. It has animals from Africa, Asia, South America, Mexico and United States. Since El Paso is blistering hot they can only have animals that can handle this heat so the selection is",
          "Zoo was clean and exhibits were attractive. Water fountains were warm/hot except 1 and they could use misters throughout zoo as most is outside which gets HOT! Bring an umbrella for shade in summer. Would not have been able to enjoy if larger as the heat was getting to us."

          "It's a decent zoo. Animals are unpredictable so there might be days were you might get to see all of the animals and others where they might be hidden. It's a good family friendly activity. I recommend it. There is a big tree house section where kids can run and play. Very entertaining.",

          "Fantastic zoo! However, please plllleeeeease PLEASE improve the poor sea lion's home. Small bit of advice- no more additions are needed, just improve on what you already have. I have loved coming here for the past 28 years, thank you for all the memories!",
          "This is maybe the BEST zoo I have ever been to! My kids (age 1, 4, and 10) all loved it too! Almost all the animals were out, there were few people (on a September Thursday), an awesome playground and splash pad. It looks like a new area is opening soon, too. Would definitely visit again in the future.",
          "The place is terrible. The vendors selling g food dont know how to give back the correct change. The animals are either sleeping or there are empty spots with overgrown grass and weeds. \n\nThe birds and amphibians are the nicest areas of the \u2026",
          "Ever since I was a kid I have always loved coming to this zoo. It's great to come as an adult and see it's still as awesome as I remember.",
          "Love the flash flood example! It was super cold and they warned us before we went in that  a lot of animals were inside warm, but we went anyway and my family had a good time.",
          "It's getting better every time we visit. Keep up the good job in making it a better zoo each year. Look forward to seeing more.",
          "Overall the zoo here is okay, nothing special. A nice way to get out and visit the animals.",
          "I was excited to go to the zoo with my kids but it was a huge waste of time and money. There were hardly any animals at all. I had 4 very disappointed kids. You can\u2019t really call it a zoo when there are no animals. When we paid to get in, \u2026",
          "Not all that many different animals but the grandkids loved it! The area for kids to play in sprinklers, get wet and cool off was a big hit",
          "I love going with my family!! This place is incredible and I really think they should receive more support from the city!!",
          "My family and I come to El Paso for the Holidays every year and today was our first time to El Paso Zoo. We were all impress. Well kept, clean and not crowded. zookeepers are very responsive, informative and kind. Must be the weather but all the animals were very active except the bear...lol",
          "Great zoo for kids. We spent about 4 hours here and don't think we missed anything.  We came during the week while visiting the El Paso area, and there were no crowds or long wait lines. Watching the feeding of the elephants was super cool.",
          "Zoo of course is not massive. But for the city its good. Some of the Reptiles are Obese but it come with Captivity",
          "I love bring my kids here. The staff was very helpful and it always looks very clean. Every time we come it keeps improving more and more.",
          "Great place to spend time with the family. Very  clean zoo.  Alot of animals on display, some exhibits still under construction.  But overall great visit.  With our membership it's well worth it.",
          "Honestly so much nicer than I was expecting. Lots of animals, and we went during Christmas break so it wasn't busy at all. I wish the layout was a little more intuitive, but that's the only thing I could possibly complain about.",
          "10 out of 10 love!! Will go again! Very friendly staff, great face painting, and cute stuffed sloths:)",
          "I like the new area added  to the zoo and the rope course. Super family friendly.",
          "We love going here. The staff are so nice and wonderful.",
          "Good zoo. Not overly huge, so you don't feel like you have to spend the entire day for your money's worth.",
          "They are over priced, for what they have to observe, like half of the zoo is empty. The poor elephant needs to get checked. It's s so sad that we really don't  have entertainment in el paso and the little we have is not in good standards. The sea lion show had been canceled for the day.",
          "It was great. Seeing all the animals was fun. Was able to meet Santa at the zoo!",
          "The new chihuahua desert except is amazing! Love all the additions they have made to this wonderful zoo!",
          "I was here about a month ago for a private event and I have to say that going in I wasn't expecting the most impressive zoo. Happy to say I couldn't have been more wrong!!! El Paso zoo has beautiful and well thought out exhibits. Everything \u2026",
          "Great place to go visit and see wild animals.  Also, they are constantly expanding so if you now and a year later again, most likely you'll find something new.",
          "Not bad for it's size. Animals were moving around where you could see them",
          "I had a really good time with my family. Would like to go back soon.",
          "This zoo is on the large side of small zoos or the small side of large. It's definitely the biggest within then region. The habitats are pretty nice and the animals seem comfortable in them. \nMost of the animals were easy to see, but as can \u2026",
          "Fun fun place to take the kids or even a date. I always have fun coming here, especially when they hire me for entertainment!",
          "We love the improvements! Can't wait to see it in a year.",
          "We recently purchased the membership and the kids love being able to come whenever we want. finally went in to the water section and the kids loved bowling able to touch and play with different things, they even experienced a rainfall.",
          "The zoo is much improved from even as recent as a couple years ago, the exhibits have grown! Unfortunately there is not much catered for visitors looking to avoid the weekend crowd, no shows or guides",
          "Great, they really try to make you happy, have some amazing animals.",
          "We had such a fun time at the El Paso Zoo. It was very calm and relaxing. We saw all of the animals. The zoo has restaurants and stores to buy drinks and food from but it is very expensive. I paid four bucks for a small water. The exhibits were nice and the staff was very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.",
          "Amazing place to take your family for a fun day to see animals.",
          "We love going to the zoo with our kids and the nieces and nephews but this was a very boring experience for them. I liked the silence and feeling of being alone but for kids it was very boring. The animals were either not at their exhibits \u2026",
          "The El Paso zoo is very nice. Not the biggest zoo, but perfect for entertaining our kids for a half day, sometimes a little longer. They have a pretty decent selection of animal exhibits, and also a playground and splash pad for the kids. \u2026",
          "Beautiful zoo. Prices were great",
          "Not the biggest zoo but they are expanding and have great views of the animals!",
          "It's a nice zoo, I just feel that the habits are smaller compared to other zoos. People were pretty friendly as well and it was fairly clean.",
          "The Zoo has really grown. There is so much to look at. I especially love the Africa side. Can\u2019t wait for the new and upcoming exhibit.",
          "This is a GREAT zoo ... and no better place to spend my 47th birthday with my family!!!",
          "Growing up this zoo was much more than what It currently is I'm sure. A lot of it may feel underwheliming but it is evident that the staff is doing their best and corporate appears to be working on upgrading exhibits and the zoo itself. Fun place. Can definitely be more though.",
          "So fun to go and see all the animals. The membership is totally worth it. I love the El Paso Zoo!",
          "It was a very nice day. The Halloween celebration was great. Lots of candy given out by local businesses. Staff and volunteers very nice and professional.",
          "I've taken my family multiple times here in the last 7 months and i have had a wonderful experience everytime super friendly staff that is always willing to help you/answer any question you have, definitely a gem in the city of el paso highly recommended if you want to see something out here special and a fair price.",
          "I love coming here and seeing all the animals. A little small, but I still like it.",
          "Great zoo, the zookeepers are happy to talk  and answer questions while they work.",
          "I love going to the zoo and so does my little one. He had a total blast looking at the animals and he didn't want to go home when they closed. ( We were there from 9am till closing time.)",
          "i am from Toledo , so i found my self comparing. We Had wonderful family time and enjoyed the turtles and giraffe the most, I give the birds {Avery} a ten  , being able to walk around with them over and all around.",
          "Went here for the first time. I would go again. It's a very big zoo. I only managed to get through 2/3 of the park. I loved the different options. The only thing that was sad is the fact that you had to pay for the merry go round and the train.",
          "Nice environment, cool playground for kids. The zookeeper's are great with interactions and giving fun information to visitors.",
          "I didn't like that they have a Carousel and a train and they charge extra to ride them. Increase the entrance a couple of dollars more per person but have the train and the carousel included. Train is not even worth the $2 more per person.",
          "Great small zoo. Clean and well maintained with nice animal enclosures.",
          "Went for an awards ceremony. I didn't even know they had a conference room. Nice big and clean. Big windows to watch the animals during the ceremony.",
          "The zoo is awesome and the family passes are a great investment if you plan to be at the zoo more than 3 times this year. It has a splash pad, a playground, the new ropes course, a carousel, a train, and oh yeah, animals!",
          "Nice zoo. Not too big, but definitely worth it.",
          "I'm happy that they take good care of all the animals",
          "The new Chihuahuan Desert area is a great addition and the Copper Canyon Ropes Course is great for kids of any size.  Turning the splash pad into a snowy play area for Santa at the Zoo was a nice touch, all of the kids loved it.",
          "Ita good only thing is that its hard to see the lions and tigers.  Other than its a good day to impress the kids",
          "Friendly staff and the price reasonable.  The zoo isn't very large but exhibit are well place and cared for. It looks as if they or doing some expansion and adding. It's a nice and fun place to take the family or date. There are some shows \u2026",
          "Very nice zoo. The zoo is small compared to most but, the entrance price is $12 & they give Military Discounts with valid ID. I really enjoyed myself.",
          "Its cool but its under construction and theyre expanding. If you come later in the day, most the animals are hiding. The seal is cool because he recycles!",
          "Was good. Eventful. Passed time.",
          "Love the amazement in my grandchildren's eyes when they see thre animals.  Pure love indeed",
          "What a treasure! I hadn't been to the zoo in years. The animals and enclosures are in great shape. Even on hot days, its a dry heat and it feel nice with the shade they have from the trees. Splash pad for the kids.",

          "This zoo focuses in conservation breeding efforts and education. The exhibits are nice, there are lots of trees and other shade implements, and food and drink options all around. Lots of enrichment demonstrations and animal educators just walking around, which is very nice.",
          "I love this place. Kids have a playground area that they enjoy. Parents can get off their feet for a bit while they enjoy it.",
          "I love the El Paso Zoo cuz u see different animals.",
          "I love our zoo, the El Paso Zoo. I love to just go there to collect myself and relax. Everyone there are so helpful and friendly.",
          "Family friendly, small enough to not feel rushed.  Bathrooms need some maintenance,  some sinks didn't work, missing soap dispensers, etc.  Some enclosures were very nice, others could use some improvement.",
          "Zoo was pretty nice. Had a lot of stuff done over the last couple of years. Added plenty of animals and attractions. I went on a Monday. Which I think may be the day they clean and get everything ready from the previous weekend. I would \u2026",

          "The only down side is... I was told at the booth that their system was declining all Mexican credit cards... Whaaaat???\nI politely asked: can you run mine and see what happens?\nGuess what happened? Of course It worked!!!\nI mean why would it not?",
          "Great family fun. The water feature great for little guys when it is hot. Well laid out. Grandkids loved feeding the giraffes.",
          "I recently went to the El Paso Zoo and i was very upset to see cardboard boxes and wrapping paper???? in the enclosures? Like what is even the purpose of that. The zoo isn\u2019t even the cleanest and prettiest yet they throw some christmas \u2026",
          "The newest exhibit at the zoo is beautiful!! The Chihuahuan desert gives the animals lots more space to roam. Great job!!! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c",
          "Great place. Nice new area",
          "New exhibits and attractions. Had great day with the family.",
          "Anyone who knows me will tell you that I have done a lot of zoos. My favorite is the New Orleans Zoo which one needs an entire day to see\nThe El Paso Zoo is located a few paces from the Mexican border. They offer military and senior \u2026",
          "Zoo is constantly improving upon itself. There is a fair number of animals there and overall had an enjoyable experience.\nFood is okay... but you may want to bring some of your own for the family.",

          "So amazing to see a zoo and the desert",
          "i feel like unless they can get their attendance up so they can invest more in the Zoo they should consider housing alternatives for some of the animals. The tiger looked malnourished and sick pretty sad. I do understand the purpose of \u2026",

          "Great price was fun. Some animals weren't let out until noon so we only saw them as we left. Looks like improvements are coming soon more for families to relax with.",
          "Great improvements to the zoo.  They are adding a new feature.  Very clean and food options are available throughout the park.   The animals were out and entertained their guests.   Fun family time and learning experience in El Paso.",

          "I enjoyed this zoo much more than others. I'm not a big fan of zoos typically (as the animals typically seem miserable.) That was not the case with most animals here. A lot of them were active or at least in plain view. The elephant seemed \u2026",

          "The El Paso Zoo is modestly sized, but it's clear the staff tries very hard to entertain new comers and members by varying the experience.  There is a variety of exhibits, categorized by area of the world, and includes a walk-through aviary \u2026",
          "Smaller zoo. I did the whole zoo with my mom in about 3 hours, but with kids it might be an all day event. Good date spot or place to take the kids for a day. Interesting exhibits and bugfest was also really cool!",
          "Knocked off a star for canceling the zoo pride event! Its one of the few family events that we truly enjoy. Very sad they couldnt find a way to stay exclusive.\nBUT\nAbsolutely LOVE the Zoo. Lots of animals great enclosures!! \nVery excepting of my service dog. \nA truly joyful place.",

          "The place is amazing, but theu need more shading areas. Kids and elders can dehydrated easily with the high temperatures and humidity that we are experiencing. There is only 1 giraffe and charge $3 dollars to feed it with a leaf of lettuce. I think that it is too much, because the entrance fee is a little expensive.",
          "This zoo is a fairly nice zoo. I really liked the little water play area that it has in the middle for the kids to play, & the food court. The train it has to ride is nice too.",

          "Really great place to take your family...but they always take forever to finish a project...",
          "Animals are nice to see (when they are available). Exhibits are well maintained and family atmosphere is friendly. Cost seems a bit high unless you obtain an annual pass. Good luck seeing all the animals in one visit.",

          "Always a great experience. Family membership is well worth the price.",
          "It seems like every time I take my family there they always have 1/4 of the exhibits closed",

          "Great place to have fun and see the animals. Not HUGE but definitely not small either. Definitely recommend!!!",
          "I love our zoo it's great!  Been going over 40 years watching it grow and change.  I'm very proud to say that this is \"my\" zoo\ud83d\ude42",
          "Love it, very fun for the family!",
          "The zoo is so much better than when I used to come here as a young man in the 50 s.",
          "Small zoo but beautiful.",
          "It was an amazing experience, had fun, its been a while since ive been to the el paso zoo but its still nice to go even for adults, kids, every age.",
          "It was a smaller zoo but had play areas for the kids to cool down, splash pad, tree house, can take your own sack lunch and cooler. I will be taking the kids agian and the staff were super friendly.",
          "Always love visiting the zoo, every time is something different and we always enjoy having family day here. Bought the year pass that includes other zoo across the USA so that\u2019s a perk as well when traveling this summer and anytime.",
          "Animal exhibits seem lacking in some areas but still a great cheap place to take the family. Being able to bring your own food saves you some big bucks.",
          "Nice small zoo. Well worth getting the membership. My kids love the playground but the splash pad water is always so cold!",
          "Nice family fun but we need more animals.",
          "Excellent zoo experience. Great for kids of all ages. Well layed out, beautiful park ,with many shaded areas.  The sea lion exhibit was outstanding.",
          "Not alot of animals where out. Kinda was a waste if money.  My kids liked the splash pad more then the animals. Very sad.",
          "Not crowded, plenty to see, great play area for kids, food was good $, very accessible",
          "It was a good time. I got a lot of pictures. But they were building a lot of new enclosures that we didn't go into. A lot of people with a lot of children. It is a good place for families to take the kids !",
          "Nice zoo for city's size. Wasnt too crowded today (Thursday, late May). Very reasonable price for admission with seasons passes available and discounts at other zoos.",
          "They have lots of animal exhibits where you can get up close and personal. They have a childrens playground and a splash pad. My son loves the train, and the carousel. Almost all animals were out on exhibit. Even the babies in May.",
          "A zoo just the right size where you can learn about the animals in depth, and see some of them fed. One of my favorite zoos!",
          "The Zoo in El Paso is pretty awesome. Boo at the Zoo is fun. It's got a decent layout a good amount if animals and activities. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is the size. Not a larger Zoo but perfect for a family outing.",
          "New Chihuahuan Desert Exhibit is awesome!",
          "Smaller than expected...still a great place to bring the kids. Looking forward to the special program days. Military discount for service members and family...",
          "Pretty cute and small, this zoo was well laid out with tons of fun things for kids! The lion feeding was an awesome experience! I've never seen something like that at a zoo.",
          "Had a good time with my son we enjoyed the animals and the \ud83d\udc26 show \ud83e\uddd0 would definitely be back",
          "It is a small zoo but very well taken care of.",
          "Was fun and awesome to spend the day with family and friends.",
          "Good place to spend an hour walking around.",
          "So much fun. It is not as large as other zoo's I've been to but it was a ton of fun. We went on a Friday morning.  There was no wait and the weather was perfect. The animals seemed well cared for. Will definitely go back.",
          "This tiny little zoo packs a lot of experience into a small area. While I have visited other, much larger zoos, this one delivers a very good experience without killing my wallet! I have 4 kids so it is tough to get them out for something \u2026",
          "Such a fun zoo,well laid out and unique",
          "Very nice experience.  I had a hard time climbing up the tree with my grandson so he could go down the slide.  The train was fun to ride on,  my grandson and I were the only ones on the train.",
          "So many hidden gems in there. Lots of kid- friendly activities and then there's the animal exhibits. This place has been redone in all the right ways!",
          "El Paso Zoo is always clean and well-maintained.  Lots of fun activities and events, and an annual membership is well worth the cost!",
          "Pretty small zoo but the kids don't seem to mind. They are expanding so it will probably get better.",
          "We've been members for years, it's the perfect place to take the kids. They have great shows, check out the bird show.",
          "Good family get together..",
          "Very nice zoo. Some of the attractions were closed because of making it nicer for the animals.  But that was okay.",
          "Bring cash for ticket purchases, most cards don't take and the ATM outside doesn't work either. Inside the park was great, the entire family enjoyed the day there.",
          "Can't never get enough of our zoo. Small but very educational.",
          "Awsome place for a date! Me and my girlfriend loved it! Totaly going to go again. Maybe to see some of the shows next time",

          "My grandson with his aunt...great time!",

          "It was a really unique experience, the zoo keepers and trainers are friendly and the elephant workout was awesome",
          "I've been a few times in El Paso Zoo. The animals look happy, well fed, and clean. The zoo is not too big or too small, you probably will need around 3-4 hours to walk around. The grounds are well maintained. If you want to have a snack \u2026",
          "Not a bad afternoon day trip, fun",
          "My family and I had an awesome time at the May the 4th event. Super cool. Loved that they recognized it. We had a great time.",
          "The Boo at the Zoo event was awesome!",
          "Very bad Customer Service from the kids that work at the \"cafe.\" The cashier didn't feel like working that day or something, his attitude was a big, \"No No!\" I was not going to let him ruined my day at the zoo with my family! To think, I \u2026",
          "Pretty GREAT on a Saturday afternoon, even for adults. Good way to get exercise. Thanks! \u263a\ufe0f",
          "Love supporting our local Zoo\u2764\ufe0f The kids always have a great time!",
          "Excellent !!!  Halloween at the zoo was an amazing experience. Thanks El paso Zoo",
          "Not the largest Zoo but good variety. Make sure you get there early to see the most animals during the cooler part of the day. They also have a lot of events so check their website.",
          "Family friendly place and its clean.",
          "The exhibits are good. A lot of construction going on and some exhibits were not open. They have a nice play area and splash area for kids so bring attire to get wet in because it can get hot.",
          "Awesome and love that they keep improving it.  Clean and I cant believe how good the food is. Highly recommend !!!!!!",
          "I enjoyed it.  I think the El Paso zoo was very nice.  As a smaller zoo I think the prices were reasonable for the sizeand what they had.  It was very clean and the staff were very friendly.\n\nThe family enjoyed themselves.",
          "The zoo is great! It was fun to see the animals and learn about the conservation projects the zoo is involved in.  The kids liked the train ride around the African area, and the reptile building is adorable.",
          "I'll start with saying that everyone at the zoo itself was really friendly. The front desk gave us helpful advice about the giraffe exhibit and the security guard asked about our 1 year old and genuinely seemed to care. \n\nThey are doing \u2026",
          "We love coming to the zoo! Theres always new things to explore and learn.",
          "Great place to bring my young nephews. The animal exhibits were fun, the train ride was a neat touch, and the playground was a convenient way to let the kids blow off some steam while we sat and drank water. Some of the exhibits were closed for construction which made us a little sad, but it happens. I'd go back for sure.",
          "Well kept and very fun for children. A large playfround and splash pad keep the kiddos entertained for a long time.",
          "I hadn't gone to the zoo in ages. I sincerely had fun with the kids. There have been many new additions I wasnt aware of. The merry go round was pretty fun. The prices are pretty reasonable. Walking through the zoo gives me nostalgia to the \u2026",
          "-good zoo, lots of unique animals\n-Go in the morning, ot gets hot\n-take the kid's bathing suits, they have a splash park",
          "Kids love the play area the best with the slides that come out of the tree houses.  Also love the dining area that looks into the lion area.  Can't wait for the extensio  construction to be over.  Also consider getting membership.",
          "Decent...several exhibits closed on Tuesday in February, but they do not tell you when you pay. Zoo needs some TLC...exhibits with glass viewing areas needed cleaning or repair. Bird show was extraordinary with charming, knowledgeable young lady bird expert. Senior discount.",
          "Good place to walk!! Missing a few important animals in the exhibition,",
          "I love this zoo!!! It's a small zoo compared to San Diego, but it has a giant heart and awesome pride!",
          "Really enjoyed my recent visit to the El Paso Zoo with my 2 year old son. There have been many great renovations like the addition of the merry-go-round and the new Leopard exhibit. The staff were really friendly and the kids play area is \u2026",
          "Nice staff. A good place to enjoy a cloudy day.",
          "My son loved it. It was his 1st visit. Good price too",
          "Love this place we have memberships and have been using it once to twice a week. It\u2019s a great way to let young kids blow off steam and I swear they never get bored and are always excited to see the animals. Do not expect this to be a large \u2026",
          "I really liked this zoo. We were visiting from out of town and got to attend a trick or treat event that was really fun. My kids loved a special hula hoop show we got to see too. And I felt like more of the animals were out and visible than in my hometown where it tends to be colder.",
          "Entertaining for the whole family. My grandson enjoyed it.",
          "Alot of fun fun the whole family",
          "The zoo was busy today so didn't see many animals as usual but my kids had fun .",
          "Unfortunately, this Zoo was VERY small for the size of the city it is in. They did have some animals I had never seen before. However, regardless of the unusual animals, this Zoo fell way below what I expected it would be. I was VERY \u2026",
          "Is a very good place to go with the family they have a splash area, playground for the kids. And is very relaxing.",
          "Fun for families and kids of all ages. They have quite a few 'Meet the keeper' events throughout the day where you can see the zookeeper feed a certain animal. Very interesting!",
          "Got to volunteer here it was truly a great experience and a bunch of fun if you have kids! Feeding the giraffes is aleays a great experience and sea lion is quite funny to watch. Dont forget to check out the stores for some cool new gear, decorations and toys for your kids and stop by the cafe to get some delicious food!",
          "Very clean and good experience.   Not overly crowded.",
          "Very impressive new additions to the zoo opening this fall of 2019!",
          "Its AZA accredited and my daughter actually enjoyed the splash zone and playground more. Then again shes 1. So it really does have something for ALL ages.",
          "Nice first visit. Kids loved it. Thank you for an amazing experience.",
          "There was a massive remodeling taking place, so that along with the winter weather had quite a few exhibits closed, but yet & still this was one of the best zoo experiences I can say my family and I have had! The animals were so \u2026",
          "Great for a day out with kids. Plan to spend about half a day there. The carousel is a great value.",
          "Not all the exhibits were open, but very clean and fun activities.",
          "Great experience to work for.",
          "Zoo's most important part because it's time",
          "Decent. We went when it was quite hot out so the animals were all resting in the shade and hard to see. We hung around until they started feeding them so we could actually see some of them. As to be expected drinks and such was expensive but many people had wagons with coolers. Part if it was under construction.",
          "We take our granddaughter here all the time, she wants to go every week! Lol. We enjoy walking around looking at the animals. Parking is always simple here at this zoo. Wish it was a little bigger but we do get tired of the walking we do \u2026",
          "Its nicer than before",
          "They\u2019ve made a lot of great updates in the past decade, lots of fun for little ones!",
          "Its just a great part of el paso",
          "Very clean zoo with great animals",
          "Sorry, don't like location, during our visit in Juarez there must of been a tire fire and all the smoke was wafting over zoo, there was lots of construction at zoo and some of exhibits were closed. Will try again after remodeling is done and definitely go during cooler weather",
          "Very cool place, excellent for family time, and to play Pokemon Go",
          "Tremendous, was lovely to see all the animals that were situated. Was also great to know certain facts about each animal",
          "Happy birthday my handsome grandson! El Paso zoo was the perfect place for your 2nd birthday celebration! Thanks El Paso zoo!! Great time!",
          "Picked the perfect day for an outing. Enjoyed the zoo with my son and granddaughter.",
          "Just visited the zoo for the first time today. The train and giraffe feedings were closed for maintenance, the two things my daughter was most excited about. Carousel ride is offered once every hour and lasts two minutes. Only one \u2026",
          "Pretty place love animals",
          "Right now at this point they have a lot of construction but I'm definitely looking forward to visiting again in the summer they have plenty of things going on to really get the whole family invested. They are really improving and everything",
          "Took visitors from Austin to visit the EP zoo. El Paso should be soo proud of such an amazing zoo. Since I\u2019ve been going there, it just keeps getting better and better! Can\u2019t wait for the new Chihuahuan area to open up.",
          "Caveat: I'm married to one of the zookeepers here so I might be biased but the El Paso zoo is phenomenal! It's such a great place for families with kids or for animal lovers of any age. They have so many great animals here like lions, giraffes, tigers, orangutans and elephants!",
          "We travel all over the country and this is probably the worst who I've been to. I did go in the early spring so perhaps that contributes to my negative review but half of everything we wanted to see was closed down or under Renovations. I \u2026",
          "So much fun and so much to see!",
          "We decided to purchase the full annual membership for our family of four (and cousins!). You get discount at the gift shop and access to over 100 zoos nationwide. Well worth the investment!",
          "My kids loved the zoo! My son loves elephants and they had a blast on the splash pad.",
          "It would have been 5 stars but it is all was the same and sometimes they and stuff",
          "Good place to take the family",
          "Pretty decent zoo.",
          "Grandkids always have a blast!",
          "It was a nice visit! I still had some trouble with doors! But people going in and out helped me. The floor are is bumpy hard in a wheelchair!",
          "This was a Great Zoo with many nice animals. The staff was very friendly there too!",
          "The El Paso Zoo is slowly coming into its own.  While it is, at present, a fairly small zoo, there are expansions being built that will greatly add to its appeal and size.  Given its current scope, I was very pleasantly surprised at how \u2026",
          "Very pleasant day spent here. The enclosures are spacious & clean for the animals. The keepers are knowledgeable & open to questions. Recommend it",
          "It's super nice and when the construction is done it's going to be very nice",
          "They have transformed this zoo into an amazing experience!!!",
          "Food and drinks inside are a little pricey, but you can take your own stuff and it is a great place for your family over all.",
          "Its a good place for you and your family to have fun and to let your kids run around",
          "this place was horrible. As a student that went there as a field trip, they were completely unprepared. There was only one concession stand open, about 50 kids waiting in line. I'd never willfully come here again.",
          "So many animals were out and in the water tonight! Was really neat to see....",
          "Zoo keepers offered info on the animals and the zoo itself was kept clean. Lots of cool sights to see and lots of interaction with learning",
          "It was great. Too hot for the animals but fun.",
          "Zoo is always fun but had a great time at Bug Fest!",
          "Worth the visit! We really enjoyed spending time these. Wide variety of animals. Nicely maintained and super clean place.",
          "I love it here, I wish more people to advantage of it. Hopefully it improves in the future as this city gets bigger.",
          "Giraffe exhibit was very nice. Properly priced, 31 & change for 2 adults and 2 kids,  took us 2.5 hrs for quick tour. Was a nice day.",
          "Excellent, family friendly medium-sized zoo with a diverse and interesting assortment of mammals, reptiles and birds. Shows educational and entertaining, especially enjoyed the lion trainer's exhibition. Wonderful playground and fountains for children to cool off and play.",
          "Always love the zoo. Def a must see if visiting el paso or if you're local.",
          "I love coming here. Every visit I see a different animal that wasnt there before.",
          "It was a great experience for a small zoo. Several different animals you wouldn't see at a normal big city zoo. We went right as they opened and it was cool outside and not too crowded. Thumbs up from this family!",
          "Zoo has improved so much! Loved going had a good day with my family",
          "Love the zoo but there are what I think many renovations going on at once has allot of enclosures.  Close out due to. The renovation",
          "Pretty basic but still fun",
          "Where were all the animals?!!! No bats, all fish in aquarium are gone, a gigantic habitat for tigers and no tigers, no groundhogs to peek at! Most windows in exhibitions are so dirty and fogged up, it was difficult to even see the few \u2026",
          "It is not a huge zoo, but it still has a variety of animals. Also they have a mini train ride. And ice creams stops on each corner. There is a big tree house play ground with the Asian look. And a fountain splash park. It is a great spot for kids to play. We loved it.",
          "Missing too many animals and the one you were able to see, hardly moved.",
          "This is a nice zoo. A bit small for a zoo but it's a good place for kids as well as for adults. I love that in the summer they often do after hours so it's not super hot to walk around. \nWill be going back in the fall.",
          "Great improvement, however, many of the exhibits are close for cleaning or maintenance. Being that they open till 9:30ish, they should schedule this before opening to the public. It is as if one goes to the circus and the several of the \u2026",
          "Huge selection of animals. Plenty of places to sit and cool down with lots of places to get food or drinks. There is also a mini water splash area and a carousel.",
          "Been coming here since a little boy and hopefully one day I'll be able to bring my children here.",
          "Great variety of animals and attractions always upgrading to add more for everyone to see and do. Annual membership is great for when you have kids who love going pays for it self several times over. Also love all the different events they have going on during the year.",
          "Short walk great for kids",
          "Great place to take the family!",
          "Great zoo! And it will only get better after the construction is done. Even with the construction going on there is still lots to do and see!",
          "We had a good time, but the animals all must had just had lunch & were all sleeping. It's the first Zoo I've been to where the animals weren't friendly. They seemed so sad and lonely, but if they were out on the wild maybe they wouldn't even be alive so I'm glad they're safe. \ud83e\udd17",
          "We saw 99% of the animals. Bring your own food and water!!! \n Our food at the cafe was good, but it took a long time to make and was way over priced.",
          "It'll definitely be better when everything is finished but my kids love the play area and the water park",
          "Didn't even make it inside. We got there a little after 3:00 and they said they put the animals away @4. Why!? If you close @5, why put the animals away a whole hour before closing? I may return but definitely do it before 3pm because that's just ridiculous.",
          "Awesome activity can last you a full day at a good price!",
          "Beautiful experience, friendly people.  Animals well taken care",
          "Nicest zoo in the area. Animals look well taken care of, inexpensive to enter. But i would recommend the.membership.",
          "We are zoological society members.  We always enjoy our zoo visits.  The giraffe encounter is the best.",
          "The zoo's a great place to pass good family time. Great expansions and improvements are happening, can't wait for summer to arrive!",
          "New Chihuahua exhibit is cool",
          "Pretty lame zoo. Most of the animals were gone or asleep. It was a dirty place. The staff only spoke Spanish, and we don't know Spanish. I feel they did speak English but chose no to speak English. I wouldn't go back.",
          "Loved the place!! Our girls really enjoyed it! Nice and clean",
          "We love going to the zoo here. My little one really enjoys it. Though, choose your times to go wisely due to the high temps. Overall, it is a very enjoyable time, just plan ahead, bring some snacks, drinks and enjoy a few hours of family \u2026",
          "Staff is very helpful. Zoo keepers came out at different times to speak about the animals. The water park is nice for kids to play in. My son loved the carousel and the train.",
          "I love the zoo!",
          "I haven't enter there, but I hope the animals are treated with respect:/",
          "My little girl had a great time and loved the animals. Great experience.",
          "So much to see and do. A wonderful day of adventures.",
          "They say everything is bigger and better in Texas and thus far everything I've seen has lived up too and even exceeded the highest expectations (until now) El Paso has been a big let down (and I absolutely love Texas), but El Paso could do \u2026",
          "My family enjoyed an outing on National Zoo day! Can't wait for the new renovated park to open.",
          "On a cold day many of the animals were inside, but the zoo was almost empty and we got to take our time. As we were leaving the staff helped us become members even though they were closing their office for the day. Very fun zoo, will be returning several times.",
          "I had a wonderfull time. My favorites wer the Monekeys, wolves, and Painted dog. I loved it when they let us feed the Giraff. I think to improve it is to let the people pet the animals of course we'll have a free protection suit incase they start nibbling at us. Thank you for haveing me be their.!!!!",
          "The zoo has grown into an explicit site to be in an atmosphere of calmness n tranquility with the opportunity to be able to enjoy every bit of the park thank you El Paso zoo for making the difference in our sun city",
          "Beautiful place to take the kids. Many new exhibitions to see.  \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
          "Always fun going to the Zoo and having the kids enjoy themselves and learn new things about the exotic animals \u2764\ufe0f. The Easter Eggstravaganda was fun this year as well.",
          "Loved the new desert area!!",
          "It had been years since I'd been, but was pleasantly surprised. Most animals were present and everything was clean. I am anxious to see how it looks once construction is done. One negative was the sea lion exhibit glass was so filthy we were unable to see them.",
          "Quiet and peaceful unless they are doing school field trips over there.  Have great relationship with the animals and many of the workers.",
          "Not alot of animals out there... Colorado and last angle are best this this... Need more animals",
          "Good time for kids! My children love the zoo. New improvements (splash pad, play area, carousel) are great.",
          "We enjoyed our last visit. Lots of great changes with more to come. The lion was resting right by the window were we could take pictures. We saw the giraffes and my favorite, the zebras. We took the kids and they enjoyed it. It was Easter and they got to see the events and enjoy a great day.",
          "Excellent place for hours of fun",
          "It's really cool because there are so much cool animals like reptiles birds and chimpanzees and even seals from the ocean and wolfs,alligator but it is still really cool",
          "A Good place for new people make sure to bring sun block though",
          "Water park was a great idea to install but I think it's to small for El Paso kids. The family pack is great choice to purchase every year we love it and save money. I really wish there was more shade while walking around. Also I don't \u2026",
          "Pleasant zoo only a few missing exhibits. Definitely worth the few hours!",
          "Very cute zoo, love the elephants. Great place to hang out for the day",
          "All the animals were asleep or not for viewing and still construction going on. Funny thing happen got to see the Male orangutan go for the female and had his way while she held and played with her baby",

          "It's a small zoo and I understand that. But when 40% of the exhibits are \"under construction\" it really makes you wonder why you went. I've been going since I was a child and not much has changed. The seal exhibits downstairs should have \u2026",
          "Cute zoo and the kids love it. Animals seem well cared for and it\u2019s clean. However, it\u2019s small! Not a ton of exhibits and now there\u2019s even less because they are remodeling a portion that isn\u2019t scheduled to be finished till 2019.\n\nHowever, \u2026",

          "This was my second visit to the zoo in more than 10 years. This zoo has been growing a lot and you can see it from its exhibitions. Just make sure to plan ahead and bring something to cover yourself from the sun. Is a good exercise to go see the whole zoo.\n\nIt is nice to see this zoo grow.",
          "It is a cute zoo. I just wish the animals weren't always sick :(",
          "Great small zoo. Unfortunately during my visit, there was an event scheduled, and renovations to the exhibits.",
          "It's a fun little zoo to spend a few hours at. Constantly under construction, which is good (more exhibits in the future) and bad (some exhibits  get closed temporarily). The animals are varied and obviously well taken care of.",
          "Great zoo.  Small but well presented attractions and affordable.   Takes about 2 hours to see everything.",
          "This place has improved greatly over the years. Looking forward to all the improvements to come. The new Asia region is beautiful. The new carosel is gorgeous! Definitely somewhere you can take the kids and spend the day.",

          "We visited on a Saturday a little before 4pm. They close at 5pm on Saturday and the ticket lady at the front told us they start putting the animals away at 4pm so there would be no animals to see. Why close at 5pm if there won\u2019t be anymore animals",
          "Have some fun",
          "Love it! Only $40 for a family of 4. We took the train ride, the kids played in the little water park and we saw the birds show.  Prepare to walked a lot.  Parking is accessible and there's a cafe and a restaurant.",
          "Great zoo, easy to get around and friendly staff.",

          "Been coming here for decades and I love how much it has changed. Good job guys",
          "Loved that there was plenty of shade at the park. The splash area was a hit with the kids and was a great way to beat the heat. The playground was another highlight. There are a lot of animals inside so you can stay cool there as well.",
          "A fun day in the sun. The kids enjoyed the park and playground. New exhibits, the chihuahuan desert coming soon.",
          "The zoo itself (facilities) are nice.  The employees were nice, thoughtful. The animals seemed to be well taken care of but the sea lion was depressed and lonely as were the elephants.   There was only one of each.  I think they are social animals and how can they be if another of their own kind isn't with them.",
          "Awesome zoo always loved it. But ALOT of the animals weren't out and customer service was horrible. Very rude service.",
          "Always been my favorite spot with my daughter.",

          "Good little zoo.",
          "If you haven't been to the El Paso Zoo in a while, you owe it to yourself to visit. The newer exhibits as well as the classics are apl great. Nice shade under the abundant trees, lots of demonstrations to enjoy as well.",
          "I love to go to the zoo. The landscaping needs some love.",
          "Great place but too many closed exhibits!",
          "Love going to the zoo!! They made some new changes that made our experience even better!!",
          "The zoo is pretty pricey for admission, plus if you want to ride the train or carousel, it's an additional charge. I know there was an extreme amount of money spent to renovate the zoo, and dont get me wrong, it is very clean and kept up \u2026",
          "Great place to take your kids",

          "Disappointed\n\nFirst time taking my grand daughter and it was a HORRIBLE experience!\n\nThe park was dirty, unfriendly staff members, alot of exhibits under construction or no animals at all. Lack of information of animals.",
          "I'm slighted. I've been to NYC, Washington DC, San Diego. It is not fair to really compare the El Paso Zoo to these. I had a good time here because of the company I was with. Zoo is small and definitely family oriented.",
          "We love to visit the beautiful animals.",
          "High priced waste of time and money. Ok I admit, I'm not a zoo fan but not because I'm an animal rights wacko. They do take good care of the residence there. Having said that my views remain. Its in a horrible location. Visitors can't find \u2026",

          "The El Paso Zoo is a wonderful facility full of amazing animals and a dedicated staff who do great work.",
          "I attended a graduation ceremony in the tent at the zoo. It's very spacious and clean, however, the walls are completely blank and white. It was still very elegant with linen and the table set up. Perfect for a wedding and big event.",
          "We enjoyed the Zoo, the train was not working, due to the cold air, but just like all engines they need to be started up before use. I believe that to be the problem, so we we're very disappointed, a lot of work going on in the park. Most \u2026",
          "So fun my kids love it",
          "Amazing best place to visit  I recommend the memberships if you plan going more than once a year. One time payment and free for the year. food is a little bit pricey but good. People Are Awesome there the employees and the volunteers.",

          "We always have an amazing experience and I am so excited to see the new exhibit once it is finished and open!",
          "Decent zoo for the area we are in. Most of the animals were hidden/sleeping. Some of the exhibits were dirty (with random trash) ESPECIALLY the sea lion one. That one was actually really really gross. The glass was disgusting to the point \u2026",
          "We had fun. This place is amazing.",
          "Zoo is always great, really like the new editions. Star Wars day could have just as the Harry Potter day, maybe next time.",

          "Believe price is to high to enter for what you get also food prices are too high. They have alot of work to do",
          "Half the animals are malnourished especially the tiger can barely even stand can see every bone is his body and most exhibits are closed probably due to the animals passing.",
          "Getting a family pass is well worth the price.  The zoo is big and it will keep young children occupied. There is a large playground and splash pad there. You can bring in your own coolers and foods.",
          "Really didn't have much to see , but still kinda fun",
          "This zoo is great!  The exhibit size to viewing ratio is impressive and whenever I go the animals are out and about.",

          "Great for a small family friendly zoo. Not a while lot to see here but it's something to do while visiting El Paso.",
          "It's small. It's in the process of adding on though and I'm excited to see what comes. \nI thought the gift shop was a smidge pricey but we still left with quite a few souvenirs. We had a good time. Loved the splash pad."

        "wiki": "Franklin Mountains State Park is a Texas state park in El Paso, Texas, in the United States. Park headquarters are located at an elevation of 5,426 feet (1,654 m) with the highest peak reaching 7,192 feet (2,192 m). It is one of the largest urban parks in the nation lying completely within city limits, covering 24,247.56 acres (9,813 ha). Franklin Mountains State Park is open year-round for recreational hiking, mountain biking, picnicking and scenic driving and vistas.\n\n\n== History ==\nNative Americans and other travelers have used the natural resources in the Franklin Mountains when crossing the gap between the Franklin Mountains and the Juarez Mountains that is now Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez across the Rio Grande in Mexico and El Paso. Pictograms and mortar pits confirm a human presence in the mountains dating back more than 12,000 years.The Franklin Mountains are most likely named after Benjamin Franklin Coons, who in 1849 purchased a ranch in what is now El Paso. At first known as Coons Ranch, by 1851 the settlement took on Coons' middle name and was called Franklin. Despite the town being officially named El Paso in 1852, the locals continued to call it Franklin throughout the 1850s.The El Paso Tin Mining and Smelting Company operated a tin mine on the northeast slope of North Franklin Mountain from 1909 to 1915. While the mine had the distinction of being the only tin mine ever located in the U.S., it was an economic failure.Efforts to grant protected status to the Franklin Mountains began as early as 1925. A real estate developer sought to build housing on the mountains and in 1979 he built a road up into them. A local organization known as the Wilderness Park Coalition was able to convince the Texas Legislature to protect the mountains in 1979. Despite this success the legislature, in the same bill, prohibited funding for the development, operation and maintenance of the park. The property was formally acquired in 1981. Changes to the legislation were made in 1985 when a plan for park development was established and the park was opened to the public in 1987.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe Franklin Mountains are 23 miles (37 km) long and  3 miles (4.8 km) wide and stretch from El Paso into New Mexico. The Franklins were formed due to crustal extension related to the Cenozoic Rio Grande rift. Although the present topography of the range and adjoining basins is controlled by extension during rifting in the last 10 million years, faults within the range also record deformation during the Laramide orogeny, between 85 and 45 million years ago.The Precambrian rocks atop North Franklin Mountain are \"the highest geological structure in the state of Texas.\" The highest peak is North Franklin Mountain at 7,192 feet (2,192 m). North Franklin Peak can be accessed via a trail located east of Mundy's Gap. The mountains are composed primarily of sedimentary rock with some igneous intrusions. Geologists refer to them as tilted-block fault mountains and in them can be found billion-year-old Precambrian rocks, the oldest in Texas.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nFranklin Mountains State Park is part of the Chihuahuan Desert. The plants and wildlife found in the park, despite it being within a city, are typical of those found throughout the rest of the desert. Barrel cactus, yucca, Mexican and California poppies are common plants. Trees like cottonwood, hackberry, juniper and oak grow along the springs on the mountain slopes. Mammals in the park include mule deer, mountain lions, ring-tailed cat and a variety of rodents. Birds observed at the park included golden eagles, owls, hawks, and a wide variety of smaller birds.\n\n\n== Recreation ==\nFranklin Mountains State Park is open for year-round recreation. Development of the park is limited and much of the land is far from paved access roads and parking areas. Two hiking trails can be accessed from Woodrow Bean Transmountain Drive. Plans for a network of 100 miles (160 km) of hiking trails are under consideration. Rock climbing is permitted in the park and well established climbing areas are located in McKelligon Canyon The park headquarters is also located in McKelligon Canyon. Five camping areas are found in the Tom Mays Unit of the park with picnic facilities.The Wyler Aerial Tramway is an aerial tramway operated by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and is located in the Franklin Mountains State Park. The tram is closed to public as of Sept. 2018. The tramway complex covers 196 acres (0.79 km2) on the east side of the Franklin Mountains. The gondolas travel along two 2600 foot 1 3/8\" diameter steel cables to Ranger Peak, 5,632 feet (1,717 m) above sea level. The trip takes about four minutes and lifts riders up 940 vertical feet above the boarding area.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nFranklin Mountains (Texas)\nNorth Franklin Mountain\nBeach Mountains\nEl Paso, Texas\nWyler Aerial Tramway\nTexas Parks and Wildlife Department\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nU.S. Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System: Franklin Mountains\nFranklin Mountains State Park from the Handbook of Texas Online\nPublic domain photos of West Texas and Llano Estacado",

          "This place is a waste of tax payer dollars. The hours of operation are very limited and there isn't much to see or do in a desert park. You can hike up to a cave, but other than there are much better campgrounds within an hour of here.",

        "wiki": "Chamizal National Memorial, located in El Paso, Texas, along the United States\u2013Mexico international border, is a National Park Service site commemorating the peaceful settlement of the Chamizal boundary dispute.\n\n\n== Facility ==\nThe 54.90-acre (22.22 ha) memorial park serves primarily as a cultural center and contains art galleries, a theater, and an amphitheatre.  A museum, which details the history of the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, is located inside the visitor center.  The park honors the peaceful resolution of the Chamizal dispute, a more than 100-year border dispute between the United States and Mexico that resulted from the natural change of course of the Rio Grande between the cities of El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua.  This national memorial was established on part of the disputed land that was assigned to the United States according to the Chamizal Convention of 1963; a corresponding Parque P\u00fablico Federal \"El Chamizal\" was created on the now-Mexican portion of the land.\nThe Chamizal Convention was negotiated by the International Boundary and Water Commission, which was established in 1889 to maintain the border, and pursuant to later treaties to allocate river waters between the two nations, and provide for flood control and water sanitation.\n\n\n== Administrative history ==\nThe National Memorial was authorized on June 30, 1966.  It was established as a National Park Service unit on February 4, 1974, and was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places the same day.\n\n\n== Admission and hours ==\nFees and permits required to use the theater. Fees for picnic facilities for groups of 50 or more.Park grounds, 5 a.m. - 10 p.m. daily.  Closed Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day.Visitors center and galleries open 10 a.m. - 5 p.m . Administration office open 8 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial NPS website: Chamizal National Memorial\nNPS image archive",

          "We pretty much had the place to ourselves. The museum was closed but the park was open. We saw a marker where the original Chamizal treaty border between the US and Mexico was. From the park you could see the border fence and the highway bridge to Mexico. I wish the museum",
          "First, the Memorial is bounded by East Paisano Dr., Delta Dr. and San Marcial St. In 1911 Mexico and the US had an arbitration over a piece of land that was cut by the Rio Grande River and floated from the river's Mexican side to the U.S. side. Mexico was awarded the parcel by",
          "Wanted to go here as it is so close to the border and is a flashpoint in history. Nice NPS law enforcement officer talked with us. Also had good interface with NPS Ranger in the visitor center. Left with a much better sense of border issues and how they affect regular people.",
          "The pavilion in the park commemorates a minor historic event from the 1960s with photos of participating politicians but gives very little perspective of the lives of the everyday people who lived there and how this historic event might have affected them, The surrounding park",
          "This place really surprised us. We try to visit national parks when we can and this one did not disappoint. My 10 & 12 did the Jr. Ranger program and learned about the local history. They earned the their badges and had a great time walking the grounds. It is a small visitor",
          "This park would be better when the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) leave lawfully attending Park users alone. DHS and DPS questioned me about sitting on a park bench during the daytime. Meanwhile, they admitted to some",

          "My spouse thinks I just wanted to go here to get another stamp in my National Parks Passport. Not true! I like to fill in the gaps of my knowledge of US history, and there is always something to learn at the sites. It was heartening to read about true diplomacy between Abraham",
          "While the park grounds open at 7 AM (till 10 PM) , the visitor center is open only from 10 AM until 5 PM. There is a good view of the Bridge of the Americas - the international bridge across the Rio Grande that connects El Paso (USA) with Ciudad Juarez (Mexico) from the park",
          "Chamizal Memorial is a real gem of a historical place that should be more advertised. The memorial museum has very detailed and attractive exhibits of the peaceful agreement between two countries to resolve a pestering border dispute. The parking lot was under reconstruction",
          "If you like history and historical sights this would be a great place to visit. Check the hours before going tho because I went when it was not open but still got to see the exhibits in the lobby area.",
          "It's hard to believe that it took the US and Mexico well over 100 years to settle their boundary dispute on the edge of El Paso within sight of the International Bridge connecting the two countries. There are excellent exhibits and pictures here commemorating the event with",
          "The orientation film is a great place to start. Everything at the site is well done but it felt like a lot of focus, space, and cost for a relatively minor event. When I compare it to other National Park sites it just isn't above average. If this review is helpful then please",
          "We learned a good bit about the history of this area and the border controversy that lasted for over a century.",
          "Girls' weekend brought us to this place --- negotiations happened on the birthdate of one of our group and actual return to Mexico happened on birthdate of another of our group! Very interesting",
          "I knew nothing about the history of the area or the border issues. So this memorial was worth a visit to learn a little piece of American history. You can watch the video and see the exhibit in less than an hour. Then take a walk on the paths outside.",
          "We drove on purpose to this close to border area to visit this memorial. During our 18 days southwest tour we had several disappointments such places being closed due to government financial blockade . Unfortunately, this was another one. We saw only the outside colorful murals",
          "During a recent road trip, I spent a night in El Paso on my way to Carlsbad Caverns. As I was exploring the city, I made a quick stop at Chamizal National Memorial since it was a highly rated attraction in the city. If you're in the area, it's worth a quick stop since there's no",
          "A very interesting site within sight of the U.S./Mexico border that explains a thorny issue (if the border is defined by the river, and the river moves, where exactly is the border?) and commemorates its diplomatic solution a century in the making, our family had a great visit",
          "Took my kiddos (3&10) to explore and the rangers were fantastic. Really knew how to talk to kids and explain or their level. You can get a stamp for your National park passport book and your kiddos can becae jr rangers.",
          "I would say this place is worth a quick stop, but don't expect to stay long. It is a nice park and mural commemorating the cultures of the bortder area and the end of territorial disputes between the US and Mexico.",
          "My husband and I visited the Chamizal National Memorial on a Sunday. The Park was small, but clean and well kept. The outside bathrooms were clean. However we were disappointed that the visitors center was closed.",
          "We were tipped off about Chamizal National Monument by the park ranger at Fort Davis National Historic Site. We spent the morning visiting the museum and strolling the grounds before our afternoon flight home. A beautiful memorial to the peaceful & diplomatic border resolution",
          "Interesting history between the US and Mexico and the border disputes. Was very happy we took the trip to see this memorial.",
          "The mural is a lot of fun but inside there's not that much history (or much else) inside the building.",
          "Chamizal is a hidden gem within a stones throw of the US/Mexico border in El Paso Texas. This is managed by the US National Park Service. Entrance is free and there\u2019s a wonderful museum on the history of Chamizal and how this became such an important monument. The grounds are",
          "Visited 5-11-18. We learned a great deal about an unknown to us border dispute with Mexico and the USA that lasted many years. This is a very large urban park with a lot of history. There is a nice display wall explaining the events in time lines. Very small book store",
          "We spent several hours here, both viewing the displays and doing the outdoor walking tour. There were plenty of shaded benches on the tour, which made it pleasant to walk in 80 degree weather. The ranger told us that the indoor displays are in transition to reflect current",
          "So my nieces wanted to visit because they had seen some pictures of the place on social media. It really is an \"instagram spot\". I like how they keep the place clean and by mixing multiple historical figures in the same space, it teaches you about how we connect our cultures",
          "The history of Chamizal is very interesting and this is a good monument to check out. It's in a park so little kids can run around. We only spent about 15-20 minutes but are glad we went.",
          "There's a wall of art at the main entrance, a small museum inside, and that's pretty much it. You probably won't need more than 30 minutes.",
          "I regularly pedal by and through this incredibly historic site that is the resolution of a century-long border discussion between the USA & the EUM, and am always awestruck with the amicable settlement. I've been saddened, though, that official camping is permitted only South of",
          "Very interesting National Memorial with a small museum and some beautiful murals. Small gift shop is also on the premises. Good views of Mexico.",
          "It's a small museum, but worth stopping. Be sure to watch the video. The grounds look beautiful and it has a stage for outdoor performances.",
          "Chamizal is part of the National Park Service so it receives significant funding and is at no risk of closing. Otherwise, you wonder if it would survive without an admission fee. It's primarily a medium sized urban park with open fields, concrete sidewalks, and benches. The",
          "There is a cultural center that introduces you the history and you can walk around the park and see the border. Parking is easy too. Very convenient facilities and nice staffs",
          "Been here several times. A real nice historical setting with lots of photos, videos and information. Nicely arranged with park rangers employed to help out if needed. Good parking. Good for the family. Also, a good venue for music and dancing. A great local place to visit.",
          "Stopped by Chamizal on our way through El Paso. As with all NPS sites, this was worth the stop. It was really nice to learn how the two sides were able to cooperate and settle the land dispute in a civil way. It is a small National Memorial, but it was packed with",
          "This was one of our destinations, because of the historical purpose and the cooperation of two countries. We were surprised when we were able to see a play there also. Can't remember the name, but it was about a very progressive woman. We enjoyed the play and the park.",
          "This 55 acre site right on the US/Mexico border is free, grounds are open daily 7 AM-10 PM and cultural center was open daily 10 AM-5PM when I was there. Outdoors there are lots of walking paths (accessible and level with places to sit) throughout the entire area with a stage",
          "I enjoyed the visit to the Cultural Center. The history of the memorial was well explained about the dispute of land between the US and Mexico. I enjoyed viewing the Franklin Smith Gallery. Many excellent prints on display.",
          "Large building with extensive exhibits on the historic agreement between the U.S. and Mexico. Located on the very land area that was part of the international dispute. Very nice surrounding grounds.",
          "I understand the significance of the National Memorial but it's not worth an out of the way trip to just come here. Make it part of a bigger trip. My wife and I visited Chamizal, Guadalupe, Ft Davis and Big Bend in one long weekend. The visitor center was closed. Why wasn't this",
          "We have been on a quest to see all the National Parks and as many National Monuments and Memorials as we can. Because we were in El Paso, we decided to visit. Chamizal. We had no idea what the Memorial was for. What it is is a Memorial that commemorates the land dispute between",
          "We visited this park because we were in El Paso and wanted to see something about the city. Unfortunately, we arrived just after they closed, however one of the National Park Service guys, A. Jones, was just leaving. We asked him about the park and he gave us so much great",
          "It's a small museum and probably a lot of people will say it's outdated but it delivers the information about the area and its history very well in short enough form for a traveler who is ready to stop for an hour or two, not for the whole day. I also think the premises are nice",
          "This may be only an hour of your time but you learn about the long history of US-Mexico relations which puts the present border wall issue in perspective. Plus, we learned there are drug smuggling and illegals coming through the park so the rangers work with local authorities",
          "Unless you're from the area you probably don't know about Chamizal, so it's worth stopping just for that. However, this story is fascinating, and even a little sad, but it's an important part of the history of Texas, Chihuahua, Mexico and the United States. The museum inside",
          "Music under the stars is something everyone should participate with. I have for many years have partake in the music festivities during the summer. it starts with jazz to rhythm and blues and then ends with Mariachi music",
          "National Park site on the border off of Paisano by Bowie High School. The park and visitor center commemorate the shared management of the border by an agreement drawn up in the 1960's. The small visitor center presents an interesting history and the grounds are often used for",
          "Love going there to get our vehicles wadhed. They are so careful and fast in vacuuming , whinging drying your car. Clean everything from end to end All while you can enjoy some delicious food.",
          "We stopped as a family since we love visiting national parks and memorials. After visiting, we were wondering why this place existed. Daughter completed the Junior Ranger program, but stated she really didn't learn anything. Nice little history lesson, but nothing much else.",
          "It's more of a sign in a national park then a memorial. You can take the quick detour while your on the mission trail. Being below the border expressway it's taken away its quietness.",
          "Made the effort to visit this site recently; it commemorates the movement of the border by putting the Rio Grande into a concrete ditch in 1962. There is a stage for outdoor presentations, a small theater w/ a 10 minute movie on why this happened, and some inappropriate local",
          "This is the kind of place to go for history. I went here and the ranger was helpful and educated us about the Mexican-American treaty brought about by war. Good for everyone of all ages and is FREE",
          "Nice place to visit if you're in El Paso. Here you'll learn about the dispute of the Mexican-American border and how it was solved. This is an example of solving conflicts in a pacific way which is not common these days.",
          "This memorial commemorates the history of the settlement of a 100 year land dispute between Mexico and the U.S. caused by the shifting of the Rio Grande River. There is an amphitheater for local theatrical and musical events and a small but interesting art museum. My wife and",
          "History took place here and it is a nice park to walk through. It is surrounded by too much traffic so kind of a pain to get to.",
          "A great lesson in history. A river can change its course over time. This makes borders, security and diplomacy a complex issue. The staff did a great job at this memorial on the bourder.",
          "This is a nice enough place, but it is basically a park. It commemorates a peaceful resolution of a land dispute between the US and Mexico. There are some interesting markers and murals.",
          "Short visit, the buildings are very well kept and maintained. The grassy areas were peaceful. I can imagine it can get a little crazy when an event is going on.",
          "Small national memorial. Learned about the history of this small piece of land. Seems like an interesting place to see one of the shows they have, but none going on when we were there.",
          "This is a lesser known national landmark that we had all to ourselves for an hour or so. It takes its name from a saltbush plant that used to grow profusely in the vicinity. As the Rio Grande river cut a new flood channel in 1864 it cut off some parts of Mexico and some parts",
          "Really interesting to learn about this National Memorial, right on the border of El Paso and Ciudad Juarez. Neat children's area and short film which provides the background. Well kept grounds, enthusiastic Park Rangers and great Junior Ranger activities.",
          "Important History to remember and recognize that our family might have been able to relate if they lived in this central part of El Paso TX. in the 1960 Bitter Sweet knowledge.",

          "I decided to come here cuz I had not been here in a while. I was impressed by the history of the conflicts that have occurred in this area I call my hometown..The history stated that there were conflicts with the Spaniards and the Indians for centuries before. I watched the",
          "This is a national memorial run by U.S. park rangers. It told the story of border disputes and treaties between Mexico and the U.S. The Colorado River changed course and people suddenly found themselves on the wrong side of the border. It was the only agreement struck between",
          "We arrived here about 9 AM hoping to get into the visitor's center before the rush, but discovered it doesn't open until 10 AM. However, the ranger told us they were having a special program that day for local students, a presentation of Mexican folklorico dances and we were",
          "Its amazing how two cultures create a great place, Chamizal National Memorial staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, They will show you what Friendship is.",
          "The park opens early but be aware that doesn't mean the visitor center with all the info opens early. The visitor center opens at 10 am so I missed probably most of the info. The mural outside is interesting but I think the original version (especially the one on the left) was",
          "The music weekends are great to bring your chairs and soft drinks. The evening are wonderful to enjoy. Bring bus sprays for the mesquitos!! This is held all summer, very enjoyable. Its open to the public.",
          "The National Memorial is an easy visit, it is free with plenty of green space for children to run and play. There is a quick walk through history to understand the importance of the National Memorial site. They do host a lot of cultural events here, so I encourage everybody to",
          "The other half on Chamizal is in Juarez. If you brave the border, make sure you know where you are going. 1/2 times I received flack from US border patrol for crossing....well intended, but perhaps a more fitting issue a few years ago.",
          "We stopped here to because we liked the idea of looking across the border to Mexico even though we didn't plan to visit Mexico. The park is very pleasant with picnic tables and trees scattered on a grassy area. The big red x of the border crossing is visible, but not the river.",
          "We had our National Park Travelers Convention here. This is a smaller park but with a lot of history. They are going to be redoing some of the displays soon and can't wait to come back to see it. The Rangers were very friendly and helpful and pointed out several other",
          "If you have never heard of the memorial, then you are not alone. We are national park junkies who love collecting the passport stamps. We were close enough to make a trip to this site to see what it was all about. Yes, the disputed boundary between the US and Mexico was most",
          "This is a wonderful monument to the peaceful way in which a major border dispute was resolved. It sure would be nice to have a more open border but 9/11 took care of that for the foreseeable future. We attended a meeting at the site and with a presentation by a ranger and an",
          "The park honors the peaceful agreement of a more than 100-year border issue between Mexico and USA that resulted from the natural change of course of the Rio Grande River between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. A Park Ranger gave us very enlightening knowledge about the memorial. He",
          "The staff was great and learned a lot. Free to enter and view the park. Fun fact: our southern boarder was not so \" set in stone \" as you would have thought. Well it was fixed in the 1960's thanks to JKF. Hence the reason he is on the mural",
          "Beautiful place with Mexican-American history. The theater is little but cozy and it has excellent light and sound.",
          "Had no idea about the ongoing border dispute here, or how it was resolved. Interesting history lesson. The pale also features live performances.",
          "We decided to make a stop at Chamizal partially because my 4 year old son has a National Parks Passport we like to collect stamps for. We stopped by early on a Saturday morning. You'd never know it was there, hidden behind a residential area off the highway you'd usually have",
          "I had read the previous reviews and people had told me not to go but its a NP and there must be a reason for that. So I went and saw and it took all of 10mins. It's down the road from the zoo but don't make a special trip.",
          "Horses are available to rent for a good price. Lots of space to ride them. Took a grill, cooked a discada, rode the horses and ponies. Lots of security makes you feel comfortable.",
          "Really interesting little National Memorial. It tells the story of how a border dispute was caused then solved peacefully, which is somewhat unusual. It's also got a nice exhibit on the survey of the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo and how the Mexican and American team were able to",
          "Stopped by the visitor's center real quick. The museum just explains how the US and Mexico came to terms with a new International border. The park outside was surrounded by busy streets. The grass needed to be cut. Not one of the better NPS sites.",
          "So much to learn at the Memorial!! I was amazed by the history of El Paso, and how much of El Paso was actually part of Mexico, & how much I didn't learn in school!! During the summer months, there are free outdoor concerts every weekend - with an outdoor dance floor ....",
          "We came to the memorial to burn some time before catching a flight out if town. The memorial is dedicated to the peaceful end to a land dispute between Mexico and the United States. It's a great idea for the land, but overall it isn't anything overly special. The memorial has",
          "I honestly don't know why this is a national park. It is more like a shabby city park than anything else. There is nothing there to do outside of scheduled activities. Close to 2 freeways so you get to enjoy the sound of traffic and smell of exhaust while strolling through",
          "It's a small visitor center with some outdated displays they intend to redo shortly but still a source of very interesting info, and the staff is friendly and ready to share some history with you. This would be a great spot to visit with a history class. There is an event every",
          "Visitor center did not seem to be open hours posted on the sign. Park is in average condition and did not seem to be in the greatest of areas. Lots of special events were scheduled but seemed more geared to the local. Not worth going out of your way to and make sure you",
          "Easy to find, park rangers were friendly. Its a place to get a stamp if you like the Passport books that the National Park does.",
          "This is one of those strange places in the national park system that don't seem to belong. As other reviewers have said, it's a nice bit of history but part of the national park system? That being said the rangers(why they needed more than one is beyond me) were very nice and",
          "A well kept small park established in the 1960s to commemorate the treaty (The Chamizal Convention) which resulted in the peaceful settlement of a century-long boundary dispute between the U.S.A. and Mexico. What is noteworthy is that because of the park's close proximity to",
          "I had not been here in years so decided to visit! Got to read about the Chamizal treaty in 68 happened when I was just a child. The grounds are still well kept and I would have walked it if it had not been so cold. Got a 20% discount at the Gift shop since I am a teacher, but",
          "I visited Chamizal for a work-related function. There was nothing terribly unique about it. It is just a square of nicely-tended grass with a building that tells the story of negotiations between the US and Mexico regarding placement of the border. It accept that it is",

          "Outside of El Paso's music under the stars, and frequent art shows the Chamizal National Memorial is one of the least informative of all the NPS locations. I have been to over 120 NPS sites, and was disappointed there was such limited information on the historical significance",
          "Chamizal celebrates the settlement of a long disagreement with Mexico over the international border. Much of the dispute was caused by a huge flood on the Rio Grande in 1864 that stretched another 100 years before it was finally settled. There is the usual film, displays and",

          "I took my 3 small grandchildren while visiting there in November. Not much to do for the little ones during this time of year. They do have a 15 minute movie describing the purpose of the memorial, which was quite interesting to myself.......little ones weren't impressed."

        "wiki": "The State Scenic Highway System in the U.S. state of California is a list of highways, mainly state highways, that have been designated by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) as scenic highways. They are marked by the state flower, a California poppy, inside either a rectangle for state-maintained highways or a pentagon for county highways.The California State Legislature makes state highways eligible for designation as a scenic highway, listing them in the Streets and Highways Code, sections 260-284. For a highway to then be declared scenic by Caltrans, the local government with jurisdiction over abutting land must adopt a \"scenic corridor protection program\" that limits development, outdoor advertising, and earthmoving, and Caltrans must agree that it meets the criteria. The desire to create such a designation has at times been in conflict with the property rights of abutters, for example on State Route 174.Any county highway that is believed to have outstanding scenic qualities is considered eligible, and the county with jurisdiction must follow Caltrans' same approval process as state highways to be declared scenic.\n\n\n== California Historic Parkways ==\nCalifornia Historic Parkways are defined in the Streets and Highways Code, sections 280-284, as a subset of the State Scenic Highway System. Such historic parkways must have been constructed prior to 1945, and have been determined by either Caltrans or the Office of Historic Preservation in the California Department of Parks and Recreation to have historical significance. They must not at time of designation be traversed by more than 40,000 vehicles per day on an annual daily average basis. They also must be \"bounded on one or both sides by federal, state, or local parkland, Native American lands or monuments, or other open space, greenbelt areas, natural habitat or wildlife preserves, or similar acreage used for or dedicated to historical or recreational uses\".\nState Route 110Arroyo Seco Parkway (also a National Scenic Byway), the first freeway in the Western U.S.\nDesignated

          "We enjoyed the view once we finally got on Scenic Drive. You can see El Paso and Juarez Mexico from the overlook. We were there early afternoon. I would imagine the view would be great at night too. Definitely make the drive up if you\u2019re in the area.",
          "I'm not sure what all that glamour about this sightseeing is all about because all I saw was a bunch of slums in Mexico off of side of the freeway. But, I guess if that's your game ...",
          "Well worth the time to take this drive . Easy to find. Ideally should be prepared to walk for best views. Bring sunscreen, hat sunglasses. Nice area for a picnic lunch.",
          "Scenic drive is a great way to see much of El Paso and Juarez. On a clear day you can see forever. A must see for tourist and El Pasoans alike.",
          "I have never seen such vast expanses of differing terrain. I thought Africa was huge, but so is Texas!!! If you are at all interested in geology or volcanology, this is a must. Just don\u2019t try Old Maverick road unless you have a serious four wheel drive vehicle!",
          "This was my second trip to El Paso, but first excursion to the Overlook. If you are new to El Paso or visiting for the first time, I strongly recommend taking the time to get your bearings. The East side of the Range is totally different than the West.",
          "We were here with my family and also my sister and niece fro Germany it was just an amazing view specially when the sun sets..",
          "The view is excellent especially at night. The drive up the Franklin Mountain is short. Sometimes you might find strong winds but otherwise is a must stop to visit and spend some time. One of the nice things about El Paso.",
          "Scenic overlooks a little tricky to get to but worth it the view of El Paso, I would check it out day time and night time for the lights. Sunset would be awesome!",
          "Such a beautiful drive! Didn't know it was there until we looked at tourist information. Well worth the time!",
          "The winding road takes you past some nice big houses. There are a few places that you can stop and see the view across Texas and into Mexico. We went during the day. It was pretty and it takes less than 20 minutes. Short trip with good photo opportunities.",
          "They close it sunday for walkers and bikers. Nice view of el paso and mexico. Make sure you get out of your car and read the signs",
          "While in El Paso, I visited the Scenic Drive Overlook. It was one of the highlights of my trip. There are several places along Scenic Drive that you can pull off and see panoramic views of the city. There is a small park area near the top of the top of the drive where you can",
          "This was an amazing view of El Paso and Juarez. Tricky to find in an unfamiliar city in the dark, but well worth it.",
          "This is nothing special but packs a huge punch. The road to get here is winding and offers views of the city. Once you settle into the overlook the views of the city and into Mexico are breath taking and beautiful. It is rare to find such a nice place to enjoy an hour or so",
          "Excellent salad and soup bar. Beyond that positive expression, we found the main courses of steak and prime rib to be sub-par and disappointing. Wait service was equally disappointing as our waiter seemed preoccupied with other customers. Perhaps they were understaffed or had",
          "A really great starting point when touring El Paso. You can literally see the whole layout of the town.",
          "My son took us for a scenic drive to this overlook and was surprise since I did not know of this overlook.",
          "A beautiful view of el pas downtown during evening time as well you can able to view the Monument of mexico from here",
          "The winding roads up the mountain drive added to the excitement of the evening. The lites of the cities and the curving road made this excursion memorable. Definitely a \"must do\" when you are in El Paso and it was FREE!",
          "Worth the drive to see the overlook of El Paso and over the border into Mexico. Several pull outs but best one is on top. Bring your binoculars or use the pay viewers",
          "Whether you view during the sunny day or during our beautifu nights, coming up to Scenic Drive gives you a magestic view of not only El Paso, Texas but also our sister city of Juarez, Mexico, the amazing Chamizal National Park and the connecting Rio Grande River between the US",
          "This site has the best views of downtown El Paso and Juarez, Mexico. It is located at the base of the Franklin mountains. There is no charge to go here and the ride up to the point is fun for those who like the winding road driving and spectacular views. A great place for",
          "From downtown, go north and turn right on Rim Rd. In addition to a spectacular view, there are beautiful homes to see.",
          "Scenic drive is a nice, 20-30 minute drive with amazing bi-national views. This desert mountain road is popular with bicycles. Nice, cheap, outing while in El Paso.",
          "Drove up on sunny yet windy day. We had a super clear view of the city. Kids 14, 12, & 10 had fun using the quarter operated binocular things they have at the look out point. Good if you have some time, you can drive straight through or park for a bit. Our visit was about 15",
          "Metal plaques explain the history of what you can see in El Paso and Juarez. Acces through residential neighborhood and the curving drive in park property up the slope.",
          "Went here to see the sunset, but the clouds got on the way. Parking is limited and difficult to get in and out of when it\u2019s busy, which it was. Probably would be a nice view if it were a clear day.",
          "Went here to see the sunset. Parking is limited and difficult to get in and out of when it\u2019s busy, which it was. Otherwise, it is a wonderful view of the city and neighboring areas. The sunset was nice but is dependent on the weather. It was windy and cold so didn\u2019t stay too",
          "We only had a short time in El Paso, so we were recommended to take the scenic drive over looking the mountains and seeing the beautiful homes in the valley. Its nice and there are great photo opportunities.",
          "Well worth the short drive from downtown El Paso. Lovely view during the day. I'm sorry we weren't also able to do a late evening viewing.",
          "It\u2019s worth taking the scenic drive and stopping off at the lookouts, as well as the beautiful homes in the area. Great for picture taking. When done with the drive, the main city is just a short distance and well worth parking and exploring the historic buildings.",
          "We were on a tour with Rudy (Border tours) and enjoyed the vista back in the whole area and also looking into Juarez.",
          "If you\u2019re in El Paso, this is one thing you can\u2019t miss. It\u2019s absolutely breathtaking to watch the sun set over the mountains and then watch all the lights come up as it gets dark. I go every time I\u2019m in the area!",
          "My best advice would be to go shortly before sunset and watch the sun go down and the city lights come on. One can see for miles with the lights of both downtown El Paso and Juarez visible. Close to both downtown and the University. It was a highlight of our visit.",
          "This was so cool to see. I highly recommend you go here and see the city lights. We really enjoyed the view and would go back.",
          "This is a beautiful view during the day but at night overlooking downtown it takes on a completely different character. Great place to sit as the sun goes down and watch the lights come on. Very close to downtown and not expensive to go to even if you take a taxi. If you live",
          "Took a trip up while on business in El Paso. It was definitely worth the visit. Very quiet and beautiful especially at sunset.",
          "My husband and I took a drive along scenic drive when we were on a house hunting trip to El Paso. This is one of the most beautiful views in El Paso. You can see for miles and miles! Be sure to check it out if this is your first visit to El Paso.",
          "an absolut must do in el paso - there are several scenic drives to go - see the divided city in daylight and nightlight -",
          "Took a quick trip to El Paso to see friends. We drove up the scenic drive and the view was amazing. The lights stretched for miles and were just beautiful. The road is a bit narrow and winds up the mountain. We went up on Saturday night and the parking can get a bit congested.",
          "We were driving through El Paso and had a great lunch. We only had a short time there and I saw on the map there was a scenic drive. It was great. The day was hot, but beautiful. The overlook is gorgeous! The road is windy and fun to drive.",
          "A place not very far from the downtown. Has multiple view points from where the whole city can be seen including Mexico. The scene looks so different during the day and the night. Its worthwhile to take a trip during both times. There are parking multiple parking spots at",
          "The drive to the scenic overlook takes a few minutes but it is worth it. It looks very different in the day time than at night. Best time to go is sunset. Bring a good pair of binoculars for a better view of Juarez.",

          "Scenic drive is El Paso's iconic \"Top of The World\" view of our City by the Rio Grand, where you can see Mexico and Texas at the same time. A nice drive against our Mountain that at night displays our famous Star of Hope and Community that can be seen from your airplane seat if",
          "Really short drive, but it's a beautiful view of the city and surrounding areas, all the way into Mexico!",
          "Scenic Drive is exactly that. A short cliff hanging drive along the East side of the Franklin Mountains near downtown El Paso, Texas. It is very old, poorly paved, narrow two lane road that winds along the edge of the mountain. There is a very small parking area, marked by a",
          "We went at night. It was just beautiful to see all the lights. We wanted to go back durning the day but never made it. A must see if you are in El Paso.",
          "The view is nice during the day, but the night is when it really shines. You can see the lights of El Paso as well as Juarez, across the border. Very nice!",
          "I stopped at this scenic drive overlook on a recent trip to El Paso at night and during the day. The night view was spectacular and should not be missed.",

          "We had many people visit El Paso for our wedding. They came from New York, North Carolina, Florida and Mississippi. The day after our wedding we took a drive to Scenic Drive, El Paso. Everyone was amazed and thrilled to experience such a beautiful sight. Thank you for keeping",
          "Such an awesome view overlooking the city. Just a bit crowded but worth the effort. Limited parking spaces and lots of cars",
          "If you are in El Paso, make sure you take the time to drive up to the overlook. Parking can be very limited, especially around sunset, so you might need to go early if you want a parking spot. The view is phenomenal, overlooking most of El Paso and Juarez. A must see!",
          "The first time I stood at the Overlook I was blown away by how much I could see of the surrounding area, including El Paso, clear into Juarez and the dramatic Sierras surrounding the Valley. The Overlook can be reached from the East and West of El Paso along a narrow but very",
          "One of our local El Paso buddies recommend driving up for this and said the views were pretty good. He lied they were great. Wonderful view of El Paso and Juarez...truly gives you a full appreciation of how large and spread out the 2 cities are. If you can I'd recommend a day",
          "Beautiful views of the city best seen at dusk. Prepare for the heat May thru early September. Well worth the sweltering heat you will experience for the views of two cities in two countries.",
          "We took a brief drive on the scenic route. It was nice to see some of the luxury homes of El Paso as well as a mountain view above the city. Passed the police academy.",
          "Wonderful overview of El Paso, and Mexico too. Mountain top proclaims Juarez on top in writing. See older neighborhood in El Paso on your way to the top and down. Get better looks with the special viewers here.",
          "If you are in El Paso and want to see the city from above and surrounding area, give it a drive. Its a peaceful drive up the Franklin Mountains and overlooks the city. There are a few areas to pull off and take in the scenery.",
          "It was a fascinating experience trying to identity the land marks from above the hill. Really scenic and interesting drive.",
          "Nothing like going to the high spot for the best view in town. Super nice and you see, of course, into Mexico and the Rio Grande. Windy drive is fun. Highly recommend this for as part of your tour.",
          "This is a great place to go to get a panoramic view of the El Paso metro area. You can see for miles, including across the Rio Grande into Ciudad Juarez. The mountains are scenic in a rugged and arid way (it's a desert, after all), and one can see just how large the metro area",
          "Highly recommended if you\u2019re in El Paso. It\u2019s a minimal time investment, free, and will give you the opportunity to see the city panoramas from incredible heights.",
          "Located in El Paso, at the top of the Franklin Mountains, the highest mountains in Texas. You may easily see Mexico, and Ciudad Juarez. Is a must if you are visiting El Paso Texas.",
          "Located in the Southwest area of the United States, you may have the experience to see the Chihuahua Dessert from the top of the Franklin Mountains, the highest mountains in Texas. You may see another country (Mexico), another state (Chihuahua), and another city (Ciudad Juarez).",

          "If you are driving on Scenic Drive to get from the east to west side of the mountain or vice versa then definitely stop. I wouldn't go out of my way to see lower income housing, freeway, trains and the border / mexico in the hazy distance.",
          "Quick drive to the overlook. I imagine if it's crowed there will be no place to park. Nice to see the city laid out before you and across into Mexico",

          "Going to or from the Outlet Mall this drive is an excellent alternative to the interstate out of El Paso. It provides a beautiful view of the valley with several places to pull over for photos or picnics. The day we were there was very windy so the view wasn't as clear as usual",

          "A good way to spend a few hours. Take the scenic drive overlook. It was windy but clear the day were up there. Great views of the two cities. Lots of good signs to read about the landmarks of the city and area that you are seeing from a distance. Best of all just cost you",
          "The El Paso Scenic Park Drive is a worthwhile drive for the first time visitor to get a nice view of El Paso and Juarez. But the drive is used by the city folks as a commuting route, and they drive too fast for the first time visitor. Limited parking is available at the",
          "Picturesque area. Great views at night. You can see the border and the separation of Mexico with the US.",

          "My husband and I were visiting El Paso for the first time this past week, and I knew we had to drive the Scenic Drive for those views of El Paso and Ciudad Juarez. And the views were worth it! If you're visiting El Paso for the first time, I suggest driving the Scenic Drive",
          "Go at sunset and then stay for the night lights of El Paso and old Mexico, you will not be disappointed .",
          "I thought it was an excellent place to take in views of the city. It is not high enough to cause altitude issues and the looking glass meeters help zoom in on places of interest. It is a short drive with a decent stopping point. It wasn't too crowded when I was there but told it",

          "Great view of the City and beyond. I highly suggest getting there early as parking is limited. It looked like there were two locations to view/Park, we skipped the smaller one and found a parking spot further up. Photographers will love the vantage point at Dusk/Dawn.",

          "El Paso is a difficult city to navigate (I am used to cities laid out on a grid), and on the streets I couldn\u2019t figure out which way to the Rio Grande. The birds-eye view from the overlook provided the necessary perspective. Great views.",
          "This was an easy drive from the city. The two times we drove up we were lucky to find not many cars as the parking is limited. It was just a little hazy but spectacular view of downtown and into Mexico. The road has stone guardrails so not too scary despite the steep climb.",
          "We drove to the \u201cScenic Drive\u201d at zip code 79902. It was easy to find with satnav and there is free parking at the best viewpoint. The day we were there was a little hazy, but we could easily see the US/Mexico border - the Rio Grande river. A sign points to the section of the",

          "We were at first a bit put off by all the roadworks around the Route here but we were pleased we persisted as the view is wonderful. There are a coup of places to pull in to and some explanation of what you are looking at. The day was clear so we had a good view of the cities",

          "We had several hours to spend in El Paso and tried hard to find how to fill our time. The scenic drive was suggested so we did drive there but honestly? It is not really that much of an attraction. Perhaps it gives people a nostalgic look at a city in Texas and its twin city in",

          "Scenic Drive. There is nothing like the view from here. Day or night. Now that it\u2019s the holidays you can see the Luminarias and so many lights around town. In the day it\u2019s a relaxing view to be enjoyed by all.",
          "Just a nice way to cross the city off the interstate. Perfect for tourists to view the mountains, river, both cities, Ft. Bliss, the airport and surrounding desert. Plus you pass some pretty spectacular homes to envy. Doesn't take much extra time and there are a couple of",

          "Stumbled upon this by mistake, as I was on my way to eat at Kiki's and saw a sign that said Scenic Drive. Glad I took the detour. A very narrow road and at times my knuckles turned white, but was well worth the trip over and back. There are several points where you can stop",

          "I've gone on scenic drive a few times, and each time, I always enjoy the views of the city and borderland. While it's not much of a cityscape, it still an amazing view. Downside is that the roads are narrow, dangerously shared with bicyclists, and limited on parking. Especially",
          "I live near Scenic Drive and visit it regularly, most often on Sunday mornings when it is closed to automobile traffic and open only to pedestrian and bicycle traffic. Virtually every week I ride my bike up the east side of Mount Franklin starting from Richmond Avenue and cross",
          "This spot offers an excellent view of the two cities and two countries. It was very crowded and parking is extremely limited, but if you want one of the best night views of these cities, this is the place to go.",
          "Worth the drive to get great photographs of your trip to El Paso and get unmatched views of El Paso and Cd. Juarez.",
          "There are a few clear days(10-15mph north wind) but compared to all the majestic vistas in the west(Grand Canyon, Zion, to Denali) this is simply a view of a city.",
          "We took the drive after the Sun Bowl on the recommendation of one of the locals. Good move. Views of both El Paso and Juarez were excellent. It's a short drive and was well worth the effort.",
          "cool views and history of surroundings. it was a hazy day but still really neat views. we ate at L@J cafe then it was an easy 10 min drive to top.",
          "We went on a clear sunny day and the view was amazing. You could see 60+ miles into Mexico. There is almost always a food truck vendor there with snack type items but there are no restrooms. If you are in to scenic views, this is a must stop for you.",
          "Well since you're here you might as well see the views of the sister cities of Juarez and El Paso . Because of the combination of both cities we are actually the 20th largest market place in North America I believe . It has a nice view of the city and sometimes a lot of local",
          "Wow! Worth the quick drive up the mountain. Amazing views. A camera phone doesn\u2019t do it justice. Haven\u2019t seen it in the day but nighttime is incredible and the lights go on forever.",
          "Great place to come and see El Paso from above. Quickly little 10 min drive up the mountain and we were there. Being up there at night is best. Take a jacket.",
          "I love driving through the scenic route. It\u2019s peaceful and the view is breathtaking. It is cold. Sometimes even in the summer. There are benches and parking spaces. It\u2019s packed during vacation times. It\u2019s the edge of a cliff. It\u2019s dangerous if you\u2019re too close or not careful. I",

          "Dramatic, short, drives up and down the southernmost point on the Franklin Mountain range to the observation area. Easy parking except during the Christmas evening lighting oogler season. Just a few steps, handcap-wheelchair accessible, to take in the scenic views to the south,",
          "On the way to white sands we drove Scenic Drive in El Paso. The view of El Paso and neighbor Juarez is breathtaking. Each turn brings more wows. The homes along the drive are varied and interesting. Going east n the drive was hard for my husband who doesn't like heights or",
          "One of the highest vantage points in El Paso. The view at the lookout faces the border and into Mexico. When it\u2019s clear out which is almost always you can see all the way out to the Juarez airport. You can see the border crossings and the international waterway the separates the",
          "The Franklin Mountain State Park was a great place to overlook the city. It was an odd juxtaposition to see snow around us at the top, and see the city enveloped in clouds of dust below.",
          "This overlook looks down on downtown El Paso, and into Juarez, Mexico. Its a great place to stop and take photos. I took a bunch, and have gone back several times since being here in El Paso. Attached are some of my photos.",
          "Got here just as the cold front hit El Paso but the view was still as amazing as in the previous visits prior. Was the first time to see the city in daylight instead of dark. We went there to see a sunset but the cold front and clouds put a damper on that. While we were not",
          "Easy to quickly stop by. Beautiful views regardless what time of day it is. Limited number of parking spaces.",
          "Beautiful views. Have to see at night with city lights lit. Hard to get to with tight dark roads and limited parking but definitely worth it.",
          "Scenic Drive is a beautiful overview of El Paso and also looking into Juarez, Mexico. Its been several years since I have been back home so there are many changes but Scenic Drive remains the same. The visit can be a quick 10 minute view by using viewing scopes to hanging out",
          "This is one of the best spots to see El Paso from. The view is amazing and goes on for miles. Teens use this spot to make out which can hinder parking but when you do get a spot its Great. Also be advised it may be windy up there too.",

          "this is a great place to observe the city. There are telescopes to view the city. great view of downtown and you can see Juarez Mexico. During Xmas luminarias are lit along the way. a remarkable sight to see. During the weekends road is closed to cars for joggers and bike",

          "We take visitors here and enjoy the vastness of the view. Quite the spot on a hot summer's eve with lots of people of all types! And there are even ice cream trucks sometimes. Kids will need to be watched; the dry desert fall would be painful. Very little trouble there. Mostly",
          "The View is awesome especially at night. The lights from Juarez and El Paso truly make it spectacular",
          "We went up at night and the lights of El Paso and Mexico are truly mesmerizing. It's also cooler at night so it's more relaxing.",
          "We stayed in El Paso on a trip east to west. Great Mexican food and big city conveniences, but a sprawling flat city. To get a proper perspective of the city, the area, and the neighboring city in Mexico, this Scenic Drive is a must. Beautiful viewshed. We did it during the day,",
          "This is a beautiful twisty road that runs along the side of the mountain. There is an overlook that shows you the city. At night, El Paso is very pretty with the lights sparkling in the crisp desert air (not in the summer though.) If you use your binoculars or the quarter ones",
          "El Paso is not a very pretty city, and seen from above it was even worse. The overlook at night was pretty and romantic. The people are so friendly; one couple let me take their picture silhouetted against a full moon. To really enjoy the austere beauty of the mountains, take a",
          "Went up scenic drive and a gate was drawn closing the road to traffic. No explanation and we were there during the time the sign at the entry said it was open. Very disappointing.",
          "While in El Paso you have to make time to see the city from above. Its amazing. we did it first during the night and then again during the day. So glad we did!",

          "Driving to the scenic drive overlook you'll clearly learn that there's a major divide in the city. Getting off the main highway you'll drive through a lower income area, beaten up roads, run down houses, and all that. As you start to ascend the hill you'll sudden get to some of",
          "Amazing view at dusk. Minus the people smoking weed and playing loud music, this place is awesome to hang out at. I enjoyed the 10 minutes I spent walking around here with my friends. Probably wouldn't go if someone else wasn't driving, but it seemed to be worth the trip.",
          "Nice route to airport from West side. Surprised elevation 5280 feet. Not too busy most of the time and a better route than I10",
          "Perhaps one of the best places to see the city at night overlooking downtown El Paso and to the east. To the south is Mexico less than a couple km away! Parking is free and limited to about 10 cars. There is a small park just below the parking area for a small stroll. Too bad",
          "We arrived at the overlook just before sunset on a Saturday night (Murchison Rogers Park). There is not a lot of parking, but we managed to get our little car out of the road. Nice overlook of the city of El Paso and Jaurez, Mexico and the colors of sunset. Stick around for a",
          "Was in town for a family function and was taken on this beautiful drive by my son's girlfriend. The view of the both cities, El Paso & Juarez Mexico along with mountains was worth the drive. My son's girlfriend (who born & rasied in El Paso) explained that the letters on the",
          "It\u2019s at the base of the Franklin mountains and it\u2019s really cool with the plagues they have that describe/tell you what you are looking at.

          "Worth it! THE perfect overlook over the EP and Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico. It's just a short drive to get there.",
          "If you have a chance to stop in El Paso and have the time to do some site seeing this spot has been a great experience for a very long time. Being a somewhat local I've been up here many times. I've left town for a few years twice and driving up to the city is impressive during",

          "Two lane winding road on the Franklin Mountains overlooking downtown El Paso, I-10,, UTEP, the border highway, and Juarez Mexico. Sunset is a good time to go and watch the sky and mountains painted with splashes of color only seen in the desert area. Great photos can be taken",
          "Awesome place to view El Paso. I recommend both day and night visits. The day that we went was pretty windy but still had great views of El Paso. I love the night lights of El Paso. It just seems like El Paso goes forever",
          "The drive to the top of the mountain (part of the Franklin Mountains) is twisty and steep so go slow. When you get to the scenic overlook you'll see it is worth the effort it took to get there. There are several informative plaques but the real star is the view. Visit at",
          "It was suggested to go at sunset and while i was not able to do that the views were amazing. Bring quarters because they have those viewers so you can see far away.",
          "by driving up the scene route the view is super. You can see into Mexico and over to the University of Texas. the Air force base and much more. its a nice drive short and relaxing.",

          "El Paso is more hilly than people think, and it has a nice low mountain to the north. It's a shame the town managers messed up the Scenic Drive by cutting it short. A typical bureaucratic mistake.",
          "A short drive up the southern end of the Franklin Mountains State Park that has a good sized parking area with a view of east El Paso as well as across the border to Juarez, Mexico. Definitely a good drive for night time. During the day I would highly recommend taking the",
          "This is a very cool place to check out. I've lived in Texas nearly all of my life and am not used to seeing mountains. Driving this kinda reminded me of driving along a very small strip of the Pacific coast highway but without the water scenery. The panoramic view of the city",

          "Nice place to take in the view of El Paso and Juarez. Really enjoyed going up there at night to see all the lights.",
          "The view really is lovely, you can basically see the whole city. Great place to take the kids on a Sunday afternoon or take your sweetheart after dark for a romantic but cheap date. The lights at night are almost better than the mountains during the day. This is probably my",
          "It's top rated free attraction. If you happen to visit El Paso, this attraction should be on your list. Great night time views of Juarez. It s just amazing to see two cities as one. It does get crowded and parking might get tough so plan accordingly. It's safe in night and",

          "This is a wonderful way to see El Paso, Tx from an excellent vantage point. We have taken several visitors this way for the views and are never disappointed. The is narrow and not appropriate for large vehicles, but most know this and adhere to the rules of safety. We",

          "This was a nice side trip that didn't take too long as we drove through El Paso. The route going up from the east as provided by Google Maps had a lot of streets closed due to construction but it was easy to navigate around the closed streets. We went during the afternoon",
          "We always drive this road with visitors to El Paso. It's free and offers a great view of the Rio Grande Valley, El Paso and Juarez Mexico. You can also plan to do this drive in the evening to see the city lights below and the international border outlined. Rim road passes",
          "The scenic route was a great way to see the area of El Paso. There are two look out areas, one at the top, and another at the end in the nicer area of town. El Paso surprised me with some nice things to do, and this little drive was one of them.",

          "It's actually very nice. I mean it's nothing out of this world, but it is surprisingly pleasant up there with a view of El Paso that you can't get from anywhere else. I was initially alone when I followed the road leading up, and I went back that night to share with my wife. To",
          "Scenic Drive is a windy road crossing the tip of the last Mountain in the Rocky Mountain Range. It overlooks El Paso and you can see a great deal of Juarez, Mexico, During the day, you can see the border fence.. At night, you can tell where the border is by the difference in",
          "We enjoyed this. We went on a Sunday. It wasn't very crowded, and we didn't find it hard to find a parking space. At the top are some pretty incredible urban views of El Paso and Juarez. There was a lot of trash and glass all over though, which kind of took away from the charm",

          "I live within walking distance of the Scenic Drive overlook. On Sundays the drive from both directions is gated so that pedestrians, cyclists, dog walkers, skateboarders, and the like can take a hike without fear of automobile traffic. Scenic Drive is closed to automobile",

          "It you're driving in the nearby area, make sure to stop by. The view is fantastic, especially during sunset. You can also use the telescope to look closer. 25 cents per use, not pricey at all. You can see a lot more details of El Paso and Juarez. Parking could be tricky. Make",
          "Worth doing. Gives you a great overall view of El Paso and makes you realise how dry it is. The overarching colour is grey with not much green.",
          "El Paso should be proud of Scenic Drive. It's a built-in feature that could be a bigger tourist draw, if parking were available. Yes, parking is limited and dangerous. Cars stop waiting for spaces to open. Drivers are distracted. Be careful when crossing Scenic Drive! Once",
          "The view is incredible. Not the best for sunset. It's the wrong side of the mountain. There were a few food trucks at the top. Parking is really tight. You have to hope to get lucky. Worth the trip.",
          "This is a beautiful overlook. Great place to take pictures. Use El Paso and Juarez as a backdrop. The one drawback is the lack of parking there. There are a few parking places but not many and at times you can have a hard time finding a place to park.",
          "Definitely take this drive, the views are amazing, the road is in excellent shape. The road takes you into the mountains, which are mostly rocky giving it a surreal look. Although I'm sure that the night views of the city from the mountain must be spectacular, try to take this",
          "It is only a short drive from downtown and well worth the visit. You can see all of El Paso and Ciudad Juarez from this point. I recommend going in the afternoon while the sun is behind you for a better picture.",

          "I took this route while spending the night in El Paso, during the day it was a little dusty out but still you can see how large the city is. Went back at night when thing had calmed down and it was a much better view. Traffic can get a little stop and go so if you want to look",
          "I had been here many times before, but this time I am writing a review because the road was recently updated and now the experience is so much better. They have 2 places to stop and take pictures and you can see a good portion of El Paso and Juarez cities from there. A good",
          "Cities all over the world have their own twist, twang and style. This is a unique and beautiful thing about this city. Be careful if the hours are early and there are very few cars. Still go, but don't get out of your car. Common sense and nothing beyond that.",

          "Monday through Saturday this is an easy drive, but be prepared to hike on Sundays because it closes for people to walk through the overpass. This is the poor man's view of the entire region as far as the eye can see and its rich in history so soak it up. There is a quirky little",

          "This is a must for anyone new to, or visiting El Paso. The view is phenomenal. Just take your time on the drive, it's has some tight, blind curves. The parking at the viewing area at the top was pretty hairy. It was straight in parking so when you pulled out you go right into",
          "Note that when I went (Mar. 2017) the scenic road to the overlook was being repaired and closed, but there as a workaround if you get off on Virginia Street and head up that way. Well worth it as you get to a nicely developed overlook with telescopes and descriptive placards.",

        "wiki": "El Paso (; Spanish: [el \u02c8paso] \"the pass\") is a city and the county seat of El Paso County, Texas, United States, in the far western part of the state. The 2019 population estimate for the city from the U.S. Census was 681,728, making it the 22nd largest city in the United States. Its metropolitan statistical area (MSA) covers all of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in Texas, and has a population of 840,758.El Paso stands on the Rio Grande across the Mexico\u2013United States border from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua with 1.4 million people. Las Cruces, in the neighboring U.S. state of New Mexico, has a population of 215,579. On the U.S. side, the El Paso metropolitan area forms part of the larger El Paso\u2013Las Cruces CSA, with a population of 1,060,397.Bi-nationally, these three cities form a combined international metropolitan area sometimes referred to as the Paso del Norte or the Borderplex. The region of 2.5 million people constitutes the largest bilingual and binational work force in the Western Hemisphere.The city is home to three publicly traded companies, and former Western Refining, now Andeavor. as well as home to the Medical Center of the Americas, the only medical research and care provider complex in West Texas and Southern New Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso, the city's primary university. The city hosts the annual Sun Bowl college football post-season game, the second oldest bowl game in the country.El Paso has a strong federal and military presence. William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Biggs Army Airfield, and Fort Bliss are located in the area. Fort Bliss is one of the largest military complexes of the United States Army and the largest training area in the United States. Also headquartered in El Paso are the DEA domestic field division 7, El Paso Intelligence Center, Joint Task Force North, United States Border Patrol El Paso Sector, and the U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group (SOG).\nIn 2010 and 2018, El Paso received an All-America City Award. El Paso ranked in the top three safest large cities in the United States between 1997 and 2014, including holding the title of safest city between 2011 and 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks. The evidence suggests 10,000 to 12,000 years of human habitation. The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. When the Spanish arrived, the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area. These were subsequently incorporated into the Mestizo culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from Comancher\u00eda, and gen\u00edzaros of various ethnic groups. The Mescalero Apache were also present.\nSpanish explorer Don Juan de O\u00f1ate was born in 1550 in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and was the first New Spain (Mexico) explorer known to have observed the Rio Grande near El Paso, in 1598, celebrating a Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (decades before the English Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). However, the four survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza, and his enslaved Moor Estevanico, are thought to have passed through the area in the mid-1530s. El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) was founded on the south bank of the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande), in 1659 by Fray Garcia de San Francisco. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the Pueblo Revolt, until 1692 when Santa Fe was reconquered and once again became the capital.\nThe Texas Revolution (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of Cross-border town naming until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring Anson Mills to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.During the Civil War, a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union California Column in 1862. It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.\nAfter the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow as Texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority. El Paso itself, incorporated in 1873, encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river. In the 1870s, a population of 23 non-Hispanic whites and 150 Hispanics was reported. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, the population boomed to 10,000 by the 1890 census, with many Anglo-Americans, recent immigrants, old Hispanic settlers, and recent arrivals from Mexico. The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild boomtown known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness. Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). With the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city's geographic position, the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the U.S. Southwest.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio D\u00edaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D\u00edaz.By 1910, the overwhelming number of people in the city were Americans creating a settled environment. However, this period was short-lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees \u2013 and capital \u2013 to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast Plan de San Diego which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens. The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives. These actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the end result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.Simultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000 and Non-Hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites. In reply, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund. In 1916, the Census Bureau reported El Paso's population as 53% Mexican and 44% Non-Hispanic whites. Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.During and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.The Farah Strike, 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas. This strike was originated and led by Chicanas, or Mexican American women, due to Farah Manufacturing Company, one of the largest factories in the city, being unorganized, low wages, discrimination, no benefits, lack of gender-neutrality, health and safety hazards, and unattainable quotas. Texas Monthly described the Farah Strike as the \"strike of the century.\"On August 3, 2019, a mass shooting/domestic terrorist attack committed by a white supremacist occurred at a Walmart in El Paso, which left 23 people dead and 23 others injured.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEl Paso is located at the intersection of three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua) and two countries (the U.S. and Mexico). It is the only major Texas city on Mountain Time. Ciudad Juarez was once in Central Time, but both cities are now on Mountain Time.\nEl Paso is closer to the capital cities of four other states \u2013 Phoenix, Arizona (345 miles (555 km) away); Santa Fe, New Mexico, (273 miles (439 km) away); Ciudad Chihuahua, Chihuahua, (218 miles (351 km) away), and Hermosillo, Sonora (325 miles (523 km) away) \u2013 than it is to the capital of its own state, Austin (528 miles (850 km) away). It is closer to Los Angeles, California (700 miles (1,100 km) away) than it is to Orange (858 miles (1,381 km) away), the easternmost town in the state.\nEl Paso is located within the Chihuahuan Desert, the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region. The Franklin Mountains extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the west side forms the beginnings of the Mesilla Valley, and the east side expands into the desert and lower valley. They connect in the central business district at the southern end of the mountain range.\nThe city's elevation is 3,800 ft (1,200 m) above sea level. North Franklin Mountain is the highest peak in the city at 7,192 ft (2,192 m) above sea level. The peak can be seen from 60 mi (100 km) in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local Coronado High School gets its mascot's name. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 256.3 square miles (663.7 km2).The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park, the largest urban park in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and El Paso International Airport.\nThe Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey, an example of a pluton, rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Nearby volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (50 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEl Paso has a transitional climate between cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk) and hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh) featuring hot summers, with little humidity, and cool to mild dry winters. Rainfall averages 9.7 in (250 mm) per year, much of which occurs during the summer from July through September, and is predominantly caused by the North American Monsoon. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes thunderstorms, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.\nThe sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the National Weather Service; from this, the city is nicknamed \"The Sun City\". Due to its arid, windy climate, El Paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season, particularly during the springtime between March and early May. With an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph (50 km/h) and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph (120 km/h), these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.\nEl Paso and the nearby mountains also receive snow. Weather systems have produced over one foot (30 cm) of snow on several occasions. In the 1982\u20131983 winter season, three major snowstorms produced record seasonal snowfall. On December 25\u201326, 1982, 6.0 inches (15 cm) of snow fell, producing a white Christmas for the city. This was followed by another 7.0 inches (18 cm) on December 30\u201331, 1982. On April 4\u20137, 1983, 16.5 inches (42 cm) of snow fell on El Paso, bringing the seasonal total to nearly 30 inches (76 cm). On December 13\u201314, 1987, a record storm dumped over 22 inches (56 cm) of snow on El Paso, and two weeks later (December 25\u201326), another three inches (7.6 cm) fell, bringing the monthly total for December 1987 to an all-time record high of 25.9 inches (66 cm) of snow.\nThe average annual snowfall for the city varies widely between different neighborhoods at different elevations, but is 6.1 inches (15 cm) at the airport (but with a median of 0, meaning most years see no snow at all). Snow is most rare around Ysleta and the eastern valley area, which usually include large numbers of palm trees; in the higher neighborhoods, palm trees are more vulnerable to snow and cold snaps and are often seen with brown, frost-damaged fronds.\nOne example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C), the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was 1 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C), breaking the 5 \u00b0F (\u221215 \u00b0C) monthly record low set during the cold wave of 1899. Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results. Two local power plants failed, forcing El Paso Electric to institute rolling blackouts over several days, and electric wires were broken, causing localised blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days.\nMonthly means range from 45.5 \u00b0F (7.5 \u00b0C) in December to 83.5 \u00b0F (28.6 \u00b0C) in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon arrives, while daily low temperatures typically peak in July or early August with the higher humidity the monsoon brings (translating to warmer nights). On average, there are 52 nights of at- or below-freezing lows, 109 days of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C)+ highs and 20 days of 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ highs annually; it is extremely rare for temperatures to stay below the freezing mark all day. The city's record high is 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on June 30, 1994, and its record low is \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) on January 11, 1962; the highest daily minimum was 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the National Weather Service since 1879.\n\n\n==== Flooding ====\nAlthough the average annual rainfall is only about 9.7 in (250 mm), many parts of El Paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms. In late July and early August 2006, up to 10 in (250 mm) of rain fell in a week, the flood-control reservoirs overflowed and caused major flooding citywide. The city staff estimated damage to public infrastructure at $21 million, and to private property (residential and commercial) at $77 million. Much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood-control dams and reservoirs, and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water.\n\n\n=== Time zone ===\nEl Paso is located in the far western corner of Texas, which is roughly the only part of the state that is located within the Mountain Time Zone, as opposed to the Central Time Zone.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Downtown and central El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town contains some of the city's oldest and most historic neighborhoods. Located in the heart of the city, it is home to approximately 44,993 people. Development of the area started in 1827 with the first resident, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a wealthy merchant from Paso del Norte (present day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), who built the region's first structure establishing Rancho Ponce within the vicinity of S. El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the Sunset Heights district. It is close to the El Paso International Airport, the international border, and Fort Bliss. It is part of the El Paso Independent School District.\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the white American residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. Hispanic-American residents lived in an area called Chihuahuita (\"little Chihuahua\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area. Another downtown neighborhood is El Segundo Barrio, which is near the United States/Mexico border.\n\n\n=== Northwest El Paso ===\n\nBetter known as West El Paso or the West Side, the area includes a portion of the Rio Grande floodplain upstream from downtown which is known locally as the Upper Valley and is located on the west side of the Franklin Mountains. The Upper Valley is the greenest part of the county due to the Rio Grande. The west side is home to some of the most affluent neighborhoods within the city, such as the Coronado Hills and Country Club neighborhoods. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of El Paso.\n\n\n=== West central El Paso ===\n\nWest central El Paso is located north of Interstate 10 and west of the Franklin Mountains. The University of Texas at El Paso and the Cincinnati Entertainment district are located in the heart of the area. Historic districts Kern Place and Sunset Heights are in this part of town.\nKern Place was founded in 1914 by Peter E. Kern, for whom the neighborhood was named.The homes of Kern Place are unique in architecture and some were built by residents themselves. One of the better known homes is the Paul Luckett Home located at 1201 Cincinnati Ave. above Madeline Park, and is made of local rock. It is known as \"The Castle\" due to its round walls and a crenelated rooftop.Kern Place is extremely popular with college and university students. The area is known for its glitzy entertainment district, restaurants and coffee shops who cater to both business patrons and university students. After UTEP's basketball and football games, UTEP fans pack the Kern Place area for food and entertainment at Cincinnati Street a small bar district. This bar scene has grown over the years and has attracted thousands to its annual Mardi Gras block party as well as after sporting events or concerts. Young men and women make up the majority of the crowds who stop in between classes or after work.Sunset Heights is one of the most historic areas in town, which has existed since the latter part of the 1890s. Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory, but many have been neglected and have deteriorated. During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, Doroteo Arango (also known as Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s. During the 1910 Mexican Revolution many Mexicans fled Mexico and settled in Sunset Heights.\n\n\n=== Northeast El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town is located north of central El Paso and east of the Franklin Mountains. Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like east El Paso and northwest El Paso, but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at Ft. Bliss in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at Andress High School, Parkland High School, Irvin High School, and Chapin High School.\n\n\n=== East El Paso ===\n\nThe area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population of over 200,000. It includes the 79936 ZIP Code, which was considered in 2013 as the most populous in the nation with over 114,000 people.\n\n\n=== Mission Valley ===\n\nFormerly known as the lower valley, it includes part of Eastside and all lower valley districts. It is the third largest area of the city, behind east El Paso and central El Paso. Hawkins Road and Interstate 10 border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain).\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: Ysleta Mission-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), Socorro Mission-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and San Elizario Chapel (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King Philip II of Spain.\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n\n=== Texas and New Mexico suburbs ===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico. The most populated suburbs in Texas are Socorro, Horizon City, Fort Bliss and San Elizario. Other Texas suburbs are Anthony, Canutillo, Sparks, Fabens, and Vinton.\nAlthough Anthony, Santa Teresa, Sunland Park, and Chaparral lie adjacent to El Paso County, they are considered to be part of the Las Cruces, New Mexico metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings ===\n\nEl Paso's tallest building, the Wells Fargo Plaza, was built in the early 1970s as State National Plaza. The black-windowed, 302-foot (92 m) building is famous for its 13 white horizontal lights (18 lights per row on the east and west sides of the building, and seven bulbs per row on the north and south sides) that were lit at night. The tower did use a design of the United States flag during the July 4 holidays, as well as the American hostage crisis of 1980, and was lit continuously following the September 11 attacks in 2001 until around 2006. During the Christmas holidays, a design of a Christmas tree was used, and at times, the letters \"UTEP\" were used to support University of Texas at El Paso athletics. The tower is now only lit during the holiday months, or when special events take place in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2010 U.S. census, 649,121 people, 216,694 households, and 131,104 families resided in the city.

The first electrified line across the Rio Grande, which opened on January 11, 1902, was preceded by a network that relied on animal labor. The system quickly spread into residential and industrial areas of El Paso. In 1913, a 12-mile (19 km) interurban line was built to Ysleta. At the close of 1943, the holding company El Paso Electric sold its subsidiary, the El Paso Electric Railway Company and its Mexican counterpart, to one of National City Lines' subsidiaries. This resulted in the formation of El Paso City Lines, whose domestic streetcar lines were replaced by buses in 1947. The international streetcar line which crossed the border via the Stanton Street Bridge continued to operate until 1973.

The system was constructed under the authority of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, but when the major construction was completed, around spring 2018, it was transferred to Sun Metro, for operation and maintenance. As of 2016, construction of the system was projected to cost $97 million.\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\n\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of Nueva Espa\u00f1a, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe. Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area:\n\nBridge of the Americas, also known as the Cordova Bridge.\nGood Neighbor International Bridge, also known as the Stanton Street Bridge\nPaso del Norte International Bridge, also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge.\nYsleta\u2013Zaragoza International Bridge, also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.The city collects tolls at its international bridges.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of museums in West Texas\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Source notes ===\n\n\n== References ==\nHammond, John Hays (1935).

While the County Judge possesses some traditional powers of a judge, the County Judge functions primarily as the chief executive of the county.  The County Judge presides over Commissioners Court meetings, casts one vote on Commissioners Court (as do County Commissioners), and lacks veto authority.\nThe El Paso County Judge is Ruben Vogt, and the county commissioners are Carlos Leon (Precinct 1), David Stout (Precinct 2), Vince Perez (Precinct 3), and Andrew Haggerty (Precinct 4). Haggerty is a Republican, the other commissioners and the county judge are Democrats.\nVogt was appointed County Judge in October 2017 by the County Commissioners, following County Judge Veronica Escobar's resignation to run for Congress. He was previously Escobar's chief of staff. He will serve the remainder of her term, through the end of 2018. Leon and Perez were first elected to their positions in 2012, were re-elected in 2016, and have been in office since 2013. Haggerty and Stout were first elected to their positions in 2014, and have been in office since 2015.\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe first woman to hold elected office in El Paso County was a teacher, Myra Carroll Winkler, who was elected as superintendent of El Paso County schools in 1912.\n\n\n== Communities ==\n\n\n=== Cities ===\nEl Paso\nHorizon City\nSan Elizario\nSocorro\n\n\n=== Towns ===\nAnthony\nClint\n\n\n=== Village ===\nVinton\n\n\n=== Census-designated places ===\n\n\n=== Military Base ===\nFort Bliss\n\n\n=== Unincorporated communities ===\nMontana Vista\nNewman\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nEl Paso Holocaust Museum and Study Center\nList of museums in West Texas\nNational Border Patrol Museum\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\nRecorded Texas Historic Landmarks in El Paso County\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEl Paso County Official web site\nEl Paso County in Handbook of Texas Online at the University of Texas\nHistoric El Paso County materials, hosted by the Portal to Texas History.\nFort Bliss National Cemetery Disgrace Video",

        "wiki": "Magoffin Home is located in El Paso, Texas. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.   The surrounding area was declared the Magoffin Historic District on February 19, 1985.  The home is now known as the Magoffin Home State Historic Site under the authority of the Texas Historical Commission.\nThe Magoffin Home, built in 1875, is a combination of the local adobe style combined with Greek revival details and is an example of the Territorial style. The thick adobe walls keep the house cool in the summer heat and warm in the winter.  The house consists of three wings, each built at a different time, the last being built in the 1880s as the center that connected the two previous wings. There are 19 rooms, 8 fireplaces, and 14-foot (4.3 m) ceilings.  Members of the family lived in it for 109 years, and many of the original furnishings are still displayed, including a 11.5-foot-tall (3.5 m) half-tester bed.\nBuilt by pioneer Joseph Magoffin, who lived there with his wife, Octavia (MacGreal) until their deaths.  They had two children, James (Jim) and Josephine. James married Anne Buford and had four children, Anne, James, Mary and Jim. After James died in 1913 from appendicitis, Anne continued to care for her father-in-law at the homestead until his death in September, 1923. Josephine married William Jefferson Glasgow, a future Brigadier General in an extravaganza newspapers hailed as the 'wedding of the century'. After the death of Joseph, Josephine inherited the house and James' family settled in Los Angeles where Anne lived until her death in 1962. The last member of the family to live in the home was Octavia Magoffin Glasgow, Josephine's daughter, who died in 1986.\nAfter retiring from the military, the Glasgows returned to El Paso, Texas and remodeled the interior of the home, installing gas heat and electrical service, updating plumbing, and modernizing the kitchen.  The remodeling included plastering directly over her mother's Victorian wallpapers and removing the canvas ceilings (mantas). In 1976, the home was sold to the City and State, although Joseph's granddaughter, Octavia Magoffin Glasgow, retained lifetime tenancy and continued to live in the home until her death in 1986.  In 1977-1978, the house was restored by historic preservationist Eugene George, a professor of the School of Architecture at the University of Texas at Austin.The homestead is located at 1120 Magoffin Ave. in El Paso, Texas and is currently jointly owned by the City of El Paso and the State of Texas.  It has been maintained by the Texas Historical Commission since 2007 when authority of that agency was transferred from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department which had overseen the historic site since 1976. There is a historical marker. The Casa Magoffin Companeros (Friends of the Magoffin Home) host several annual events at the home, including kids camps and classes in the summer and a Holiday Open House in December.\nTours of the home are available Tuesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The last tour starts at 4 p.m.. Tickets for the tour, as well as unique gifts, may be purchased at the Visitor Center located across the street from the home at 1117 Magoffin Ave.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\nRecorded Texas Historic Landmarks in El Paso County\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMagoffin Home State Historic Site website\nEl Paso's Magoffin Home Video\n2005-2006 Texas Parks and Wildlife magazine",

        "wiki": "El Paso (; Spanish: [el \u02c8paso] \"the pass\") is a city and the county seat of El Paso County, Texas, United States, in the far western part of the state. The 2019 population estimate for the city from the U.S. Census was 681,728, making it the 22nd largest city in the United States. Its metropolitan statistical area (MSA) covers all of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in Texas, and has a population of 840,758.El Paso stands on the Rio Grande across the Mexico\u2013United States border from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua with 1.4 million people. Las Cruces, in the neighboring U.S. state of New Mexico, has a population of 215,579. On the U.S. side, the El Paso metropolitan area forms part of the larger El Paso\u2013Las Cruces CSA, with a population of 1,060,397.Bi-nationally, these three cities form a combined international metropolitan area sometimes referred to as the Paso del Norte or the Borderplex. The region of 2.5 million people constitutes the largest bilingual and binational work force in the Western Hemisphere.The city is home to three publicly traded companies, and former Western Refining, now Andeavor. as well as home to the Medical Center of the Americas, the only medical research and care provider complex in West Texas and Southern New Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso, the city's primary university. The city hosts the annual Sun Bowl college football post-season game, the second oldest bowl game in the country.El Paso has a strong federal and military presence. William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Biggs Army Airfield, and Fort Bliss are located in the area. Fort Bliss is one of the largest military complexes of the United States Army and the largest training area in the United States. Also headquartered in El Paso are the DEA domestic field division 7, El Paso Intelligence Center, Joint Task Force North, United States Border Patrol El Paso Sector, and the U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group (SOG).\nIn 2010 and 2018, El Paso received an All-America City Award. El Paso ranked in the top three safest large cities in the United States between 1997 and 2014, including holding the title of safest city between 2011 and 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks. The evidence suggests 10,000 to 12,000 years of human habitation. The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. When the Spanish arrived, the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area. These were subsequently incorporated into the Mestizo culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from Comancher\u00eda, and gen\u00edzaros of various ethnic groups. The Mescalero Apache were also present.\nSpanish explorer Don Juan de O\u00f1ate was born in 1550 in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and was the first New Spain (Mexico) explorer known to have observed the Rio Grande near El Paso, in 1598, celebrating a Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (decades before the English Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). However, the four survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza, and his enslaved Moor Estevanico, are thought to have passed through the area in the mid-1530s. El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) was founded on the south bank of the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande), in 1659 by Fray Garcia de San Francisco. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the Pueblo Revolt, until 1692 when Santa Fe was reconquered and once again became the capital.\nThe Texas Revolution (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of Cross-border town naming until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring Anson Mills to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.During the Civil War, a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union California Column in 1862. It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.\nAfter the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow as Texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority. El Paso itself, incorporated in 1873, encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river. In the 1870s, a population of 23 non-Hispanic whites and 150 Hispanics was reported. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, the population boomed to 10,000 by the 1890 census, with many Anglo-Americans, recent immigrants, old Hispanic settlers, and recent arrivals from Mexico. The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild boomtown known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness. Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). With the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city's geographic position, the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the U.S. Southwest.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio D\u00edaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D\u00edaz.By 1910, the overwhelming number of people in the city were Americans creating a settled environment. However, this period was short-lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees \u2013 and capital \u2013 to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast Plan de San Diego which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens. The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives. These actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the end result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.Simultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000 and Non-Hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites. In reply, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund. In 1916, the Census Bureau reported El Paso's population as 53% Mexican and 44% Non-Hispanic whites. Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.During and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.The Farah Strike, 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas. This strike was originated and led by Chicanas, or Mexican American women, due to Farah Manufacturing Company, one of the largest factories in the city, being unorganized, low wages, discrimination, no benefits, lack of gender-neutrality, health and safety hazards, and unattainable quotas. Texas Monthly described the Farah Strike as the \"strike of the century.\"On August 3, 2019, a mass shooting/domestic terrorist attack committed by a white supremacist occurred at a Walmart in El Paso, which left 23 people dead and 23 others injured.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEl Paso is located at the intersection of three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua) and two countries (the U.S. and Mexico). It is the only major Texas city on Mountain Time. Ciudad Juarez was once in Central Time, but both cities are now on Mountain Time.\nEl Paso is closer to the capital cities of four other states \u2013 Phoenix, Arizona (345 miles (555 km) away); Santa Fe, New Mexico, (273 miles (439 km) away); Ciudad Chihuahua, Chihuahua, (218 miles (351 km) away), and Hermosillo, Sonora (325 miles (523 km) away) \u2013 than it is to the capital of its own state, Austin (528 miles (850 km) away). It is closer to Los Angeles, California (700 miles (1,100 km) away) than it is to Orange (858 miles (1,381 km) away), the easternmost town in the state.\nEl Paso is located within the Chihuahuan Desert, the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region. The Franklin Mountains extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the west side forms the beginnings of the Mesilla Valley, and the east side expands into the desert and lower valley. They connect in the central business district at the southern end of the mountain range.\nThe city's elevation is 3,800 ft (1,200 m) above sea level. North Franklin Mountain is the highest peak in the city at 7,192 ft (2,192 m) above sea level. The peak can be seen from 60 mi (100 km) in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local Coronado High School gets its mascot's name. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 256.3 square miles (663.7 km2).The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park, the largest urban park in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and El Paso International Airport.\nThe Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey, an example of a pluton, rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Nearby volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (50 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEl Paso has a transitional climate between cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk) and hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh) featuring hot summers, with little humidity, and cool to mild dry winters. Rainfall averages 9.7 in (250 mm) per year, much of which occurs during the summer from July through September, and is predominantly caused by the North American Monsoon. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes thunderstorms, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.\nThe sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the National Weather Service; from this, the city is nicknamed \"The Sun City\". Due to its arid, windy climate, El Paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season, particularly during the springtime between March and early May. With an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph (50 km/h) and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph (120 km/h), these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.\nEl Paso and the nearby mountains also receive snow. Weather systems have produced over one foot (30 cm) of snow on several occasions. In the 1982\u20131983 winter season, three major snowstorms produced record seasonal snowfall. On December 25\u201326, 1982, 6.0 inches (15 cm) of snow fell, producing a white Christmas for the city. This was followed by another 7.0 inches (18 cm) on December 30\u201331, 1982. On April 4\u20137, 1983, 16.5 inches (42 cm) of snow fell on El Paso, bringing the seasonal total to nearly 30 inches (76 cm). On December 13\u201314, 1987, a record storm dumped over 22 inches (56 cm) of snow on El Paso, and two weeks later (December 25\u201326), another three inches (7.6 cm) fell, bringing the monthly total for December 1987 to an all-time record high of 25.9 inches (66 cm) of snow.\nThe average annual snowfall for the city varies widely between different neighborhoods at different elevations, but is 6.1 inches (15 cm) at the airport (but with a median of 0, meaning most years see no snow at all). Snow is most rare around Ysleta and the eastern valley area, which usually include large numbers of palm trees; in the higher neighborhoods, palm trees are more vulnerable to snow and cold snaps and are often seen with brown, frost-damaged fronds.\nOne example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C), the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was 1 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C), breaking the 5 \u00b0F (\u221215 \u00b0C) monthly record low set during the cold wave of 1899. Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results. Two local power plants failed, forcing El Paso Electric to institute rolling blackouts over several days, and electric wires were broken, causing localised blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days.\nMonthly means range from 45.5 \u00b0F (7.5 \u00b0C) in December to 83.5 \u00b0F (28.6 \u00b0C) in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon arrives, while daily low temperatures typically peak in July or early August with the higher humidity the monsoon brings (translating to warmer nights). On average, there are 52 nights of at- or below-freezing lows, 109 days of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C)+ highs and 20 days of 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ highs annually; it is extremely rare for temperatures to stay below the freezing mark all day. The city's record high is 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on June 30, 1994, and its record low is \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) on January 11, 1962; the highest daily minimum was 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the National Weather Service since 1879.\n\n\n==== Flooding ====\nAlthough the average annual rainfall is only about 9.7 in (250 mm), many parts of El Paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms. In late July and early August 2006, up to 10 in (250 mm) of rain fell in a week, the flood-control reservoirs overflowed and caused major flooding citywide. The city staff estimated damage to public infrastructure at $21 million, and to private property (residential and commercial) at $77 million. Much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood-control dams and reservoirs, and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water.\n\n\n=== Time zone ===\nEl Paso is located in the far western corner of Texas, which is roughly the only part of the state that is located within the Mountain Time Zone, as opposed to the Central Time Zone.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Downtown and central El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town contains some of the city's oldest and most historic neighborhoods. Located in the heart of the city, it is home to approximately 44,993 people. Development of the area started in 1827 with the first resident, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a wealthy merchant from Paso del Norte (present day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), who built the region's first structure establishing Rancho Ponce within the vicinity of S. El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the Sunset Heights district. It is close to the El Paso International Airport, the international border, and Fort Bliss. It is part of the El Paso Independent School District.\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the white American residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. Hispanic-American residents lived in an area called Chihuahuita (\"little Chihuahua\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area. Another downtown neighborhood is El Segundo Barrio, which is near the United States/Mexico border.\n\n\n=== Northwest El Paso ===\n\nBetter known as West El Paso or the West Side, the area includes a portion of the Rio Grande floodplain upstream from downtown which is known locally as the Upper Valley and is located on the west side of the Franklin Mountains. The Upper Valley is the greenest part of the county due to the Rio Grande. The west side is home to some of the most affluent neighborhoods within the city, such as the Coronado Hills and Country Club neighborhoods. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of El Paso.\n\n\n=== West central El Paso ===\n\nWest central El Paso is located north of Interstate 10 and west of the Franklin Mountains. The University of Texas at El Paso and the Cincinnati Entertainment district are located in the heart of the area. Historic districts Kern Place and Sunset Heights are in this part of town.\nKern Place was founded in 1914 by Peter E. Kern, for whom the neighborhood was named.The homes of Kern Place are unique in architecture and some were built by residents themselves. One of the better known homes is the Paul Luckett Home located at 1201 Cincinnati Ave. above Madeline Park, and is made of local rock. It is known as \"The Castle\" due to its round walls and a crenelated rooftop.Kern Place is extremely popular with college and university students. The area is known for its glitzy entertainment district, restaurants and coffee shops who cater to both business patrons and university students. After UTEP's basketball and football games, UTEP fans pack the Kern Place area for food and entertainment at Cincinnati Street a small bar district. This bar scene has grown over the years and has attracted thousands to its annual Mardi Gras block party as well as after sporting events or concerts. Young men and women make up the majority of the crowds who stop in between classes or after work.Sunset Heights is one of the most historic areas in town, which has existed since the latter part of the 1890s. Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory, but many have been neglected and have deteriorated. During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, Doroteo Arango (also known as Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s. During the 1910 Mexican Revolution many Mexicans fled Mexico and settled in Sunset Heights.\n\n\n=== Northeast El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town is located north of central El Paso and east of the Franklin Mountains. Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like east El Paso and northwest El Paso, but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at Ft. Bliss in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at Andress High School, Parkland High School, Irvin High School, and Chapin High School.\n\n\n=== East El Paso ===\n\nThe area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population of over 200,000. It includes the 79936 ZIP Code, which was considered in 2013 as the most populous in the nation with over 114,000 people.\n\n\n=== Mission Valley ===\n\nFormerly known as the lower valley, it includes part of Eastside and all lower valley districts. It is the third largest area of the city, behind east El Paso and central El Paso. Hawkins Road and Interstate 10 border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain).\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: Ysleta Mission-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), Socorro Mission-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and San Elizario Chapel (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King Philip II of Spain.\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n\n=== Texas and New Mexico suburbs ===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico. The most populated suburbs in Texas are Socorro, Horizon City, Fort Bliss and San Elizario. Other Texas suburbs are Anthony, Canutillo, Sparks, Fabens, and Vinton.\nAlthough Anthony, Santa Teresa, Sunland Park, and Chaparral lie adjacent to El Paso County, they are considered to be part of the Las Cruces, New Mexico metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings ===\n\nEl Paso's tallest building, the Wells Fargo Plaza, was built in the early 1970s as State National Plaza. The black-windowed, 302-foot (92 m) building is famous for its 13 white horizontal lights (18 lights per row on the east and west sides of the building, and seven bulbs per row on the north and south sides) that were lit at night. The tower did use a design of the United States flag during the July 4 holidays, as well as the American hostage crisis of 1980, and was lit continuously following the September 11 attacks in 2001 until around 2006. During the Christmas holidays, a design of a Christmas tree was used, and at times, the letters \"UTEP\" were used to support University of Texas at El Paso athletics. The tower is now only lit during the holiday months, or when special events take place in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2010 U.S. census, 649,121 people, 216,694 households, and 131,104 families resided in the city.

The first electrified line across the Rio Grande, which opened on January 11, 1902, was preceded by a network that relied on animal labor. The system quickly spread into residential and industrial areas of El Paso. In 1913, a 12-mile (19 km) interurban line was built to Ysleta. At the close of 1943, the holding company El Paso Electric sold its subsidiary, the El Paso Electric Railway Company and its Mexican counterpart, to one of National City Lines' subsidiaries. This resulted in the formation of El Paso City Lines, whose domestic streetcar lines were replaced by buses in 1947. The international streetcar line which crossed the border via the Stanton Street Bridge continued to operate until 1973. In 1977, El Paso City Lines and two other bus companies were bought by the municipality and merged to form Sun City Area Transit (SCAT). In 1987, SCAT restyled itself Sun Metro.\n\n\n==== El Paso Streetcar ====\nThe El Paso Streetcar is a streetcar system that opened for service on November 9, 2018, and uses a fleet of restored PCC streetcars that had served the city's previous system until its closure in 1974. The system covers 4.8 miles (7.7 km) (round trip) in two loops from Downtown El Paso to University of Texas at El Paso. The system was constructed under the authority of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, but when the major construction was completed, around spring 2018, it was transferred to Sun Metro, for operation and maintenance. As of 2016, construction of the system was projected to cost $97 million.\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\n\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of Nueva Espa\u00f1a, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe. Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area:\n\nBridge of the Americas, also known as the Cordova Bridge.\nGood Neighbor International Bridge, also known as the Stanton Street Bridge\nPaso del Norte International Bridge, also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge.\nYsleta\u2013Zaragoza International Bridge, also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.The city collects tolls at its international bridges.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of museums in West Texas\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Source notes ===\n\n\n== References ==\nHammond, John Hays (1935).

          "The El Paso Museum of Archaeology is a bit off the beaten track, but well worth the effort to find it. It is perfectly sized for families with children or those with just a casual interest, but informative enough for most history buffs (myself included). The displays are well",

          "You wouldn't know it from the unprepossessing exterior, but this little museum tells the area's anthropological story in a clear and interesting way, through large dioramas, and carefully-selected examples of pottery, stone tools, weapons, and jewelry. The scale is off somehow",
          "the museum is small but filled to the rafters with information. half of the building is diarama that is very well done. The other half are display cases and much information. The museum is free which is even better! Donations are of course accepted and there is a small gift",
          "If you have 30 minutes to spare, this is an excellent rest stop. The museum is rather small but the exhibit explains the history of the region. The highlight is the monthly talk organized by the staff. Go if you are a local. I particularly like the spring poppy blooms outside",

          "You'd be surprised at the museum: it is smallish but has some really artistic exhibits. Be sure you try one of the nature trails if the weather is good. If you are there in early spring there is wildflowers in the hills. The border patrol museum is a short walk down the hill",
          "Worth seeing but even if you stop and read everything wont take more than an hour. The place is very nice, and well maintained for mostly volunteer work. Just outside is the wilderness park, and it neighbors the El Paso Border Patrol Museum."

It is a very prominent part of the El Paso skyline and is most visible heading eastbound on I-10. It is the second tallest skyscraper in El Paso, behind Wells Fargo Plaza. Currently, among its tenants are restaurants, healthcare groups, law offices, accounting firms, family offices, insurance companies, and financial institutions. It was built in the international style of architecture, which was very popular during the time period in which the building was constructed.\nThe building was originally named the El Paso National Bank Tower when it opened in 1962, it was also known as the Texas Commerce Bank Tower in the 1980s and early 1990s. By the mid-1990s, Chase Bank had acquired all Texas Commerce Bank locations and the tower's name was changed to Chase Tower.\nIn 2017, Chase Bank announced that it would be moving out and losing the naming rights to the tower. Jamie Gallagher, senior vice president of the Borderplex Realty Trust, which owns the building, said the El Paso real estate investment trust was working with a new tenant to possibly replace Chase, and she said, put its brand on the building.In September 2018, Borderplex Realty announced that the tower's name would be changed to One San Jacinto Plaza. A new LED lighting system was added in late 2018 to bathe the building's exterior in light, which can be done in various colors at night.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.emporis.com/buildings/119147/one-san-jacinto-plaza-el-paso-tx-usa\nhttps://onesanjacintoplaza.com/",

The State of Texas issued its incorporation certificate in 1980 as a 501(c) 3 tax-exempt organization.  Its first location from 1985\u20131992 was the Cortez Building in El Paso. From 1992\u20131994, museum artifacts were in storage awaiting construction of a new building.  The current 10,000 square feet (930 m2) space opened its doors in 1994, and  is located on 2 acres (0.81 ha; 0.0031 sq mi) of land northeast of El Paso.This is the only museum solely honoring the Border Patrol, and artifacts cover the agency's entire history. Among the exhibits are weapons and vehicles used, including helicopters. There is a border patrol dog exhibit, an art exhibit and an exhibit of officer badges. Depicted are various methods used by individuals to cross the border between Mexico and the United States.Membership fees, private and corporation donations, and the purchase of memorial bricks help fund the museum.\n\n\n== Hours, admission ==\nNo admission fee.

          "I had heard about this museum and it sounded interesting so I decided to visit as I was nearby in Mesilla. It was worth the detour, it gives you an insight into the work the do and dangers they face preforming their duty. Later on the way to Socorro I got stopped at a border",

        "wiki": "Paso Robles ( PASS-oh ROH-buulz; full name: El Paso de Robles \"The Pass of the Oaks\") is a city in San Luis Obispo County, California, United States. Located on the Salinas River north of San Luis Obispo, California, the city is known for its hot springs, its abundance of wineries, its production of olive oil, almond orchards, and for playing host to the California Mid-State Fair.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area of the Central Coast, known as the City of El Paso De Robles, Paso Robles, or simply \"Paso\", is known for its thermal springs. Native Americans known as the Chumash lived in the area thousands of years even before the mission era. They knew this area as the \u201cSprings\u201d or the \u201cHot Springs.\u201d A tribal site on present-day Paso Robles was named elewexe, Obispe\u00f1o for \"Swordfish\".Paso Robles is located on the Rancho Paso de Robles Mexican land grant that was purchased by James and Daniel Blackburn in 1857. Their partner was Drury James of Kentucky, a veteran of the Mexican War and uncle of the outlaw Jesse James. The land was a rest-stop for travelers of the Camino Real trail, and was known for its mineral hot springs. In fact, Franciscan priests from neighboring Mission San Miguel constructed the first mineral baths in the area. During this period, Paso Robles began to attract the pioneer settlers who would become the founding members of the community. They would later establish cattle ranches, apple and almond orchards, dairy farms, and vineyards.\nIn 1864, the first El Paso de Robles Hotel was constructed and featured a hot mineral springs bath house. Today, only three locations (Paso Robles Inn, River Oaks Hot Springs, and Franklin Hot Springs) are left that offer the healing mineral bath hot spring experience which brought people like Ignacy Jan Paderewski to Paso Robles.\nJames and Daniel Blackburn donated two blocks to the city for a public park to be used for the pleasure of its citizens and visitors. By original deed, the land was to revert to the donors if used for any other purpose than a public park. Two exceptions were made: allowing the building of the Carnegie Library, and the conversion of the library to a museum.  The grounds were laid out by a Mr. Redington and a planting day was held when each citizen set out his own donation. Originally, the whole park was hedged in by a fence of cactus, and in 1890 a bandstand was built with money raised by private theatricals.\nIn 1886, after the coming of the Southern Pacific Railroad, work began on laying out a town site, with the resort as the nucleus. Two weeks after the first train arrived on October 31, 1886, a three-day celebration was held including a special train from San Francisco bringing prospective buyers, who toured the area and enjoyed the daily barbecues. On November 17, the \u201cGrand Auction\u201d was held, resulting in the sale of 228 lots.\nThe local agent for the SPR when it arrived in Paso Robles was R. M. \"Dick\" Shackelford, a Kentucky native who had come to California in 1853 to dig for gold. Shackelford had a varied career, going from gold mining to hauling freight by ox team, to lumbering, which took him to Nevada, where he served one term as a delegate in the state's first legislature for Washoe County. By 1886 Shackelford had returned to California and was living in Paso Robles, where he began buying up extensive property, building warehouses and starting lumber yards along the railroad's route. Shackelford also established the Southern Pacific Milling Company, which had a virtual monopoly on local milling until local farmers, in an effort to break Shackelford's stranglehold, themselves organized their own milling cooperative, the Farmers' Alliance Flour Mill.In 1889, the same year that Paso Robles incorporated as a city, construction began on a magnificent new hotel. The hotel required over one-million bricks and cost a princely $160,000. The new El Paso de Robles Hotel opened for business in 1891. The new hotel was three stories tall and built of solid masonry, set off by sandstone arches. This ensured the hotel was completely fireproof. The hotel also featured a seven-acre (28,000 m\u00b2) garden and nine-hole golf course. Inside there was a library, a beauty salon, a barber shop, and various billiard and lounging rooms. The new hotel also offered an improved hot springs plunge bath as well as 32 individual bath rooms. The 20 by 40-foot (12 m) plunge bath was considered one of the finest and most complete of its time in the United States.\nOn January 17, 1914, one of the world's most well-known concert pianists and composers came to the hotel: Ignace Paderewski. After three weeks of treatments at the hotel's mineral hot springs for his arthritis, he resumed his concert tour. He later returned to live at the hotel and bought two ranches west of Paso Robles.During the next 30 years, the hotel was visited by other notables: Boxing champion Jack Dempsey, President Theodore Roosevelt, Adela Rogers St. Johns, Phoebe Apperson Hearst (the mother of William Randolph Hearst), actors Douglas Fairbanks, Boris Karloff, Bob Hope, and Clark Gable all stayed at the El Paso de Robles Hotel. And when Major League baseball teams used Paso Robles as a spring training home, the Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago White Sox stayed at the hotel and soaked in the mineral hot springs to soothe tired muscles.\nFor a time, Paso Robles was known as the \u201cAlmond City\u201d because the local almond growers created the largest concentration of almond orchards in the world. The ranchers in the outlying areas were very important to the Paso Robles area. On these ranches were cattle and horses, grain crops (primarily wheat and barley), garden produce and fruit and nut orchards. Many of these ranch lands and orchards have become vineyards for the many wineries which currently draw tourists to the area.\nTo show their appreciation to the ranchers, in October 1931 the business people established Pioneer Day, which is still an annual celebration.\nPioneer Day is celebrated most years on the Saturday prior to October 12 (however, in 2017, it was moved to October 14). It was originally organized by community volunteers working with donations of time, materials and money from individuals, businesses, churches and service organizations. Their goal was to provide a day of community friendship and a commemoration of the heritage of the Paso Robles area. It would also become a day set aside to say \u201cThank you\u201d to all of the people who support the business and professional community of the area throughout the year. Most businesses would close so that their employees could enjoy and participate in the activities and family reunions. There were to be no charges for any of the events and no commercial concessions, and lunch would be provided at no cost. The business closure still holds true for most of the downtown core businesses, but some do open in the mid-afternoon. Most businesses outside of the downtown area keep their normal hours and do not close.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nIn December 1940, a fire completely destroyed the \"fire-proof\" El Paso de Robles Hotel. Guests staying the night escaped unharmed. However, the night clerk who discovered the fire suffered a fatal heart attack immediately after sounding the alarm. Within months after the blaze, plans for a new hotel to be built on the site were drawn up. The design was an entirely new concept: A garden inn-hotel, designed to accommodate motor vehicle travelers. By February 1942 construction was complete and the new Paso Robles Inn opened for business.Through the 1960s and 1970s, the City of Paso Robles experienced significant growth. The area's wine industry flourished, the California Mid-State Fair expanded into a regional attraction, and local lakes, such as Lake Nacimiento, became family vacation destinations. \n\n\n=== The waters ===\n\nAs far back as 1795, Paso Robles has been spoken of and written about as \u201cCalifornia\u2019s oldest watering place\u201d\u2014the place to go for springs and mud baths. In 1864, a correspondent to the San Francisco Bulletin wrote that there was every prospect of the Paso Robles hot springs becoming the watering place of the state. By 1868 people were coming from as far away as Oregon, Nevada, Idaho, and even Alabama. Besides the well-known mud baths, there were the Iron Spring and the Sand Spring, which bubbles through the sand and was said to produce delightful sensations.In 1882, Drury James and the Blackburn brothers issued a pamphlet advertising \u201cEl Paso de Robles Hot and Cold Sulphur Springs and the Only Natural Mud Baths in the World\u201d. By then there were first-class accommodations: a reading room, barber shop, and telegraph office; a general store, a top-of-the-line livery stable, and comfortably furnished cottages for families that preferred privacy to quarters in the hotel. Visitors could stay in touch with the rest of the world, as there were two daily mails, a Western Union telegraph office, and a Wells Fargo agency with special rates for guests. As the springs became more and more a destination of the well-to-do as a place to go to socialize, the original purpose of the springs\u2014to heal\u2014became peripheral.\nThe bathhouse was erected over the sulphur spring in 1888, with a plunge and thirty-seven bath rooms. In the following year, work began on the large Hot Springs Hotel, (today the Paso Robles Inn), which was completed in 1900 and burned down 40 years later. Since the privileges of using the baths were restricted to guests of the hotel and many sufferers of the ailments the baths cured could not pay the rates of the fashionable hotel, a few businessmen in Paso Robles made arrangements with Felix Liss for the right to bore for sulphur water on a lot which Liss owned. A sulphur well was reached, a bath house built and baths offered at an affordable rate of twenty-five cents. The establishment was later offered to the city and is currently the site of the Municipal Pool.\n\n\n=== Wine ===\nPaso Robles\u2019 growth industry\u2014wine\u2014has a long history with the area. Wine grapes were introduced to the Paso Robles soil in 1797 by the Spanish conquistadors and Franciscan missionaries. Spanish explorer Francisco Cortez envisioned an abundant wine-producing operation and encouraged settlers from Mexico and other parts of California to cultivate the land. The first vineyardists in the area were the Padres of the Mission San Miguel, and their old fermentation vats and grapevine artwork can still be seen at the Mission, north of the city of Paso Robles.\nCommercial winemaking was introduced to the Paso Robles region in 1882 when Andrew York, a settler from Indiana, began planting vineyards and established the Ascension Winery at what became York Mountain Winery and is now Epoch Winery. When York purchased the land, it was primarily apple orchards, with a small plot of wine grape vines. York found that the climate and soil were more suitable for vineyards and he expanded the vineyards. Within a few years, he found that the vines were yielding more than he could market, prompting him to build a small, stone winery.\nFollowing Andrew York's early success in the wine business, Gerd and Ilsabe Klintworth planted a vineyard in the Geneseo/Linne area in approximately 1886. They were licensed to sell jugs of Zinfandel, Port, and Muscatel, as well as some of the area's first white wine made from Burger grapes. The Casteel Vineyards in the Willow Creek area were planted just prior to 1908. Casteel wines were stored and aged in a cave cellar. Cuttings from the old vines provided the start for other vineyards, still producing in the area today.\nAs the popularity of wines began to grow, so did the Paso Robles wine region. Lorenzo and Rena Nerelli purchased their vineyard at the foot of York Mountain in 1917. Their Templeton Winery was the area's first to be bonded following the repeal of Prohibition.\nThe early 1920s saw a flurry of winemaking activity when several families immigrated to the area to establish family vineyards and wineries. Sylvester and Caterina Dusi purchased a vineyard in 1924. The old head-pruned Zinfandel vines are now owned and cultivated by their son, Benito. The Martinelli, Busi, Vosti, Steinbeck and Bianchi Winery vineyards were also established around this time.\nThe Paso Robles wine region gained more notoriety when Ignace Paderewski, the famous Polish statesman and concert pianist, visited Paso Robles, became enchanted with the area, and purchased 2,000 acres (8.1 km2). In the early 1920s, he planted Petite Sirah and Zinfandel on his Rancho San Ignacio vineyard in the Adelaide area. Following Prohibition, Paderewski's wine was made at York Mountain Winery. The wines produced from grapes grown on Rancho San Ignacio went on to become award-winners. Paso Robles\u2019 reputation as a premier wine region became firmly established as a result of this and later successes, and through to the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new generation of vineyard pioneers came forth and flourished in the Paso Robles area.\n\n\n=== San Simeon earthquake ===\n\nAt 11:15 am PST on December 22, 2003, the San Simeon earthquake struck about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Paso Robles. The earthquake registered 6.6 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). Two deaths occurred when the roof slid off the clock tower building, a popular landmark in downtown Paso Robles. The dormant underground springs that had once been used for the spa were brought back to life, causing flooding and a large sinkhole in the parking lot of the city hall and library. Due to lengthy environmental and engineering considerations, it took until December 2010 for the sinkhole to be filled and the parking lot resurfaced. Paso Robles has dedicated a new clock tower in memory of the two women who died.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPaso Robles is approximately halfway between the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco.\nThe topography of the area consists of gentle rolling hills on the eastern half of the city, and foothill peaks which rise in elevation to the Santa Lucia Coastal Range on the west, which are all blanketed in the Californian chaparral environment, which is mainly dry grassland and oak woodland.  Paso Robles sits on the eastern foothills of the Santa Lucia Coastal Mountain Range, which lies directly to the West of the city, and runs in a North-South direction, starting at Monterey, then runs down South to its terminus, in the San Luis Obispo area. The city is located at the southern end of the fertile Salinas River Valley, which is centered in between the Temblor Range (including the San Andreas Fault), which lie about 28 miles (45 km) to the East, and the Santa Lucia Coastal Range, which lie directly west, rising up from the city's western border. Paso Robles sits at the border where northern San Luis Obispo County and southern Monterey County meet, and is situated roughly 24 miles (39 km), or 20 minutes, inland from the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe Paso Robles area has two different climate types and classifications, as based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification (KCC) system, which are KCC type BSk, a semi-arid, dry, steppe-type climate, and KCC type Csb, which is the typical, coastal Californian & \"Mediterranean\" type.  The area receives a mixture of these two types of climates, but the primary climate is defined by long, hot, dry summers and brief, cool, rainy winters. Paso Robles enjoys long-lasting, mild autumns and occasional early springs, giving the region a unique climate suitable for growing a variety of crops (ranging from primarily grapes, to olives, to almonds and other tree nuts). The city receives an average annual rainfall of about 14.71 inches (374 mm) per year, and most of this precipitation falls during winter and early spring. Paso Robles often receives less than 10 inches (250 mm) of rain per year and typically, no rain falls from May through September. Summers in Paso Robles tend to be very hot, with daily temperatures frequently exceeding 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) from late June to as late as mid September, and occasionally exceeding 110 \u00b0F (43 \u00b0C). Paso Robles' summers feature an unusually large daytime-nighttime temperature swing, where there may be a profound temperature difference, as much as 50 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C), between the daytime highs and the overnight lows. Winters are often very cool and moist, with daytime temperatures reaching into the low 50s\u00b0F (10 \u00b0C). Mornings and nights differ from the daytime average, as they tend to very frigid (especially in December and January), where lows reach as low as 22 \u00b0F (\u22126 \u00b0C). Due to the somewhat close proximity to the Pacific Ocean, the marine layer occasionally makes it over the coast range and into Paso Robles, creating occasional fog. Unlike typical California coastal marine fog in areas such as San Francisco, this fog is never long lasting, and typically burns off before 10am.\nThe all-time record high temperature at the National Weather Service cooperative city office was 117 \u00b0F (47 \u00b0C) on August 13, 1933.  The record low temperature was 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) on January 6, 1913, making Paso Robles the lowest elevation in California to reach that low temperature.  There are an average of 81.0 days with high temperatures of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) or higher and an average of 64.0 days with low temperatures of 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C) or lower.  The 30-year average (1971\u20132000) annual precipitation is 15.17 inches (385 mm), falling on an average of 47 days.  The wettest year was 1941 with 29.19 inches (741 mm) of precipitation and the dryest year was 1947 with 4.24 inches (108 mm).  The most precipitation in one month was 14.76 inches (375 mm) in January 1916.  The most precipitation in 24 hours was 5.25 inches (133 mm) on December 6, 1966.  Although snow is rare in Paso Robles, 4.0 inches fell on April 5, 1929, and on December 15, 1988.At the Paso Robles FAA Airport, the record high temperature was 115 \u00b0F on June 15, 1961, and July 20, 1960.  The record low temperature was 8 \u00b0F (\u221213 \u00b0C) on December 22, 1990.  There are an average of 86.7 days with highs of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) or higher and an average of 53.6 days with lows of 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C) or lower. The 30-year average (1971\u20132000) annual precipitation was 12.57 inches (319 mm), falling on an average of 42 days. The wettest year was 1995 with 25.56 inches (649 mm) and the driest year was 2007 with 4.20 inches (107 mm). The most precipitation in one month was 12.19 inches (310 mm) in January 1969.  The most precipitation in 24 hours was 5.47 inches (139 mm) on March 10, 1995.  The record snowfall was 4.0 inches (100 mm) on December 15, 1988.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 Census ===\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Paso Robles had a population of 29,793.

More than 25 different varieties of grapes are grown in the Paso Robles Wine Country and there are over 250 bonded wineries.\nIn 1993, Paso Robles grape growers, wineries and wine tasting rooms united to form the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance.

This event is held by the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance, a non-profit cooperative marketing alliance looking to not only educate the community and surrounding communities about Paso Robles wine, but to also give back to the community.The Paso Robles Wine Festival takes place in May and an olive festival takes place yearly also.

It uses a council-manager form of government, directed by a five-member city council. The council consists of a mayor (elected at-large for a four-year term during non-presidential even-numbered years) and four council members (elected at-large for staggered four-year terms on even-numbered years (2+2)). The mayor has no veto power, but has a vote on the council. Prior to the mid-1990s, the mayor was rotated through the city council members on a yearly basis. Then it became a two-year general election post. In 2012, the voters voted to make the mayor a four-year post. The council appoints the city manager and city attorney, but the city clerk and city treasurer are elected officials.\n\n\n=== State and federal representation ===\nIn the California State Legislature, Paso Robles is in the  17th Senate District, represented by Democrat Bill Monning, and the  35th Assembly District, represented by Republican Jordan Cunningham.In the United States House of Representatives, Paso Robles is in California's  24th congressional district, represented by Democrat Salud Carbajal.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nPaso Robles is at the major crossroads of U.S. Highway 101 and State Highway 46, about halfway between Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area with direct access to the San Joaquin Valley and Interstate 5. Paso Robles is currently served by one freeway and two highways:\n\n U.S. Route 101 (US 101) is the most frequented and largest road-transportation arterial for the city of Paso Robles which serves as its north-south gateway. US 101 runs in a north-south direction and bisects the city (along with the Salinas River), into its western and eastern portions. Traveling northward from the city, US 101 heads to San Jose and San Francisco, and continues on along the coast up through Northern California and Oregon, and ends near Olympia in Washington state. Traveling southward from the city, US 101 heads to San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and on to its southern terminus in Los Angeles.\n State Route 46 (SR 46) is the main east-west arterial for the city of Paso Robles and serves as its eastern gateway from the San Joaquin Valley. SR 46 runs in an east-west direction except for a short portion in Paso Robles where it overlaps with US 101 for 3 miles (4.8 km). Traveling westward, SR 46 leaves the city and gradually climbs up and over the Santa Lucia Coastal Range, where it then quickly descends and meets the Pacific Ocean, just south of the coastal village of Cambria at its westernmost terminus at Highway 1, better known as the Pacific Coast Highway. Traveling eastward, SR 46 leaves the city and after traveling through rolling countryside for about 25 miles (40 km), it climbs up the Temblor Range and San Andreas Fault, then 25 miles (40 km) later, crosses Interstate 5 and continues on, later terminating at State Route 99, about 20 miles (32 km) north of Bakersfield and 90 miles (140 km) south of Fresno. In the future, SR 46 may be considered for a possible westward expansion of Interstate 40, via SR 58 from Barstow to Bakersfield, from Bakersfield to I-5 via Westside Parkway, along I-5 to SR 46, then following SR 46 to Paso Robles.\n State Route 229 is mainly an intra-county route that is used for traveling between the small rural towns in the eastern part of the county. SR 229 begins in Paso Robles as Creston Road, then 3 miles (4.8 km) east, as it leaves the city heading south-eastward, becomes simply SR 229 as it heads to the small rural town of Creston about 15 miles (24 km) southeast of Paso Robles. It then continues southward for 8 miles (13 km), where it ends at State Route 58, about 5 miles (8.0 km) east of the small town of Santa Margarita.\n\n\n=== Rail transportation ===\n\nAmtrak, the national passenger rail system, serves Paso Robles, operating its Coast Starlight daily in each direction between Seattle, Washington, and Los Angeles. Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner, which operates between San Diego and Paso Robles, connects by bus transfer from San Luis Obispo Railroad Station.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nPaso Robles Municipal Airport, a regional general aviation airport, is about 5 miles (8.0 km) northeast of downtown Paso Robles. Paso Robles Municipal does not offer scheduled passenger service. Scheduled passenger market is available at thebnearby San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport, 25 miles (40 km) to the south in San Luis Obispo. The Paso Robles airport has daily business aviation operations, in addition to serving as a large general aviation base. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) has an air attack base at the airport. There, aircraft are reloaded with fire fighting chemicals, which are dropped on brush and forest fires. The local Civil Air Patrol squadron also operates and trains on the airbase as part of the localized squadron 103, performing training craft operations known as O-Flights in a trainer craft that is brought to a desired altitude then dropped, essentially being towed by the aircraft, cadets of the Civil Air Patrol are the most of this demographic, but the cadets also help out congestion in the airport when it is busy during the operations. Also, the California Highway Patrol (CHP) houses a fixed-wing aircraft, used for speed enforcement, and a helicopter, used for search and rescue. The area immediately surrounding the Paso Robles Airport, known as Airport Road Industrial Park, is also home to many aviation maintenance providers and facilities, as well as home to many aviation parts manufacturers and other related businesses. LaGuardia's Italian Deli is the only restaurant on the field, and is located in the terminal building.  The deli opened in November 2012.\nThe Paso Robles Airport hosts the Northern California Regional Aerobatic Contest which is held annually in mid-June.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe Paso Robles Public Schools District contains six elementary schools, two middle schools, three high schools, and four other miscellaneous school sites and programs.\n\n\n=== Elementary and middle schools ===\n\nBauer\u2013Speck Elementary (K\u20135)\nGeorgia Brown Elementary (Dual language immersion campus) (K\u20135)\nKermit King Elementary (K\u20135)\nPat Butler Elementary (K\u20135)\nVirginia Peterson Elementary (K\u20135)\nWinifred Pifer Elementary (K\u20135)\nGeorge Flamson Middle School (6\u20138)\nDaniel Lewis Middle School (6\u20138)\nSaint Rose of Lima School (Pres.\u20138)\nTrinity Lutheran School (Pres.\u20138)\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nPaso Robles High School\nLiberty High School\nIndependence High School\n\n\n=== Colleges and adult education ===\nCuesta College\nPaso Robles Adult School\nPR Culinary Arts Academy\nUniversity of Phoenix Satellite Office\n\n\n== Media ==\nLocal newspapers include Paso Robles Daily News and Paso Robles Press.Radio stations serving the area include KPRL-AM/1230.\n\n\n== Sports and recreation ==\nPaso Robles offers its residents and visitors cycling, golfing, tennis and swimming.

Although Lake Nacimiento is not actually located within the city of Paso Robles itself, it is however in what is considered the Greater Paso Robles Area. \"The Lake\", as it is known to locals, shares the 93446 zip code with Paso Robles, due to its proximity to the city. The lake provides ample room for waterskiing, wakeboarding, jetskiing, and other water-related activities, in addition to fishing and swimming.\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\nLocated just off of Highway 46 East at Union Road is the 42-acre (170,000 m2) Barney Schwartz Park. The park has baseball, softball and soccer facilities, as well as lake access, picnicking, event pavilions, picnicking and playgrounds. Centennial Park is located in the eastern section of Paso Robles. Besides being the home of all indoor community sports (basketball, volleyball and gymnastics) and many different classes and activities, the 17-acre (69,000 m2) Centennial Park contains a 200,000-gallon swimming pool and wading pool with waterslides, group barbecue areas, grassy picnic and pavilion areas, an amphitheater, walking paths, two outdoor half-court basketball courts, five pickleball courts, four tennis courts, a 1.2-mile-long (1.9 km) paved trail, four lighted tennis courts and two playgrounds.\nThe land upon which City Park sits was donated by the town's founders, James and Blackburn, for the specific use of a public park. Located in the heart of downtown, the 5-acre (20,000 m2) park provides easy access to the downtown area's amenities. Holiday and festival events are often held at this park, including holidays such as the 4th of July.

Las Cruces, in the neighboring U.S. state of New Mexico, has a population of 215,579. On the U.S. side, the El Paso metropolitan area forms part of the larger El Paso\u2013Las Cruces CSA, with a population of 1,060,397.Bi-nationally, these three cities form a combined international metropolitan area sometimes referred to as the Paso del Norte or the Borderplex. The region of 2.5 million people constitutes the largest bilingual and binational work force in the Western Hemisphere.The city is home to three publicly traded companies, and former Western Refining, now Andeavor. as well as home to the Medical Center of the Americas, the only medical research and care provider complex in West Texas and Southern New Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso, the city's primary university. The city hosts the annual Sun Bowl college football post-season game, the second oldest bowl game in the country.El Paso has a strong federal and military presence. William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Biggs Army Airfield, and Fort Bliss are located in the area. Fort Bliss is one of the largest military complexes of the United States Army and the largest training area in the United States. Also headquartered in El Paso are the DEA domestic field division 7, El Paso Intelligence Center, Joint Task Force North, United States Border Patrol El Paso Sector, and the U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group (SOG).\nIn 2010 and 2018, El Paso received an All-America City Award. El Paso ranked in the top three safest large cities in the United States between 1997 and 2014, including holding the title of safest city between 2011 and 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks. The evidence suggests 10,000 to 12,000 years of human habitation. The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. When the Spanish arrived, the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area. These were subsequently incorporated into the Mestizo culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from Comancher\u00eda, and gen\u00edzaros of various ethnic groups. The Mescalero Apache were also present.\nSpanish explorer Don Juan de O\u00f1ate was born in 1550 in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and was the first New Spain (Mexico) explorer known to have observed the Rio Grande near El Paso, in 1598, celebrating a Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (decades before the English Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). However, the four survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza, and his enslaved Moor Estevanico, are thought to have passed through the area in the mid-1530s. El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) was founded on the south bank of the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande), in 1659 by Fray Garcia de San Francisco. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the Pueblo Revolt, until 1692 when Santa Fe was reconquered and once again became the capital.\nThe Texas Revolution (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of Cross-border town naming until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring Anson Mills to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.During the Civil War, a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union California Column in 1862. It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.\nAfter the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow as Texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority. El Paso itself, incorporated in 1873, encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river. In the 1870s, a population of 23 non-Hispanic whites and 150 Hispanics was reported. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, the population boomed to 10,000 by the 1890 census, with many Anglo-Americans, recent immigrants, old Hispanic settlers, and recent arrivals from Mexico. The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild boomtown known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness. Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). With the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city's geographic position, the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the U.S. Southwest.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio D\u00edaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D\u00edaz.By 1910, the overwhelming number of people in the city were Americans creating a settled environment. However, this period was short-lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees \u2013 and capital \u2013 to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast Plan de San Diego which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens. The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives. These actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the end result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.Simultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000 and Non-Hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites. In reply, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund. In 1916, the Census Bureau reported El Paso's population as 53% Mexican and 44% Non-Hispanic whites. Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.During and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.The Farah Strike, 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas. This strike was originated and led by Chicanas, or Mexican American women, due to Farah Manufacturing Company, one of the largest factories in the city, being unorganized, low wages, discrimination, no benefits, lack of gender-neutrality, health and safety hazards, and unattainable quotas. Texas Monthly described the Farah Strike as the \"strike of the century.\"On August 3, 2019, a mass shooting/domestic terrorist attack committed by a white supremacist occurred at a Walmart in El Paso, which left 23 people dead and 23 others injured.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEl Paso is located at the intersection of three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua) and two countries (the U.S. and Mexico). It is the only major Texas city on Mountain Time. Ciudad Juarez was once in Central Time, but both cities are now on Mountain Time.\nEl Paso is closer to the capital cities of four other states \u2013 Phoenix, Arizona (345 miles (555 km) away); Santa Fe, New Mexico, (273 miles (439 km) away); Ciudad Chihuahua, Chihuahua, (218 miles (351 km) away), and Hermosillo, Sonora (325 miles (523 km) away) \u2013 than it is to the capital of its own state, Austin (528 miles (850 km) away). It is closer to Los Angeles, California (700 miles (1,100 km) away) than it is to Orange (858 miles (1,381 km) away), the easternmost town in the state.\nEl Paso is located within the Chihuahuan Desert, the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region. The Franklin Mountains extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the west side forms the beginnings of the Mesilla Valley, and the east side expands into the desert and lower valley. They connect in the central business district at the southern end of the mountain range.\nThe city's elevation is 3,800 ft (1,200 m) above sea level. North Franklin Mountain is the highest peak in the city at 7,192 ft (2,192 m) above sea level. The peak can be seen from 60 mi (100 km) in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local Coronado High School gets its mascot's name. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 256.3 square miles (663.7 km2).The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park, the largest urban park in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and El Paso International Airport.\nThe Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey, an example of a pluton, rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Nearby volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (50 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEl Paso has a transitional climate between cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk) and hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh) featuring hot summers, with little humidity, and cool to mild dry winters. Rainfall averages 9.7 in (250 mm) per year, much of which occurs during the summer from July through September, and is predominantly caused by the North American Monsoon. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes thunderstorms, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.\nThe sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the National Weather Service; from this, the city is nicknamed \"The Sun City\". Due to its arid, windy climate, El Paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season, particularly during the springtime between March and early May. With an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph (50 km/h) and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph (120 km/h), these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.\nEl Paso and the nearby mountains also receive snow. Weather systems have produced over one foot (30 cm) of snow on several occasions. In the 1982\u20131983 winter season, three major snowstorms produced record seasonal snowfall. On December 25\u201326, 1982, 6.0 inches (15 cm) of snow fell, producing a white Christmas for the city. This was followed by another 7.0 inches (18 cm) on December 30\u201331, 1982. On April 4\u20137, 1983, 16.5 inches (42 cm) of snow fell on El Paso, bringing the seasonal total to nearly 30 inches (76 cm). On December 13\u201314, 1987, a record storm dumped over 22 inches (56 cm) of snow on El Paso, and two weeks later (December 25\u201326), another three inches (7.6 cm) fell, bringing the monthly total for December 1987 to an all-time record high of 25.9 inches (66 cm) of snow.\nThe average annual snowfall for the city varies widely between different neighborhoods at different elevations, but is 6.1 inches (15 cm) at the airport (but with a median of 0, meaning most years see no snow at all). Snow is most rare around Ysleta and the eastern valley area, which usually include large numbers of palm trees; in the higher neighborhoods, palm trees are more vulnerable to snow and cold snaps and are often seen with brown, frost-damaged fronds.\nOne example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C), the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was 1 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C), breaking the 5 \u00b0F (\u221215 \u00b0C) monthly record low set during the cold wave of 1899. Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results. Two local power plants failed, forcing El Paso Electric to institute rolling blackouts over several days, and electric wires were broken, causing localised blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days.\nMonthly means range from 45.5 \u00b0F (7.5 \u00b0C) in December to 83.5 \u00b0F (28.6 \u00b0C) in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon arrives, while daily low temperatures typically peak in July or early August with the higher humidity the monsoon brings (translating to warmer nights). On average, there are 52 nights of at- or below-freezing lows, 109 days of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C)+ highs and 20 days of 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ highs annually; it is extremely rare for temperatures to stay below the freezing mark all day. The city's record high is 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on June 30, 1994, and its record low is \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) on January 11, 1962; the highest daily minimum was 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the National Weather Service since 1879.\n\n\n==== Flooding ====\nAlthough the average annual rainfall is only about 9.7 in (250 mm), many parts of El Paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms. In late July and early August 2006, up to 10 in (250 mm) of rain fell in a week, the flood-control reservoirs overflowed and caused major flooding citywide. The city staff estimated damage to public infrastructure at $21 million, and to private property (residential and commercial) at $77 million. Much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood-control dams and reservoirs, and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water.\n\n\n=== Time zone ===\nEl Paso is located in the far western corner of Texas, which is roughly the only part of the state that is located within the Mountain Time Zone, as opposed to the Central Time Zone.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Downtown and central El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town contains some of the city's oldest and most historic neighborhoods. Located in the heart of the city, it is home to approximately 44,993 people. Development of the area started in 1827 with the first resident, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a wealthy merchant from Paso del Norte (present day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), who built the region's first structure establishing Rancho Ponce within the vicinity of S. El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the Sunset Heights district. It is close to the El Paso International Airport, the international border, and Fort Bliss. It is part of the El Paso Independent School District.\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the white American residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. Hispanic-American residents lived in an area called Chihuahuita (\"little Chihuahua\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area. Another downtown neighborhood is El Segundo Barrio, which is near the United States/Mexico border.\n\n\n=== Northwest El Paso ===\n\nBetter known as West El Paso or the West Side, the area includes a portion of the Rio Grande floodplain upstream from downtown which is known locally as the Upper Valley and is located on the west side of the Franklin Mountains. The Upper Valley is the greenest part of the county due to the Rio Grande. The west side is home to some of the most affluent neighborhoods within the city, such as the Coronado Hills and Country Club neighborhoods. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of El Paso.\n\n\n=== West central El Paso ===\n\nWest central El Paso is located north of Interstate 10 and west of the Franklin Mountains. The University of Texas at El Paso and the Cincinnati Entertainment district are located in the heart of the area. Historic districts Kern Place and Sunset Heights are in this part of town.\nKern Place was founded in 1914 by Peter E. Kern, for whom the neighborhood was named.The homes of Kern Place are unique in architecture and some were built by residents themselves. One of the better known homes is the Paul Luckett Home located at 1201 Cincinnati Ave. above Madeline Park, and is made of local rock. It is known as \"The Castle\" due to its round walls and a crenelated rooftop.Kern Place is extremely popular with college and university students. The area is known for its glitzy entertainment district, restaurants and coffee shops who cater to both business patrons and university students. After UTEP's basketball and football games, UTEP fans pack the Kern Place area for food and entertainment at Cincinnati Street a small bar district. This bar scene has grown over the years and has attracted thousands to its annual Mardi Gras block party as well as after sporting events or concerts. Young men and women make up the majority of the crowds who stop in between classes or after work.Sunset Heights is one of the most historic areas in town, which has existed since the latter part of the 1890s. Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory, but many have been neglected and have deteriorated. During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, Doroteo Arango (also known as Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s. During the 1910 Mexican Revolution many Mexicans fled Mexico and settled in Sunset Heights.\n\n\n=== Northeast El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town is located north of central El Paso and east of the Franklin Mountains. Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like east El Paso and northwest El Paso, but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at Ft. Bliss in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at Andress High School, Parkland High School, Irvin High School, and Chapin High School.\n\n\n=== East El Paso ===\n\nThe area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population of over 200,000. It includes the 79936 ZIP Code, which was considered in 2013 as the most populous in the nation with over 114,000 people.\n\n\n=== Mission Valley ===\n\nFormerly known as the lower valley, it includes part of Eastside and all lower valley districts. It is the third largest area of the city, behind east El Paso and central El Paso. Hawkins Road and Interstate 10 border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain).\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: Ysleta Mission-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), Socorro Mission-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and San Elizario Chapel (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King Philip II of Spain.\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n\n=== Texas and New Mexico suburbs ===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico. The most populated suburbs in Texas are Socorro, Horizon City, Fort Bliss and San Elizario. Other Texas suburbs are Anthony, Canutillo, Sparks, Fabens, and Vinton.\nAlthough Anthony, Santa Teresa, Sunland Park, and Chaparral lie adjacent to El Paso County, they are considered to be part of the Las Cruces, New Mexico metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings ===\n\nEl Paso's tallest building, the Wells Fargo Plaza, was built in the early 1970s as State National Plaza. The black-windowed, 302-foot (92 m) building is famous for its 13 white horizontal lights (18 lights per row on the east and west sides of the building, and seven bulbs per row on the north and south sides) that were lit at night. The tower did use a design of the United States flag during the July 4 holidays, as well as the American hostage crisis of 1980, and was lit continuously following the September 11 attacks in 2001 until around 2006. During the Christmas holidays, a design of a Christmas tree was used, and at times, the letters \"UTEP\" were used to support University of Texas at El Paso athletics. The tower is now only lit during the holiday months, or when special events take place in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2010 U.S. census, 649,121 people, 216,694 households, and 131,104 families resided in the city. The population density was 2,263.0 people per square mile (873.7/km\u00b2). There were 227,605 housing units at an average density of 777.5 per square mile (300.2/km\u00b2). Recent census estimates say that the racial composition of El Paso is: White\u2013 92.0% (Non-Hispanic Whites: 11.8%), African American or Black \u2013 3.9%, Two or more races \u2013 1.5%, Asian \u2013 1.3%, Native American \u2013 1.0%, and Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander \u2013 0.2%.

The El Paso International Airport serves the El Paso-Las Cruces Combined Statistical area.\nBiggs Army Airfield\nHorizon Airport\nDona Ana Airport\nLas Cruces International Airport\n\n\n==== Passenger rail ====\nAmtrak, the national passenger rail system, serves El Paso at the Union Depot, operating its Sunset Limited/Texas Eagle three times weekly between Los Angeles and New Orleans via San Antonio and Houston and between Los Angeles and Chicago via San Antonio and Fort Worth.\n\n\n==== Major highways ====\n Interstate 10: The primary thoroughfare through the city, connecting the city with other major U.S. cities such as Los Angeles, Phoenix, Tucson, San Antonio, Houston, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Gulfport and Mobile, with the east end located in Jacksonville, Florida. I-10 is also a connector to Interstate 25, which connects with the cities of Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Colorado Springs, Denver, Fort Collins, Cheyenne, Casper, and north to the junction with I-90, located in Buffalo, Wyoming.\n US Highway 54: Officially called the Patriot Freeway, it is also known as the North-South Freeway. A business route runs along Dyer Street, the former US 54, from the freeway near Fort Bliss to the Texas\u2013New Mexico border, where it again rejoins the expressway. The original US 54 was a transcontinental route connecting El Paso with Chicago.\n US Highway 62: Santa Fe Street south of Paisano Drive concurrently runs with US 85, Paisano Drive east of Santa Fe Street to Montana Avenue, then Montana Avenue concurrently with US 180.\n US Highway 85: Santa Fe Street south of Paisano Drive concurrently runs with US 62 and Paisano Drive west of Santa Fe Street to I-10.\n US Highway 180: Montana Avenue is a bypass route to the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex to the east, and Flagstaff, Arizona to the west.\n SH 20: Alameda Avenue (formerly US 80), Texas Avenue, Mesa Street and Doniphan Drive\n SH 178: Artcraft Road in northwest El Paso extends from Interstate 10 west to the New Mexico state line, at which point it becomes New Mexico Highway 136, the Pete V. Domenici International Highway.\n Loop 375: Texas Highway Loop 375 encircles the city of El Paso. Between Interstate 10 and Fort Bliss, including the stretch that crosses the Franklin Mountains via Smuggler's Pass, it is TransMountain Road. In the Ft. Bliss Military Reservation between northeast and east El Paso, it is officially the Purple Heart Memorial Highway. In east El Paso, the north- and south-bound sections are known as Joe Battle Boulevard, or simply as \"the Loop\". South of I-10, in the east and westbound portion, it is known as the Cesar Chavez Border Highway, a four-lane expressway which is located along the Mexico\u2013U.S. border between downtown El Paso and the Ysleta area.\n Spur 601: Once known as the Inner Loop, it was officially named the Liberty Expressway by the El Paso City Council in April 2010 at the request of then Fort Bliss commander Maj. Gen. Howard Bromberg. It was fully completed on April 27, 2011; it connects the Patriot Freeway (US 54) and Biggs Army Airfield to the Purple Heart Memorial Highway (Loop 375).\n North Loop Road, as well as Delta Drive between North Loop Road and Alameda Avenue (Texas Highway 20)\n Zaragoza Road, running more or less north from the Ysleta International Bridge to US 62\u2013180 (Montana Avenue), it lies mostly in east El Paso.\n Texas Farm-to-Market Road 3255 runs north from US 54 to the New Mexico state line in northeast El Paso and bears the city street name Martin Luther King Boulevard.\nBorder West Expressway under construction (as of 2018), parallel to I-10 through downtown and the west side.\n\n\n==== Mass transit ====\nThe Sun Metro Mass Transit System operates a system of medium- to large-capacity natural gas-powered buses all around the city of El Paso.El Paso County Transit makes trips with small-capacity buses mainly in the eastern El Paso area.\nIn 2011, Sun Metro was named the most outstanding public transit system of the year in all of North America for a mid-size transit system by the American Public Transportation Association.\nOn September 1, 2009, NMDOT Park and Ride began operating commuter bus service to and from Las Cruces, New Mexico.Historically, El Paso and Ciudad Juarez had a shared streetcar system with a peak electrified route mileage of 64 miles (103 km) in 1920. The first electrified line across the Rio Grande, which opened on January 11, 1902, was preceded by a network that relied on animal labor. The system quickly spread into residential and industrial areas of El Paso. In 1913, a 12-mile (19 km) interurban line was built to Ysleta. At the close of 1943, the holding company El Paso Electric sold its subsidiary, the El Paso Electric Railway Company and its Mexican counterpart, to one of National City Lines' subsidiaries. This resulted in the formation of El Paso City Lines, whose domestic streetcar lines were replaced by buses in 1947. The international streetcar line which crossed the border via the Stanton Street Bridge continued to operate until 1973. In 1977, El Paso City Lines and two other bus companies were bought by the municipality and merged to form Sun City Area Transit (SCAT). In 1987, SCAT restyled itself Sun Metro.\n\n\n==== El Paso Streetcar ====\nThe El Paso Streetcar is a streetcar system that opened for service on November 9, 2018, and uses a fleet of restored PCC streetcars that had served the city's previous system until its closure in 1974. The system covers 4.8 miles (7.7 km) (round trip) in two loops from Downtown El Paso to University of Texas at El Paso. The system was constructed under the authority of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, but when the major construction was completed, around spring 2018, it was transferred to Sun Metro, for operation and maintenance. As of 2016, construction of the system was projected to cost $97 million.\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\n\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of Nueva Espa\u00f1a, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe. Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area:\n\nBridge of the Americas, also known as the Cordova Bridge.\nGood Neighbor International Bridge, also known as the Stanton Street Bridge\nPaso del Norte International Bridge, also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge.\nYsleta\u2013Zaragoza International Bridge, also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.The city collects tolls at its international bridges.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of museums in West Texas\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Source notes ===\n\n\n== References ==\nHammond, John Hays (1935).

        "wiki": "El Paso (; Spanish: [el \u02c8paso] \"the pass\") is a city and the county seat of El Paso County, Texas, United States, in the far western part of the state. The 2019 population estimate for the city from the U.S. Census was 681,728, making it the 22nd largest city in the United States. Its metropolitan statistical area (MSA) covers all of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in Texas, and has a population of 840,758.El Paso stands on the Rio Grande across the Mexico\u2013United States border from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua with 1.4 million people. Las Cruces, in the neighboring U.S. state of New Mexico, has a population of 215,579. On the U.S. side, the El Paso metropolitan area forms part of the larger El Paso\u2013Las Cruces CSA, with a population of 1,060,397.Bi-nationally, these three cities form a combined international metropolitan area sometimes referred to as the Paso del Norte or the Borderplex. The region of 2.5 million people constitutes the largest bilingual and binational work force in the Western Hemisphere.The city is home to three publicly traded companies, and former Western Refining, now Andeavor. as well as home to the Medical Center of the Americas, the only medical research and care provider complex in West Texas and Southern New Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso, the city's primary university. The city hosts the annual Sun Bowl college football post-season game, the second oldest bowl game in the country.El Paso has a strong federal and military presence. William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Biggs Army Airfield, and Fort Bliss are located in the area. Fort Bliss is one of the largest military complexes of the United States Army and the largest training area in the United States. Also headquartered in El Paso are the DEA domestic field division 7, El Paso Intelligence Center, Joint Task Force North, United States Border Patrol El Paso Sector, and the U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group (SOG).\nIn 2010 and 2018, El Paso received an All-America City Award. El Paso ranked in the top three safest large cities in the United States between 1997 and 2014, including holding the title of safest city between 2011 and 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks. The evidence suggests 10,000 to 12,000 years of human habitation. The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. When the Spanish arrived, the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area. These were subsequently incorporated into the Mestizo culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from Comancher\u00eda, and gen\u00edzaros of various ethnic groups. The Mescalero Apache were also present.\nSpanish explorer Don Juan de O\u00f1ate was born in 1550 in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and was the first New Spain (Mexico) explorer known to have observed the Rio Grande near El Paso, in 1598, celebrating a Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (decades before the English Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). However, the four survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza, and his enslaved Moor Estevanico, are thought to have passed through the area in the mid-1530s. El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) was founded on the south bank of the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande), in 1659 by Fray Garcia de San Francisco. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the Pueblo Revolt, until 1692 when Santa Fe was reconquered and once again became the capital.\nThe Texas Revolution (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of Cross-border town naming until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring Anson Mills to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.During the Civil War, a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union California Column in 1862. It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.\nAfter the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow as Texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority. El Paso itself, incorporated in 1873, encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river. In the 1870s, a population of 23 non-Hispanic whites and 150 Hispanics was reported. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, the population boomed to 10,000 by the 1890 census, with many Anglo-Americans, recent immigrants, old Hispanic settlers, and recent arrivals from Mexico. The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild boomtown known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness. Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). With the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city's geographic position, the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the U.S. Southwest.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio D\u00edaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D\u00edaz.By 1910, the overwhelming number of people in the city were Americans creating a settled environment. However, this period was short-lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees \u2013 and capital \u2013 to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast Plan de San Diego which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens. The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives. These actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the end result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.Simultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000 and Non-Hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites. In reply, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund. In 1916, the Census Bureau reported El Paso's population as 53% Mexican and 44% Non-Hispanic whites. Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.During and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.The Farah Strike, 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas. This strike was originated and led by Chicanas, or Mexican American women, due to Farah Manufacturing Company, one of the largest factories in the city, being unorganized, low wages, discrimination, no benefits, lack of gender-neutrality, health and safety hazards, and unattainable quotas. Texas Monthly described the Farah Strike as the \"strike of the century.\"On August 3, 2019, a mass shooting/domestic terrorist attack committed by a white supremacist occurred at a Walmart in El Paso, which left 23 people dead and 23 others injured.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEl Paso is located at the intersection of three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua) and two countries (the U.S. and Mexico). It is the only major Texas city on Mountain Time. Ciudad Juarez was once in Central Time, but both cities are now on Mountain Time.\nEl Paso is closer to the capital cities of four other states \u2013 Phoenix, Arizona (345 miles (555 km) away); Santa Fe, New Mexico, (273 miles (439 km) away); Ciudad Chihuahua, Chihuahua, (218 miles (351 km) away), and Hermosillo, Sonora (325 miles (523 km) away) \u2013 than it is to the capital of its own state, Austin (528 miles (850 km) away). It is closer to Los Angeles, California (700 miles (1,100 km) away) than it is to Orange (858 miles (1,381 km) away), the easternmost town in the state.\nEl Paso is located within the Chihuahuan Desert, the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region. The Franklin Mountains extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the west side forms the beginnings of the Mesilla Valley, and the east side expands into the desert and lower valley. They connect in the central business district at the southern end of the mountain range.\nThe city's elevation is 3,800 ft (1,200 m) above sea level. North Franklin Mountain is the highest peak in the city at 7,192 ft (2,192 m) above sea level. The peak can be seen from 60 mi (100 km) in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local Coronado High School gets its mascot's name. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 256.3 square miles (663.7 km2).The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park, the largest urban park in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and El Paso International Airport.\nThe Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey, an example of a pluton, rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Nearby volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (50 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEl Paso has a transitional climate between cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk) and hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh) featuring hot summers, with little humidity, and cool to mild dry winters. Rainfall averages 9.7 in (250 mm) per year, much of which occurs during the summer from July through September, and is predominantly caused by the North American Monsoon. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes thunderstorms, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.\nThe sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the National Weather Service; from this, the city is nicknamed \"The Sun City\". Due to its arid, windy climate, El Paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season, particularly during the springtime between March and early May. With an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph (50 km/h) and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph (120 km/h), these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.\nEl Paso and the nearby mountains also receive snow. Weather systems have produced over one foot (30 cm) of snow on several occasions. In the 1982\u20131983 winter season, three major snowstorms produced record seasonal snowfall. On December 25\u201326, 1982, 6.0 inches (15 cm) of snow fell, producing a white Christmas for the city. This was followed by another 7.0 inches (18 cm) on December 30\u201331, 1982. On April 4\u20137, 1983, 16.5 inches (42 cm) of snow fell on El Paso, bringing the seasonal total to nearly 30 inches (76 cm). On December 13\u201314, 1987, a record storm dumped over 22 inches (56 cm) of snow on El Paso, and two weeks later (December 25\u201326), another three inches (7.6 cm) fell, bringing the monthly total for December 1987 to an all-time record high of 25.9 inches (66 cm) of snow.\nThe average annual snowfall for the city varies widely between different neighborhoods at different elevations, but is 6.1 inches (15 cm) at the airport (but with a median of 0, meaning most years see no snow at all). Snow is most rare around Ysleta and the eastern valley area, which usually include large numbers of palm trees; in the higher neighborhoods, palm trees are more vulnerable to snow and cold snaps and are often seen with brown, frost-damaged fronds.\nOne example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C), the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was 1 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C), breaking the 5 \u00b0F (\u221215 \u00b0C) monthly record low set during the cold wave of 1899. Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results. Two local power plants failed, forcing El Paso Electric to institute rolling blackouts over several days, and electric wires were broken, causing localised blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days.\nMonthly means range from 45.5 \u00b0F (7.5 \u00b0C) in December to 83.5 \u00b0F (28.6 \u00b0C) in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon arrives, while daily low temperatures typically peak in July or early August with the higher humidity the monsoon brings (translating to warmer nights). On average, there are 52 nights of at- or below-freezing lows, 109 days of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C)+ highs and 20 days of 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ highs annually; it is extremely rare for temperatures to stay below the freezing mark all day. The city's record high is 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on June 30, 1994, and its record low is \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) on January 11, 1962; the highest daily minimum was 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the National Weather Service since 1879.\n\n\n==== Flooding ====\nAlthough the average annual rainfall is only about 9.7 in (250 mm), many parts of El Paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms. In late July and early August 2006, up to 10 in (250 mm) of rain fell in a week, the flood-control reservoirs overflowed and caused major flooding citywide. The city staff estimated damage to public infrastructure at $21 million, and to private property (residential and commercial) at $77 million. Much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood-control dams and reservoirs, and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water.\n\n\n=== Time zone ===\nEl Paso is located in the far western corner of Texas, which is roughly the only part of the state that is located within the Mountain Time Zone, as opposed to the Central Time Zone.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Downtown and central El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town contains some of the city's oldest and most historic neighborhoods. Located in the heart of the city, it is home to approximately 44,993 people. Development of the area started in 1827 with the first resident, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a wealthy merchant from Paso del Norte (present day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), who built the region's first structure establishing Rancho Ponce within the vicinity of S. El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the Sunset Heights district. It is close to the El Paso International Airport, the international border, and Fort Bliss. It is part of the El Paso Independent School District.\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the white American residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. Hispanic-American residents lived in an area called Chihuahuita (\"little Chihuahua\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area. Another downtown neighborhood is El Segundo Barrio, which is near the United States/Mexico border.\n\n\n=== Northwest El Paso ===\n\nBetter known as West El Paso or the West Side, the area includes a portion of the Rio Grande floodplain upstream from downtown which is known locally as the Upper Valley and is located on the west side of the Franklin Mountains. The Upper Valley is the greenest part of the county due to the Rio Grande. The west side is home to some of the most affluent neighborhoods within the city, such as the Coronado Hills and Country Club neighborhoods. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of El Paso.\n\n\n=== West central El Paso ===\n\nWest central El Paso is located north of Interstate 10 and west of the Franklin Mountains. The University of Texas at El Paso and the Cincinnati Entertainment district are located in the heart of the area. Historic districts Kern Place and Sunset Heights are in this part of town.\nKern Place was founded in 1914 by Peter E. Kern, for whom the neighborhood was named.The homes of Kern Place are unique in architecture and some were built by residents themselves. One of the better known homes is the Paul Luckett Home located at 1201 Cincinnati Ave. above Madeline Park, and is made of local rock. It is known as \"The Castle\" due to its round walls and a crenelated rooftop.Kern Place is extremely popular with college and university students. The area is known for its glitzy entertainment district, restaurants and coffee shops who cater to both business patrons and university students. After UTEP's basketball and football games, UTEP fans pack the Kern Place area for food and entertainment at Cincinnati Street a small bar district. This bar scene has grown over the years and has attracted thousands to its annual Mardi Gras block party as well as after sporting events or concerts. Young men and women make up the majority of the crowds who stop in between classes or after work.Sunset Heights is one of the most historic areas in town, which has existed since the latter part of the 1890s. Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory, but many have been neglected and have deteriorated. During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, Doroteo Arango (also known as Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s. During the 1910 Mexican Revolution many Mexicans fled Mexico and settled in Sunset Heights.\n\n\n=== Northeast El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town is located north of central El Paso and east of the Franklin Mountains. Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like east El Paso and northwest El Paso, but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at Ft. Bliss in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at Andress High School, Parkland High School, Irvin High School, and Chapin High School.\n\n\n=== East El Paso ===\n\nThe area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population of over 200,000.

It is the third largest area of the city, behind east El Paso and central El Paso. Hawkins Road and Interstate 10 border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain).\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: Ysleta Mission-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), Socorro Mission-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and San Elizario Chapel (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King Philip II of Spain.\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n\n=== Texas and New Mexico suburbs ===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico.

The tower did use a design of the United States flag during the July 4 holidays, as well as the American hostage crisis of 1980, and was lit continuously following the September 11 attacks in 2001 until around 2006. During the Christmas holidays, a design of a Christmas tree was used, and at times, the letters \"UTEP\" were used to support University of Texas at El Paso athletics.

The first electrified line across the Rio Grande, which opened on January 11, 1902, was preceded by a network that relied on animal labor. The system quickly spread into residential and industrial areas of El Paso. In 1913, a 12-mile (19 km) interurban line was built to Ysleta. At the close of 1943, the holding company El Paso Electric sold its subsidiary, the El Paso Electric Railway Company and its Mexican counterpart, to one of National City Lines' subsidiaries. This resulted in the formation of El Paso City Lines, whose domestic streetcar lines were replaced by buses in 1947. The international streetcar line which crossed the border via the Stanton Street Bridge continued to operate until 1973. In 1977, El Paso City Lines and two other bus companies were bought by the municipality and merged to form Sun City Area Transit (SCAT). In 1987, SCAT restyled itself Sun Metro.\n\n\n==== El Paso Streetcar ====\nThe El Paso Streetcar is a streetcar system that opened for service on November 9, 2018, and uses a fleet of restored PCC streetcars that had served the city's previous system until its closure in 1974. The system covers 4.8 miles (7.7 km) (round trip) in two loops from Downtown El Paso to University of Texas at El Paso. The system was constructed under the authority of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, but when the major construction was completed, around spring 2018, it was transferred to Sun Metro, for operation and maintenance. As of 2016, construction of the system was projected to cost $97 million.\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\n\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of Nueva Espa\u00f1a, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe. Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area:\n\nBridge of the Americas, also known as the Cordova Bridge.\nGood Neighbor International Bridge, also known as the Stanton Street Bridge\nPaso del Norte International Bridge, also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge.\nYsleta\u2013Zaragoza International Bridge, also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.The city collects tolls at its international bridges.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of museums in West Texas\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Source notes ===\n\n\n== References ==\nHammond, John Hays (1935).

          "Built as a tribute to the City of El Paso by Rufino Loya Rivas, his home is worth the detour for a quick walk around the property. A lot of wonderful artistry went into the home, so take your time and admire all of the details. This is a residential neighborhood so street",
          "This is a nice short visit to look around the house in all sides. It\u2019s very Catholic focused and is a sweet labor of love. Looks like people still live in there in the quiet neighborhood. Easy parking."

          "Good fun great way to cool off",

          "Pretty cool wish i had this when i was a kid",

        "wiki": "The Ysleta Mission, located in the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo within the municipality of El Paso, Texas, is recognized as the oldest continuously operated parish in the State of Texas. The Ysleta community is also recognized as the oldest in Texas and claims to have the oldest continuously cultivated plot of land in the United States.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nIn 1680, as a result of the Pueblo Revolt, the Tigua (Tiwa) tribe was forced to flee from their ancestral home, Isleta Pueblo, located south of present-day Albuquerque, New Mexico. Some of the pueblo people fled to Hopi territory in Arizona while others followed Spanish colonists as they retreated southward. The Spanish and Comanches eventually settled in El Paso del Norte (present day El Paso, TX) where they established the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and where the Ysleta Mission was founded. The spelling of Ysleta with a \"Y\" and the term del Sur (south) was to differentiate the new settlement from the mother pueblo, Isleta. In 1682, the Tigua people built a permanent structure out of adobe and, in October of that year, the building was formally dedicated by Bishop Salpointe of Tucson and named La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur in honor of the Tigua's patron saint, Saint Anthony (San Antonio).Over the next two centuries the mission was relocated several times due to flooding of the Rio Grande. In 1829 one such flood washed away the structure. The flood also resulted in the river cutting a new course further south and the area where the church had been located was no longer considered a part of Mexico but of the Republic of Texas. In 1897 the structure was remodeled and the now familiar gables and bee-hive bell tower were added. A fire in 1907, caused by chemicals stored in the bell tower to repel bats, resulted in massive damage to the building. The church was rebuilt in 1908 and remains much the same today. The church prospered and in 1918 Our Lady of Mount Carmel School was established and remained open until 2005 when the church closed it. The Texas Historical Commission erected historical markers at the Ysleta Mission in the following years: 1936 \u2013 First mission and pueblo in Texas, 1962 \u2013 Site of first mission in Texas, and 1970 \u2013 Oldest mission in Texas. On July 31, 1972, the Ysleta Mission was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== The mission today ==\nIn 1990 members of the community began efforts to restore and preserve the Ysleta and Socorro missions as well as the Presidio Chapel of San Elizario, Texas. That same year the City and County governments of El Paso formed the Office of Heritage Tourism and received technical support for the project from the National Trust for Historic Preservation in the form of a grant. The newly created Office of Heritage Tourism established a board with representatives from various local governments, the Catholic Diocese, and private organizations who had been working separately on projects to restore the missions. Two Mexican architects with expertise in restoring adobe buildings were retained with the help of a grant from the National Park Service and they developed a comprehensive restoration plan which was the basis upon which Bishop Armando Ochoa began a much publicized fund raising effort to pay for the restorations. The two missions and chapel comprise The El Paso Mission Trail, which stretches approximately 9 miles along Socorro Rd. (FM 258) and is considered to be a part of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro (The Royal Road to the Interior).The Tigua people continue to be closely associated with the church and remain loyal to their patron saint, Saint Anthony of Padua. The Tigua feast day of San Antonio is observed on June 13, with a morning mass followed by traditional dancing. Directly adjacent to the church, the Tiguas built a large gaming center called Speaking Rock Casino; however, after a few years the state government of Texas successfully challenged its legality and it was subsequently closed down. It was later reopened but no longer offered casino style gaming. The Tigua Tribal Government offices are located a short distance from the church as is the Tigua Cultural Center.\nThe church is currently owned by the Catholic Diocese of El Paso and staffed by Conventual Franciscans. For nearly a century, the church has hosted the Ysleta Mission Festival on the second weekend of July . This three-day event is one of El Paso's largest and proceeds from the event help fund the maintenance and preservation of the Ysleta Mission. In the 1960s a newer church building was constructed to accommodate the growing number of parishioners. The old church is now primarily reserved for special occasions such as weddings, quincea\u00f1eras, and baptisms.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n1680 \u2013 Spanish settlers and Tigua (Tiwa) Indians are driven from northern New Mexico and Isleta Pueblo by the Pueblo Revolt. They travel southward to El Paso del Norte where El Paso, Texas, and Cd. Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico exist today. Mexico Governor Antonio de Otermin, representing the crown of Spain, established the Ysleta Mission (Ysleta del Sur Mission) for the refugees.\n1682 \u2013 A permanent structure for the Ysleta Mission was established. In October the building is formally dedicated and named La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur in honor of the Tigua's patron saint, Saint Anthony (San Antonio) by the Bishop of Tucson, Arizona.\n1691 \u2013 Governor Diego de Vargas gives the first official land grant for the church to Father Joaquin de Hinojosa.\n1693 \u2013 The church was renamed Corpus Christi de los Tiguas de Ysleta by Governor Diego de Vargas under the authority of King Charles II of Spain.\n1740s, 1829 \u2013 Flooding of the Rio Grande damaged/destroyed the mission.\n1874 \u2013 The first formal property deed for the church was granted to Bishop Salpointe of Tucson. This deed outlined the boundaries of the church's property and remain the same today. French clergy petitioned the Bishop of Tucson to change the church's name to Our Lady of Mount Carmel.\n1881-1891,1894-1990 \u2013 The church was administered by Jesuits from Mexico Province, Mexico City, Mexico.\n1907 \u2013 Fire caused massive damage to the church structure. It was rebuilt the following year.\n1919\u20131921 \u2013 Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (M\u00e9xico-Cuba Province, El Paso, Texas and United States Province, Los Angeles, California) established and staffed Our Lady of Mount Carmel School (Tiwa).\n1922\u20131980s \u2013 Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word from the New Orleans, Louisiana, province staffed the school.\n1980s\u20132005 \u2013 Lay teachers and Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word staffed the school.\n1990\u20131992 \u2013 The church became a parish and was administered by diocesan priests.\n1992\u2013present \u2013Conventual Franciscans from Our Lady of Consolation Province, Mount St. Francis, Indiana, administer Our Lady of Mount Carmel.\n\n\n== Photo gallery ==\n\n\n=== May 1936 ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== July 2009 ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHueco Tanks\nSocorro Mission\nMission Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe\nTown of Ysleta, El Paso, Texas\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\nRecorded Texas Historic Landmarks in El Paso County\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ysleta Mission at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "El Paso (; Spanish: [el \u02c8paso] \"the pass\") is a city and the county seat of El Paso County, Texas, United States, in the far western part of the state. The 2019 population estimate for the city from the U.S. Census was 681,728, making it the 22nd largest city in the United States. Its metropolitan statistical area (MSA) covers all of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in Texas, and has a population of 840,758.El Paso stands on the Rio Grande across the Mexico\u2013United States border from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua with 1.4 million people. Las Cruces, in the neighboring U.S. state of New Mexico, has a population of 215,579. On the U.S. side, the El Paso metropolitan area forms part of the larger El Paso\u2013Las Cruces CSA, with a population of 1,060,397.Bi-nationally, these three cities form a combined international metropolitan area sometimes referred to as the Paso del Norte or the Borderplex. The region of 2.5 million people constitutes the largest bilingual and binational work force in the Western Hemisphere.The city is home to three publicly traded companies, and former Western Refining, now Andeavor. as well as home to the Medical Center of the Americas, the only medical research and care provider complex in West Texas and Southern New Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso, the city's primary university. The city hosts the annual Sun Bowl college football post-season game, the second oldest bowl game in the country.El Paso has a strong federal and military presence. William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Biggs Army Airfield, and Fort Bliss are located in the area. Fort Bliss is one of the largest military complexes of the United States Army and the largest training area in the United States. Also headquartered in El Paso are the DEA domestic field division 7, El Paso Intelligence Center, Joint Task Force North, United States Border Patrol El Paso Sector, and the U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group (SOG).\nIn 2010 and 2018, El Paso received an All-America City Award. El Paso ranked in the top three safest large cities in the United States between 1997 and 2014, including holding the title of safest city between 2011 and 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks. The evidence suggests 10,000 to 12,000 years of human habitation. The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. When the Spanish arrived, the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area. These were subsequently incorporated into the Mestizo culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from Comancher\u00eda, and gen\u00edzaros of various ethnic groups. The Mescalero Apache were also present.\nSpanish explorer Don Juan de O\u00f1ate was born in 1550 in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and was the first New Spain (Mexico) explorer known to have observed the Rio Grande near El Paso, in 1598, celebrating a Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (decades before the English Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). However, the four survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza, and his enslaved Moor Estevanico, are thought to have passed through the area in the mid-1530s. El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) was founded on the south bank of the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande), in 1659 by Fray Garcia de San Francisco. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the Pueblo Revolt, until 1692 when Santa Fe was reconquered and once again became the capital.\nThe Texas Revolution (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of Cross-border town naming until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring Anson Mills to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.During the Civil War, a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union California Column in 1862. It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.\nAfter the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow as Texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority. El Paso itself, incorporated in 1873, encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river. In the 1870s, a population of 23 non-Hispanic whites and 150 Hispanics was reported. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, the population boomed to 10,000 by the 1890 census, with many Anglo-Americans, recent immigrants, old Hispanic settlers, and recent arrivals from Mexico. The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild boomtown known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness. Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). With the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city's geographic position, the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the U.S. Southwest.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio D\u00edaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D\u00edaz.By 1910, the overwhelming number of people in the city were Americans creating a settled environment. However, this period was short-lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees \u2013 and capital \u2013 to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast Plan de San Diego which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens. The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives. These actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the end result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.Simultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000 and Non-Hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites. In reply, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund. In 1916, the Census Bureau reported El Paso's population as 53% Mexican and 44% Non-Hispanic whites. Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.During and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.The Farah Strike, 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas. This strike was originated and led by Chicanas, or Mexican American women, due to Farah Manufacturing Company, one of the largest factories in the city, being unorganized, low wages, discrimination, no benefits, lack of gender-neutrality, health and safety hazards, and unattainable quotas. Texas Monthly described the Farah Strike as the \"strike of the century.\"On August 3, 2019, a mass shooting/domestic terrorist attack committed by a white supremacist occurred at a Walmart in El Paso, which left 23 people dead and 23 others injured.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEl Paso is located at the intersection of three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua) and two countries (the U.S. and Mexico). It is the only major Texas city on Mountain Time. Ciudad Juarez was once in Central Time, but both cities are now on Mountain Time.\nEl Paso is closer to the capital cities of four other states \u2013 Phoenix, Arizona (345 miles (555 km) away); Santa Fe, New Mexico, (273 miles (439 km) away); Ciudad Chihuahua, Chihuahua, (218 miles (351 km) away), and Hermosillo, Sonora (325 miles (523 km) away) \u2013 than it is to the capital of its own state, Austin (528 miles (850 km) away). It is closer to Los Angeles, California (700 miles (1,100 km) away) than it is to Orange (858 miles (1,381 km) away), the easternmost town in the state.\nEl Paso is located within the Chihuahuan Desert, the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region. The Franklin Mountains extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the west side forms the beginnings of the Mesilla Valley, and the east side expands into the desert and lower valley. They connect in the central business district at the southern end of the mountain range.\nThe city's elevation is 3,800 ft (1,200 m) above sea level. North Franklin Mountain is the highest peak in the city at 7,192 ft (2,192 m) above sea level. The peak can be seen from 60 mi (100 km) in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local Coronado High School gets its mascot's name. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 256.3 square miles (663.7 km2).The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park, the largest urban park in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and El Paso International Airport.\nThe Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey, an example of a pluton, rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Nearby volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (50 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEl Paso has a transitional climate between cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk) and hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh) featuring hot summers, with little humidity, and cool to mild dry winters. Rainfall averages 9.7 in (250 mm) per year, much of which occurs during the summer from July through September, and is predominantly caused by the North American Monsoon. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes thunderstorms, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.\nThe sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the National Weather Service; from this, the city is nicknamed \"The Sun City\". Due to its arid, windy climate, El Paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season, particularly during the springtime between March and early May. With an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph (50 km/h) and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph (120 km/h), these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.\nEl Paso and the nearby mountains also receive snow. Weather systems have produced over one foot (30 cm) of snow on several occasions. In the 1982\u20131983 winter season, three major snowstorms produced record seasonal snowfall. On December 25\u201326, 1982, 6.0 inches (15 cm) of snow fell, producing a white Christmas for the city. This was followed by another 7.0 inches (18 cm) on December 30\u201331, 1982. On April 4\u20137, 1983, 16.5 inches (42 cm) of snow fell on El Paso, bringing the seasonal total to nearly 30 inches (76 cm). On December 13\u201314, 1987, a record storm dumped over 22 inches (56 cm) of snow on El Paso, and two weeks later (December 25\u201326), another three inches (7.6 cm) fell, bringing the monthly total for December 1987 to an all-time record high of 25.9 inches (66 cm) of snow.\nThe average annual snowfall for the city varies widely between different neighborhoods at different elevations, but is 6.1 inches (15 cm) at the airport (but with a median of 0, meaning most years see no snow at all). Snow is most rare around Ysleta and the eastern valley area, which usually include large numbers of palm trees; in the higher neighborhoods, palm trees are more vulnerable to snow and cold snaps and are often seen with brown, frost-damaged fronds.\nOne example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C), the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was 1 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C), breaking the 5 \u00b0F (\u221215 \u00b0C) monthly record low set during the cold wave of 1899. Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results. Two local power plants failed, forcing El Paso Electric to institute rolling blackouts over several days, and electric wires were broken, causing localised blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days.\nMonthly means range from 45.5 \u00b0F (7.5 \u00b0C) in December to 83.5 \u00b0F (28.6 \u00b0C) in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon arrives, while daily low temperatures typically peak in July or early August with the higher humidity the monsoon brings (translating to warmer nights). On average, there are 52 nights of at- or below-freezing lows, 109 days of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C)+ highs and 20 days of 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ highs annually; it is extremely rare for temperatures to stay below the freezing mark all day. The city's record high is 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on June 30, 1994, and its record low is \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) on January 11, 1962; the highest daily minimum was 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the National Weather Service since 1879.\n\n\n==== Flooding ====\nAlthough the average annual rainfall is only about 9.7 in (250 mm), many parts of El Paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms. In late July and early August 2006, up to 10 in (250 mm) of rain fell in a week, the flood-control reservoirs overflowed and caused major flooding citywide. The city staff estimated damage to public infrastructure at $21 million, and to private property (residential and commercial) at $77 million. Much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood-control dams and reservoirs, and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water.\n\n\n=== Time zone ===\nEl Paso is located in the far western corner of Texas, which is roughly the only part of the state that is located within the Mountain Time Zone, as opposed to the Central Time Zone.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Downtown and central El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town contains some of the city's oldest and most historic neighborhoods. Located in the heart of the city, it is home to approximately 44,993 people. Development of the area started in 1827 with the first resident, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a wealthy merchant from Paso del Norte (present day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), who built the region's first structure establishing Rancho Ponce within the vicinity of S. El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the Sunset Heights district. It is close to the El Paso International Airport, the international border, and Fort Bliss. It is part of the El Paso Independent School District.\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the white American residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. Hispanic-American residents lived in an area called Chihuahuita (\"little Chihuahua\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area. Another downtown neighborhood is El Segundo Barrio, which is near the United States/Mexico border.\n\n\n=== Northwest El Paso ===\n\nBetter known as West El Paso or the West Side, the area includes a portion of the Rio Grande floodplain upstream from downtown which is known locally as the Upper Valley and is located on the west side of the Franklin Mountains. The Upper Valley is the greenest part of the county due to the Rio Grande. The west side is home to some of the most affluent neighborhoods within the city, such as the Coronado Hills and Country Club neighborhoods. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of El Paso.\n\n\n=== West central El Paso ===\n\nWest central El Paso is located north of Interstate 10 and west of the Franklin Mountains. The University of Texas at El Paso and the Cincinnati Entertainment district are located in the heart of the area. Historic districts Kern Place and Sunset Heights are in this part of town.\nKern Place was founded in 1914 by Peter E. Kern, for whom the neighborhood was named.The homes of Kern Place are unique in architecture and some were built by residents themselves. One of the better known homes is the Paul Luckett Home located at 1201 Cincinnati Ave. above Madeline Park, and is made of local rock. It is known as \"The Castle\" due to its round walls and a crenelated rooftop.Kern Place is extremely popular with college and university students. The area is known for its glitzy entertainment district, restaurants and coffee shops who cater to both business patrons and university students. After UTEP's basketball and football games, UTEP fans pack the Kern Place area for food and entertainment at Cincinnati Street a small bar district. This bar scene has grown over the years and has attracted thousands to its annual Mardi Gras block party as well as after sporting events or concerts. Young men and women make up the majority of the crowds who stop in between classes or after work.Sunset Heights is one of the most historic areas in town, which has existed since the latter part of the 1890s. Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory, but many have been neglected and have deteriorated. During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, Doroteo Arango (also known as Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s. During the 1910 Mexican Revolution many Mexicans fled Mexico and settled in Sunset Heights.\n\n\n=== Northeast El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town is located north of central El Paso and east of the Franklin Mountains. Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like east El Paso and northwest El Paso, but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at Ft. Bliss in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at Andress High School, Parkland High School, Irvin High School, and Chapin High School.\n\n\n=== East El Paso ===\n\nThe area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population of over 200,000. It includes the 79936 ZIP Code, which was considered in 2013 as the most populous in the nation with over 114,000 people.\n\n\n=== Mission Valley ===\n\nFormerly known as the lower valley, it includes part of Eastside and all lower valley districts. It is the third largest area of the city, behind east El Paso and central El Paso. Hawkins Road and Interstate 10 border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain).\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: Ysleta Mission-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), Socorro Mission-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and San Elizario Chapel (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King Philip II of Spain.\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n\n=== Texas and New Mexico suburbs ===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico. The most populated suburbs in Texas are Socorro, Horizon City, Fort Bliss and San Elizario. Other Texas suburbs are Anthony, Canutillo, Sparks, Fabens, and Vinton.\nAlthough Anthony, Santa Teresa, Sunland Park, and Chaparral lie adjacent to El Paso County, they are considered to be part of the Las Cruces, New Mexico metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings ===\n\nEl Paso's tallest building, the Wells Fargo Plaza, was built in the early 1970s as State National Plaza. The black-windowed, 302-foot (92 m) building is famous for its 13 white horizontal lights (18 lights per row on the east and west sides of the building, and seven bulbs per row on the north and south sides) that were lit at night. The tower did use a design of the United States flag during the July 4 holidays, as well as the American hostage crisis of 1980, and was lit continuously following the September 11 attacks in 2001 until around 2006. During the Christmas holidays, a design of a Christmas tree was used, and at times, the letters \"UTEP\" were used to support University of Texas at El Paso athletics. The tower is now only lit during the holiday months, or when special events take place in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2010 U.S. census, 649,121 people, 216,694 households, and 131,104 families resided in the city. The population density was 2,263.0 people per square mile (873.7/km\u00b2). There were 227,605 housing units at an average density of 777.5 per square mile (300.2/km\u00b2). Recent census estimates say that the racial composition of El Paso is: White\u2013 92.0% (Non-Hispanic Whites: 11.8%), African American or Black \u2013 3.9%, Two or more races \u2013 1.5%, Asian \u2013 1.3%, Native American \u2013 1.0%, and Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander \u2013 0.2%. There are no de facto African-American neighborhoods.Ethnically, the city was: 82.8% Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nThere were 216,894 households in 2010, out of which 37.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.5% were married couples living together, 20.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.3% were not families. About 21.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 24.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.95 and the average family size was 3.47\nIn the city, the population was distributed as 29.1% under the age of 18, 7.5% from 20 to 24, 26.2% from 25 to 44, 22.8% from 45 to 64, and 11.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32.5 years.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $44,431, and for a family was $50,247. Males had a median income of $28,989 versus $21,540 for females. The per capita income for the city was $21,120. About 17.3% of families and 20.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 28.5% of those under age 18 and 18.4% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEl Paso has a diversified economy focused primarily within international trade, military, government civil service, oil and gas, health care, tourism and service sectors. The El Paso metro area had a GDP of $29.03 billion in 2017. There was also $92 billion worth of trade in 2012. Over the past 15 years the city has become a significant location for American-based call centers. Cotton, fruit, vegetables, and livestock are also produced in the area. El Paso has added a significant manufacturing sector with items and goods produced that include petroleum, metals, medical devices, plastics, machinery, defense-related goods and automotive parts. The city is the second busiest international crossing point in the U.S. behind San Diego.El Paso is home to one Fortune 500 company, Western Refining, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This makes the city one of six Texas metro areas to have at least one Fortune 500 company call it home; the others being Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin and Corpus Christi. The second publicly traded company is Helen of Troy Limited, a NASDAQ-listed company that manufactures personal health care products under many labels, such as OXO, Dr. Scholl's, Vidal Sassoon, Pert Plus, Brut and Sunbeam, and the third is El Paso Electric listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a public utility engaging in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in west Texas and southern New Mexico. The fourth publicly traded company is Western Refining Logistics also traded in the New York Stock Exchange. It is a Western Refining subsidiary which owns, operates, develops, and acquires terminals, storage tanks, pipelines, and other logistics assets.\nMore than 70 Fortune 500 companies have offices in El Paso, including AT&T, ADP, Boeing, Charles Schwab, Delphi, Dish Network, Eureka, Hoover, Raytheon, Prudential Financial, USAA and Verizon Wireless.\nHispanic Business Magazine included 28 El Paso companies in its list of the 500 largest Hispanic owned businesses in the United States. El Paso's 28 companies are second only to Miami's 57. The list of the largest Hispanic owned businesses includes companies like Fred Loya Insurance, a Hispanic 500 company and the 18th largest Hispanic business in the nation. Other companies on the list are Dos Lunas Spirits, Dynatec Labs, Spira Footwear, Datamark, Inc. and El Taco Tote. El Paso was home to El Paso Corporation formerly known as El Paso Natural Gas Company.\nThe city also has a large military presence with Fort Bliss, William Beaumont Army Medical Center and Biggs Army Airfield. The defense industry in El Paso employs over 41,000 and provides a $6 billion annual impact to the city's economy. In 2013, Fort Bliss was chosen as the newly configured U.S. Air Force Security Forces Regional Training Center which added 8,000 to 10,000 Air Force personnel annually.In addition to the military, the federal government has a strong presence in El Paso to manage its status and unique issues as an important border region. Operations headquartered in El Paso include the DEA domestic field division 7, El Paso Intelligence Center, Joint Task Force North, U.S. Border Patrol El Paso Sector and U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group (SOG).\nCall center operations employ more than 10,000 people in the area. Automatic Data Processing has an office in West El Paso, employing about 1,100 people with expansion plans to reach 2,200 by 2020.Tourism is another major industry in El Paso, bringing in $1.5 billion-a-year and over 2.3 million visitors annually due to the city's sunny weather, natural beauty, rich cultural history and many outdoor attractions.Education is also a driving force in El Paso's economy. El Paso's three large school districts are among the largest employers in the area, employing more than 20,000 people among them. UTEP has an annual budget of nearly $418 million and employs nearly 4,800 people. A 2010 study by the university's Institute for Policy and Economic Development stated the university's impact on local businesses is $417 million annually.\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n\n\n=== Annual cultural events and festivals ===\n\n\n==== Amigo Airsho ====\nAmigo Airsho is one of El Paso's premier events, and is ranked as one of the top ten air shows in the country.

It was fully completed on April 27, 2011; it connects the Patriot Freeway (US 54) and Biggs Army Airfield to the Purple Heart Memorial Highway (Loop 375).\n North Loop Road, as well as Delta Drive between North Loop Road and Alameda Avenue (Texas Highway 20)\n Zaragoza Road, running more or less north from the Ysleta International Bridge to US 62\u2013180 (Montana Avenue), it lies mostly in east El Paso.\n Texas Farm-to-Market Road 3255 runs north from US 54 to the New Mexico state line in northeast El Paso and bears the city street name Martin Luther King Boulevard.\nBorder West Expressway under construction (as of 2018), parallel to I-10 through downtown and the west side.\n\n\n==== Mass transit ====\nThe Sun Metro Mass Transit System operates a system of medium- to large-capacity natural gas-powered buses all around the city of El Paso.El Paso County Transit makes trips with small-capacity buses mainly in the eastern El Paso area.\nIn 2011, Sun Metro was named the most outstanding public transit system of the year in all of North America for a mid-size transit system by the American Public Transportation Association.\nOn September 1, 2009, NMDOT Park and Ride began operating commuter bus service to and from Las Cruces, New Mexico.Historically, El Paso and Ciudad Juarez had a shared streetcar system with a peak electrified route mileage of 64 miles (103 km) in 1920. The first electrified line across the Rio Grande, which opened on January 11, 1902, was preceded by a network that relied on animal labor. The system quickly spread into residential and industrial areas of El Paso. In 1913, a 12-mile (19 km) interurban line was built to Ysleta. At the close of 1943, the holding company El Paso Electric sold its subsidiary, the El Paso Electric Railway Company and its Mexican counterpart, to one of National City Lines' subsidiaries. This resulted in the formation of El Paso City Lines, whose domestic streetcar lines were replaced by buses in 1947. The international streetcar line which crossed the border via the Stanton Street Bridge continued to operate until 1973. In 1977, El Paso City Lines and two other bus companies were bought by the municipality and merged to form Sun City Area Transit (SCAT). In 1987, SCAT restyled itself Sun Metro.\n\n\n==== El Paso Streetcar ====\nThe El Paso Streetcar is a streetcar system that opened for service on November 9, 2018, and uses a fleet of restored PCC streetcars that had served the city's previous system until its closure in 1974. The system covers 4.8 miles (7.7 km) (round trip) in two loops from Downtown El Paso to University of Texas at El Paso. The system was constructed under the authority of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, but when the major construction was completed, around spring 2018, it was transferred to Sun Metro, for operation and maintenance. As of 2016, construction of the system was projected to cost $97 million.\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\n\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of Nueva Espa\u00f1a, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe. Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area:\n\nBridge of the Americas, also known as the Cordova Bridge.\nGood Neighbor International Bridge, also known as the Stanton Street Bridge\nPaso del Norte International Bridge, also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge.\nYsleta\u2013Zaragoza International Bridge, also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.The city collects tolls at its international bridges.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of museums in West Texas\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Source notes ===\n\n\n== References ==\nHammond, John Hays (1935).

        "wiki": "Concordia Cemetery is a burial ground in El Paso, Texas. It is well known for the being the burial place of several gunslingers and old west lawmen. The first burial took place in 1856. There are between 60,000 and 65,000 graves in the cemetery. Concordia is the only place to have a Chinese cemetery in Texas.\n\n\n== About ==\n\nThe main entrance to the cemetery is on Yandell Street, east of Piedras. The cemetery is 52 acres in size. Most of the Chinese burials in El Paso took place in Concordia and it is the only place in Texas to have a Chinese cemetery. The Chinese came to El Paso with the railroad as workers and chose to stay. There is also an area set aside for Buffalo Soldiers,  Freemasons, Mormons and Jewish burials. There is also an \"infant nursery\" with unmarked graves for babies, many of whom died due to the 1918 influenza pandemic which hit El Paso in January 1919. It is possible that remains that were once part of the larger area of the cemetery are still located under houses and other property in the surrounding neighborhoods.  In 2012, there were more than 60,000 graves at the cemetery. Other reports state there are around 65,000 graves.In 2016 and 2017, it was rated the Best Historic Cemetery in the West by True West Magazine. The cemetery is managed by the Concordia Heritage Association. Special events at the cemetery include celebrations of Dia de los Muertos, ghost tours and meetings of the John Wesley Hardin Secret Society. The ghost tours, given by Paso Del Norte Paranormal Society, were first started in order to help pay for maintenance of the cemetery. Ghost Adventures featured the cemetery on an episode aired on October 29, 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe cemetery was once a ranch known as Rancho Concordia, and built by Hugh and Juana Stephenson in the 1840s. Hugh Stephenson married the local Juana Maria Ascarate, and her family gave them the land where they built the ranch. The ranch they built included a chapel and a cemetery. Juana became the first person buried in that cemetery in 1856, after she was gored by a pet deer and died of an infection. Also in 1859, a Catholic Church was built on the site called San Jos\u00e9 de Concordia el Alto.In 1882, the city of El Paso bought part of the ranch in order to bury the poor. The different sections of the cemetery were purchased by diverse groups of people by the 1890s, including Jesuits, Catholics, Freemasons, Jewish people, African Americans, Chinese, military, the city and El Paso County. Because of this, no one took responsibility for the upkeep of the cemetery as a whole. In the 1960s, the cemetery was not in good shape and was owned by both private and public interests. In 1990, the Concordia Heritage Association was formed to preserve and maintain the cemetery. In 2012, the Ysleta Lions Club, the Five Points Lions Club and Martin Funeral Homes donated 250 desert willows to the cemetery and helped plant the trees.\n\n\n== Notable burials ==\n\nJames Biggs, who Biggs Army Airfield is named after.\nMoses Carson, younger brother of Kit Carson.\nBenjamin S. Dowell, first mayor of El Paso.\nJohn Wesley Hardin (1853-1895), gunslinger. His grave is surrounded by a cage to prevent people from digging up his body. In 1995, the descendants of Hardin requested permission to move his remains to Nixon, Texas, but a judge decided his body should stay in El Paso.\nPascual Orozco (1882-1915), Mexican Revolution leader briefly buried in Concordia between 1915 and 1923; his remains were moved to Chihuahua.\nJohn Selman (1839-1896), gunslinger, killer of Hardin.\nErnest St. Leon (d. 1898), Texas ranger.\nFlorida J. Wolfe (c. 1867-1913), also known as \"Lady Flo\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nFind a Grave: Concordia Cemetery",

          "This looks as though you stepped back in time to the old west. This really looks like the dusty end of the line, seemingly not much changed from the 1880's. It just has not moved into the 21st century with the rest of the city. It is enclosed within a stone wall, but one may",
          "Recently made a tour of dead Texas gunfighters, of which John Wesley Hardin was a highlight. His grave is very easy to find and if you look around you can see Diamond Dick too. One highlight is the area reserved for the buffalo soldiers. Well worth seeing.",

          "I almost didn't make it there. I did not know that I was allowed to drive through it. Make sure you go there through the entrance/gate from the E Yandell Dr. (located in the middle of the fence/wall). There is a map of it (there is another one next to the gate on Boone Street",
          "I visited Concordia Cemetery because I wanted to visit the graves site of John Wesley Hardin, a gunslinger, who was shot and killed in El Paso, Tx. in 1895. This is a true \"old west\" cemetery that will take you back in time over a hundred years once you enter it's gates. There",

          "Was chowing down at L&J caf\u00e9 and decided to take a quiet stroll through Concordia cemetery.....visit a place where world famous gunfighters were laid to rest. Old place ...Old souls....a real insight into Old El Paso.........a must..!",
          "I don't understand why some reviewers have criticised this cemetery because they feel it is not sufficiently well maintained. Come on folks, that is the whole point. If it was well maintained and pristine it would not have the same draw and sense of mystery for visitors like me.",
          "but then again, it is the desert. Was very disappointed that it is not kept up better. There are only cactus in the main part of the cemetery - the Jewish section has nice trees and grass. Was slightly un-impressed with John Wesley Hardin's grave.",
          "We had some extra time in El Paso and decided to see the grave of gunslinger John Wesley Hardin. I'm not a Wild West buff, but the atmosphere of this dusty cemetery carries the mystique. All I knew was the claim from an old Time/Life book series commercial that he once killed a",
          "I go every other visit, I took out of town friends this time and they enjoyed the history also. It's like the old west, gunslingers, buffalo soldiers, the only Chinese Cemetary in Texas. Tumble weeds and headstones. Visit if you have a chance. Get out of the car and read some of",
          "The Concordia Cemetary is a very interesting place to visit. You need to enter at the main entrance to see the map to the Graves of El Paso's infamous and famous. There is a lot of history to be found as you wander through the rows of tombstones. There is an \"Infant Nursery\"",
          "I have been there a number of time durning the day as well as the ghost trip at night. Both where a great place",

          "We've been to a few dozen cemeteries for historical interest. This one was just average but they do have a nice map out front and in other places. Interesting that there are separate sections for Buffalo Soldiers, Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, Chinese in the same cemetery.",
          "I was surprised to see that this oldest cemetery in El Paso has had some improvements but still has a ways to go. My paternal grandmother is buried here and her gravesite has still not been found. The Concordia's claim to fame is that the gunfighter, John Wesley Hardin, is",
          "This is a cool cemetery to bad it is in such need of care. I feel bad for people buried here! The part where John Wesley Hardin is buried is pretty nice. The rest of it is overgrown with weeds. It looks nothing like it does from the google maps satellite picture. There are",
          "I love cemeteries; very much into genealogy even when not my family. John Wesley Hardin is buried there. Very close to the freeway. No grass so when wind blows, it can be unpleasant. Separate areas for Jewish and Chinese. Nice piece of history, especially for Old West buffs.",
          "I want to join the Association so I can help preserve this masterpiece..but a little hard to get into..I went with the Paranormal group and saw that alot of people that my mother told me about in childhood are buried here like Father Pinto",
          "Read the reviews and had to go to see John Wesley Hardin's grave-it was picture worthy and easy to locate on the map at the entrance. Because it was so hot, we drove through the rest of the cemetery, not as much to see as I had hoped.",
          "Where do I start? This cemetery has it all -- very old sections dating back to the 1880s, a Buffalo Soldier section, Chinese, and Mexican-American. I never get tired of it. If you want to take pictures, go in the morning so you can get the beautiful mountain in the background.",
          "Concordia cemetery is a fascinating experience. The cemetery is quite large, with many interesting grave sites. We were looking for John Wesley Hardin's gravesite, but could not find it. Two kind cemetery workers walked us through the cemetery in the hot sun, to find the grave.",

          "I went when they had the historical tour. At the entrance, I was given a map. People were dressed in period costumes and stayed in character. Each told the story of his life. It painted a picture of olden times and life in El Paso. Especially good was the John Hardin",
          "I've visited Concordia many times through the years and I've watched it lately as it's been cleaned up and markers fixed. If you like the history of the old west and little trivia tidbits you will adore this old cemetery in the heart of El Paso. Did you know the World's Tallest",

          "As an Old West buff I enjoy places where real life \"then\" touches today, even if in a cemetery. If you have an appreciation for those who pioneered the West (good guys and bad) take time to walk through Concordia. You'll see the graves of soldiers, pioneers and at least one",
          "Concordia is not like any cemetery we have ever visited. Only one section, the Jewish, has trees and grass and large markers. This is a monument to all who made this part of Texas & Mexico. The cemetery is bordered by a busy expressway so it is not a peaceful place. It",

        "wiki": "Paso Robles ( PASS-oh ROH-buulz; full name: El Paso de Robles \"The Pass of the Oaks\") is a city in San Luis Obispo County, California, United States. Located on the Salinas River north of San Luis Obispo, California, the city is known for its hot springs, its abundance of wineries, its production of olive oil, almond orchards, and for playing host to the California Mid-State Fair.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis area of the Central Coast, known as the City of El Paso De Robles, Paso Robles, or simply \"Paso\", is known for its thermal springs. Native Americans known as the Chumash lived in the area thousands of years even before the mission era. They knew this area as the \u201cSprings\u201d or the \u201cHot Springs.\u201d A tribal site on present-day Paso Robles was named elewexe, Obispe\u00f1o for \"Swordfish\".Paso Robles is located on the Rancho Paso de Robles Mexican land grant that was purchased by James and Daniel Blackburn in 1857. Their partner was Drury James of Kentucky, a veteran of the Mexican War and uncle of the outlaw Jesse James. The land was a rest-stop for travelers of the Camino Real trail, and was known for its mineral hot springs. In fact, Franciscan priests from neighboring Mission San Miguel constructed the first mineral baths in the area. During this period, Paso Robles began to attract the pioneer settlers who would become the founding members of the community. They would later establish cattle ranches, apple and almond orchards, dairy farms, and vineyards.\nIn 1864, the first El Paso de Robles Hotel was constructed and featured a hot mineral springs bath house. Today, only three locations (Paso Robles Inn, River Oaks Hot Springs, and Franklin Hot Springs) are left that offer the healing mineral bath hot spring experience which brought people like Ignacy Jan Paderewski to Paso Robles.\nJames and Daniel Blackburn donated two blocks to the city for a public park to be used for the pleasure of its citizens and visitors. By original deed, the land was to revert to the donors if used for any other purpose than a public park. Two exceptions were made: allowing the building of the Carnegie Library, and the conversion of the library to a museum.  The grounds were laid out by a Mr. Redington and a planting day was held when each citizen set out his own donation. Originally, the whole park was hedged in by a fence of cactus, and in 1890 a bandstand was built with money raised by private theatricals.\nIn 1886, after the coming of the Southern Pacific Railroad, work began on laying out a town site, with the resort as the nucleus. Two weeks after the first train arrived on October 31, 1886, a three-day celebration was held including a special train from San Francisco bringing prospective buyers, who toured the area and enjoyed the daily barbecues. On November 17, the \u201cGrand Auction\u201d was held, resulting in the sale of 228 lots.\nThe local agent for the SPR when it arrived in Paso Robles was R. M. \"Dick\" Shackelford, a Kentucky native who had come to California in 1853 to dig for gold. Shackelford had a varied career, going from gold mining to hauling freight by ox team, to lumbering, which took him to Nevada, where he served one term as a delegate in the state's first legislature for Washoe County. By 1886 Shackelford had returned to California and was living in Paso Robles, where he began buying up extensive property, building warehouses and starting lumber yards along the railroad's route. Shackelford also established the Southern Pacific Milling Company, which had a virtual monopoly on local milling until local farmers, in an effort to break Shackelford's stranglehold, themselves organized their own milling cooperative, the Farmers' Alliance Flour Mill.In 1889, the same year that Paso Robles incorporated as a city, construction began on a magnificent new hotel. The hotel required over one-million bricks and cost a princely $160,000. The new El Paso de Robles Hotel opened for business in 1891. The new hotel was three stories tall and built of solid masonry, set off by sandstone arches. This ensured the hotel was completely fireproof. The hotel also featured a seven-acre (28,000 m\u00b2) garden and nine-hole golf course. Inside there was a library, a beauty salon, a barber shop, and various billiard and lounging rooms. The new hotel also offered an improved hot springs plunge bath as well as 32 individual bath rooms. The 20 by 40-foot (12 m) plunge bath was considered one of the finest and most complete of its time in the United States.\nOn January 17, 1914, one of the world's most well-known concert pianists and composers came to the hotel: Ignace Paderewski. After three weeks of treatments at the hotel's mineral hot springs for his arthritis, he resumed his concert tour. He later returned to live at the hotel and bought two ranches west of Paso Robles.During the next 30 years, the hotel was visited by other notables: Boxing champion Jack Dempsey, President Theodore Roosevelt, Adela Rogers St. Johns, Phoebe Apperson Hearst (the mother of William Randolph Hearst), actors Douglas Fairbanks, Boris Karloff, Bob Hope, and Clark Gable all stayed at the El Paso de Robles Hotel. And when Major League baseball teams used Paso Robles as a spring training home, the Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago White Sox stayed at the hotel and soaked in the mineral hot springs to soothe tired muscles.\nFor a time, Paso Robles was known as the \u201cAlmond City\u201d because the local almond growers created the largest concentration of almond orchards in the world. The ranchers in the outlying areas were very important to the Paso Robles area. On these ranches were cattle and horses, grain crops (primarily wheat and barley), garden produce and fruit and nut orchards. Many of these ranch lands and orchards have become vineyards for the many wineries which currently draw tourists to the area.\nTo show their appreciation to the ranchers, in October 1931 the business people established Pioneer Day, which is still an annual celebration.\nPioneer Day is celebrated most years on the Saturday prior to October 12 (however, in 2017, it was moved to October 14). It was originally organized by community volunteers working with donations of time, materials and money from individuals, businesses, churches and service organizations. Their goal was to provide a day of community friendship and a commemoration of the heritage of the Paso Robles area. It would also become a day set aside to say \u201cThank you\u201d to all of the people who support the business and professional community of the area throughout the year. Most businesses would close so that their employees could enjoy and participate in the activities and family reunions. There were to be no charges for any of the events and no commercial concessions, and lunch would be provided at no cost. The business closure still holds true for most of the downtown core businesses, but some do open in the mid-afternoon. Most businesses outside of the downtown area keep their normal hours and do not close.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nIn December 1940, a fire completely destroyed the \"fire-proof\" El Paso de Robles Hotel. Guests staying the night escaped unharmed. However, the night clerk who discovered the fire suffered a fatal heart attack immediately after sounding the alarm. Within months after the blaze, plans for a new hotel to be built on the site were drawn up. The design was an entirely new concept: A garden inn-hotel, designed to accommodate motor vehicle travelers. By February 1942 construction was complete and the new Paso Robles Inn opened for business.Through the 1960s and 1970s, the City of Paso Robles experienced significant growth. The area's wine industry flourished, the California Mid-State Fair expanded into a regional attraction, and local lakes, such as Lake Nacimiento, became family vacation destinations. \n\n\n=== The waters ===\n\nAs far back as 1795, Paso Robles has been spoken of and written about as \u201cCalifornia\u2019s oldest watering place\u201d\u2014the place to go for springs and mud baths. In 1864, a correspondent to the San Francisco Bulletin wrote that there was every prospect of the Paso Robles hot springs becoming the watering place of the state. By 1868 people were coming from as far away as Oregon, Nevada, Idaho, and even Alabama. Besides the well-known mud baths, there were the Iron Spring and the Sand Spring, which bubbles through the sand and was said to produce delightful sensations.In 1882, Drury James and the Blackburn brothers issued a pamphlet advertising \u201cEl Paso de Robles Hot and Cold Sulphur Springs and the Only Natural Mud Baths in the World\u201d. By then there were first-class accommodations: a reading room, barber shop, and telegraph office; a general store, a top-of-the-line livery stable, and comfortably furnished cottages for families that preferred privacy to quarters in the hotel. Visitors could stay in touch with the rest of the world, as there were two daily mails, a Western Union telegraph office, and a Wells Fargo agency with special rates for guests. As the springs became more and more a destination of the well-to-do as a place to go to socialize, the original purpose of the springs\u2014to heal\u2014became peripheral.\nThe bathhouse was erected over the sulphur spring in 1888, with a plunge and thirty-seven bath rooms. In the following year, work began on the large Hot Springs Hotel, (today the Paso Robles Inn), which was completed in 1900 and burned down 40 years later. Since the privileges of using the baths were restricted to guests of the hotel and many sufferers of the ailments the baths cured could not pay the rates of the fashionable hotel, a few businessmen in Paso Robles made arrangements with Felix Liss for the right to bore for sulphur water on a lot which Liss owned. A sulphur well was reached, a bath house built and baths offered at an affordable rate of twenty-five cents. The establishment was later offered to the city and is currently the site of the Municipal Pool.\n\n\n=== Wine ===\nPaso Robles\u2019 growth industry\u2014wine\u2014has a long history with the area. Wine grapes were introduced to the Paso Robles soil in 1797 by the Spanish conquistadors and Franciscan missionaries. Spanish explorer Francisco Cortez envisioned an abundant wine-producing operation and encouraged settlers from Mexico and other parts of California to cultivate the land. The first vineyardists in the area were the Padres of the Mission San Miguel, and their old fermentation vats and grapevine artwork can still be seen at the Mission, north of the city of Paso Robles.\nCommercial winemaking was introduced to the Paso Robles region in 1882 when Andrew York, a settler from Indiana, began planting vineyards and established the Ascension Winery at what became York Mountain Winery and is now Epoch Winery. When York purchased the land, it was primarily apple orchards, with a small plot of wine grape vines. York found that the climate and soil were more suitable for vineyards and he expanded the vineyards. Within a few years, he found that the vines were yielding more than he could market, prompting him to build a small, stone winery.\nFollowing Andrew York's early success in the wine business, Gerd and Ilsabe Klintworth planted a vineyard in the Geneseo/Linne area in approximately 1886. They were licensed to sell jugs of Zinfandel, Port, and Muscatel, as well as some of the area's first white wine made from Burger grapes. The Casteel Vineyards in the Willow Creek area were planted just prior to 1908. Casteel wines were stored and aged in a cave cellar. Cuttings from the old vines provided the start for other vineyards, still producing in the area today.\nAs the popularity of wines began to grow, so did the Paso Robles wine region. Lorenzo and Rena Nerelli purchased their vineyard at the foot of York Mountain in 1917. Their Templeton Winery was the area's first to be bonded following the repeal of Prohibition.\nThe early 1920s saw a flurry of winemaking activity when several families immigrated to the area to establish family vineyards and wineries. Sylvester and Caterina Dusi purchased a vineyard in 1924. The old head-pruned Zinfandel vines are now owned and cultivated by their son, Benito. The Martinelli, Busi, Vosti, Steinbeck and Bianchi Winery vineyards were also established around this time.\nThe Paso Robles wine region gained more notoriety when Ignace Paderewski, the famous Polish statesman and concert pianist, visited Paso Robles, became enchanted with the area, and purchased 2,000 acres (8.1 km2). In the early 1920s, he planted Petite Sirah and Zinfandel on his Rancho San Ignacio vineyard in the Adelaide area. Following Prohibition, Paderewski's wine was made at York Mountain Winery. The wines produced from grapes grown on Rancho San Ignacio went on to become award-winners. Paso Robles\u2019 reputation as a premier wine region became firmly established as a result of this and later successes, and through to the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new generation of vineyard pioneers came forth and flourished in the Paso Robles area.\n\n\n=== San Simeon earthquake ===\n\nAt 11:15 am PST on December 22, 2003, the San Simeon earthquake struck about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Paso Robles. The earthquake registered 6.6 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). Two deaths occurred when the roof slid off the clock tower building, a popular landmark in downtown Paso Robles. The dormant underground springs that had once been used for the spa were brought back to life, causing flooding and a large sinkhole in the parking lot of the city hall and library. Due to lengthy environmental and engineering considerations, it took until December 2010 for the sinkhole to be filled and the parking lot resurfaced. Paso Robles has dedicated a new clock tower in memory of the two women who died.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPaso Robles is approximately halfway between the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco.\nThe topography of the area consists of gentle rolling hills on the eastern half of the city, and foothill peaks which rise in elevation to the Santa Lucia Coastal Range on the west, which are all blanketed in the Californian chaparral environment, which is mainly dry grassland and oak woodland.  Paso Robles sits on the eastern foothills of the Santa Lucia Coastal Mountain Range, which lies directly to the West of the city, and runs in a North-South direction, starting at Monterey, then runs down South to its terminus, in the San Luis Obispo area. The city is located at the southern end of the fertile Salinas River Valley, which is centered in between the Temblor Range (including the San Andreas Fault), which lie about 28 miles (45 km) to the East, and the Santa Lucia Coastal Range, which lie directly west, rising up from the city's western border. Paso Robles sits at the border where northern San Luis Obispo County and southern Monterey County meet, and is situated roughly 24 miles (39 km), or 20 minutes, inland from the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe Paso Robles area has two different climate types and classifications, as based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification (KCC) system, which are KCC type BSk, a semi-arid, dry, steppe-type climate, and KCC type Csb, which is the typical, coastal Californian & \"Mediterranean\" type.  The area receives a mixture of these two types of climates, but the primary climate is defined by long, hot, dry summers and brief, cool, rainy winters. Paso Robles enjoys long-lasting, mild autumns and occasional early springs, giving the region a unique climate suitable for growing a variety of crops (ranging from primarily grapes, to olives, to almonds and other tree nuts). The city receives an average annual rainfall of about 14.71 inches (374 mm) per year, and most of this precipitation falls during winter and early spring. Paso Robles often receives less than 10 inches (250 mm) of rain per year and typically, no rain falls from May through September. Summers in Paso Robles tend to be very hot, with daily temperatures frequently exceeding 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) from late June to as late as mid September, and occasionally exceeding 110 \u00b0F (43 \u00b0C). Paso Robles' summers feature an unusually large daytime-nighttime temperature swing, where there may be a profound temperature difference, as much as 50 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C), between the daytime highs and the overnight lows. Winters are often very cool and moist, with daytime temperatures reaching into the low 50s\u00b0F (10 \u00b0C). Mornings and nights differ from the daytime average, as they tend to very frigid (especially in December and January), where lows reach as low as 22 \u00b0F (\u22126 \u00b0C). Due to the somewhat close proximity to the Pacific Ocean, the marine layer occasionally makes it over the coast range and into Paso Robles, creating occasional fog. Unlike typical California coastal marine fog in areas such as San Francisco, this fog is never long lasting, and typically burns off before 10am.\nThe all-time record high temperature at the National Weather Service cooperative city office was 117 \u00b0F (47 \u00b0C) on August 13, 1933.  The record low temperature was 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) on January 6, 1913, making Paso Robles the lowest elevation in California to reach that low temperature.  There are an average of 81.0 days with high temperatures of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) or higher and an average of 64.0 days with low temperatures of 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C) or lower.  The 30-year average (1971\u20132000) annual precipitation is 15.17 inches (385 mm), falling on an average of 47 days.  The wettest year was 1941 with 29.19 inches (741 mm) of precipitation and the dryest year was 1947 with 4.24 inches (108 mm).  The most precipitation in one month was 14.76 inches (375 mm) in January 1916.  The most precipitation in 24 hours was 5.25 inches (133 mm) on December 6, 1966.  Although snow is rare in Paso Robles, 4.0 inches fell on April 5, 1929, and on December 15, 1988.At the Paso Robles FAA Airport, the record high temperature was 115 \u00b0F on June 15, 1961, and July 20, 1960.  The record low temperature was 8 \u00b0F (\u221213 \u00b0C) on December 22, 1990.  There are an average of 86.7 days with highs of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) or higher and an average of 53.6 days with lows of 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C) or lower. The 30-year average (1971\u20132000) annual precipitation was 12.57 inches (319 mm), falling on an average of 42 days. The wettest year was 1995 with 25.56 inches (649 mm) and the driest year was 2007 with 4.20 inches (107 mm). The most precipitation in one month was 12.19 inches (310 mm) in January 1969.  The most precipitation in 24 hours was 5.47 inches (139 mm) on March 10, 1995.  The record snowfall was 4.0 inches (100 mm) on December 15, 1988.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 Census ===\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Paso Robles had a population of 29,793.

The demographics are compiled by the Census Bureau using data and surveys collected from the ACS, Census Bureau Population Estimates Program Link, and the California State Department of Finance from years 2005\u20132007. Although these US Census Bureau statistics are Estimates, they have been proven to be incredibly accurate year after year with a very small margin of error. These updated figures, although not necessary, give a better, and more current, idea of statistics such as population percentages, income figures, racial and age makeup, etc.\nAs of the 2007 ACS Census Update, the city limits population was estimated at 27,868 people, 7,880 families within the city, and an average citizen age of 33.2 years old. The city limits population density was 1,504.2 people per square mile (29.18 km\u00b2), there were 11,218 total available housing units with 10,876 of them occupied (total households). The racial makeup of the city was 82.0% White, 2.8% Black or African American, 1.1% Native American, 2.0% Asian, 0.08% Pacific Islander, 12.1% from other races, and 3.5% from two or more races.

Males had a median income of $42,357 versus $29,311 for females. The per capita income for the city was $23,544. About 11.4% of families and 13.5% of the population as a whole were below the poverty line, including 18.2% of those under age 18 and 12.2% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Wine and vineyards ===\n\nThe Paso Robles Wine Country has a number of wineries and vineyards in the area. It is the location of the Paso Robles AVA (American Viticultural Area).  More than 25 different varieties of grapes are grown in the Paso Robles Wine Country and there are over 250 bonded wineries.\nIn 1993, Paso Robles grape growers, wineries and wine tasting rooms united to form the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance. This non-profit trade organization is dedicated to the promotion and education of the Paso Robles premium wine country.\nThe Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance is a cooperative marketing alliance made up of Paso Robles Wine Country wineries, vineyards and related businesses. They host many of the festivals in the Paso Robles Area, and strengthen brand awareness locally, regionally and nationally. The wine alliance focuses on trade and consumer outreach, media relations, buyer tours, educational and research programs and giving back to education and health organizations in the Paso Robles community.\n\n\n=== Sustainable building ===\nSeveral companies in the area specialize in straw-bale construction, insulating concrete forms, rammed earth, super insulated buildings, and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (L.E.E.D) construction.  Within a 15-mile (24 km) radius of downtown Paso Robles there are twelve straw bale homes, six insulated concrete homes, and several straw bale wineries/tasting rooms.\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\nEvery year in March, the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance hosts the Zinfandel Festival, during which Central Coast Zinfandel producers and the public visit the area to enjoy the wine of the area. This event is held by the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance, a non-profit cooperative marketing alliance looking to not only educate the community and surrounding communities about Paso Robles wine, but to also give back to the community.The Paso Robles Wine Festival takes place in May and an olive festival takes place yearly also. In October is the Harvest Wine Weekend, celebrating the wine harvest in the region. The Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance also host a Grand Tasting Tour, which takes the wines of the Paso Robles area to other areas in California, and other states such as Washington, D.C..On Memorial Day Weekend, Paso Robles hosts the Festival of the Arts in the downtown park.  With over 100 artists over three art-filled days, the festival of the arts is a multiday arts festival which is intended to honor and preserve the natural environment and character of the region through the arts.In August of each year, the Paso Robles Main Street Association presents the Olive Festival in the downtown park featuring free olive oil and olive product sampling from producers from all over California.\n\n\n== Government ==\nPaso Robles is a general law city; it does not have a city charter. It uses a council-manager form of government, directed by a five-member city council. The council consists of a mayor (elected at-large for a four-year term during non-presidential even-numbered years) and four council members (elected at-large for staggered four-year terms on even-numbered years (2+2)). The mayor has no veto power, but has a vote on the council. Prior to the mid-1990s, the mayor was rotated through the city council members on a yearly basis. Then it became a two-year general election post. In 2012, the voters voted to make the mayor a four-year post. The council appoints the city manager and city attorney, but the city clerk and city treasurer are elected officials.\n\n\n=== State and federal representation ===\nIn the California State Legislature, Paso Robles is in the  17th Senate District, represented by Democrat Bill Monning, and the  35th Assembly District, represented by Republican Jordan Cunningham.In the United States House of Representatives, Paso Robles is in California's  24th congressional district, represented by Democrat Salud Carbajal.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nPaso Robles is at the major crossroads of U.S. Highway 101 and State Highway 46, about halfway between Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area with direct access to the San Joaquin Valley and Interstate 5. Paso Robles is currently served by one freeway and two highways:\n\n U.S. Route 101 (US 101) is the most frequented and largest road-transportation arterial for the city of Paso Robles which serves as its north-south gateway. US 101 runs in a north-south direction and bisects the city (along with the Salinas River), into its western and eastern portions. Traveling northward from the city, US 101 heads to San Jose and San Francisco, and continues on along the coast up through Northern California and Oregon, and ends near Olympia in Washington state. Traveling southward from the city, US 101 heads to San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and on to its southern terminus in Los Angeles.\n State Route 46 (SR 46) is the main east-west arterial for the city of Paso Robles and serves as its eastern gateway from the San Joaquin Valley. SR 46 runs in an east-west direction except for a short portion in Paso Robles where it overlaps with US 101 for 3 miles (4.8 km). Traveling westward, SR 46 leaves the city and gradually climbs up and over the Santa Lucia Coastal Range, where it then quickly descends and meets the Pacific Ocean, just south of the coastal village of Cambria at its westernmost terminus at Highway 1, better known as the Pacific Coast Highway. Traveling eastward, SR 46 leaves the city and after traveling through rolling countryside for about 25 miles (40 km), it climbs up the Temblor Range and San Andreas Fault, then 25 miles (40 km) later, crosses Interstate 5 and continues on, later terminating at State Route 99, about 20 miles (32 km) north of Bakersfield and 90 miles (140 km) south of Fresno. In the future, SR 46 may be considered for a possible westward expansion of Interstate 40, via SR 58 from Barstow to Bakersfield, from Bakersfield to I-5 via Westside Parkway, along I-5 to SR 46, then following SR 46 to Paso Robles.\n State Route 229 is mainly an intra-county route that is used for traveling between the small rural towns in the eastern part of the county. SR 229 begins in Paso Robles as Creston Road, then 3 miles (4.8 km) east, as it leaves the city heading south-eastward, becomes simply SR 229 as it heads to the small rural town of Creston about 15 miles (24 km) southeast of Paso Robles. It then continues southward for 8 miles (13 km), where it ends at State Route 58, about 5 miles (8.0 km) east of the small town of Santa Margarita.\n\n\n=== Rail transportation ===\n\nAmtrak, the national passenger rail system, serves Paso Robles, operating its Coast Starlight daily in each direction between Seattle, Washington, and Los Angeles. Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner, which operates between San Diego and Paso Robles, connects by bus transfer from San Luis Obispo Railroad Station.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nPaso Robles Municipal Airport, a regional general aviation airport, is about 5 miles (8.0 km) northeast of downtown Paso Robles. Paso Robles Municipal does not offer scheduled passenger service. Scheduled passenger market is available at thebnearby San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport, 25 miles (40 km) to the south in San Luis Obispo. The Paso Robles airport has daily business aviation operations, in addition to serving as a large general aviation base. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) has an air attack base at the airport. There, aircraft are reloaded with fire fighting chemicals, which are dropped on brush and forest fires. The local Civil Air Patrol squadron also operates and trains on the airbase as part of the localized squadron 103, performing training craft operations known as O-Flights in a trainer craft that is brought to a desired altitude then dropped, essentially being towed by the aircraft, cadets of the Civil Air Patrol are the most of this demographic, but the cadets also help out congestion in the airport when it is busy during the operations. Also, the California Highway Patrol (CHP) houses a fixed-wing aircraft, used for speed enforcement, and a helicopter, used for search and rescue. The area immediately surrounding the Paso Robles Airport, known as Airport Road Industrial Park, is also home to many aviation maintenance providers and facilities, as well as home to many aviation parts manufacturers and other related businesses. LaGuardia's Italian Deli is the only restaurant on the field, and is located in the terminal building.  The deli opened in November 2012.\nThe Paso Robles Airport hosts the Northern California Regional Aerobatic Contest which is held annually in mid-June.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe Paso Robles Public Schools District contains six elementary schools, two middle schools, three high schools, and four other miscellaneous school sites and programs.\n\n\n=== Elementary and middle schools ===\n\nBauer\u2013Speck Elementary (K\u20135)\nGeorgia Brown Elementary (Dual language immersion campus) (K\u20135)\nKermit King Elementary (K\u20135)\nPat Butler Elementary (K\u20135)\nVirginia Peterson Elementary (K\u20135)\nWinifred Pifer Elementary (K\u20135)\nGeorge Flamson Middle School (6\u20138)\nDaniel Lewis Middle School (6\u20138)\nSaint Rose of Lima School (Pres.\u20138)\nTrinity Lutheran School (Pres.\u20138)\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nPaso Robles High School\nLiberty High School\nIndependence High School\n\n\n=== Colleges and adult education ===\nCuesta College\nPaso Robles Adult School\nPR Culinary Arts Academy\nUniversity of Phoenix Satellite Office\n\n\n== Media ==\nLocal newspapers include Paso Robles Daily News and Paso Robles Press.Radio stations serving the area include KPRL-AM/1230.\n\n\n== Sports and recreation ==\nPaso Robles offers its residents and visitors cycling, golfing, tennis and swimming.

Since 2008, Paso Robles hosts the annual Wine Vine Run, a half marathon  and 5k foot race to benefit Paso Robles High School youth sports programs.Lake Nacimiento is an 18-mile (29 km)-long lake located about 13 miles (21 km) north-west of the city up in the Santa Lucia Range. Although Lake Nacimiento is not actually located within the city of Paso Robles itself, it is however in what is considered the Greater Paso Robles Area. \"The Lake\", as it is known to locals, shares the 93446 zip code with Paso Robles, due to its proximity to the city. The lake provides ample room for waterskiing, wakeboarding, jetskiing, and other water-related activities, in addition to fishing and swimming.\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\nLocated just off of Highway 46 East at Union Road is the 42-acre (170,000 m2) Barney Schwartz Park. The park has baseball, softball and soccer facilities, as well as lake access, picnicking, event pavilions, picnicking and playgrounds. Centennial Park is located in the eastern section of Paso Robles. Besides being the home of all indoor community sports (basketball, volleyball and gymnastics) and many different classes and activities, the 17-acre (69,000 m2) Centennial Park contains a 200,000-gallon swimming pool and wading pool with waterslides, group barbecue areas, grassy picnic and pavilion areas, an amphitheater, walking paths, two outdoor half-court basketball courts, five pickleball courts, four tennis courts, a 1.2-mile-long (1.9 km) paved trail, four lighted tennis courts and two playgrounds.\nThe land upon which City Park sits was donated by the town's founders, James and Blackburn, for the specific use of a public park. Located in the heart of downtown, the 5-acre (20,000 m2) park provides easy access to the downtown area's amenities. Holiday and festival events are often held at this park, including holidays such as the 4th of July. City Park hosts \u201cConcerts in the Park\u201d, Trading Day, bi-weekly farmers markets, the Wine Festival, the Olive Festival, the Festival of the Arts, and several car shows.\nSherwood Park is located on the upper south-east side of town and is used mostly for youth sports. The Little League field was completely redone in April 2002. In addition to the renovated Little League Field, Sherwood Park has one basketball court, horseshoe pits, a sand volleyball court, barbecue areas, three soccer fields, a softball field, and tennis courts.

          "I always bring my friends from out of state to this place when they come and visit since its a wonderful historic site",
          "We loved the Old Missions. The history was interesting. They were not easy to find, the information office was not open at all (even though if was posted online and on the door as being open those times). We got directions from one of the mission workers at Ysleta. We enjoyed",
          "Be sure to make sure to see these free attractions outside of El Paso. Beautiful and historic missions and garrisons are amazing.",
          "These are some of the oldest locations in the US. These missions were started before the English colonists ever made their way to the east coast. The oldest road in the US is located at San Elizario. All of the churches are located in small towns close to the border with a",

          "The little church was sweet to visit because it was very close to where we needed to be. Otherwise I would not make a special trip for this event. Very small gift shop directly inside the mission. Ladies not very friendly. I like to visit churches when I have the chance so I",
          "Went to all three sites (Ysleta and Socorro Missions and San Elizario Presidio chapel) - all within a 10 mile stretch. Each is unique, pretty, and appreciably rustic. None are completely original due to floods, fires and wear and tear, but they are beautiful and peaceful. Easy",

          "Most mission trails are very interesting, but they are always a bit crude (when compared to other significant churches built in other parts of the world at the same time frame) and most have had significant \"restoration\" work done to preserve them--altering them in many cases.",

          "We only went to La Mission de San Antonio de la Ysleta de Sur. The gate guard was most kind and allowed us to park inside the compound area on a Friday afternoon. No one was at the mission but the doors were open so we respectfully went in and just took in the history and",

          "This is an interesting and educational. There is a calmness and peace here. We have visited often and love it every time.",
          "I also take my visitors on a trip on the Mission trail. The missions in Ysleta, Socorro and San Elizario are excellent examples of old Southwest architects. There is a great little gift shop in the Socorro mission and some wonderful art galleries and shops in San Elizario.",
          "Take the time to go to all three missions as as well as the San Elizario historic district (with a walking tour.) Nicely kept and cared for. Gives a real historic sense of place and culture. On your way back stop at the Tortilla Factory and have a fresh tortilla.",
          "The missions are beautiful and part of a wonderful culture, please visit each one and do a bit of research on their history.",
          "Not sure, but this may be the second oldest settlement in the entire United States (after St Augustine, Florida). Not too exciting, but there is a casino next door and it is practically walking distance to Mexico.",
          "We tried to do the trail while in El Paso the week before Xmas. Unfortunately two of the three churches were closed and we could only visit one. It would probably have been a worthwhile attraction if they all been open. It might be good to call the mission trail office to",
          "This is a beautiful experience for the entire family to learn about the history of The conquistadors and settlers of the area. It also has some breath taking Missions that you must see.Make sure you take drinks with you if in the summer it get hot in El Paso. There are great",
          "If you would love to see El Paso off the expressway then check out the mission trail. It will take you from the east to the west side of the city through the streets. Not for everyone but interesting trip",
          "When you visit these missions, look at the architecture that was done back when they were built. Thick adobe walls and wooden ceiling beams. The beams have very nice designs painted on them. I have been in these missions during 100+ summer heat. You do not feel the heat because",
          "Tour companies rush you to see 3 missions. Not quaint. One was under under construction and you could not go in.",
          "Very bad. Total waste of time. Very little information, very hot. Even took us to one that was closed for renovation.",
          "There are three main missions on this trail and they are beautiful during the Posada in December. This is a reenactment of Mary and Joseph's return to Bethlehem. The entire mission trail is lined with luminarias. This event is very photogenic and the local communities come",
          "We drive the 9 mile trail to see the missions. We did it in about 30 minutes as we were low on time. They are all amazing to look at.",
          "The mission are a good place to get some history and quietly reflect on what this use to be like. We went to several end enjoyed each one.",
          "We followed the mission trail and it was enjoyable afternoon. The Ysleta mission was being renovated so we were not able to go inside. The other two were very pretty. We had been to the missions in San Antonio so we had some background. There is not very much information",
          "Please don't miss going to see the beautiful pieces of history!! We followed the trail and visited all three of the missions. While the Ysleta mission was being renovated and we were unable to view inside, the outside of the mission is very beautiful. Socorro and San Elizario",
          "We spent time talking to people at each of the missions. Some of them had glorious stories to tell; some were descendants of people who had actually been at the missions, or walked the trail, etc.",
          "Beautiful churches. We were able to see only 2 missions (Socorro and San Elizario) as Ysleta of them was under reconstruction. The altars are beautiful. The ceiling is all wood. A lot of history. They both have a grotto outside each church.",
          "Anyone who comes to El Paso to visit or has just moved should visit all three missions. They are a great historical part of the city and it's unfortunate that many students have never been taken and don't know and appreciate how important they are to the area.",
          "we left El Paso and stopped at Ysleta Mission, but it was closed for renovations till May 2016. We missed the Socorro Mission, but stopped at San Elisario Mission. There is a long history reaching back to 1680. The building is still active as a parish and beautiful inside.",
          "The missions are close to each other, not in the best part of town, but no worries. Check to see if they are open on any particular day",
          "Beautiful old missions well preserve, a lot of history, please visit the museum at the Mission San Elizario, the person who was there attending the desk was very friendly and informative. Please take the time to visit each mission: Ysleta, Soccoro and San Elizario Presidio",

          "I had planned on finishing viewing the missions this Xmas visit to my hometown..I took the Special County Bus #50 to get here..as I often take public transportation on trips when I can..I got a special bracelet for only 5 bucks..First stop was Socorro Mission..I took a quick",
          "My mom wanted to tour the missions so I drove her expecting to be bored after the first one. Instead I was pleasantly surprised that each had a interesting story behind it as well as some amazing architecture. Well worth the drive and time spent.",
          "We saw three missions on this nine-mile trail to the past. Note that it begins about six miles from the highway and then skirts along the border, through the pueblo, residences and businesses. The missions themselves are wonderful, but I did have to encourage my husband we",
          "My husband & I, my sister and her two kids, spent a few hours meandering along this off-the-beaten-path El Paso Mission Trail on a Sunday afternoon. It is a self-guided tour by car that stretches over 9 miles in El Paso, TX. The area is safe; we never felt any concern for",
          "From the oldest missions in Texas (est. 1682) to a jail Billy the Kid broke a friend out of, there's quite a bit to see along this route. A little difficult to find each church without a good map or GPS, though.",
          "We rented a car at the airport and were inspired to take this drive after reading about it at the scenic overlook. The drive getting to the mission seemed to be filled with used car lots but once we made it to the missions it was worth it. Because we were traveling later in the",
          "Not nearly the sophistication of the California missions or the finances to develop them into the Golden States tourist attractions, in many ways these are more authentic and original.",
          "Traveled after 5 p.m. And so did not get to go inside but loved seeing the old missions especially Socorro mission as some of the surrounding pueblo was still there and much gas been restored into shops and a memorial to our veterans. The adjacent cemetery was open and very",
          "we went the whole trail the missions were absolutly beautiful.a welot of history to unravel.we took this tour in the fall wasnt as hot.we took this trip about ten years ago.",
          "We did manage to find a place to park and get inside to oldest Mission in Texas. The mission is located just off a main street on the East side of El Paso. Our local guide and friend doubted we would be able to get a parking spot to visit, but we were fortunate not only to",
          "Prepare to drive. The missions themselves are interesting but the distances are spread out and time consuming. I also found there was a lack of historical information at some of the Missions. San Elizario was my favorite and there was a little museum across the street.",
          "Had good trip first one closed and last one missed but main one was lovely, show around b great lady and Suso saw the new chapel and copy of Michael A",

          "Having grown up in San Antonio, I'm no stranger to Texas Missions. But I've never been to a Mission during broad daylight when the sanctuary was closed. I'm not sure if they've had problems in the past, but it was sad not to have been able to take a peek inside and had the",
          "We may have just been lucky but when we arrived there was a volunteer available that sat with us and gave us a fantastic history of all of the missions in the area. The gift shop is also worth your time to visit and had many unique items we have never seen and yes we purchased",
          "Overall very good because of poor signage on the road (I strayed off the Trail twice), indifferent staff and a confusing map that suggests the three churches are in closer proximity than they are. However it is worth the inconvenience if you are interested in the local history",
          "This was a self-guided auto tour- and it was worth the time. The missions were beautiful and the history was very interesting. Follow the brown Mission Trail signs and they will take you to the missions easily. Socorro Mission has up signs that parking is for the church only-",
          "Start in San Elizario and work your way west. Check times and call ahead to make sure the mission churches are open. Some of the missions are not wheelchair accessible. You can get into the building but not down to the altar.",
          "We visited the three Mission churches and loved how rich in history they were. It is a wonderful way to spend the day. The churches are beautiful.",
          "Did a small group tour of the three Churches on the Mission Trail with a speaker supplied by the Mission preservation group. She was full of information about the history of the Missions and the area. One of the churches was busy so did not get to see inside.",

          "If you have any interest in the history of the American West, this is a must-see. I stumbled on this mission by accident. I walked in and was greeted by a group of very friendly ladies, one of which gave me a quick tour of the church. It's a beautiful place and it helps tell",
          "We drove along the trail but only had time to go inside the old Socorro mission as the Ysleta and Elizario missions were having masses and we did not want to disturb. The Socorro mission is very nice inside; they had the Christmas tree nicely decorated inside when we were",

          "We like to look at churches and these were ones of historical significance. Unfortunately one was closed and the other two were unavailable to visit. We like the history, but would have liked to have visited them. They are off the main stream, so you have to make an effort to",

          "I expected a little more from the Mission Trail based on the brochure I found in my hotel that mentioned interesting local shops and good food. The missions themselves were pretty and have an interesting history. If there are no services taking place, you can see the interiors",
          "The missions on the trail are small, far apart, and can be difficult to find. I've enjoyed missions elsewhere, but these seemed somewhat uninspiring. The history behind these missions displayed on the signs outside tell a pretty generic story. I'd recommend passing on these",
          "We live in El Paso and were looking for something interesting to do close to home. I was happy to find The Mission Trail right here. I love visiting historical sites and these missions were impressive. We were able to visit all three sites. They were spread out quite a ways in",
          "EEven if your not really into doing this kind of activity I think this drive is worth doing.. You will be off the main drag and into the scenic route and poking about places you would not normally see. The Missions themselves are beautiful and interesting. A lovely way to spend",
          "Amazing how the city started out along the mission trail and three missions still exist with larger churches beside them, still active. The trail is along the Mexican border with interesting homes along the way. The trail is well marked and fun to drive",
          "We drove the \"Mission Trail\" and visited all three missions. The San Elceario Prisidio Chapel in San Elizario was originally a military post established in 1684. The original chapel was destroyed by the flooding Rio Grande in 1829 and rebuilt in 1850. Mission Socorro was",

          "Not too many people will go out of their way to find the churches on the mission trail when they come to El Paso. This is a large city and this kind of sightseeing does not have the woe factor ,but as you visit the churches and start to snap pictures , your camera will capture",
          "El Paso's mission trail is not as well organized as the larger one in San Antonio. I saw two out of the three (Socorro and San Elizario). Road between the two is not scenic. Hours of entrance are erratic. I basically just lucked out that someone was there at both missions. The",
          "Good to see historical sites that have been in the area since the late 1600's. Ysleta Mission was open and took a look inside the church, adobe walls which kept it cool as compared to the outside temperature.",
          "Only 1 of the 3 Churches was open at the time of my visit - Ysleta. A beautiful Church claiming to form the oldest community in Texas. The Mission Trail seems to be neglected by the people of El Paso - why? This is a great American site with few visitors which is very sad. The",
          "Great to see the different missions and history! You can stop in one of the multiple road restaurants via the missions.",
          "I had a few hours to kill on a recent trip to El Paso. After a quick search of things to do, I settled on taking a trip to the Ysleta Mission, about 15 minutes drive east of the El Paso Airport. The mission site has been active since 1680 and Ysleta claims to be the oldest",
          "These missions are still alive-- services are currently held in these churches. The members are careful to keep renovations authentic. There are lots of history in museums, plazas, art galleries, and even a jail around the missions. We were able to watch native dancers in",
          "I particularly enjoyed Mission Ysleta, which was built in the late 17th century, and claims to have the oldest continuously cultivated plot of land in the USA. It is a very active church and well kept, and easily found, about a half-hour from downtown El Paso.",
          "Loved the mission trail excursion. Took the tour which included a fantastic lunch and visits to three missions and two art galleries. A wonderful day experience we will always remember.",
          "The El Paso mission trail is a group of old mission churches concentrated in the far South East of El Paso. The churches are all in splendid repair. It is sort of hard to wrap your head around how old they actually are! You should call ahead if you want to go inside the",
          "Driving the Mission Trail in El Paso leads you to a part of old El Paso, that one wouldn't normally see. A couple of the churches are in a native American reservation. The churches are beautiful and out of the 3 churches, 2 were open, allowing us to marvel at the lovely",
          "I grew up in the Lower Valley, my Dad was the Justice of the Peace in Ysleta. His office was right behind the Ysleta Mission. I was in awe of the beautiful mission, when I went there, it was so very peaceful and endearing to me. We also went to the Sorcorro and San Elizario",
          "We enjoyed viewing the missions from the outside but it was Sunday morning and we didn't want to intrude on the worshippers. We saw many cars with Mexican license plates, guess the families travel over the border to visit. The missions were very serene and peaceful. We saw",
          "Only in the beautiful lower valley of El Paso, Texas can you visit this Mission Trail. The Ysleta mission is first and Speaking Rock is next door. Eat fajitas. Then the Socorro Mission followed by the San Elizario Mission. Billy the Kid escaped from the jail to your left. This",
          "May not be the kind of thing everybody enjoys but it was quite pleasant and on a 100+ degree day you could feel the Tiqua Indian/Mexica/Spanish/Texan cultures come alive.",

          "The Missions in Ysleta, Socorro, and the Chapel in San Elizario are all very old and all adobe. Built my the natives and Spanish Priests before this part of the world was in the U.S. One might also want to check out the church in Clint. It's also adobe and also old, just not",
          "Gorgeous architecture, even for the non-religious! These churches are a must see!",
          "The greatest mission is actually across the river, in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, easily accessible by foot over Puente Santa Fe from downtown El PasoTX. Or you can go by motorcar, but congestion & parking might be a problem, as is some of the violence. I'm ashamed to admit that it",
          "We had a little time to kill before catching a flight out of El Paso, so on the spur of the moment, we went to visit the two closest missions, Ysleta and Socorro. We were happy to find good street signage pointing the way and had no trouble finding them. Both buildings were",

        "wiki": "Wet N' Wild Waterworld is a 60 acre waterpark featuring over 25 rides and attractions and a canopy of mature shade trees. It is located at 8804 S. Desert in Anthony, Texas, a small town in between El Paso, Texas, and Las Cruces, New Mexico.\n\n\n== Park ==\nThe park usually opens the first weekend in May, and closes after Labor Day. It has over twenty-five rides and attractions. In addition to traditional water rides, the park has a wave pool, a lazy river, shallow kiddie pools, a spray park, and a climbing wall. Amenities include shaded picnic areas with tables, a restaurant, air conditioned VIP Suites for parties, cabana rentals, locker rentals, grill rentals, inner tube rentals, and reserved parking. The mix of attractions, from thrill rides to a spray park for toddlers, is meant to appeal to all age groups with a focus on families. Wet 'N' wild offers free life jackets to kids at the park.\nGuest can bring their own food and beverages and are not charged a cooler fee. The park does feature a restaurant called The Ribbit Cafe, which offers traditional waterpark fare, such as burgers, fries, nachos, snow cones and funnel cakes, as well as regional specialties, including corn-in-a-cup, papas locas, pi\u00f1a con chamoy, and aguas frescas.\nWet \u2018N\u2019 Wild Waterworld is  the site of numerous festivals and concerts performed in a raised stage in the middle of the open picnic area. Private sleep-overs, birthday parties, company picnics, and reserved areas can be arranged for groups.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe park opened in 1979 after El Paso businessman and attorney Berry H. Edwards purchased a KOA campground in Anthony. After his son suggested they get a waterslide for the campground's pool, Edwards visited the now closed Wild Wild Wet in Anaheim, California for research. He then installed two Plantation Plastics waterslides (powered by a Chrysler diesel engine connected to a water pump). The park opened as Wet N Wild Waterslides, charging $2.50 per half hour to ride 2 slides, \"Blue Streak' and \"Corkscrew.\" In 1980, after adding the 12 foot deep Volcano Lake, a water zip line, and a few more in-house slides, Edwards changed the name to Wet N Wild Waterworld.\n\n\n== Community Outreach ==\nSince 2011, Wet 'N' Wild has also been host to the Christian Castle Lifeguard Olympics, which celebrates local lifeguards while allowing them to fine tune their skills. In 2015, Wet N Wild was awarded Best Of Aquatics 2015 for Community Outreach by Aquatics International Magazine  for its efforts in drowning prevention and water safety. The park also participates annually in the World's Largest Swimming Lesson  an event dedicated to raising awareness of water safety. During Drowning Prevention Week, the park sends Freddy the Surfing Frog to local schools to give lessons in water safety and drowning prevention.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of waterparks\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWet N' Wild Waterworld",

          "This place would be great with only 1/3 the amount of people that they let in. There is a lot of extra space around the edges of the park, so I think they feel as if they can let in a lot more people than there is room for in the actual attractions and rides. There were so",
          "We went as a family outing, but it was SO CROWDED. We have only gone a handful of times but every time we go it is hard to enjoy anything because of the amount of people.",
          "This was probably my 7th visit to Wet N Wild over the past 20 years and it did not disappoint. The good: Shade trees; no lines from 11 to 12:30; happy, easy-going families, young adults, and teens; lots of staff; nice variety of rides. The bad: Food variety, old facilities,",
          "It's an old park, but very friendly. Lots of pools, slides, lazy river etc. for all ages. The defining feature to us was the huge amount (more than 200) of picnic tables and bbq grills all under the shade of mature trees. Also they encourage you to bring your own food to cook",
          "During our vacation back home we decided to go back to Wet n'Wild because we hadn't been there since we were kids. This place really has grown and for the better. This place has a little bit for everyone.",
          "Im going straight to the point....i been to alot of water parks.....alot. And this one, wet n wild waterworld in anthony texas, is the worst i been too. Rides are old...slow......rusty.,,dirty water....TERRIBLE..if you live in surrounding areas....go.to denver",
          "This by far the worst water park we have ever been they should destroy this park and rebuild a hole lot better water park it sad u have traveled to other parts of the US to go to a awesome water park",
          "You can't tell me this place adheres to any safety regulations! It felt like a third world country water park. The place is overcrowded, hundreds of grills on top of each other, high flames, sigarettes everywhere, beercans and drunk people. Nasty water, no rules for anyone. God",
          "A bit pricey and long waits for rides. But overall a whole lot of fun! You definitely have more than enough time during the day to enjoy all the rides! But fair warning to all you giants out there you will flip in your inter-tubes at the end of each ride!",
          "Overall we had a good time. There are plenty of tables to choose. Only gripe are the tubes. You must rent one they only have like 3 non rental tubes for each ride. Why not just have tubes for everyone? Why nickel and dime",
          "We arrived as soon as they opened at 10 am on labor day and people were just beginning to show up.The first 2 hours were pretty pleasant with short lines to the various slides which range from mild to crazy.My 6 year old son enjoyed them all but their were a couple of slides",
          "Every year we get to go to Wet n Wild Anthony area for a company picnic. On summer weekends this place is mayhem - including waiting lines to go into the \"wave pool\"... Which is the attraction with the largest capacity. Flooring is uneven throughout the place, so I do recommend",
          "Because of my husband's job, we were able to get half price tickets to Wet 'n Wild, or else after reading these reviews, I probably wouldn't have gone. We went on a Tuesday afternoon, which was nice and quiet. There weren't very long rides for any of the attractions, and there",
          "Was an OK day the park is very worn and was pretty mad you have to pay $2 for parking on a dirt lot? Felt weird that alcohol was allowed especially because there are young children and families around seemed trashy watching people come in with an 18 pack while I was with my 2",
          "I'm literally sitting in the park now. It's old and worn. The water level on many of the rides is too low, so it makes it difficult not to get stuck. Not many rules, which is good because they don't enforce them anyway. Lots of families barbecuing which is fine. I love that we",
          "There aren't any waterparks whatsoever around or in El Paso so this is definitely a decent place to visit on a hot summer day. It may not be the best waterpark but it's nice.",
          "Unfortunately I bought tickets for this place before reading reviews....the negative reviews are spot on! First we get charged for parking on a non paved parking lot. (Can the income pay for pavement upgrades?) THEN, we get charged to rent tubes to ride slides?? I can",
          "We thought going to the waterpark would be a great family activity, and we were wrong. This place is more like a cookout area with some water placed around it. There are not many pools or slides available for children or anyone to use. Tubes must be rented, which I think is",
          "I find it comical that Wet N Wild has responses to almost all the negative comments here. Your excuses do not work. You can also add me to the list of negative experiences at Wet N Wild. Many of us are locals and we KNOW how long you have been in existence. However, clean it",
          "Old nasty water park.. The water smells like urine and the restrooms are filthy. I felt like I was going to to get an infection",
          "I just would like to add that like so many other visitors we also had a negative experience. My sister came into town to visit and we decided to take our 9 yr old boys to this wet n wild waterpark. So our boys were so excited, looking forward to going on rides. We rented out",
          "Yikes. What a chunk out of my wallet. Even with discount tickets purchased online, ended up being a$60 day for two. Don't believe that you don't necessarily need to rent your own tube. If you don't, you will wait FOREVER for a free one. Each slide had only a few free ones",
          "Just leaving this place after all the fun. If you rent an inner-tube and the thugs that frequent the place take it, because you can't take it in some rides, you are screwed. The water was dirty with trash in the lazy river and the rides/slides were falling apart. Go to this",
          "Wet n' Wild Waterworld is a pretty nice park considering where it is located in El Paso, Texas. It is not like the Schliterbahn that is located in San Antonio but for the location it is pretty nice. It is a decent water park but like any water park there is always a better one",
          "Unfortunately in NM the waterparks are virtually non-existent. There is one in a hotel in ABQ but that is hardly a waterpark. You either need to go to Amarillo, Denver, or Anthony. My choice? Anthony. I heard some people describe the place as ghetto, but my family and friends",
          "If you are expecting a polished, pristine, place this may not be for you. This water park is interesting in that is very homey. There are concrete slabs and dirt with patches of grass and trees..(this is the park area.) There are areas that are paved closer to the slides and",
          "It's not the best Wet N Wild I've ever been to but it's a decent water park. It's close to El Paso and Las Cruces so if you are ever in these areas, it would be a decent place to visit, at least once. Only issue I really had is the wave pool is anything but. Overall it's a",
          "If you want a cleaner, more fun time, go swim in your neighbor's toilet. This place is down right disgusting. From floating used diapers, to non-existent clorine, to local gangs using it as a hangout...you make the call. I've been here twice, once for a family day-trip",
          "I love this place we go at least once a year and it never has failed us.the customer service is great there's always staff walking around to see if you need help with the grills and stuff. You can literally spend a whole day there with the fam and the kids have so much fun there",
          "Wet n' Wild Waterworld is fun, but needs some new attractions. The park has the same attractions since I was a child.",
          "First off they charge for parking. Beware! The parking lot is unpaved, there are potholes and huge rocks everywhere. Also, they park you so close it is hard to get out of your car comfortably. The park itself was alright. It was a bit outdated and requires some TLC. It's a major",
          "This was our first visit and will not be the last. Visited on a Saturday afternoon, stayed until closing with the grandchildren ages 4, 7, and 10. We all enjoyed it, there is water fun for all ages. This is a good and affordable place to go , you can take your food, grill, ice",
          "one splash in any pool or ride and its all good. small enough to let the kids go wild and big spacious not to feel crowded. Even when we cant find a table we make do and have a great time.",
          "Total rip off. They even charge for parking in an unpaved parking lot. Bathrooms are nasty and dirty. The place is very old and needs an upgrade. I-10 traffic is visible. I have been to water parks that ae so much better at the same cost or less.",
          "A very disappointing water park for the large area and warm temperatures. It only has a few slides, wading/tide pool and lazy river. Prices are overpriced for what it offers. A huge fail! But for families with kids it could be a costly way to beat the heat.",
          "Whoooooo I work here it's awesome!!!! The chile cheese fries are amazing and everyone is friendly. Plus when it is super hot especially out here during this time it's the best place to be!!!",

          "This place is and looks old!! Old rides Old paths Dirty Its a pool bar! Not much a family place People getting drunk next to a family with kids babies. not much a good idea right!? I can cross to Mexico and go to Anitas Much better Cleaner And way cheaper $8 adults $5 kids",
          "Great little family place to take the kids for the day. Pack your own food, and drinks to save money. Enjoy the water slides.",
          "My family and i went this past summer and it was really fun! We got a great spot near the stage where they had live music and even a clown show. While we were there, we realized we had forgotten some items but dreaded leaving the park and coming back, so we were lucky to find",
          "You can bring your own food and booze which is great. You can rent lockers but they are small and most do not fit a cooler. Everything is dirty, like gross dirty. The water is brown and smells like sewer. The wave pool is a joke and doesnt even create waves. Bathrooms are not",
          "I bought 3 seasons passes this past summer. Went 3 times. My son had blast but he is only 5. I did not like the fact you can bring all the alchohol you want. I saw many families there drinking. The park is old and the rides look old. The parking lot is uncomfortable. Bring",
          "This was our second venture to Wet N Wild Waterworld. I must admit, it is a pretty nice getaway, for about 4 hours. Don't let any ads fool you-it's pretty rinky dink. The paint is chipping, cracks in the concrete and pools, worn down slides, overly used tubes, sun bleached",
          "Water not clear. Should have cooling misters. Food at snack bars not appetizing. Garbage cans not emptied frequently. Bathrooms should be attended to more frequently.",
          "So much fun. You can bring in your own food, drinks, and even a gas grill. No glass is allowed, but the savings in food cost is great. You can ride from slow and relaxing to hold on for dear life. Plenty of shade everywhere. Best bet for pricing is a large group. 15 and over",
          "We took the granddaughter and there are discount tickets at the Pik-Quik in Las Cruces that are worth the drive. Making it $13 each for the whole day. lazy river was nice for the oldsters..",

          "I just went to wet n wild on sunday July 1st. I read a lot of reviews where people were saying the water was dirty and a bunch of other nonsense. I was expecting it to be dirty but when I got there the water was crystal clear. There are so many trees and so a lot of shade you",
          "absolutely no maintenance done on this place....more run down each and every year....last year was the last time I will spend another dime there as it officially is not ever worth the cheap price of admittance. We actually went opening day last year and everything was dirty",
          "This place was horrible. It was very dirty and run down. You can tell that they put none of the overpriced ticket fees back into the water park!!! The water was very dirty and I really do not think that there was any kind of chlorine in the water GROSS!!! The water slides were",
          "Small, always over crowded with kids. Would be better if they expanded.",

          "My family and I love to come here in the summer. Just stay away on the weekends as it gets ridiculously crowded.",

          "I visit Wet N Wild every summer and this year the whole staff spoke nothing but spanish and the whole park was filthy. The river they have to float throughout the park looks diseased. I was highly unsatisfied with the park this year.",
          "My husband and I went to this park on an army trip we had to make to El Paso and could not have chosen a better attraction to visit for the day! We spent almost 5 hours at this park and LOVED every minute of it!!!! The rides were incredible, well made, and safe. Lots of",

          "For the past 4 years I\u2019ve been getting season tickets for my family and a few of my daughters friends. This year they have ignorantly added a $10 fee to reserve a table. I refused to pay it and found a little grassy area to put our stuff. \u2026",
          "Great place, Great time. I recommend buying your tickets ahead of time and renting a cabana. Rides were fun, restrooms were clean. CDC guidelines were being followed by all employees.",

          "This is a great place for family fun but watch out husbands. I hadn't been there 10 minutes and i was waiting in line to get in the lazy river with the family and i was already getting looks from my wife by just waiting behind these two mothers.",

          "What a great experience coming from NC to EL Paso spending time with my family thumbs up",
          "Its decent. Lack of anything to buy inside is kinda frustrating. They made my wife take her glassed off to go down rides and she's blind. Otherwise the price and time is well spent.",
          "For $25.00 a person (or less depending on promotions available) you can spend the entire day until 6pm playing in the water, the wave pool, on the various slides and my favorite floating in the lazy River. There are lots free picnic tables \u2026",
          "I love the new cabanas you can rent. They're SO inviting! \n\nMy family and I love this lovely water park. The water park caters to people of all ages.\n\nYou can rent your own grill and find a picnic table just about anywhere. The restrooms \u2026",
          "Great place. I rented the Cabana. But it also had plenty of picnic tables under largely shaded tree areas. I will just get the picnic tables next time when it's just my own hubby and family. We went during the week day so it wasn't packed \u2026",

          "Great place for summer fun with the kids. Season passes are totally worth it. The slides are fun, and there's plenty to do. The only thing I'd say needs drastic improvement is the wave pool. I remember as a kid going to Texas Water Rampage \u2026",
          "My family and I have always enjoyed coming here. We've been doing it for years. We weren't able to make last year so we were looking forward to this time before summer was over. We ALWAYS come on a Tuesday or Wednesday because the lines are \u2026",

          "Great place for the family of all ages. The rides are awesome and lines disipate quickly.",

Some slides people would get hurt but other than that,it was a really nice experience",

          "I am not a huge water park person, however we decided to check it out with friends for the kids. The kids LOVED it, the place is clean, the rides are enjoyable and you can bring your own food in which is amazing. Season passes are very reasonable and you can spend a few hours or a whole day here and feel justified in your cost.",
          "Excellent place to spend time with the kids. The rides aren't cracy tall and pretty much all can enjoy. What I love about this place is quantity of benches and shade available, there is no place in the whole park where there are no trees.",
          "I love this place so much! It is full of people, but the lines are fast and the staff is very nice. It is fun to go and it is very big so don\u2019t get lost!",
          "The Place has potential. Sadly the Park hasn't been unattended! The Water Sliders have so much Rust. The Tables look like 40 years old. The place needs better land scapping. With the price they charge they need to really bring it back and make it more pleasant to look at and to interact with the park",
          "The picnic, BBQ areas were tree covered; lots of shade, plenty of tables and benches. Great place to spend the whole day! I met two buddies from work and their families there. I'm an older person, meaning over 64, and had a blast!!! I loved \u2026",
          "Had so much family fun here at the park!! Awesome park and water slides! The new slides are exciting",
          "I love wet n wild. The only thing I would like to see change is them getting security. We pay a lot for season passes. Today I found a crack pipe in the parking lot. I really don't care what people do but it's not safe for a kid. Last week someone was smoking weed at the park. It's supposed to be a family place.\u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\ude21",

          "Great day of fun. I love that you can bring your own food and drinks. The water was freezing, but on a hot day that's a good thing. Plenty of shade for when you're not in the water.",

          "This guys improve every year. They have fixed part of the parking. New water rides. Better restrooms. 2 dlls for parking, not bad. Remember to bring only cans not glass. Yes you can bring beers and any food.",
          "This place needs serious updating! Bathrooms are sickening. Everyone blasts loud, annoying music and gets drunk supervising young children! May I suggest installing music that plays throughout the park, so as to not have 2,000 different \u2026",
          "Always a good time! There was plenty of room for us to picnic and play. It was busy but that goes for any theme park. I'd absolutely recommend the trip.",
          "Awesome family and company gathering place if you reserve a party area. They have someone check on you conveniently.",
          "Had a great time with the family. Pro tip bring water shoes or sandles. Walking between rides can really burn the bottom of your feet. Renting a cabana is worth the cost!",
          "The new family ride is AWESOME!!!! HAD SO MUCH FUN.. it better going on the weekdays since you get to ride all of the rides with no line.",
          "Great time. Slides were out of order for a good part of the day on the side our cabana was on but it was an enjoyable experience",
          "VERY fun and can spend quality fun family time",
          "always have a great time here.",
          "Very fun. Kids had a blast. We will be better prepared next time. Cabana was a bit pricey.",
          "Hands down worst water park we have ever been to.  Employees were useless and rude.  Did not greet us upon entering because they were busy eating and had to clean their hands off before they checked our bags.  The bathrooms were disgusting. \u2026",
          "Kids, water, on a Wednesday.  Crowd not so big and really ride all the rides.  A blast!  They didn't want to stop.",
          "Really hyped up place, it\u2019s pretty cool it has fun rides. I guess it\u2019s alright, review coming from a Florida guy so I\u2019ve definitely seen better water parks.",
          "Fun for the kids and adults alike it began to sprinkle and they kicked us off the rides most people began leaving at that point. Still was fun and would do it again",
          "Was great until someone stole our tubes. Looked away for 1 min and they were gone. At $6 bucks each????? Not happy about it. People just ruthless.",
          "Had a great time... As an El Paso'n born n raised here ive seen wet n wild grow substantially, from having virtually nothing for young children to do.. Too having many attractions that keep the young ones entertained for hours and hours.... \u2026",
          "Absolutely love coming here! I highly recommend renting a tube if you go on a weekend though, otherwise your wait time will be higher because you'll have to wait for a tube before you can get in line for the actual ride.",

          "It's a fun place for kids from 1 to 100. There is something for everyone \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Signs are hard to read. Great prices and the season pass makes much more since. It pays itself off after two uses.  Wish you could bring beer on the lazy river, if so I'd come back much more often.",
          "Great place to relax and enjoy some fun.   Great rides at a good price too.",
          "Its hot in El Paso and this is a great place to cool off! Perfect for summer fun with the kids. Cabana rentals are so worth it.",

          "Fun, clean, lots of lifeguards and friendly staff. We had a blast.",
          "Honestly for the price that is 25.00 I was expecting more. There is no control the life guards only attend  if someone is breaking a rule,  but will not say anything to people cutting in line. I suggest you take your own food as the one \u2026",
          "I was surprised to see how well maintained it is! good job wet'n' wild , keep up the good work!!!  nice and smiley employees, I felt secure with my grandkids in the water with your lifeguards all around, thank you very much!",

          "It was a gross, nasty park! Stay away! \n\nThere was either piss everywhere or yellow, rusty water; I just couldn't tell. I maybe stayed half an hour before cutting my loses. I managed to change to my swimsuit only to walk around a bit and then decide to leave; never once getting into the water.\n\nI repeat: Stay Away!",
          "Love it full of so many positive memories for my family and I!",

          "It was an alright waterpark. Unclean in some places and I felt nervous while going up certain slides because it would shake. It's a fun place to go with friends, and a good place if you dont want to drive far.",

          "For El paso being a big city and having a big population this water park is pretty boring. It's small and usually over crowded. The price you pay to get in isn't even worth it. I'm from Wisconsin and Wisconsin Dells is 10 times better than this place.",
          "A nice place to cool off the heat. \nPeople ( the customers ) has to understand something though.\nIt's a family place dude, don't get wasted and throw up in front of people who are trying to enjoy family time. Please, that's just very \u2026",

          "This place is a great place to take the kids.  They let you bring your own food and you can grill it there.  Pricing isn't bad but I found the tickets cheaper and a quick pic store in Las Cruces. We will be coming back.",

          "Love it here!!  Always a great time!!",
          "Very long lines to ride the slides, most pools when falling from slides are 3ft or less, so its safe for kids. Make sure to rent a donut inflatable as most rides require one and this way you dont have to wait for one provided by the rides. Super cold water, and will probably get sick afterwards, but worth the fun.",
          "I am visiting my husband, who is stationed here, and this is the sorriest excuse for a waterpark that I've ever seen. There's no beach chairs to layout, there's too many picnic tables, and the layout of the park is hard to navigate. The \u2026",
          "Pretty ok for a place that's been open since '79 but it's age is showing in some areas. Some buildings dotted across the park seem abandoned, not sure what's going on with that. Certain rides have used chewing gum plastered on areas where \u2026",
          "Best place to cool down during the summer !!!",
          "Enjoy the slides, but on top of the entry price, you have to pay to rent a locker and pay to rent a tube. So it adds up really quickly. Some do have free to use tubes though. I wish there was a deeper pool or something but no luck.",
          "Very disappointed! Rides are good but the park itself needs a facelift. I could imagine how much the park makes per day. Needs new sitting tables, bbq grills, upgrades on the restrooms. It's not worth the price.",

          "It was ok. The wet n wild in Las Vegas is better, especially because you don't have to rent tubes there and they recycle them on the slides. Here if you don't get a tube for a ride you're out of luck even if you already paid to get in. Way too crowded at this location also.",

        "wiki": "Hueco Tanks is an area of low mountains and historic site in El Paso County, Texas, in the United States. It is located in a high-altitude desert basin between the Franklin Mountains to the west and the Hueco Mountains to the east.  Hueco is a Spanish word meaning hollows and refers to the many water-holding depressions in the boulders and rock faces throughout the region. Due to the unique concentration of historic artifacts, plants and wildlife, the site is under protection of Texas law; it is a crime to remove, alter, or destroy them.The historic site is located approximately 32 miles (51 km) northeast of central El Paso, Texas, accessible via El Paso's Montana Avenue (U.S. Route 62/U.S. Route 180), by turning at RM 2775.  The park consists of three syenite (a weak form of granite) mountains; it is 860 acres (350 ha) in area and is popular for recreation such as birdwatching and bouldering. It is culturally and spiritually significant to many Native Americans.  This significance is partially manifested in the pictographs (rock paintings) that can be found throughout the region, many of which are thousands of years old.\n\n\n== Designation ==\nHueco Tanks State Park & Historic Site was obtained from the county by special deed on June 12, 1969, and by purchase of 121 additional acres on August 10, 1970. This site was opened to the public in May 1970. This 860.3-acre park is named for the large natural rock basins or \"huecos\" that have furnished a supply of trapped rainwater to dwellers and travelers in this arid region of west Texas for millennia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe park has gone through considerable changes during private and public ownership.The inscribed names of Texas Rangers and US Cavalrymen, as well as Native American artifacts and paintings, attest to its historic nature.This site had originally attracted people due to its critical resource needed to survive life in the desert-water. The huge rocks and boulders have cracks and are pocketed with holes-huecos that trap and hold rainwater for months at a time. Passing people found this out and had made it known for future travelers by encrypting the walls with pictures and symbols on the rocks.\n\n\n=== Early inhabitants ===\n\nHuman habitation of the area dates back 10,000 years with the arrival of the Desert Archaic Culture. These people would have eaten mesquite beans, banana yucca and cactus fruits in Hueco Tanks. The region was inhabited by various peoples, from the Paleo-Indians who used Folsom points to hunt the Megafauna of North America, to the people of the 'Jornada Mogollon' (pronounced mo-goi-YONE). This site was once a Jornada Mogollon village, according to an archaeological dig of the ground between North Mountain and West Mountain. By about 700 years ago, the population of the village could no longer be sustained by the small agricultural area surrounding Hueco Tanks.  At this point, a population shift occurred and settlements were formed on the nearby playas to the south, west, and northwest.  There, they flourished until about 1450 A.D. when the area suffered from a series of severe droughts. Although it took time, by about 1600 A.D. the region was inhabited by the Apache people, who moved in from Canada (see the Athabascans).\nAgriculture was introduced in the area sometime around 1000 A.D. and along with it, the development of the Jornada Mogollon Culture. The Jornada people built a village in the area and grew corn.Later the area was occupied by Mescalero and Lipan Apaches and Jumano people. Also using the area were Comanche, Kiowa and Tiguas. Spanish and Mexican travelers were rare visitors to the area. The Kiowa called the area the Tso-doi-gyata-de-dee, meaning \"rock cave where they were surrounded.\" In 1837, the Kiowa signed a treaty with the United States, however, shortly after Mexican soldiers forced them into a six-day siege in Hueco Tanks, during which most of them died. The earliest known modern graffiti dates back to the 1840s.\nThe area was visited by United States Boundary Commissioner, John R. Bartlett, in 1852 who recorded some of the pictographs. Between 1858 and 1859, the Butterfield Overland Mail kept a stagecoach station in the area, but left when a better location was found to the south. An El Paso businessman, Juan Armadariz, purchased much of the Hueco Tanks land to use for ranching in 1895. Silverio Escontr\u00edas bought the land from Armendariz in 1898 and the family used it as a ranch and tourist attraction until 1956. The early El Paso Archaeological Society (EPAS) began to campaign for the land to be turned into a park and in 1935, the National Park Service offered to buy the land from the Escontr\u00edas family, but they refused. Fort Bliss leased land from the Escontr\u00edas family for training purposes in the 1940s and 50s. The ranch went on the real estate market in 1956 and during this time, members of archaeological and historical societies raised awareness of the area's significance. El Paso County took over the land in the mid-1960s.In 1968, it was discussed whether or not the park should be turned over to the Tiguas. In 1969, the El Paso County commissioners decided to deed the park to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission. It was made a Texas State Park in 1970. The park's information center was made from the old Escontr\u00edas ranch house. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Archaeological excavations conducted by George Kegley took place in the area between 1972 and 1973. The park was named the Hueco Tanks State Historic Site in 1998.\n\n\n== Pictographs ==\n\nThe first paintings made at Hueco Tanks were done by members of the Desert Archaic Culture, and depicted abstract designs. These were created between 6000 and 3000 B.C. Between 3000 BC and 450 A.D., pictures of animals and humans were drawn on the rocks.Most of the pictographs at Hueco Tanks are of Jornada Mogollon origin. The drawings may have been used in praying for rain. The Jornada's religion was influenced by Mesoamerican religions. Many of the Hueco Tanks drawings depicted Tlaloc, a rain god and Quetzalcoatl.Modern graffiti by Anglo people started appearing when someone painted \"1849\" over some of the original pictographs.The first scientific overview of the rock paintings at Hueco Tanks happened in the summer of 1939 with Forrest and Lula Kirkland recording the art. Most of the colors used in the paintings came from minerals in the area. The paintings themselves became bound to the rock through the aging process.In 1972, the El Paso Archaeological Society (EPAS) and the Anthropology Club of the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) systematically documented the drawings, their current conditions and sometimes relocated and inspected the rock art. The project discovered 300 previously unrecorded pictographs. The findings of their work was published in A Rock Art Inventory at Hueco Tanks State Park (1974). In 1988, park ranger Dave Parker and archeologist Ron Ralph plotted the location of all known pictographs. A digital database of the art and its GPS coordinates was started in 1999 with Robert Mark and Evelyn Billo.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe syenite pluton was formed 34-38 million years ago, as part of a larger range, the Hueco Mountains, which range in age to over 320 million years ago, when this area was covered by an inland sea. The pluton was eventually exposed through weathering to form the rock formations visible today, which jut from the desert floor. The tanks were once capable of containing a year's supply of water. In addition to the tanks, there are several permanent springs and seasonal springs in the area. The area receives less than 14 inches (360 mm) of rainfall a year.The syenite rock formation is covered with 'desert patina' (visible in the image below), the result of thousands of years of weathering of the rock surface by sun, sand, and water; the site is culturally and spiritually significant to many Native Americans, such as the Mescalero Apache, the Kiowa, the Hopi, and the Pueblo people.  This significance is partially manifested in the pictographs (rock paintings) that can be found throughout the region, some of which are thousands of years old. Hueco Tanks contains the single largest concentration of mask paintings by Native Americans in North America, of which hundreds exist at this site.\n\n\n== Wildlife ==\nFreshwater shrimp and spadefoot toads survive at the site; for this and other reasons, visitors are cautioned against touching the pools of water at Hueco Tanks to avoid destroying the eggs of these animals. Other amphibians seen in the park include barred tiger salamanders. Around 30 different species of reptiles live in the area. In 2002, 222 different species of bird were documented at the site during the year. Migratory birds such as waterfowl and songbirds pass through during migration seasons. Several birds such as the prairie falcon, burrowing owl, white throated swift, black-chinned hummingbird, ash throated flycatcher, Crissal thrasher, blue grosbeak, Scott's oriole and lesser goldfinch all likely breed in the area. The park is home today to mule deer, black bears, bobcats, gray fox, coyotes, badgers, ringtails, skunks, raccoons, mountain lions, black-tailed jackrabbits, desert cottontail, eastern cottontail, six species of bats and twenty species of rodents.\n\n\n== Plants ==\nAround the syenite outcrops, the park is surrounded by Chihuahuan Desert scrub with creosote bush as the dominant species. The site contains enough water to support live oaks and junipers, species which survive from the last ice age. Other trees found in the area include netleaf hackberry, Texas mulberry, Mexican buckeye, Gregg acacia and Arizona oak. Hueco Tanks has the only population in the United States of the plant Colubrina stricta.\n\n\n== Rock climbing ==\n\nHueco Tanks is widely regarded as one of the best areas in the world for bouldering that is, rock climbing low enough to attempt without ropes for protection.  It is unique for its rock type, the concentration and quality of the climbing. In any given climbing season, which generally lasts from October through March, it is common for climbers from across Europe, Asia, and Australia to visit the park.  In February an outdoor bouldering competition known as the Hueco Rock Rodeo is held. The event is a world-class outdoor competition that attracts many professional climbers every year. Since implementation of the Public Use Plan in June 2000, following a brief closure of the entire park due to the park service's inability to manage the growing crowds of international climbers, more than two-thirds of the park is restricted to tours by volunteer or commercial guides.  Only North Mountain is accessible without guides, and then only for about 70 people at any given time, except on the south side at ground level, which is closed to the public. The park offers camping and showers for $12 per night (as of April 2020), or, as is most popular for climbers, the nearby Hueco Rock Ranch offers camping where climbers can relax and socialize. This is also where commercial guides can be found, and where many volunteer guides stay during the climbing season.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nGale Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes, Volume II, p203-205.

          "We camped a night here in November 2017 and wished we had stayed longer. There is so much in this little place, from great scenery to excellent birding. But what really sets the place apart is the cultural heritage of the place. There is a strong sensation of the long history",
          "We stayed two nights, could have used one more day. Did rock art tour 1 with Dar and Tish. They are great guides and you can request a tour with them. We are not experienced climbers but had a great time exploring the unguided part of the park. Entire staff at Park was very",
          "Beautiful unique terrain, cool petroglyphs, we saw a javelina and a bobcat during our visit. Cool rock formations and canyons for the kids to explore. Worth the booking",
          "Hueco tanks is one of the most beautiful places I've been. It's located just on the outskirts of El Paso about 30 minutes out of town. There is a important historical relevance as this holds the largest collection of pictographs in North American. Hueco is also a bouldering",
          "This was nice little place to kill a couple hours boulder hopping. The do have some serious policies and the trails are kind poorly marked. Normally, that wouldn't bother me, but they make you watch a film about staying on the trail and such. Anyway, the scenery is amazing.",
          "Not much to see if you cannot scramble over the rocks..... We arrived around 4pm. The ranger said the entrance fee was $7 per person. I stated that we were a little late in the day, but, she said, the park is open until 6pm. I specifically asked if there was somewhere to drive",
          "This was a beautiful site but we had to wait 2 hours before we could get in without reservation. Definitely need to make reservations beforehand. Several people left without going in especially with little kids.",
          "This is a great trip. You have to watch a video before you get to go to the rocks, and part of the park is guided tour only, but it is definitely worth the trip out there. You have free reign of the rocks and you can actually climb up and down whatever you want. There are a",
          "So so sad that this place was covered \"from head to toe\" with graffiti before it was protected. Yes, the rocks are so interesting as they differ from all around them, and finding \"holes\" full of water in such a desert landscape is interesting, BUT the pictographs can hardly be",
          "This is an oasis in the desert. Native people have gathered here for thousands of years. The tanks are water goes that are in the rock. Some are small, others the size of large ponds. The ecosystem is unique. Besides the tanks, there are pictographs in many sites in the park.",
          "We stopped at Hueco tanks on the way between El Paso and Carlsbad Caverns. We didn't plan ahead so we were only able to do the short hike but it was very enjoyable. Note that you are required to watch a 17-minute video before being allowed to hike in the park The short hike",

          "We visited this park to see the Jornada Mogollon rock art, and camped there two nights. We were able to reserve a tour in advance for our second day. The map provided to visitors isn\u2019t detailed enough to locate much rock art and so the first day we enjoyed hiking and birding,",

          "We went hiking with our children (ages 11 & 7) and we had a wonderful time. We climbed way up on the rocks and it was a wonderful view from the top. The kids did well climbing. It was not too difficult for them and they are not experienced climbers. I am also not an experienced",
          "My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with Hueco Tank State park. Hueco is pronounced like Waco. We visited on a Sunday morning in June and there was plenty of parking. We took the 2.5 \u2013 3 hour ranger guided tour that I highly recommend. Our tour was supposed to start at 9",
          "We really enjoyed exploring here. I suggest going early in the morning and bring some mosquito repellant wipes... Don't spray at the park because it is very environmentally delicate there and you don't want to kill any life forms. Then go on a couple of hours more to Carlsbad",
          "The primary purpose of my visit so I was very disappointed to not see any, but the pictographs and plant tour were great! And I saw lots of quail, cottontails, jackrabbits, roadrunners, and even a - thankfully - dead rattlesnake!",

          "Hueco Tanks is an interesting place. There are a small number of ancient pictographs (paintings - not to be confused with petroglyphs) visible on guided tours and in a few hidden public locations. But most are understandably off limits - for their protection and preservation.",

          "Hueco Tanks is an absolute treasure. You must plan ahead as the number of visitors at a time is limited due to past vandalism. See their website for phone numbers (the 915- is the local office) and other info. Without reservations, expect to wait in your car outside the gate",
          "Nice rock formations - hard to imagine people climbing them safely. The guided hike to the pictographs and petroglyphs was interesting - lots of history. Jorge was very passionate and knowledgeable , but for us the walk was too long at 3 hours. 2 hours max would be ideal",

          "I've heard of Hueco Tanks for years, but this is the first time I was actually able to visit. We arrived late in the afternoon and only had to wait about a half an hour before we could go in. It was worth the wait and, to my delight, it allowed the afternoon sun to get lower to",
          "We liked or hike the guest day so much we went back and took a tour. The $2 toe lasted 3 hours and was very informative. Would caution that it is a physical hike with climbing but well worth the effort. Petroglyphs from the Apache tribes dating 200 to 300 hundred years ago.",
          "We arrive at the Park at 1100 on a Sunday morning. There were already 5 vehicles ahead of us waiting to get into the Park. They only allow 70 people in the Park at one time, so you may be waiting 5 minutes or 2 hours. We waited 10-15 minutes and left.",

          "We thoroughly enjoyed this campground! What a fantastic experience even for those that don't rock climb or seek strenuous hikes. We were in site #1, right up against the rocks. Sites are spaced well and offer privacy along with electrical and water hookups. We had to back in but",

          "This is a fun, unique place to enjoy nature. There are several tours available, but you can go and explore the north mountain on your own. You pay at the front building ($7) then your first visit, you have to watch a video as orientation. When you get out there you can hike,",
          "Beautiful state park about 15 minutes from the Eastside of El Paso. If you want to beat the heat and sometimes the line you need to be there early. There is a small fee for each person and you must watch an educational video about the park and how to take care of it before you",

          "This place is a great find in the middle of the El Paso desert. It's a ways outside the city limits and depending on your cell carrier, you probably won't get service out here. I really enjoying come to this place because there are so many different areas to hike that it's",
          "These rock formations are truly spectacular. There are many well preserved petroglyphs on the site and rangers to give insight into the ancient and more recent history of the site. Make sure to bring water as it gets very hot out there. People do get hurt out there, usually",
          "We enjoy this state park. We go at least twice a year and we have still not \"seen it all\". In the summer, you should go early morning to avoid the hot sun. The video and tours are informative. Be sure and ask for the Kiva cave map at the ranger station.",
          "You'll definitely want to take the time to RSVP for the petroglyphs and pictographs tour. It's amazing, and the staff is incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. It's a good, moderate hike. Make sure and take plenty of water and sunblock. Wouldn't recommend it for those who aren't",
          "We had 4 spaces at this really great park. The kids saw animals, took a hike, slept in tents and loved it. The ranger led hike was a huge success. They are still talking about the pictographs and animal prints they found. Decent rest rooms and really clean camp area. I highly",

          "Must see for lovers of Indian rock art. Seen lots of petroglyphs (pecked art), but it's rare to see many pictographs (painted). This place has it in spades. Went on about a 3 hour guided tour. It was worth every minute. Campground was very nice and we stayed one night. Ask",
          "We went on a ranger led walk, and it was interesting to see some of the cave paintings that we would never have found on our own. Hearing about the history was also interesting. We did a little exploring on our own, and then one of the park rangers saw a rattlesnake. We got to",

          "Hueco Tanks is too and simple for someone wanting to really go for a good hike. Other than the obvious huge rocks there, there is nothing but cactus and dessert. Not my idea of a pleasant scenery while hiking. I did not enjoy this, not to mention the heat!",
          "This place is an absolutely amazing thing to see - very worth your time. It is home to thousands of years worth of petroglyphs. I went twice, and didn't get to see all of them. The staff is especially helpful. I suggest telling the ranger you will talk to during the intro video",
          "Use to live here in the '80 but never visited. Wish I had of, getting to old to walk the trails. Walked though for about an hour and had to turn back because of the heat and I had drink all my water. Definitely visit this when you are young. Still had a good time.",

      "name": "St. Patrick Cathedral",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "St. Patrick Cathedral is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of El Paso, Texas.  The cathedral is located at 1118 N. Mesa Street, north of the downtown area.  It is the mother church for 668,000 Catholics in the diocese (80.8% of total population; as of the 2006 survey). The cathedral parish operates one of El Paso's Catholic high schools, Cathedral High School, and St. Patrick Elementary School adjacent to the church.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was designed by Barnett, Haynes & Barnett, an architectural firm from St Louis, Missouri.  It was built in the form of a Byzantine basilica, in the Italian Renaissance style.  In raising funds for the cathedral's construction, the diocese offered to allow the first group to raise $10,000 for the project to name the new cathedral. A group of Irish Catholic women met the challenge and chose St. Patrick as patron. At the time El Paso was a major center of the mining industry in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, with many of the miners being Irish.  The ground was broken on April 8, 1914 and the church and the cornerstone were blessed in a ceremony by Fr Edward Barry on November 12, 1916.  The interior of the cathedral is adorned with Roman columns, elaborate frescoes that depict biblical scenes and the Stations of the Cross are carved in bas-relief on the interior walls.  The high altar contains a 2.5-meter-tall statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus with a large canopy over the altar, topped with a golden eagle.  The church seats about 800 people for Mass. In alcoves along the walls there are a picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe and a life-size classical sculpture of St. Patrick.  The stained-glass windows depict scenes from the life of Jesus and the Church.\n\n\n== Saint Peter of Jesus Maldonado and the Cathedral ==\n\nBecause of the anticlerical laws due to the Mexican Constitution of 1917 and the Mexican Revolution, the Catholic Church was increasingly suppressed by the governments of Presidents Alvaro Obregon and Plutarco Calles. Involvement in politics, freedom of worship and redress of grievances were severely curtailed and even denied to bishops, priests, deacons and Catholic laity.  Even prior to the end of the revolution, from 1914 to 1918, those aspiring to be priests found it impossible to study in Mexico, and studied abroad, usually in the United States, mostly in cities close to the U.S.-Mexican border.\nEl Paso was especially popular because of its closeness to Mexico.  During these years many seminarians from northern Mexico studied in El Paso, and were ordained to the priesthood there.  One such was Peter of Jesus Maldonado, who was ordained by Bishop Anthony J Schuler, S.J., in the cathedral on January 25, 1918.  Padre Maldonado returned to his native Chihuahua; he was beaten to death in 1937 at the hands of town authorities in Santa Isabel (at that time named General Trias), Chihuahua, for preaching the Gospel and teaching the catechism to the people there.  He was buried in the Cathedral of Chihuahua, and canonised by Pope John Paul II on May 21, 2000 as one of the companions of St Christopher Magallanes.  A memorial in the nave of St. Patrick commemorates the event of his ordination.\n\n\n== Photo Gallery I - The Windows ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Photo Gallery II - Other Points of Interest ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Catholic cathedrals in the United States\nList of cathedrals in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAlso included in the Borderlands series is additional information concerning El Paso and the cathedral.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Cathedral Site\nRoman Catholic Diocese of El Paso Official Site\n\"Diocese of El Paso\".

          "Family fun near Fort Bliss. We bought the 3 hours pass. Best deal if you plan to do more than 4 outside activities. You get 1 free laser session per pasd. We went on go carts, minigolf, bumper boats. (Side note: Bumper boats are more fun than it looks like. This is the best",
          "Took out of town young ones here and we had a good time. Video games, bumper boats and more. Hardly any wait at all to get on a ride. This place has something for everyone. I even took the older ones and played mini golf. Good place for fun.",
          "Depending on how you work it, you can spend a couple of hours to all day at this park. Check height restrictions before you go. We thought this was a great little amusement park for our three and six year olds. There were no lines or wait times for the rides. Our youngest rode",
          "Small place on the outskirts of the city. Great for young children gives them a couple hours of arcade, and ride fun-bumper boats, go karts, mini golf and other things",
          "I use this center because I like to go to the batting cages. It also has a video center with many games along with mini golf. It is a nice family type place where you can enjoy the afternoon with your family.",
          "My kids enjoyed this place! The attractions are very much suited for their ages! We visited with friends and I don't think there is a child in our group who was disappointed!",
          "Spent an afternoon here and although the temperature was hot it didn't spoil our good time. Young, old(ish) and the in-between all had an enjoyable time here. The mini golf course is nice and some holes provide a challenge without being too difficult for the little one's. The",
          "We went with a younger child and a teen and all had a good time. It's a typical arcade/game center. The arcade was nice but not very big. The prices for activities and food were fairly high but they usually are. We did the batting cages, go carts and bumper boats. Make sure and",

          "I'ts a great place to have a party or just to get out of the old routine. Family friendly and lots of activities to do for all ages.",
          "Terrible customer service. Staff is unprofessional and very poorly trained. Food is mediocre and there are very few choices. Still, best not to eat here. Also there are very few attractions for an over-priced entrance fee (wristband). Advertised prices (and hours of operation)",
          "Lots of variety in arcade games, and I believe here the only place in El Paso to do laser tag. The mini golf course is a lot of fun, and the batting cages are a nice touch! The only drawbacks are the food (just eat before or after) and the decor (looks crazy outdated). My 11",
          "Enjoyed a fun evening with my son and his wife. Lots of little kids running around with no supervision from an adult this is why they have 4 stars from me instead of 5. Pizza similar to Chuck E. Cheese...we had pepperoni which was way better than the cheese we had and also",

          "My kids always have a good time here. The place is in much better shape than their competitor a few miles away. Prices are reasonable, especially if you take advantage of the specials offered. Two for one batting cage tokens on Tuesdays, unlimited attractions for a set price,",
          "I went with my girlfriend and it was very fun experience, I had my doubts, but it was a fun date played mini golf, bating cages, lazer tag, and arcade. Everything was clean and well maintained. Spent for the both of us about 30 to 38 wich is very good.",
          "We went with a small group of adults and a 16 and 12 year old and had a surprisingly good time. Played some games, rode the go carts, played mini golf and had a blast withe the laser tag. Well worth the $20 unlimited play! A couple of the adults didn't want to go cart, so they",
          "The place is ok, it needs a little bit of a face lift. The staff needs to pay attention to the customers. We got tickets for laser tag and had to wait 30 min because of shift change. The food, try to avoid it. Very over priced and food is very dry.",
          "Super fun environment, where adults can be kids, There is food like hot dogs and pizza, There are different games such as golf, small roller coasters for kids, racing carts, and a nice sized arcade.",
          "This was not a bad little place. 4 of us spent a few hours here and we had fun. The mini golf was a decent course. It did have alot of water on the greens and the greens them selves need some tlc. We also road the go karts. With 4 of us it was ok. Need more people and carts",
          "Not an inexpensive fun time. It has many different activities, especially for kids. The facilities needs some more attention -- the mini golf 'grass carpeting' is pretty worn out but still a fun time. The batting cages are not supervised and people put themselves and others in",
          "we went with our 8 and 10 year old kids and had lots of fun. love the gokarts, the track\u00b4s large and has lots of curves. The mini golf course is also good, allthough it could use some renovation, make it a bit more challenging. Food is normal.",
          "It's kind of pricy and really not that much fun...We went there with my 11 year old and he had fun of course but from parent point of view ...it's better then Chuck e Cheeses.We never went back",
          "Fun time!! We are visiting El Paso from Fort Gordon, GA and Fort Hood, TX and had a great time here. The staff is friendly, the restroom is clean, and the kids (and us adults) thoroughly enjoyed the rides and games. They also have laser tag and golf in addition to bumper boats.",
          "Love this place. It's great for family or a fun date. Has laser tag, mini golf, batting cages, bumper boats, go carts, and an arcade.",
          "The arcade was small but it's got one. Laser tag, mini golf, bumper boats, go-karts, it's a kid paradise frankly. Best part for me was the DDR machine, turned me into a kid. I enjoyed it, stop by if you've got little ones.",
          "We went here for a family fun day and it was wonderful! For the first time we were all able to play lazer tag and we had a blast! Great place, and our new place to go as a family! The staff was very friendly and The prices weren't bad either! Highly recommend it!",
          "Good price. Go karts are fun could be faster. Quick and easy. Will do it again looking forward to the bumper boats.",
          "I've been going for the past 5 yrs to use the batting cages for slow pitch softball and today they stop me to tell me I had to wear a helmet that they never clean. When I asked for my money back they refused to give me my monet and I had to to just walk out.",
          "Had a great time riding the big track for go-karts. Nice track with plenty of curves and on a slight hill side for tons of fun. Karts are decent, typical and they allow you to bump slightly at this track, which adds to the excitement. Me and a friend took our teen sons and we",
          "We spent half a day at Bob-O's and had a lot of fun. We were a big group of adults and children ages 3-10. There is something to do for everyone of all ages and prices are very reasonable. They have arcade games, laser tag, go carts, mini golf and a few kiddy rides. I am not",
          "We just visited to play a round of mini golf and I have to say it was one of the worst mini golfs we've been to. It was in quite a bad condition, no one had bothered to clean it for a while, the courses were full of tree leaves and the carpets were slit open in several places,",
          "My 3 year old daughter liked it. Not all rides were working and its starting to look a lil old. Could use an update. The outside part is fun. Karts and bumperboats. A lil trainride and mini golf, battingcages and such. If it wasnt for the outside part I would just recommend",
          "Laser Tag, Putt-Putt, Race cars for big and small size racers, and other fun attractions. Busy on a weekend.",
          "The most fun of our entire trip ! ! ! ! Bumper boats were the best - and my husband and kids went on the go-carts a dozen times, The wristband is definitely worth the money. The Laser Tag was fun for a one time thing - it's meant for kids. We had a BLAST on the bumper boats.",
          "My Mother took my kids here for a little time with the kids, little did she know she would barely see them as they ran and played so much and had such a wonderful time!! I highly recommend the bracelet/all the fun for one price. We will for sure visit Bobo's again and again!!",
          "This place is a ton of fun. My kids LOVED the laser tag! We were able to get on the go-karts with them and they had a blast. Their selection of arcade games are decent. I recommend purchasing a bracelet if you plan on staying a while. It was a fun place.",
          "We went with four kids and five adults and had a great time. Loved the go karts and bumper boats. Good fun for all the kids who were between 12 and 7. The food was so so but didn't really expect much for a snack counter.",
          "My son and I raced go karts and staff was friendly. Within walking distance of our hotel. Great place to occupy your children.",
          "Nice place to take kids . Not a lot of outdoors ,except Track cars and floating boats. Video games inside...",
          "Had a decent time with family while visiting El Paso. Golf & Go-Karts were fun! Batting cage & Laser tag was also. Spent 3 hours, had great time.",
          "We played a round of mini golf and had a great time. Bob-O's has the prettiest flowers in town. Took lots of pictures and I WON!",
          "My husband and I tried this place out for a different date. We had a fairly good time. The outdoor area wasn't too crowded, but the inside arcade was packed. We tried out the batting cages (lost quite a few quarters thought) and mini-golf. The course wasn't very inventive or",
          "Ever have a trip and kids say 'I'm bored!'? Bob-O's was suggested and the grandson and grandad had the time of their lives. they bought the wrist bands and played for 3 hours of non-stop fun. Go-carts, batting cages, laser tag, miniature golf, and more. Was the highlight of",
          "this is always a good time for the kids. Mine love the laser tag, but the outside stuff is fun too, so long as the wind isnt up...",
          "I live in Las Cruces, NM, where it is tough to find things to do with the family. Bob-O's is just a short hour drive from home and offers things that you can't get in Las Cruces such as miniature golf and go-carts and such. Bob-O's is a little pricey but compared to the void of",
          "This is a fun place to take your tween if you want to try to unplug them from the X-box for a little while. There is more to do in the summer (when the outdoor activities like bumper boats, mini-golf and go-karts are more fun), but laser tag and the arcade go on regardless of",
          "It is a great atmosphere with plenty to do. It is not expensive and the staff was very friendly and helpful.",
          "I love Bob-O's for it's laser tag. It has one of the best in El Paso with it being 2 stories, but the arcade part is very small and when there are parties it gets quite cramped. But other than that I always have fun when I go with my family.",
          "the ride in the outside was kind of broken but other than that i had fun the laser tag was SO fun and i liked it very much",
          "fun place to hang with the kids for a couple of hors. expensive unless you buy the day passes. careful with the go carts and the bullys. batting cages are neat ( when working ) but make sure bring batting gloves so you can do it for a while.",
          "This place has a wide variety of kid-friendly fun. We've been here a few times for kid birthdays. The gokarts are great, and the pizza was pretty good. The one complaint I would have, is the price of the arcade games. Some are $2 or more per game. You can go to Chuck E",
          "I highly recommend BobO's. Not what we expected to find in El Paso. Looks like places I've seen in California..very nice and the sevice was very helpful",
          "Bob-Os features bumper boats, an arcade, laser tag, miniature golf, batting cages, and a little food area. We went last night and it was complete pandemonium. Kids were running rampant and no parents were in sight. Bob-Os allows parents to host birthday parties, so I recommend"

        "wiki": "El Paso (; Spanish: [el \u02c8paso] \"the pass\") is a city and the county seat of El Paso County, Texas, United States, in the far western part of the state. The 2019 population estimate for the city from the U.S. Census was 681,728, making it the 22nd largest city in the United States. Its metropolitan statistical area (MSA) covers all of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in Texas, and has a population of 840,758.El Paso stands on the Rio Grande across the Mexico\u2013United States border from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua with 1.4 million people. Las Cruces, in the neighboring U.S. state of New Mexico, has a population of 215,579. On the U.S. side, the El Paso metropolitan area forms part of the larger El Paso\u2013Las Cruces CSA, with a population of 1,060,397.Bi-nationally, these three cities form a combined international metropolitan area sometimes referred to as the Paso del Norte or the Borderplex. The region of 2.5 million people constitutes the largest bilingual and binational work force in the Western Hemisphere.The city is home to three publicly traded companies, and former Western Refining, now Andeavor. as well as home to the Medical Center of the Americas, the only medical research and care provider complex in West Texas and Southern New Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso, the city's primary university. The city hosts the annual Sun Bowl college football post-season game, the second oldest bowl game in the country.El Paso has a strong federal and military presence. William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Biggs Army Airfield, and Fort Bliss are located in the area. Fort Bliss is one of the largest military complexes of the United States Army and the largest training area in the United States. Also headquartered in El Paso are the DEA domestic field division 7, El Paso Intelligence Center, Joint Task Force North, United States Border Patrol El Paso Sector, and the U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group (SOG).\nIn 2010 and 2018, El Paso received an All-America City Award. El Paso ranked in the top three safest large cities in the United States between 1997 and 2014, including holding the title of safest city between 2011 and 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks. The evidence suggests 10,000 to 12,000 years of human habitation. The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. When the Spanish arrived, the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area. These were subsequently incorporated into the Mestizo culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from Comancher\u00eda, and gen\u00edzaros of various ethnic groups. The Mescalero Apache were also present.\nSpanish explorer Don Juan de O\u00f1ate was born in 1550 in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and was the first New Spain (Mexico) explorer known to have observed the Rio Grande near El Paso, in 1598, celebrating a Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (decades before the English Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). However, the four survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza, and his enslaved Moor Estevanico, are thought to have passed through the area in the mid-1530s. El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) was founded on the south bank of the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande), in 1659 by Fray Garcia de San Francisco. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the Pueblo Revolt, until 1692 when Santa Fe was reconquered and once again became the capital.\nThe Texas Revolution (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of Cross-border town naming until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring Anson Mills to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.During the Civil War, a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union California Column in 1862. It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.\nAfter the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow as Texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority. El Paso itself, incorporated in 1873, encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river. In the 1870s, a population of 23 non-Hispanic whites and 150 Hispanics was reported. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, the population boomed to 10,000 by the 1890 census, with many Anglo-Americans, recent immigrants, old Hispanic settlers, and recent arrivals from Mexico. The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild boomtown known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness. Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). With the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city's geographic position, the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the U.S. Southwest.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio D\u00edaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D\u00edaz.By 1910, the overwhelming number of people in the city were Americans creating a settled environment. However, this period was short-lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees \u2013 and capital \u2013 to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast Plan de San Diego which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens. The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives. These actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the end result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.Simultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000 and Non-Hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites. In reply, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund. In 1916, the Census Bureau reported El Paso's population as 53% Mexican and 44% Non-Hispanic whites. Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.During and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.The Farah Strike, 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas. This strike was originated and led by Chicanas, or Mexican American women, due to Farah Manufacturing Company, one of the largest factories in the city, being unorganized, low wages, discrimination, no benefits, lack of gender-neutrality, health and safety hazards, and unattainable quotas. Texas Monthly described the Farah Strike as the \"strike of the century.\"On August 3, 2019, a mass shooting/domestic terrorist attack committed by a white supremacist occurred at a Walmart in El Paso, which left 23 people dead and 23 others injured.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEl Paso is located at the intersection of three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua) and two countries (the U.S. and Mexico). It is the only major Texas city on Mountain Time. Ciudad Juarez was once in Central Time, but both cities are now on Mountain Time.\nEl Paso is closer to the capital cities of four other states \u2013 Phoenix, Arizona (345 miles (555 km) away); Santa Fe, New Mexico, (273 miles (439 km) away); Ciudad Chihuahua, Chihuahua, (218 miles (351 km) away), and Hermosillo, Sonora (325 miles (523 km) away) \u2013 than it is to the capital of its own state, Austin (528 miles (850 km) away). It is closer to Los Angeles, California (700 miles (1,100 km) away) than it is to Orange (858 miles (1,381 km) away), the easternmost town in the state.\nEl Paso is located within the Chihuahuan Desert, the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region. The Franklin Mountains extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the west side forms the beginnings of the Mesilla Valley, and the east side expands into the desert and lower valley. They connect in the central business district at the southern end of the mountain range.\nThe city's elevation is 3,800 ft (1,200 m) above sea level. North Franklin Mountain is the highest peak in the city at 7,192 ft (2,192 m) above sea level. The peak can be seen from 60 mi (100 km) in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local Coronado High School gets its mascot's name. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 256.3 square miles (663.7 km2).The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park, the largest urban park in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and El Paso International Airport.\nThe Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey, an example of a pluton, rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Nearby volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (50 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEl Paso has a transitional climate between cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk) and hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh) featuring hot summers, with little humidity, and cool to mild dry winters. Rainfall averages 9.7 in (250 mm) per year, much of which occurs during the summer from July through September, and is predominantly caused by the North American Monsoon. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes thunderstorms, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.\nThe sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the National Weather Service; from this, the city is nicknamed \"The Sun City\". Due to its arid, windy climate, El Paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season, particularly during the springtime between March and early May. With an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph (50 km/h) and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph (120 km/h), these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.\nEl Paso and the nearby mountains also receive snow. Weather systems have produced over one foot (30 cm) of snow on several occasions. In the 1982\u20131983 winter season, three major snowstorms produced record seasonal snowfall. On December 25\u201326, 1982, 6.0 inches (15 cm) of snow fell, producing a white Christmas for the city. This was followed by another 7.0 inches (18 cm) on December 30\u201331, 1982. On April 4\u20137, 1983, 16.5 inches (42 cm) of snow fell on El Paso, bringing the seasonal total to nearly 30 inches (76 cm). On December 13\u201314, 1987, a record storm dumped over 22 inches (56 cm) of snow on El Paso, and two weeks later (December 25\u201326), another three inches (7.6 cm) fell, bringing the monthly total for December 1987 to an all-time record high of 25.9 inches (66 cm) of snow.\nThe average annual snowfall for the city varies widely between different neighborhoods at different elevations, but is 6.1 inches (15 cm) at the airport (but with a median of 0, meaning most years see no snow at all). Snow is most rare around Ysleta and the eastern valley area, which usually include large numbers of palm trees; in the higher neighborhoods, palm trees are more vulnerable to snow and cold snaps and are often seen with brown, frost-damaged fronds.\nOne example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C), the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was 1 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C), breaking the 5 \u00b0F (\u221215 \u00b0C) monthly record low set during the cold wave of 1899. Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results. Two local power plants failed, forcing El Paso Electric to institute rolling blackouts over several days, and electric wires were broken, causing localised blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days.\nMonthly means range from 45.5 \u00b0F (7.5 \u00b0C) in December to 83.5 \u00b0F (28.6 \u00b0C) in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon arrives, while daily low temperatures typically peak in July or early August with the higher humidity the monsoon brings (translating to warmer nights). On average, there are 52 nights of at- or below-freezing lows, 109 days of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C)+ highs and 20 days of 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ highs annually; it is extremely rare for temperatures to stay below the freezing mark all day. The city's record high is 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on June 30, 1994, and its record low is \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) on January 11, 1962; the highest daily minimum was 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the National Weather Service since 1879.\n\n\n==== Flooding ====\nAlthough the average annual rainfall is only about 9.7 in (250 mm), many parts of El Paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms. In late July and early August 2006, up to 10 in (250 mm) of rain fell in a week, the flood-control reservoirs overflowed and caused major flooding citywide. The city staff estimated damage to public infrastructure at $21 million, and to private property (residential and commercial) at $77 million. Much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood-control dams and reservoirs, and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water.\n\n\n=== Time zone ===\nEl Paso is located in the far western corner of Texas, which is roughly the only part of the state that is located within the Mountain Time Zone, as opposed to the Central Time Zone.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Downtown and central El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town contains some of the city's oldest and most historic neighborhoods. Located in the heart of the city, it is home to approximately 44,993 people. Development of the area started in 1827 with the first resident, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a wealthy merchant from Paso del Norte (present day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), who built the region's first structure establishing Rancho Ponce within the vicinity of S. El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the Sunset Heights district. It is close to the El Paso International Airport, the international border, and Fort Bliss. It is part of the El Paso Independent School District.\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the white American residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. Hispanic-American residents lived in an area called Chihuahuita (\"little Chihuahua\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area. Another downtown neighborhood is El Segundo Barrio, which is near the United States/Mexico border.\n\n\n=== Northwest El Paso ===\n\nBetter known as West El Paso or the West Side, the area includes a portion of the Rio Grande floodplain upstream from downtown which is known locally as the Upper Valley and is located on the west side of the Franklin Mountains. The Upper Valley is the greenest part of the county due to the Rio Grande. The west side is home to some of the most affluent neighborhoods within the city, such as the Coronado Hills and Country Club neighborhoods. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of El Paso.\n\n\n=== West central El Paso ===\n\nWest central El Paso is located north of Interstate 10 and west of the Franklin Mountains. The University of Texas at El Paso and the Cincinnati Entertainment district are located in the heart of the area. Historic districts Kern Place and Sunset Heights are in this part of town.\nKern Place was founded in 1914 by Peter E. Kern, for whom the neighborhood was named.The homes of Kern Place are unique in architecture and some were built by residents themselves. One of the better known homes is the Paul Luckett Home located at 1201 Cincinnati Ave. above Madeline Park, and is made of local rock. It is known as \"The Castle\" due to its round walls and a crenelated rooftop.Kern Place is extremely popular with college and university students. The area is known for its glitzy entertainment district, restaurants and coffee shops who cater to both business patrons and university students. After UTEP's basketball and football games, UTEP fans pack the Kern Place area for food and entertainment at Cincinnati Street a small bar district. This bar scene has grown over the years and has attracted thousands to its annual Mardi Gras block party as well as after sporting events or concerts. Young men and women make up the majority of the crowds who stop in between classes or after work.Sunset Heights is one of the most historic areas in town, which has existed since the latter part of the 1890s. Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory, but many have been neglected and have deteriorated. During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, Doroteo Arango (also known as Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s. During the 1910 Mexican Revolution many Mexicans fled Mexico and settled in Sunset Heights.\n\n\n=== Northeast El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town is located north of central El Paso and east of the Franklin Mountains. Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like east El Paso and northwest El Paso, but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at Ft. Bliss in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at Andress High School, Parkland High School, Irvin High School, and Chapin High School.\n\n\n=== East El Paso ===\n\nThe area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population of over 200,000.

It is the third largest area of the city, behind east El Paso and central El Paso. Hawkins Road and Interstate 10 border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain).\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: Ysleta Mission-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), Socorro Mission-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and San Elizario Chapel (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King Philip II of Spain.\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n\n=== Texas and New Mexico suburbs ===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico.

The tower did use a design of the United States flag during the July 4 holidays, as well as the American hostage crisis of 1980, and was lit continuously following the September 11 attacks in 2001 until around 2006. During the Christmas holidays, a design of a Christmas tree was used, and at times, the letters \"UTEP\" were used to support University of Texas at El Paso athletics.

The first electrified line across the Rio Grande, which opened on January 11, 1902, was preceded by a network that relied on animal labor. The system quickly spread into residential and industrial areas of El Paso. In 1913, a 12-mile (19 km) interurban line was built to Ysleta. At the close of 1943, the holding company El Paso Electric sold its subsidiary, the El Paso Electric Railway Company and its Mexican counterpart, to one of National City Lines' subsidiaries. This resulted in the formation of El Paso City Lines, whose domestic streetcar lines were replaced by buses in 1947. The international streetcar line which crossed the border via the Stanton Street Bridge continued to operate until 1973. In 1977, El Paso City Lines and two other bus companies were bought by the municipality and merged to form Sun City Area Transit (SCAT). In 1987, SCAT restyled itself Sun Metro.\n\n\n==== El Paso Streetcar ====\nThe El Paso Streetcar is a streetcar system that opened for service on November 9, 2018, and uses a fleet of restored PCC streetcars that had served the city's previous system until its closure in 1974. The system covers 4.8 miles (7.7 km) (round trip) in two loops from Downtown El Paso to University of Texas at El Paso. The system was constructed under the authority of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, but when the major construction was completed, around spring 2018, it was transferred to Sun Metro, for operation and maintenance. As of 2016, construction of the system was projected to cost $97 million.\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\n\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of Nueva Espa\u00f1a, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe. Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area:\n\nBridge of the Americas, also known as the Cordova Bridge.\nGood Neighbor International Bridge, also known as the Stanton Street Bridge\nPaso del Norte International Bridge, also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge.\nYsleta\u2013Zaragoza International Bridge, also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.The city collects tolls at its international bridges.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of museums in West Texas\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Source notes ===\n\n\n== References ==\nHammond, John Hays (1935).

        "wiki": "El Paso (; Spanish: [el \u02c8paso] \"the pass\") is a city and the county seat of El Paso County, Texas, United States, in the far western part of the state. The 2019 population estimate for the city from the U.S. Census was 681,728, making it the 22nd largest city in the United States. Its metropolitan statistical area (MSA) covers all of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in Texas, and has a population of 840,758.El Paso stands on the Rio Grande across the Mexico\u2013United States border from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua with 1.4 million people. Las Cruces, in the neighboring U.S. state of New Mexico, has a population of 215,579. On the U.S. side, the El Paso metropolitan area forms part of the larger El Paso\u2013Las Cruces CSA, with a population of 1,060,397.Bi-nationally, these three cities form a combined international metropolitan area sometimes referred to as the Paso del Norte or the Borderplex. The region of 2.5 million people constitutes the largest bilingual and binational work force in the Western Hemisphere.The city is home to three publicly traded companies, and former Western Refining, now Andeavor. as well as home to the Medical Center of the Americas, the only medical research and care provider complex in West Texas and Southern New Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso, the city's primary university. The city hosts the annual Sun Bowl college football post-season game, the second oldest bowl game in the country.El Paso has a strong federal and military presence. William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Biggs Army Airfield, and Fort Bliss are located in the area. Fort Bliss is one of the largest military complexes of the United States Army and the largest training area in the United States. Also headquartered in El Paso are the DEA domestic field division 7, El Paso Intelligence Center, Joint Task Force North, United States Border Patrol El Paso Sector, and the U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group (SOG).\nIn 2010 and 2018, El Paso received an All-America City Award. El Paso ranked in the top three safest large cities in the United States between 1997 and 2014, including holding the title of safest city between 2011 and 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks. The evidence suggests 10,000 to 12,000 years of human habitation. The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. When the Spanish arrived, the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area. These were subsequently incorporated into the Mestizo culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from Comancher\u00eda, and gen\u00edzaros of various ethnic groups. The Mescalero Apache were also present.\nSpanish explorer Don Juan de O\u00f1ate was born in 1550 in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and was the first New Spain (Mexico) explorer known to have observed the Rio Grande near El Paso, in 1598, celebrating a Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (decades before the English Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). However, the four survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza, and his enslaved Moor Estevanico, are thought to have passed through the area in the mid-1530s. El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) was founded on the south bank of the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande), in 1659 by Fray Garcia de San Francisco. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the Pueblo Revolt, until 1692 when Santa Fe was reconquered and once again became the capital.\nThe Texas Revolution (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of Cross-border town naming until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring Anson Mills to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.During the Civil War, a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union California Column in 1862. It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.\nAfter the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow as Texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority. El Paso itself, incorporated in 1873, encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river. In the 1870s, a population of 23 non-Hispanic whites and 150 Hispanics was reported. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, the population boomed to 10,000 by the 1890 census, with many Anglo-Americans, recent immigrants, old Hispanic settlers, and recent arrivals from Mexico. The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild boomtown known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness. Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). With the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city's geographic position, the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the U.S. Southwest.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio D\u00edaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D\u00edaz.By 1910, the overwhelming number of people in the city were Americans creating a settled environment. However, this period was short-lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees \u2013 and capital \u2013 to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast Plan de San Diego which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens. The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives. These actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the end result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.Simultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000 and Non-Hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites. In reply, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund. In 1916, the Census Bureau reported El Paso's population as 53% Mexican and 44% Non-Hispanic whites. Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.During and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.The Farah Strike, 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas. This strike was originated and led by Chicanas, or Mexican American women, due to Farah Manufacturing Company, one of the largest factories in the city, being unorganized, low wages, discrimination, no benefits, lack of gender-neutrality, health and safety hazards, and unattainable quotas. Texas Monthly described the Farah Strike as the \"strike of the century.\"On August 3, 2019, a mass shooting/domestic terrorist attack committed by a white supremacist occurred at a Walmart in El Paso, which left 23 people dead and 23 others injured.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEl Paso is located at the intersection of three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua) and two countries (the U.S. and Mexico). It is the only major Texas city on Mountain Time. Ciudad Juarez was once in Central Time, but both cities are now on Mountain Time.\nEl Paso is closer to the capital cities of four other states \u2013 Phoenix, Arizona (345 miles (555 km) away); Santa Fe, New Mexico, (273 miles (439 km) away); Ciudad Chihuahua, Chihuahua, (218 miles (351 km) away), and Hermosillo, Sonora (325 miles (523 km) away) \u2013 than it is to the capital of its own state, Austin (528 miles (850 km) away). It is closer to Los Angeles, California (700 miles (1,100 km) away) than it is to Orange (858 miles (1,381 km) away), the easternmost town in the state.\nEl Paso is located within the Chihuahuan Desert, the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region. The Franklin Mountains extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the west side forms the beginnings of the Mesilla Valley, and the east side expands into the desert and lower valley. They connect in the central business district at the southern end of the mountain range.\nThe city's elevation is 3,800 ft (1,200 m) above sea level. North Franklin Mountain is the highest peak in the city at 7,192 ft (2,192 m) above sea level. The peak can be seen from 60 mi (100 km) in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local Coronado High School gets its mascot's name. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 256.3 square miles (663.7 km2).The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park, the largest urban park in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and El Paso International Airport.\nThe Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey, an example of a pluton, rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Nearby volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (50 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEl Paso has a transitional climate between cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk) and hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh) featuring hot summers, with little humidity, and cool to mild dry winters. Rainfall averages 9.7 in (250 mm) per year, much of which occurs during the summer from July through September, and is predominantly caused by the North American Monsoon. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes thunderstorms, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.\nThe sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the National Weather Service; from this, the city is nicknamed \"The Sun City\". Due to its arid, windy climate, El Paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season, particularly during the springtime between March and early May. With an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph (50 km/h) and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph (120 km/h), these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.\nEl Paso and the nearby mountains also receive snow. Weather systems have produced over one foot (30 cm) of snow on several occasions. In the 1982\u20131983 winter season, three major snowstorms produced record seasonal snowfall. On December 25\u201326, 1982, 6.0 inches (15 cm) of snow fell, producing a white Christmas for the city. This was followed by another 7.0 inches (18 cm) on December 30\u201331, 1982. On April 4\u20137, 1983, 16.5 inches (42 cm) of snow fell on El Paso, bringing the seasonal total to nearly 30 inches (76 cm). On December 13\u201314, 1987, a record storm dumped over 22 inches (56 cm) of snow on El Paso, and two weeks later (December 25\u201326), another three inches (7.6 cm) fell, bringing the monthly total for December 1987 to an all-time record high of 25.9 inches (66 cm) of snow.\nThe average annual snowfall for the city varies widely between different neighborhoods at different elevations, but is 6.1 inches (15 cm) at the airport (but with a median of 0, meaning most years see no snow at all). Snow is most rare around Ysleta and the eastern valley area, which usually include large numbers of palm trees; in the higher neighborhoods, palm trees are more vulnerable to snow and cold snaps and are often seen with brown, frost-damaged fronds.\nOne example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C), the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was 1 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C), breaking the 5 \u00b0F (\u221215 \u00b0C) monthly record low set during the cold wave of 1899. Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results. Two local power plants failed, forcing El Paso Electric to institute rolling blackouts over several days, and electric wires were broken, causing localised blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days.\nMonthly means range from 45.5 \u00b0F (7.5 \u00b0C) in December to 83.5 \u00b0F (28.6 \u00b0C) in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon arrives, while daily low temperatures typically peak in July or early August with the higher humidity the monsoon brings (translating to warmer nights). On average, there are 52 nights of at- or below-freezing lows, 109 days of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C)+ highs and 20 days of 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ highs annually; it is extremely rare for temperatures to stay below the freezing mark all day. The city's record high is 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on June 30, 1994, and its record low is \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) on January 11, 1962; the highest daily minimum was 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the National Weather Service since 1879.\n\n\n==== Flooding ====\nAlthough the average annual rainfall is only about 9.7 in (250 mm), many parts of El Paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms. In late July and early August 2006, up to 10 in (250 mm) of rain fell in a week, the flood-control reservoirs overflowed and caused major flooding citywide. The city staff estimated damage to public infrastructure at $21 million, and to private property (residential and commercial) at $77 million. Much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood-control dams and reservoirs, and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water.\n\n\n=== Time zone ===\nEl Paso is located in the far western corner of Texas, which is roughly the only part of the state that is located within the Mountain Time Zone, as opposed to the Central Time Zone.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Downtown and central El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town contains some of the city's oldest and most historic neighborhoods. Located in the heart of the city, it is home to approximately 44,993 people. Development of the area started in 1827 with the first resident, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a wealthy merchant from Paso del Norte (present day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), who built the region's first structure establishing Rancho Ponce within the vicinity of S. El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the Sunset Heights district. It is close to the El Paso International Airport, the international border, and Fort Bliss. It is part of the El Paso Independent School District.\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the white American residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. Hispanic-American residents lived in an area called Chihuahuita (\"little Chihuahua\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area. Another downtown neighborhood is El Segundo Barrio, which is near the United States/Mexico border.\n\n\n=== Northwest El Paso ===\n\nBetter known as West El Paso or the West Side, the area includes a portion of the Rio Grande floodplain upstream from downtown which is known locally as the Upper Valley and is located on the west side of the Franklin Mountains. The Upper Valley is the greenest part of the county due to the Rio Grande. The west side is home to some of the most affluent neighborhoods within the city, such as the Coronado Hills and Country Club neighborhoods. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of El Paso.\n\n\n=== West central El Paso ===\n\nWest central El Paso is located north of Interstate 10 and west of the Franklin Mountains. The University of Texas at El Paso and the Cincinnati Entertainment district are located in the heart of the area. Historic districts Kern Place and Sunset Heights are in this part of town.\nKern Place was founded in 1914 by Peter E. Kern, for whom the neighborhood was named.The homes of Kern Place are unique in architecture and some were built by residents themselves. One of the better known homes is the Paul Luckett Home located at 1201 Cincinnati Ave. above Madeline Park, and is made of local rock. It is known as \"The Castle\" due to its round walls and a crenelated rooftop.Kern Place is extremely popular with college and university students. The area is known for its glitzy entertainment district, restaurants and coffee shops who cater to both business patrons and university students. After UTEP's basketball and football games, UTEP fans pack the Kern Place area for food and entertainment at Cincinnati Street a small bar district. This bar scene has grown over the years and has attracted thousands to its annual Mardi Gras block party as well as after sporting events or concerts. Young men and women make up the majority of the crowds who stop in between classes or after work.Sunset Heights is one of the most historic areas in town, which has existed since the latter part of the 1890s. Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory, but many have been neglected and have deteriorated. During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, Doroteo Arango (also known as Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s. During the 1910 Mexican Revolution many Mexicans fled Mexico and settled in Sunset Heights.\n\n\n=== Northeast El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town is located north of central El Paso and east of the Franklin Mountains. Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like east El Paso and northwest El Paso, but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at Ft. Bliss in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at Andress High School, Parkland High School, Irvin High School, and Chapin High School.\n\n\n=== East El Paso ===\n\nThe area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population of over 200,000. It includes the 79936 ZIP Code, which was considered in 2013 as the most populous in the nation with over 114,000 people.\n\n\n=== Mission Valley ===\n\nFormerly known as the lower valley, it includes part of Eastside and all lower valley districts. It is the third largest area of the city, behind east El Paso and central El Paso. Hawkins Road and Interstate 10 border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain).\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: Ysleta Mission-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), Socorro Mission-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and San Elizario Chapel (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King Philip II of Spain.\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n\n=== Texas and New Mexico suburbs ===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico. The most populated suburbs in Texas are Socorro, Horizon City, Fort Bliss and San Elizario. Other Texas suburbs are Anthony, Canutillo, Sparks, Fabens, and Vinton.\nAlthough Anthony, Santa Teresa, Sunland Park, and Chaparral lie adjacent to El Paso County, they are considered to be part of the Las Cruces, New Mexico metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings ===\n\nEl Paso's tallest building, the Wells Fargo Plaza, was built in the early 1970s as State National Plaza. The black-windowed, 302-foot (92 m) building is famous for its 13 white horizontal lights (18 lights per row on the east and west sides of the building, and seven bulbs per row on the north and south sides) that were lit at night.

The last to be removed was KTLA in the fall of 2006 as a consequence of the WB-UPN merger into The CW, when KVIA-TV launched a digital subchannel with the network's programming.\nEl Paso's current television stations are as shown in the list below:\n\nKDBC 4.1 (CBS)\nKDBC-TV 4.2 (TBD)\nMeTV 4.3 (MeTV)\nKDBC-TV 4.4 (Dabl)\nKVIA 7.1 (ABC)\nKVIA-TV 7.2 (CW)\nKVIA-TV 7.3 (Ion)\nKVIA-TV 7.4 (Azteca)\nKTSM-TV 9.1 (NBC)\nKTSM-TV 9.2 (Estrella)\nKTSM-TV 9.3 (Escape)\nKTSM-TV 9.4 (Laff)\nKCOS 13.1 (PBS)\nKCOS13 13.2 (EPCC TV)\nKCOS13 13.3 (Create)\nKCOS13 13.4 (CITY-15)\nKFOX-TV 14.1 (FOX)\nKFOX-TV 14.2 (Comet)\nKFOX-TV 14.3 (Charge)\nKFOX-TV 14.4 (Stadium)\nKINT-TV 26.1 (Univision)\nKINT-TV 26.2 (Grit)\nKINT-TV 26.3 (LATV)\nKINT-TV 26.4 (Bounce)\nKTDO 48.1 (Telemundo)\nKTFN 65.1 (UniM\u00e1s)\nKTFN 65.2 (Justice Network)\nKTFN 65.3 (Quest)\n\n\n=== Cellular phone coverage ===\nKTSM-TV reports that cellular phone users in El Paso may be subject to international calling fees.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n\nEl Paso is the medical hub of West Texas and Southern New Mexico, hosting numerous state-of-the-art medical centers.

I-10 is also a connector to Interstate 25, which connects with the cities of Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Colorado Springs, Denver, Fort Collins, Cheyenne, Casper, and north to the junction with I-90, located in Buffalo, Wyoming.\n US Highway 54: Officially called the Patriot Freeway, it is also known as the North-South Freeway. A business route runs along Dyer Street, the former US 54, from the freeway near Fort Bliss to the Texas\u2013New Mexico border, where it again rejoins the expressway. The original US 54 was a transcontinental route connecting El Paso with Chicago.\n US Highway 62: Santa Fe Street south of Paisano Drive concurrently runs with US 85, Paisano Drive east of Santa Fe Street to Montana Avenue, then Montana Avenue concurrently with US 180.\n US Highway 85: Santa Fe Street south of Paisano Drive concurrently runs with US 62 and Paisano Drive west of Santa Fe Street to I-10.\n US Highway 180: Montana Avenue is a bypass route to the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex to the east, and Flagstaff, Arizona to the west.\n SH 20: Alameda Avenue (formerly US 80), Texas Avenue, Mesa Street and Doniphan Drive\n SH 178: Artcraft Road in northwest El Paso extends from Interstate 10 west to the New Mexico state line, at which point it becomes New Mexico Highway 136, the Pete V. Domenici International Highway.\n Loop 375: Texas Highway Loop 375 encircles the city of El Paso. Between Interstate 10 and Fort Bliss, including the stretch that crosses the Franklin Mountains via Smuggler's Pass, it is TransMountain Road. In the Ft. Bliss Military Reservation between northeast and east El Paso, it is officially the Purple Heart Memorial Highway. In east El Paso, the north- and south-bound sections are known as Joe Battle Boulevard, or simply as \"the Loop\". South of I-10, in the east and westbound portion, it is known as the Cesar Chavez Border Highway, a four-lane expressway which is located along the Mexico\u2013U.S. border between downtown El Paso and the Ysleta area.\n Spur 601: Once known as the Inner Loop, it was officially named the Liberty Expressway by the El Paso City Council in April 2010 at the request of then Fort Bliss commander Maj. Gen. Howard Bromberg. It was fully completed on April 27, 2011; it connects the Patriot Freeway (US 54) and Biggs Army Airfield to the Purple Heart Memorial Highway (Loop 375).\n North Loop Road, as well as Delta Drive between North Loop Road and Alameda Avenue (Texas Highway 20)\n Zaragoza Road, running more or less north from the Ysleta International Bridge to US 62\u2013180 (Montana Avenue), it lies mostly in east El Paso.\n Texas Farm-to-Market Road 3255 runs north from US 54 to the New Mexico state line in northeast El Paso and bears the city street name Martin Luther King Boulevard.\nBorder West Expressway under construction (as of 2018), parallel to I-10 through downtown and the west side.\n\n\n==== Mass transit ====\nThe Sun Metro Mass Transit System operates a system of medium- to large-capacity natural gas-powered buses all around the city of El Paso.El Paso County Transit makes trips with small-capacity buses mainly in the eastern El Paso area.\nIn 2011, Sun Metro was named the most outstanding public transit system of the year in all of North America for a mid-size transit system by the American Public Transportation Association.\nOn September 1, 2009, NMDOT Park and Ride began operating commuter bus service to and from Las Cruces, New Mexico.Historically, El Paso and Ciudad Juarez had a shared streetcar system with a peak electrified route mileage of 64 miles (103 km) in 1920. The first electrified line across the Rio Grande, which opened on January 11, 1902, was preceded by a network that relied on animal labor. The system quickly spread into residential and industrial areas of El Paso. In 1913, a 12-mile (19 km) interurban line was built to Ysleta. At the close of 1943, the holding company El Paso Electric sold its subsidiary, the El Paso Electric Railway Company and its Mexican counterpart, to one of National City Lines' subsidiaries. This resulted in the formation of El Paso City Lines, whose domestic streetcar lines were replaced by buses in 1947. The international streetcar line which crossed the border via the Stanton Street Bridge continued to operate until 1973. In 1977, El Paso City Lines and two other bus companies were bought by the municipality and merged to form Sun City Area Transit (SCAT). In 1987, SCAT restyled itself Sun Metro.\n\n\n==== El Paso Streetcar ====\nThe El Paso Streetcar is a streetcar system that opened for service on November 9, 2018, and uses a fleet of restored PCC streetcars that had served the city's previous system until its closure in 1974. The system covers 4.8 miles (7.7 km) (round trip) in two loops from Downtown El Paso to University of Texas at El Paso. The system was constructed under the authority of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, but when the major construction was completed, around spring 2018, it was transferred to Sun Metro, for operation and maintenance. As of 2016, construction of the system was projected to cost $97 million.\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\n\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of Nueva Espa\u00f1a, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe. Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area:\n\nBridge of the Americas, also known as the Cordova Bridge.\nGood Neighbor International Bridge, also known as the Stanton Street Bridge\nPaso del Norte International Bridge, also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge.\nYsleta\u2013Zaragoza International Bridge, also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.The city collects tolls at its international bridges.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of museums in West Texas\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Source notes ===\n\n\n== References ==\nHammond, John Hays (1935).

          "Had a birthday party for my grandson here. Having rented other venues for birthday parties, I thought this was the best deal by far. The tacos are the best in El paso, the party attendant was attentive and friendly. The attractions included made the grandkids have a blast. The",

          "Look; there is mini-golf, bumper boats, video games and other fun things. But the reason most people go to Adventure Zone 99% of the time are for their tacos. Mouth watering, delicious tacos.",
          "Good place for a fun time",
          "Got to work on the pizza.  It was horrible.  Wings were good.",
          "I really enjoyed coming for sensory sensitivity day. My son enjoyed the rides. I wish the equipment wasn't so old. Our go kart kept shutting off on it's own.",
          "Good tacos.",
          "We had fun on the miniature golf",
          "I have a large family with 5 kids ranging from ages 4 to 10 and they had a blast. Honestly a great place for kids. They have go kart racing, bumper boats, mini golf, an arcade room and food. Kid friendly food (burgers, nuggets, pizza, grilled cheese, corn dogs and tacos) it's cheaply priced as well and they even sell beer!",
          "The mimi golf was fun and the arcade is huge. But the pizza is not very good.",
          "What do I have to say, get the tacos! Great price for take out dinner and super fun for the whole family!",
          "Awesome place, staff was super friendly and attentive.",
          "Bumper boats were better than the go carts and the escape room was missing stuff",
          "We did a party reservation for 12+ kids and it went very good! We would highly recomend this place",
          "First time there.  To tacos were great.  Water boats looked like fun.",
          "Nice place to spend a couple of hours with your grandchildren",
          "Some of the machines didn't work at all and the ones that did half of them didn't give tickets! We spend lots of money for games and outside rides the person's at register never told us we could buy a bracelets for $16 till after we bought \u2026",
          "You can come in for free and pay as you go. We put some money on a card and my son played the games inside. He loved it. There are some small rides for young kids to go on for free. The weather wasn't great so we didn't go outside.",
          "Most games are broken, I don't think you should go unless you're ok with broken/uncalibrated games",
          "It was amazing.but me and my friends had to wait for the Junior rides to go and he only wrap me in while the other people had to wait until the the Junior riders were off then he strapped other people in.",

          "What can i said,  over cook nuggets. Not that great.",
          "Kids loved it! Fun games!",
          "Fun place for the kids. The pizza was ok. We went on a pretty warm day and inside the building wasn't cool enough for comfort.",

          "Competitive Mini and Fun Go-Cart Racing",
          "The place was not organized. We were told that once the food was ready they were going to call out our name, they never did. The food got cold and nasty.  The order was not correct, we ordered 3 times and Krystal could not get the order right.",
          "Adventure zone was overall just fun.",
          "Perfect for parents with little kiddos.",
          "Something fun to do in EP,  a bit pricey.",
          "Excellent place to bring kids. My six year son loves this place, he can't get enough of the mini golf and go karts.",
          "It was fun BUT it was very unorganized when throwing a party. Party room was tiny. And its not really a place for kids under 10 bc they can't do much outside and half the games inside were off! (Pics are of all the games off) and games were expensive and the prizes to use tickets on were ridiculous.",
          "It was good the rides and stuff but the food was terrible the pizza was super greasy and the dough still had flour on it. I was super sketchy about it and told one of the workers about it and they said it wasn\u2019t raw flour. So we were eating \u2026",
          "Nothing fun really. Put putt to old",
          "Lots of fun games, golf and carts.",

          "It's ok place, this did not meet my expectations...",
          "Love their salsa",
          "Bad value for the money in the arcade. ......$20 in games for 7 plays and walked out it $0.50 worth of prizes. Only reason two stars is given is the value for mini golf. Will not be returning.",
          "Bought unlimited 2hrs of arcade games and half of the machines weren\u2019t working!!!...The shooting games had messed up guns!! The guitar hero games didn\u2019t have working guitars!! \nThe basketball games had balls with no air!!!...Bad place! I dislike it and don\u2019t recommend it.and the outside area sucks even more!!!",
          "This place is pretty cool. They run a lot of specials. Place is needs a bit of work, but doesn't interfere with the fun.",
          "Much improved.\nThey have redone the arcade, all the games seems to work and have more current titles.  Mini golf course has been repaired and has new turf.  Staff friendly.   Still a few  fountains not working outdoors and the new arcade system makes you pay a dollar for a credits card.",
          "We just moved here and were looking for a place to take the kids. Both of my kids absolutely love it!! The arcade is fully stocked with so many good games, and the outdoor activities are a blast. My son absolutely loves the bumper boats and \u2026",
          "The whole family really enjoyed themselves. We didnt eat there because of the condition of the tables and restrooms both being very dirty. But the go-carts were super fun and the arcade had a decent selection. Bumper boats wouldve been a bit more enjoyable if the water didnt smell so badly and leave a residual odor on your clothes.",
          "I volunteered to help my son's school take his grade level for a field trip and it was my first time there.  It's a neat little place for the kids to go.",
          "Great family fun!",
          "We had an amazing birthday party this weekend! My son and all 20+  family and friends had fun! Our hostess was kind and very helpful! I do however wish we had an option to get a bigger room seeming how we did pay for the biggest package! ",
          "It was fun but just no shade whatsoever. It's great to go but when you go Mini Golfing and there's no shade you feel hot and sluggish",
          "We had a groupon gift card and it was so worth it . The kids had so much fun. The only thing was when we asked a cashier what the fun card covered she got frustrated and a manager had to step in and assist her.  The manager had great customer service tho .",
          "The best crispy homemade tacos!... The salsa has great taste too, not spicy at all though. They have them for $1 on Thursdays. ",
          "Had fun with my 17teen year old daughter.",
          "My kids loved it and the staff were all very nice",
          "Was a great idea had to operate the bumper boats on my own cause no one was out side. the whole premise of the place is the go carts, mini golf and bumper boats and no one was outside! and after messing around with my family for about 30 \u2026",
          "Excellent place to kill time with the family, try to get the Groupon discount better value for the money. Really liked the idea of having credits in a card plus the tickets won. The only thing that bugs me is the golf course needs some maintenance done.",
          "We came here for mini golfing.  We had a fun time",
          "Amazing Tacos! We love Ausome Sundays where everything everything is sensory friendly! Also they are a certified autism friendly business \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Fun place to play with the family and friends.",
          "The upgrades are nice and it's a lot cleaner than before. Tacos are still amazing! New play card is simple to use but one does miss the excitement of seeing tickets spew out after a big win. Overall, still a fun place to visit. Bumper boats, go karts, and mini golf are available outdoors.",
          "I had a whole lot of fun at the Go Carts! The French Fries were very good tasting!\n \ud83d\udcaf recommend!",
          "Nice workers and good affordable food!!",
          "We think that is Similar to Bob O's so we think that is Ok!!",
          "Went here with the family on a Groupon. We figured if the place wasn't great it wasn't a ton of money lost. However, the staff was friendly and helpful, food was good and the games worked.  Also, their mini golf had fishing nets to help you \u2026",
          "I visit just for the Tacos that are the best in all of El Paso.",
          "DELICIOUS TACOS!",
          "Decent prices and fun for smaller kids. However the place has let itself go. The game room has older and dying games, some that do not work. Really all the place needs is a fresh coat of paint and new games.",
          "Kids will enjoy lot..",
          "Went there for a my girls baby shower, great service, great prices and lots of fun.",
          "Great place to take the kids for some outdoor activities. They have pretty good go karts and the bumper boats are nice. They also have a mini golf course and arcade games. The place looks well taken care of. They so serve beer and wine for \u2026",
          "Not a bad place! An El Paso staple that\u2019s for sure. Not much has changed but it\u2019s still enjoyable and at a decent price",
          "Awful food and slow service. The games are fine.",
          "First time there we had a good time. We are visiting from Tucson Arizona",
          "Had a great time here I would highly recommend it for families or for parties birthday parties or just for fun event to go out to you know an outing it's a very fun place to go to and you can enjoy everything that they have there with your family and it's affordable as well when you get like a combo",
          "Great and fun place to be with the family ..",
          "Good fun nice place",
          "This place is run down.  Several games barley work or don't work.  Go-karts barley run, smoke, and stop running on the track.  Owner taking people's money and obviously not investing it back into the business.  Last time to visit this place.",
          "Had not been here before, so my experience here was ok,  the day I went it if was full of kids which was hard to mini golf , go karts keeped breaking down , over all it was ok. Probably better suited for 18 and under families more.",
          "Pretty awesome place we had fun and most important my boys had lots of fun. Its a clean good priced place to have fun I totally recomend it if you have kids or if your feeling like one. I have lots of fun when I come here.",
          "I had my son party here over the weekend. For the most part it went well till it was time to go outside. There was 3 party at the same time the 1st party to have the pinata wasnt even outside yet and I had all my party outside waiting. And \u2026",
          "If anything you want to come to this place for the tacos. Which are a $1 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. But it's also the better of the two mini golf places in town.",
          "They steal your money with all their broken games",
          "Customer service was horrible. The pizza had a finger nail in it. Not to mention the way they treat their workers is disgusting. The go cart are all dirty through the inside and full of mud.",
          "We went there for my daughter's birthday and We really had a Great time! Most of the employees were so patient And helpful I like that. The only thing that really turned me off was when I went to the counter to ask for water and there was 2 \u2026",
          "We've been there about 6 times for school field trips. Every time, the kids wait I'm line for about 1 hour because Adventure Zone always books 4 schools for one day. Horrible experience for the kiddos. We're there for 4 hours....2 hours \u2026",
          "Fun and cool rides but not very informative on the specials so it cost us a big amount of money",
          "Had a great time at the music festival and great tacos",

          "Very friendly staff...son loves it!",
          "Its cool for kids 8 and up but if you have little ones between 2-7 they can't ride anything unless their really tall. They can play golf and that is fun for them",

          "The greatest place to have fun and great food.",
          "I was really impressed with the go karts! Everything seemed very well maintained. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Moreover the go kart attendants really cared about safety. I felt like I could let my kid ride them without being nervous.",
          "It was ok. We went for an afternoon birthday party in the afternoon, in May. It was very hot and the main tables outside had no shade, except for the 3 umbrella tables, whose umbrellas were closed. Kids had fun, unsupervised mostly. Employees were mostly attentive and helpful.",
          "We played mini golf and did a quest along with having taco for lunch.",
          "Not very impressed. Game area looked exciting but then you play and the games don\u2019t work and not worth it. The employees and manager looked like they hated every minute of being there. Will not be returning.",
          "I will admit they could use a few more attractions but overall we had fun. The games and tickets make up for it. Oh and the food wasnt bad either. We will definitely be going back!",
          "A lot of fun and good for the family",
          "Make sure you're wearing shoes! They no longer allow Sandals without straps.",

          "Best place to tale my kids for fun! My favorite p art is that they are certified an autism friendly business",
          "Expensive, if you pay per ride, also a bit pricey if you buy the bracelet.",
          "Wouldn't mind the prices if all the games worked, they cleaned up the golf course and the go carts wait wasn't so long! Also,needs some music to liven up the place a bit. Workers are friendly and courteous, good with kids!!",

          "Nice people and fun place.",
          "Had a blast with the family!",
          "Great games for decent price. I like the point system. Just wish they would update the western shootout game to something else. It's old and is hardly used.",
          "Once we entered adventurer zone sum kid sprayed us with water then we ordered a beer and it taisted old \ud83d\ude24 then we orded pizza my looked like it was half bitten and the crust is like paper thin \ud83d\udc7f this place is an adventure but not a good one..",

          "I live on the east side and usually stay there but this place was available and willing to cater to our needs unlike our bolling areas on our side. this is the 2nd time I'm here and Jonathan in the go_carts was attentive and polite. Rating is for Jonathan!",
          "Great value compared to places like Dave and Busters. The game selection was good, and the mini golf and go karts can be had with a wrist band or purchased individually. The food selection is actually pretty robust for a place that I \u2026",
          "Wasn't very impressed. Me and my daughter looked around then left. We wanted to ride the go carts but there was not even any other people riding them so we would have been on the track by ourself.",
          "Love the food. Alright attractions, I spend most of my time on the go karts.",
          "The most disgusting overpriced pizza one can purchase!  The Taco plate looked horrible as well, although, my husband said that the taco's tasted decent!  Absolutely overpriced disgusting food!  A lot better off going to Peter Piper Pizza or Chuck E. Cheese's for food and fun!  Only decent thing at this place are the outside activities!",
          "Golf course is not in great shape. Employees not cleaning up outside food area. Trash blown all over, cups and plates left on tables for hours. Not really interested in going back.  Prices were affordable.. I guess you pay for what you get.",

          "Was invited to a party, and party rooms for the price are not reasonable considering most your competitors offer the same price or 30-50$ more and you get a much bigger space,  staffs age truly shows, not a single manager stepped in to \u2026",

It was located in Ascarate Park in El Paso, Texas from 1960 until 2006, but after conflicts with El Paso County, owner Pat Thompson decided to move it to Sunland Park where the owner of Sunland Park Casino donated land right across from his casino.\n\nIt is home to the rides the Hurricane, Tsunami, El Bandido Roller Coaster, Paratrooper, Round up, Tilt-a Whirl, Pharaoh's Fury, Scrambler, Himalaya, and more. \nThe park is opened seasonally, usually March to October. It opens only during the weekends for most of the season, except for summer, its peak season, when they also open during the week.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMagic Landing, former rival\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nWestern Playland at the Roller Coaster DataBase31.803043\u00b0N 106.559878\u00b0W\ufeff / 31.803043; -106.559878",

          "We took my granddaughter and two of her friends. We got there when it was still quite early and there were no lines at the attractions. The ride would last less than 2 minutes. When I was a young girl, not only would they last longer but they would also go backwards on some",
          "Took the grandkids ages 11-3 and they had the best time. Lines weren't long and the weather was great.",
          "I go often with my grandchildren. It is always clean and the staff are friendly. Most are local students in high school or in the university. Have always been kind and patient with the little ones. Rides seem to be well maintained and the grounds are in good shape. This",
          "The park offers an adequate variety of rides for kids of all ages, teenagers and adults. Park is Priced very well. We more than got our moneys worth with the bracelet. No long lines. Kids are able to ride their favorite ride over and over. Felt very safe, was able to sit down",
          "Located right outside of El Paso TX this amusement park is not anything exciting or amusing more of a place for kids to go. One roller coaster and one nice water ride. Dollar days are the best days to go! I wouldn't pay full price tho. There is no shaded areas also so make sure",
          "I rather spend my money on Six Flags than this Carnival Amuestment Park. Roller Coasters aren\u2019t even thrilling , the roller coasters are more tailored to kids than adults. I have purchased the Six Flags Membership and has endless amounts of benefits purchasing this than going",
          "I love that the new location keeps everything so closed together. The rides are perfect for all ages-something for everyone. Bring plenty of bug spray, and really, you can visit in the evening when the summer sun goes down as you can pretty much do everything in a matter of",
          "Really not worth the time. Very few rides and really not much there at all. It is the only game in town as far as amusement parks go , so really no competition. Your children will be board very fast here.",
          "When Western Playland was located at Ascarate Park it was pretty lame. The present location is even worse! It is slightly better than the traveling carnival. I took an 8 and 10 year old and they were disappointed and bored in less than 30 minutes. In my opinion, it isn't worth",
          "Our family visits Western Playland several times a year. The amusement park is on a large lot and all the rides are spread out nicely. My youngest enjoys the kiddie section. The best part about the entire park is that the lines are very short for all rides. This is because there",
          "Western Playland has offers good price for hours of fun for you family. Short lines which allows children to ride multiples times.",
          "This is not for the anxious! Some of the rides are almost prehistoric and look as the have been there for 200 years already. The entrance fee is very low but the fun, especially for younger kids, is great. They've also got a roller coaster for the little ones. If you're into",
          "When we were kids, going to the original Western Playland at Ascarate was a real treat. Even though we now live hundreds of miles away, bringing our kids each May was a fun tradition they all looked forward to. The newer location at Sunland Park was a difficult transition, but",
          "Plenty of rides from toddlers to adults age groups. Only few shaded areas, take hat, umbrella, suntain lotion, call to find out if you can take your drinks and lunch. Log water ride is a great way to cool off, train available, but you still have to walk to get to rides, take",
          "too expensive and not enough rides. Don't waste your $ going here; if you have little ones there are very little stuff they can enjoy same w/ teens. don't",
          "it is a great option to take your kids on a weekend, at the end it is a little pricey but kids will have a blast",
          "When they were at Ascarate Park it was better as there were trees and shade. Now at their current location the trees have not grown enough to provide relief from the intense sun during El Paso's summers.",
          "Wetsern Playland is an El Paso staple for local children growing up. They have many rides as well as some arcade games. Lines are usually not too long of a wait on busy weekends. It is not a spectacular amusement park but it is very enjoyable. You can also enjoy foods, treats,",
          "I gave it a 'very good' because with their size and limited space they do a good job with what they have. They employees are very nice for the most part but the very few rotten apples stand out. I would like to see some smoking areas because the nicotine slaves are going to",
          "It is not Six Flags, It is not Disneyland, nor do they claim to be. It is just a fun place to go with older / smaller rides. Wish they had more trees for shade. We enjoyed ourselves. It about as expensive as going to baseball game. Will gladly go back. Its better at night when",
          "A long standing El Paso amusement park. Always fun. Decent rides, with a few new ones added. Always good for family and friends.",
          "In a place where fairs don't occur, this place is a great replacement! Our 4 yr old daughter had so much fun here! There were a lot of rides she could do and she loves them all! Definitely would recommend for small children.",
          "It's a fun place for local teenagers even though it only has about 6 big rides. A few hours will do. Across the street is a casino for the adults .",
          "sucks lousy park its ok but too small no treese all sand and dirt really don't like elpaso no really good rides",
          "It used to be at Ascarate Park and was beautiful. It is now in the desert and just is boring as can be. We took an out of town guest and he was bored out of his mind.",
          "One of the best old time places to have family fun. Close to the race track and close to the mall. Prices are fair and family friendly.",
          "Imagine if you had your own personal amusement park! This is it! We went on a Thu night after the hot day cooled off. It was nice because we seldom had to wait more than one ride cycle. You can easily get through a dozen rides in 3 hours and still have time for food!",
          "only amusement park in the city, it gives us a chance to play and have fun in the sun. very litle shade, not many games but distracts us from the everyday routine..",
          "Western Playland is way over amazing the rides r so cool like the Drop-Zone its the scariest ride there than all the other rides. But it's better if u go at night its way better cause u can see \ud83d\udc40 all the lights \ud83c\udf86\u2734\u2733\u2b50\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf20",
          "The first thing I noticed about the park was the cleanliness. The park was very clean and very tidy. I really liked that there was a lot of shade and that you could take food and drinks. There were shaded areas and seats. There were grass areas you could sit at also. The staff",

          "This amusement park is full of rides that are more like carnival rides than an actual amusement park. There are however, two roller coasters and a log type ride. We went on Labor Day weekend and the lines were not bad at all. At most we waited 10 minutes in line and that was for",

          "Reduced admission in the summer if you go on a Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday evening. Personally, I would never pay full admission price for this park. It would be nice if they would offer a family membership for the season, but they do not. This amusement park is more \"old",
          "Had my daughter's birthday party there, it kept them all busy having fun till they closed. Only one fall back when you get a birthday package there is really no one there making sure you have everything you need , you have to stay on top of them and track them down for service.",
          "I really like the amusement park, even though it is small compared to others. I wish El Paso could have a bigger amusement park, but I can assure you that this amusement park can make you have a good time all day! There are so many rides for the whole family, but the thing that",
          "For someone who's grown up and lived in El Paso all their lives, it's known that there are no theme parks around here except for this one and Wet-n-wild. The park is fun and the rides aren't to bad, but in the middle of the summer there is hardly any shade and the drinks are",

          "If you are bored and have nothing else to do then this might be for you. Other wise Id avoid it. The rides look like they are falling apart they are so old. Not really any shade to hide from the sun, water fountains put out lava rather than water. Staff isnt friendly. Not really",

          "Went with my kids this past weekend and they had a blast.... the food was reasonable...the rides were  just enough and it wasn\u2019t expensive to get in the park. At first glance I was concerned that the park wasn\u2019t big enough and wouldn\u2019t be enough to entertain my teenagers but boy was I wrong\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
          "Nice pass time place. Very reasonably priced.. decent crowd. Not too long wait at each ride.. every ride is very very exciting enough..",
          "It was very nice only reason giving a 3 because they need more rides for the whole family to go on together",
          "Family fun should have more rides. Very clean through out the whole park very friendly staff and fast to get in all rides. Prices for food are reasonable. Overall good to take the family for fun \ud83d\ude42",
          "Simple but yet so fun and affordable",
          "Today was a horrible experience! First there was no parking! Lines were supper long! My son only rode two rides! They ran out of cotton candy!",
          "Celebrated the girls birthday! It was lots of fun for everyone!",
          "Place is awesome to take the kids. Wish they had more trees for shade. Also massive mosquito infestation",
          "A employee on 4/6/2019 was extremely rude. When the front lady gives you a unwarrented attitude before you enter the park, it totally ruins your experience.  You guys need a different person at the door, not this one.\n\nIll gladly turn this \u2026",
          "Awesome place to be although it needs more rides hopefully the owners expand their amusement park it would be awesome to see it grow bigger and bigger",
          "Awesome....get the bracelet for unlimited rides... Even if you don't think you'll use it you will.",
          "Needs to renovate, add lights and more fun attractions",
          "Great place to take the family! Drink lots of fluids if you go on a hot day! Great rides and lots of exercise",

          "Such a blast! Lines a little long but fun.",
          "Went with my son this past weekend and we definitely had a blast even tho there wasn't that many rides that my 3 year old could ride.\n Very clean and friendly staff. Food prices were reasonable. If you planning on staying until they close please take \"OFF\" mosquitoes are bad.",
          "Good time, very clean park.",
          "I love all the rides especially the log and the spinner with music",
          "My family and I love to spending a whole afternoon, going through every ride of possible.  Also, their birthday food packages are very reasonable (plus, you get an entire amusement park for you and your guests)!",
          "Fun place to go in El Paso.  I just wish there was more shade. The train ride would also be way better with some upgraded scenery.\nAlways a blast for the kids!",
          "It was pretty fun!",
          "So fun hope you have fun too",
          "Its a nice fair",

          "love it during the weekend!!! $1admittion and tickets!!! Cant beat that",
          "Rides are ok, train ride is a reflection of the baron landscape they inhabit, and I miss the haunted house ride",
          "One of our party guests got hurt on one of the rides. She fell of the frog ride and cut her chin open The school kids running the rides need a lot more training. They dont even have a first aid kit! Please train your employees on how to handle accidents better. Thank you.",
          "Wonderful variety of rides for various ages of children. This was perfect for our family with a youngest of 5 and oldest of 13. Both of them enjoyed their respective rides and it was a good value for the extended trip. Wouldn't pay the \u2026",
          "Great family place",
          "I grew up going to western playland and I came back for vacation and I gotta say it's a little wimp on the rides. Not much to do but my kids enjoyed themselves. I gave it a 3 stars cuz they took the ferris wheel out and some of the rides were not operating. For the price I'd hope to ride all of them.",
          "Fun park. Needs more shade.",
          "Had a great time and for the price.. It was worth every penny... No long lines to wait for the rides...",
          "NEEDS TO BE UPDATED IN THE LAST 10 YEARS THERE HAS BEEN ONLY ABOUT 1 OR 2 NEW RIDES AND NOW LITTLE KIDS RIDES ARE NOT INCLUDED, ALL THE RIDES SEEM VERY SKETCHY. THIS RIDE NEED MORE THRILLS AND AN UPDATE BUT I GUESS FOR 20 BUCKS WHAT CAN I \u2026",
          "Reminds me of a traveling carnival, but in a permanent area.The rides are antiquated and very classic.(well taken care of) Good selection  of rides for young kids. Staff is friendly and very nice. Area is clean but the weeds around the park \u2026",
          "Great place for family and friends. If you plan to come on a holiday like the 4th of July, come early because later on in the day you can expect long lines everywhere. Still worth it though. Kids cant wait to see the firework show!!!",
          "Very nice and we had a good time",
          "Lots of fun and great prices! The churros are amazing and low price as well. We'll definitely be coming back!",
          "My son absolutely loved having his birthday party here at western playland tonight!  The girls were amazing and had good service, took care of my family .",
          "Love this place!!\nThe people working there are so helpful and it's a safe place for my kids to be. It's clean and FUN!!",
          "This place is fun and adorable, like the amusement park in Monopoly Junior. My 2yo and 4yo had an amazing time because there were about a dozen rides for them- most places only have 2 or 3 rides for little ones, at best. My 4yo could ride \u2026",
          "We visited over spring break and our two kids (ages 4 and 6) had a great time.  The park was very clean and the staff was very courteous.  There were hardly any lines except on one ride and we waited no longer than 5 minutes for most of the \u2026",
          "Not enough shade. Coasters don't seem very safe",
          "My only complaint is there was not enough shade. Put some covers for the benches and plant some more trees",

          "Great fun for the whole family",
          "Our daughter had a great time to the point of exhaustion for us all...",
          "Great place for the breaks, but it could use some new updates. More shade, more trees that aren't dead, and NEW rides. Bring back the train tunnel! Make the Himalaya go backwards again! They can aso use water rides:/ were in a dessert.",
          "Great deals for the summer. Had a great time! At a good price",
          "It is a nice place to spend 4th of July evening or just to have fun with the family and friends. There is plenty of space to park and the staff are very friendly and helpful.",
          "Park is kept clean. Prices are reasonable even on the food. It was fun to go on the rides with my kids.",
          "Awesome fun place to go with the kiddos.",
          "This is one of two theme parks El Paso has to offer. The rides are good,  but most of them are mild attractions. They have two rollercoasters, which are good, but the rest of the rides just go in circles. Overall it is a good experience if you come with family and friends.",
          "Awesome place for family fun",
          "Staff at the concession stands are rude but otherwise great place to spend the day with family",
          "The rides are okay, there's plenty of food stands and restrooms. There is an entire section of rides for small children. The dollar nights are the best time to go. Group events can be reserved in a special area for cook outs and similar. \u2026",
          "It is cool, the games, but some of the things are expensive,  when i went last year it was 15 dll now it has raisen up\ud83d\ude12",
          "My family had so much fun!! My kids ages 3&8 were able to get on most rides. Very worth it!",
          "Kids had lots  off fun until it got crowded!  They need new system at the snack stands waited in  line for 30 minutes for 1 bottle of water! Also they could add more stuff it's looked the same for decades!",
          "Great price, super fun!",
          "Had a great time with family!!",
          "I had a great time!!! The lines were fairly fast!! It was very well maintained. A great fun place!!",
          "Its fun for your family to visit",
          "Best time on dollar nights",
          "The park is nice and clean with plenty of restrooms. Fairly priced and TONS of fun. I have memories at Western Playland from when I was a child both with family and friends. It's a unique place in El Paso, pretty much a landmark. \n\nI\u2019m sure \u2026",
          "Itd alright \nNot dollar rides anymore \nBut kids had fun",
          "Good rides",
          "Always fun.  For little and older kids  plus adults.  The rides are decent.  The prices are ok.   They need a season pass option.",

          "it's so fun.",
          "Fun rides and good food.",
          "Fun",
          "Only downfall...they do not allow coolers in the park.",
          "Fun times with the family.",
          "It's simply super",
          "This is a great place for kids, teens, and adults. They have great prices and the line to get on rides is not too bad. It's not a place to bring toddlers nor infants. There is not much for them to do but sit in a stroller and eat. A play area would be a great addition. ",
          "Nice people and enjoyable rides",
          "A lot of fun for our family and it was beyond reasonable with their dollar days promotion. Kids are looking forward to visiting again soon!",
          "Had a good time, but my only complaint is how the workers move at a snails pace and allow the lines to pick up. Tsunami only had one cart which made for a longer wait.",
          "This was an extremely good and well-run medium-sized Park. They have 4 roller coasters & a number of flat rides. Things were well taken care of and they have some midweek specials that are exceptionally inexpensive to take in the park.  Things were clean and staff was very friendly.",
          "Slowly updating their rides, doesn't feel like a big amusement park but decent for what it is",
          "Not wat it used 2 be but still fun \ud83d\udc4d",
          "It\u2019s suck a fun place",
          "It's no Six flags but with that said there is almost no wait on some rides. One down side the owners don't really invest in the park. They have had the same rides since they where in El Paso.",
          "It was amazing I had the time of my life.\nI loved the ride tsunami, I recommend u to try it.",
          "The most scary/fun places I ever went to in my life sanitation is up and is a great amusement park basically",
          "Great fun! Not overcrowded like theme parks.",
          "You pay 21 dollars for a bracelet and when a little wind comes they wanna shut down rides for hours. Really like there is so much to choose from already lol. It's the windy city for a reason. Owner is ridiculous for doing that. Yo Yo and the others all shut down because of just a few trees blowing?",
          "Nice retro amusement park",
          "There's not a lot of shade. Not worth driving all the way over there and if you do don't get the p.o.p. bracelet it's not worth it. takes about 15-20 minutes to get on a ride then the kids working the rides drag their feet like they have no purpose in life and take forever to start the rides.",
          "We,7 year-old me and my wife, had a great time, lines move very fast, clean park, and nice staff",
          "Not enough shade. Not enough lighting at night. Not enough menu options at the food stands",
          "Pretty good amusement park at times food and rides are a bit pricey but lately they have lots of specials and they are becoming more attentive to customers than past years! Keep it up especially those dollar days that are wednesdays to fridays from 7pm to 10:30 for a limited time at times",
          "Not as nice a place as former location",
          "They still seem to be adding rides. Need more shaded area. Plenty of parking",
          "Perfect place to have fun",
          "Really fun and decent prices",
          "Best amusement park there is here, been  coming for the past 15 years and it\u2019s always great.",
          "Theres only like 10 rides and it's extremely expensive.",
          "Not that many rides for what they charge. I think it's over priced.",
          "It's decent not to big of a park but for the price you can definitely make an afternoon of it.",
          "Reasonably priced for the attractions it offers. Plenty of public bathrooms and shade areas. It wasn't very crowded when we went, the night before Easter.",
          "Hadn't been here in a while, rides are the same ones. They need new ones. Still had a good time.",
          "It\u2019s very small & a bit overpriced. I arrived with my 10 month old son- just him & I. I asked how much it would cost to just walk him around the park so that he can see the lights and they told me to walk around it would be $35. I was \u2026",
          "I had so much fun here, I'm going to go again.",
          "It's fun but its to expensive they would lower the price of the bracelet and they will have more people",
          "Great park!",
          "Not a bad place for a bit of fun. We went during dollar days and it was a good value. The adults and kids had fun. We will be back.",
          "I had so much fun with my family and my brother I got to bound with him loved the place it brought us closer together",
          "Beautiful friendly people \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Little one's had a great time. Only problem here is lack of shade. On hot days there seems to be no escape from the heat.",
          "Very clean, staff was very kind and courteous. We went 7-9pm and it was great weather and not waits, not many people!! Great time!",
          "It is not wheelchair accessible truly disappointed my sister could have transferred if we were able to have some dam ramps so she can go on the ride and enjoy herself also....",
          "Fun and all for the family or with friends. I think they should add more rides and update a few.",
          "Great place to entertain kids at an excellent price!  Pay one price for all day long .Can't beat it!",
          "Fun for a few hours on a Saturday.  It wasn't too crowded.  My 5yo son is a little more than 42 inches and could ride the small coasters but couldn't ride the bigger ones.   He had a good time on the rides he could ride.\n\nSome of the rides \u2026",
          "Not worth the money..  Pizza is ugly. Serve to buy food poor.",
          "great place for the kids but food is a little pricey.",

          "Western Playland was a good ending to spring break. We had a great time.",
          "Took my Godson, he had a great time. I definitely recommend getting the wrist band. Food was a little expensive, but you can come and go from the park all day.",
          "Kids always have a great time. Expect lines as it gets later in the day",
          "The rides there are super cool and the fact that there is a place for kids",

          "Love dollar nights and appreciate friendly employees!!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f",
          "Not worth buying a POP bracelet (15.90) on dollar nights and definitely not worth buying it for a kid that's 35 inches.. oh and on the big rides (hurricane) they hardly check height requirements or bracelets.  I paid a POP for my short \u2026",

          "Any El Pasoan who hasn't gone to any \"big\" amusement parks (Disneyland,  Six Flags, Universal Studios, etc) would most likely believe Western Playland is fun. As for me, I believe it is very boring. I personally believe some of the rides \u2026",

Hough has also starred in various stage productions, including the 2006 original production of Footloose: The Musical at the Novello Theatre in London's West End, as well as the 2015 New York Spring Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. In 2013, he starred in Make Your Move, a Romeo and Juliet-inspired South Korean-American independent dance film. As of 2014, he has held a recurring acting role on ABC's musical-drama, Nashville.\nOn December 7, 2016, Hough played the role of Corny Collins in NBC's live musical TV-production, Hairspray Live!.In May 2017, Hough joined the judges table in NBC's new dance competition series World of Dance. He continued his role as a judge for the second and third seasons.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n Hough grew up the fourth of five children in a Latter-day Saint family in Sandy, Utah, a suburb of Salt Lake City. He is the son of Marianne and Bruce Hough, who was twice chairman of the Utah Republican Party, and has four sisters, Sharee, Marabeth, Katherine, and Julianne. All of his grandparents were dancers, and his parents met while on a ballroom dancing team in college in Idaho. He is the second cousin of musicians Riker, Rydel, Rocky, and Ross Lynch from R5, their maternal grandmothers are sisters.When Hough was 12, his divorcing parents sent him to London to live and study with dance coaches Corky and Shirley Ballas. Hough's sister Julianne joined him in London several months later. Originally intending to stay for a year, Hough remained in London for ten years. (Julianne returned after five years.) The Ballases helped tutor the two Hough children alongside their own son, Mark Ballas, schooling them at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts. They received training in song, theater, gymnastics, and many forms of dance, including jazz, ballet, and tap. The three children formed their own pop music trio 2B1G (\"2 Boys, 1 Girl\") and performed at dance competitions in the UK and the U.S., and showcased UK television shows. As well as being trained in many forms of dance, Hough can also play the piano, guitar and drums.Derek subsequently taught at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Competitive dancing and choreography ===\nHough won the WDSF World Latin Championship in 2002, and the Blackpool U-21 Latin title with Aneta Piotrowska in 2003.

Hough, who was nominated for Dancing with the Stars, was part of that number, along with the other nominees. Ken Ehrlich, the executive producer of the show, stated, \"It's definitely going to be an original number, something that hasn't been done before. It's going to utilize the talents of all of them to put this number together as choreographers.\" Hough then went on to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography. On September 12, 2015, Hough won his second Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography, alongside Julianne Hough and Tessandra Chavez.

About this opportunity, Hough said: I started working on a very special routine that's not for the show [Dancing with the Stars]. I'm choreographing a number for our world champion ice dancers Meryl Davis and Charlie White to perform at the Olympics next year. They graciously asked me to do it, and how could I say no?

          "Great place for kids to let loose, jump and tire themselves out. A safe fun place with diverse jump areas and \"dodge ball\". Has a snack bar and plenty of seats for adults and parents to chill.",
          "Kids really enjoy this venue. We often use it to hold birthday parties, but also go in certain occasions. The kids have fun and do plenty of exercise. The main attraction are the trampolines, but there's also arcades, rockclimbing, and other activities.",
          "The tickets are far from cheap. Considering the cost of living in El Paso, this might be one of the priciest attractions for our younger ones. But everytime they had a lot of fun. Seating for adults is scarce and could be improved.",
          "Getting in was quick and easy, staff were very helpful and friendly. If you want to be with a lot of players in dodgeball, go later in the day. No problem with small kids as you can go in to the viewing area to watch over them.",
          "Employees walk around and watch kids like hawks. I paid 75 dollars for kids to have fun, if they are doing something wrong by all means correct until then leave them alone. Telling them everytime they cross the wrong line or jump wrong is a bit excessive.",
          "the grandkids loved it. I thought the price was okay. need to work on their food - too expensive for not so good. also some of the staff were rude and too busy talking with each other",

          "This place will defiantly wear out your children. Nonstop jumping and moving with relaxing couches and TVs for adults who\u2019s children know how to behave and do not need supervision. Standard kid food (pizza, etc) options at decent prices ($2 pizza slice, $1.29 hot dog). Admission",

          "The facility is very clean, fun for the kids but overpriced for El Paso (Regular price is $12 per hour plus $3 for your green jumping sox). When you check in for the first time You need to enter you personal data and sign a waiver form. You can save money with some Groupon",
          "This place can be hard to find as it is located in a warehouse area close to Mesa and Doniphan. This is a great activity for kids especially on a bad weather day. It is a little pricey at $20.00 per person but that allows a person to jump all day. I would recommend you get there"

We attempted to give this place a second chance since the previous year they failed to us the game cards that were included in our package. This year they failed to schedule the event. So sad my son loves this place.",

          "Way overpriced for the younger kids that you really can't dump off to spend entire day unsupervised. I can typically sit for an hour or so with a book, but, eh, not impressed. The snack bar is wickedly highway robbery too. The  place has definitely paid for itself many times over I am sure of it.",

        "wiki": "Ysleta del Sur Pueblo (also Tigua Pueblo) is a Puebloan Native American tribal entity in the Ysleta section of El Paso, Texas. Its members are Southern Tiwa people who had been displaced from Spanish New Mexico in 1680-1681 during the Pueblo Revolt against the Spaniards.\n\n\n== Tigua ==\nIn Spanish the people and language are called Tigua (pronounced tiwa). They have maintained a tribal identity and lands in Texas. Spanish replaced the indigenous language in the early 1900s, and today, English is increasingly gaining ground in the community.\nFor almost 40 years the Pueblo has owned and operated tribal businesses that provide employment for its members and the El Paso community. These businesses include the Speaking Rock Entertainment Center, Big Bear Oil Co., Inc., and the Tigua Indian Cultural Center.  The tribe employs approximately 500 individuals.\nAs part of the Indian termination policy followed by the federal government from the 1940s through the 1960s, the Tigua became the last tribe formally terminated. They were recognized as the Tigua Indians of El Paso in 1967 as a Texas Indian tribe; House Bill 888 was passed during the 60th Legislature, Regular Session, transferring all trust responsibilities for the Tigua Indians to the Texas Indian Commission.  On 12 April 1968, under Public Law 90\u2013287 82 Stat. 93 the United States Congress relinquished all responsibility for the Tiwa Indians of Ysleta, Texas to the State of Texas.  The Tiwa Indians Act specified that tribal members would be ineligible for any services, claims or demands from the United States as Indians.Public Law 100-89, 101 STAT. 666 was enacted 18 August 1987 and restored the federal relationship with the tribe simultaneously with those of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe. The restoration act renamed the tribe to the Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo, repealed the Tiwa Indians Act, and specifically prohibited all gaming activities prohibited by the laws of the state of Texas. The Tigua have maintained a federal relationship continuously since 1987.\nThe legislation of the United States Congress restored eligibility to receive services from the federal government to this group, the southernmost tribe of the Pueblo peoples.  In addition, the state of Texas recognized the tribe. Two other tribes in Texas also have federal and state recognition, while an additional two tribes have state recognition only.  In April 2008, the Tribal Census Department reported 1,615 enrolled members.As of 2019, E. Michael Silvas is the current Governor of Ysleta del Sur Pueblo.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAwelo\nPiro Pueblo\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBartlett, John R. (1909). The language of the Piro.

        "wiki": "El Paso (; Spanish: [el \u02c8paso] \"the pass\") is a city and the county seat of El Paso County, Texas, United States, in the far western part of the state. The 2019 population estimate for the city from the U.S. Census was 681,728, making it the 22nd largest city in the United States. Its metropolitan statistical area (MSA) covers all of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in Texas, and has a population of 840,758.El Paso stands on the Rio Grande across the Mexico\u2013United States border from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua with 1.4 million people. Las Cruces, in the neighboring U.S. state of New Mexico, has a population of 215,579. On the U.S. side, the El Paso metropolitan area forms part of the larger El Paso\u2013Las Cruces CSA, with a population of 1,060,397.Bi-nationally, these three cities form a combined international metropolitan area sometimes referred to as the Paso del Norte or the Borderplex. The region of 2.5 million people constitutes the largest bilingual and binational work force in the Western Hemisphere.The city is home to three publicly traded companies, and former Western Refining, now Andeavor. as well as home to the Medical Center of the Americas, the only medical research and care provider complex in West Texas and Southern New Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso, the city's primary university. The city hosts the annual Sun Bowl college football post-season game, the second oldest bowl game in the country.El Paso has a strong federal and military presence. William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Biggs Army Airfield, and Fort Bliss are located in the area. Fort Bliss is one of the largest military complexes of the United States Army and the largest training area in the United States. Also headquartered in El Paso are the DEA domestic field division 7, El Paso Intelligence Center, Joint Task Force North, United States Border Patrol El Paso Sector, and the U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group (SOG).\nIn 2010 and 2018, El Paso received an All-America City Award. El Paso ranked in the top three safest large cities in the United States between 1997 and 2014, including holding the title of safest city between 2011 and 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks. The evidence suggests 10,000 to 12,000 years of human habitation. The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. When the Spanish arrived, the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area. These were subsequently incorporated into the Mestizo culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from Comancher\u00eda, and gen\u00edzaros of various ethnic groups. The Mescalero Apache were also present.\nSpanish explorer Don Juan de O\u00f1ate was born in 1550 in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and was the first New Spain (Mexico) explorer known to have observed the Rio Grande near El Paso, in 1598, celebrating a Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (decades before the English Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). However, the four survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza, and his enslaved Moor Estevanico, are thought to have passed through the area in the mid-1530s. El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) was founded on the south bank of the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande), in 1659 by Fray Garcia de San Francisco. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the Pueblo Revolt, until 1692 when Santa Fe was reconquered and once again became the capital.\nThe Texas Revolution (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of Cross-border town naming until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring Anson Mills to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.During the Civil War, a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union California Column in 1862. It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.\nAfter the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow as Texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority. El Paso itself, incorporated in 1873, encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river. In the 1870s, a population of 23 non-Hispanic whites and 150 Hispanics was reported. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, the population boomed to 10,000 by the 1890 census, with many Anglo-Americans, recent immigrants, old Hispanic settlers, and recent arrivals from Mexico. The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild boomtown known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness. Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). With the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city's geographic position, the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the U.S. Southwest.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio D\u00edaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D\u00edaz.By 1910, the overwhelming number of people in the city were Americans creating a settled environment. However, this period was short-lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees \u2013 and capital \u2013 to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast Plan de San Diego which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens. The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives. These actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the end result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.Simultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000 and Non-Hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites. In reply, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund. In 1916, the Census Bureau reported El Paso's population as 53% Mexican and 44% Non-Hispanic whites. Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.During and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.The Farah Strike, 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas. This strike was originated and led by Chicanas, or Mexican American women, due to Farah Manufacturing Company, one of the largest factories in the city, being unorganized, low wages, discrimination, no benefits, lack of gender-neutrality, health and safety hazards, and unattainable quotas. Texas Monthly described the Farah Strike as the \"strike of the century.\"On August 3, 2019, a mass shooting/domestic terrorist attack committed by a white supremacist occurred at a Walmart in El Paso, which left 23 people dead and 23 others injured.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEl Paso is located at the intersection of three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua) and two countries (the U.S. and Mexico). It is the only major Texas city on Mountain Time. Ciudad Juarez was once in Central Time, but both cities are now on Mountain Time.\nEl Paso is closer to the capital cities of four other states \u2013 Phoenix, Arizona (345 miles (555 km) away); Santa Fe, New Mexico, (273 miles (439 km) away); Ciudad Chihuahua, Chihuahua, (218 miles (351 km) away), and Hermosillo, Sonora (325 miles (523 km) away) \u2013 than it is to the capital of its own state, Austin (528 miles (850 km) away). It is closer to Los Angeles, California (700 miles (1,100 km) away) than it is to Orange (858 miles (1,381 km) away), the easternmost town in the state.\nEl Paso is located within the Chihuahuan Desert, the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region. The Franklin Mountains extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the west side forms the beginnings of the Mesilla Valley, and the east side expands into the desert and lower valley. They connect in the central business district at the southern end of the mountain range.\nThe city's elevation is 3,800 ft (1,200 m) above sea level. North Franklin Mountain is the highest peak in the city at 7,192 ft (2,192 m) above sea level. The peak can be seen from 60 mi (100 km) in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local Coronado High School gets its mascot's name. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 256.3 square miles (663.7 km2).The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park, the largest urban park in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and El Paso International Airport.\nThe Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey, an example of a pluton, rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Nearby volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (50 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEl Paso has a transitional climate between cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk) and hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh) featuring hot summers, with little humidity, and cool to mild dry winters. Rainfall averages 9.7 in (250 mm) per year, much of which occurs during the summer from July through September, and is predominantly caused by the North American Monsoon. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes thunderstorms, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.\nThe sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the National Weather Service; from this, the city is nicknamed \"The Sun City\". Due to its arid, windy climate, El Paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season, particularly during the springtime between March and early May. With an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph (50 km/h) and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph (120 km/h), these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.\nEl Paso and the nearby mountains also receive snow. Weather systems have produced over one foot (30 cm) of snow on several occasions. In the 1982\u20131983 winter season, three major snowstorms produced record seasonal snowfall. On December 25\u201326, 1982, 6.0 inches (15 cm) of snow fell, producing a white Christmas for the city. This was followed by another 7.0 inches (18 cm) on December 30\u201331, 1982. On April 4\u20137, 1983, 16.5 inches (42 cm) of snow fell on El Paso, bringing the seasonal total to nearly 30 inches (76 cm). On December 13\u201314, 1987, a record storm dumped over 22 inches (56 cm) of snow on El Paso, and two weeks later (December 25\u201326), another three inches (7.6 cm) fell, bringing the monthly total for December 1987 to an all-time record high of 25.9 inches (66 cm) of snow.\nThe average annual snowfall for the city varies widely between different neighborhoods at different elevations, but is 6.1 inches (15 cm) at the airport (but with a median of 0, meaning most years see no snow at all). Snow is most rare around Ysleta and the eastern valley area, which usually include large numbers of palm trees; in the higher neighborhoods, palm trees are more vulnerable to snow and cold snaps and are often seen with brown, frost-damaged fronds.\nOne example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C), the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was 1 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C), breaking the 5 \u00b0F (\u221215 \u00b0C) monthly record low set during the cold wave of 1899. Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results. Two local power plants failed, forcing El Paso Electric to institute rolling blackouts over several days, and electric wires were broken, causing localised blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days.\nMonthly means range from 45.5 \u00b0F (7.5 \u00b0C) in December to 83.5 \u00b0F (28.6 \u00b0C) in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon arrives, while daily low temperatures typically peak in July or early August with the higher humidity the monsoon brings (translating to warmer nights). On average, there are 52 nights of at- or below-freezing lows, 109 days of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C)+ highs and 20 days of 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ highs annually; it is extremely rare for temperatures to stay below the freezing mark all day. The city's record high is 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on June 30, 1994, and its record low is \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) on January 11, 1962; the highest daily minimum was 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the National Weather Service since 1879.\n\n\n==== Flooding ====\nAlthough the average annual rainfall is only about 9.7 in (250 mm), many parts of El Paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms. In late July and early August 2006, up to 10 in (250 mm) of rain fell in a week, the flood-control reservoirs overflowed and caused major flooding citywide. The city staff estimated damage to public infrastructure at $21 million, and to private property (residential and commercial) at $77 million. Much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood-control dams and reservoirs, and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water.\n\n\n=== Time zone ===\nEl Paso is located in the far western corner of Texas, which is roughly the only part of the state that is located within the Mountain Time Zone, as opposed to the Central Time Zone.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Downtown and central El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town contains some of the city's oldest and most historic neighborhoods. Located in the heart of the city, it is home to approximately 44,993 people. Development of the area started in 1827 with the first resident, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a wealthy merchant from Paso del Norte (present day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), who built the region's first structure establishing Rancho Ponce within the vicinity of S. El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the Sunset Heights district. It is close to the El Paso International Airport, the international border, and Fort Bliss. It is part of the El Paso Independent School District.\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the white American residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. Hispanic-American residents lived in an area called Chihuahuita (\"little Chihuahua\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area. Another downtown neighborhood is El Segundo Barrio, which is near the United States/Mexico border.\n\n\n=== Northwest El Paso ===\n\nBetter known as West El Paso or the West Side, the area includes a portion of the Rio Grande floodplain upstream from downtown which is known locally as the Upper Valley and is located on the west side of the Franklin Mountains. The Upper Valley is the greenest part of the county due to the Rio Grande. The west side is home to some of the most affluent neighborhoods within the city, such as the Coronado Hills and Country Club neighborhoods. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of El Paso.\n\n\n=== West central El Paso ===\n\nWest central El Paso is located north of Interstate 10 and west of the Franklin Mountains. The University of Texas at El Paso and the Cincinnati Entertainment district are located in the heart of the area. Historic districts Kern Place and Sunset Heights are in this part of town.\nKern Place was founded in 1914 by Peter E. Kern, for whom the neighborhood was named.The homes of Kern Place are unique in architecture and some were built by residents themselves. One of the better known homes is the Paul Luckett Home located at 1201 Cincinnati Ave. above Madeline Park, and is made of local rock. It is known as \"The Castle\" due to its round walls and a crenelated rooftop.Kern Place is extremely popular with college and university students. The area is known for its glitzy entertainment district, restaurants and coffee shops who cater to both business patrons and university students. After UTEP's basketball and football games, UTEP fans pack the Kern Place area for food and entertainment at Cincinnati Street a small bar district. This bar scene has grown over the years and has attracted thousands to its annual Mardi Gras block party as well as after sporting events or concerts. Young men and women make up the majority of the crowds who stop in between classes or after work.Sunset Heights is one of the most historic areas in town, which has existed since the latter part of the 1890s. Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory, but many have been neglected and have deteriorated. During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, Doroteo Arango (also known as Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s. During the 1910 Mexican Revolution many Mexicans fled Mexico and settled in Sunset Heights.\n\n\n=== Northeast El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town is located north of central El Paso and east of the Franklin Mountains. Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like east El Paso and northwest El Paso, but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at Ft. Bliss in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at Andress High School, Parkland High School, Irvin High School, and Chapin High School.\n\n\n=== East El Paso ===\n\nThe area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population of over 200,000. It includes the 79936 ZIP Code, which was considered in 2013 as the most populous in the nation with over 114,000 people.\n\n\n=== Mission Valley ===\n\nFormerly known as the lower valley, it includes part of Eastside and all lower valley districts. It is the third largest area of the city, behind east El Paso and central El Paso. Hawkins Road and Interstate 10 border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain).\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: Ysleta Mission-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), Socorro Mission-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and San Elizario Chapel (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King Philip II of Spain.\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n\n=== Texas and New Mexico suburbs ===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico. The most populated suburbs in Texas are Socorro, Horizon City, Fort Bliss and San Elizario. Other Texas suburbs are Anthony, Canutillo, Sparks, Fabens, and Vinton.\nAlthough Anthony, Santa Teresa, Sunland Park, and Chaparral lie adjacent to El Paso County, they are considered to be part of the Las Cruces, New Mexico metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings ===\n\nEl Paso's tallest building, the Wells Fargo Plaza, was built in the early 1970s as State National Plaza. The black-windowed, 302-foot (92 m) building is famous for its 13 white horizontal lights (18 lights per row on the east and west sides of the building, and seven bulbs per row on the north and south sides) that were lit at night. The tower did use a design of the United States flag during the July 4 holidays, as well as the American hostage crisis of 1980, and was lit continuously following the September 11 attacks in 2001 until around 2006. During the Christmas holidays, a design of a Christmas tree was used, and at times, the letters \"UTEP\" were used to support University of Texas at El Paso athletics. The tower is now only lit during the holiday months, or when special events take place in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2010 U.S. census, 649,121 people, 216,694 households, and 131,104 families resided in the city.

The first electrified line across the Rio Grande, which opened on January 11, 1902, was preceded by a network that relied on animal labor. The system quickly spread into residential and industrial areas of El Paso. In 1913, a 12-mile (19 km) interurban line was built to Ysleta. At the close of 1943, the holding company El Paso Electric sold its subsidiary, the El Paso Electric Railway Company and its Mexican counterpart, to one of National City Lines' subsidiaries. This resulted in the formation of El Paso City Lines, whose domestic streetcar lines were replaced by buses in 1947. The international streetcar line which crossed the border via the Stanton Street Bridge continued to operate until 1973.

The system was constructed under the authority of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, but when the major construction was completed, around spring 2018, it was transferred to Sun Metro, for operation and maintenance. As of 2016, construction of the system was projected to cost $97 million.\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\n\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of Nueva Espa\u00f1a, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe. Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area:\n\nBridge of the Americas, also known as the Cordova Bridge.\nGood Neighbor International Bridge, also known as the Stanton Street Bridge\nPaso del Norte International Bridge, also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge.\nYsleta\u2013Zaragoza International Bridge, also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.The city collects tolls at its international bridges.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of museums in West Texas\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Source notes ===\n\n\n== References ==\nHammond, John Hays (1935).

          "We pretty much had the place to ourselves. The museum was closed but the park was open. We saw a marker where the original Chamizal treaty border between the US and Mexico was. From the park you could see the border fence and the highway bridge to Mexico. I wish the museum",
          "First, the Memorial is bounded by East Paisano Dr., Delta Dr. and San Marcial St. In 1911 Mexico and the US had an arbitration over a piece of land that was cut by the Rio Grande River and floated from the river's Mexican side to the U.S. side. Mexico was awarded the parcel by",
          "Wanted to go here as it is so close to the border and is a flashpoint in history. Nice NPS law enforcement officer talked with us. Also had good interface with NPS Ranger in the visitor center. Left with a much better sense of border issues and how they affect regular people.",
          "The pavilion in the park commemorates a minor historic event from the 1960s with photos of participating politicians but gives very little perspective of the lives of the everyday people who lived there and how this historic event might have affected them, The surrounding park",
          "This place really surprised us. We try to visit national parks when we can and this one did not disappoint. My 10 & 12 did the Jr. Ranger program and learned about the local history. They earned the their badges and had a great time walking the grounds. It is a small visitor",
          "This park would be better when the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) leave lawfully attending Park users alone. DHS and DPS questioned me about sitting on a park bench during the daytime. Meanwhile, they admitted to some",
          "I will be going to visit Gettysburg in late May..this place is close to my home near downtown...I guess that is why I rarely visit, but it is a good place to know the history of the border in my hometown..my mother told me alot about this place where she was also born and",
          "My spouse thinks I just wanted to go here to get another stamp in my National Parks Passport. Not true! I like to fill in the gaps of my knowledge of US history, and there is always something to learn at the sites. It was heartening to read about true diplomacy between Abraham",
          "While the park grounds open at 7 AM (till 10 PM) , the visitor center is open only from 10 AM until 5 PM. There is a good view of the Bridge of the Americas - the international bridge across the Rio Grande that connects El Paso (USA) with Ciudad Juarez (Mexico) from the park",
          "Chamizal Memorial is a real gem of a historical place that should be more advertised. The memorial museum has very detailed and attractive exhibits of the peaceful agreement between two countries to resolve a pestering border dispute. The parking lot was under reconstruction",
          "If you like history and historical sights this would be a great place to visit. Check the hours before going tho because I went when it was not open but still got to see the exhibits in the lobby area.",
          "It's hard to believe that it took the US and Mexico well over 100 years to settle their boundary dispute on the edge of El Paso within sight of the International Bridge connecting the two countries. There are excellent exhibits and pictures here commemorating the event with",
          "The orientation film is a great place to start. Everything at the site is well done but it felt like a lot of focus, space, and cost for a relatively minor event. When I compare it to other National Park sites it just isn't above average. If this review is helpful then please",
          "We learned a good bit about the history of this area and the border controversy that lasted for over a century.",
          "Girls' weekend brought us to this place --- negotiations happened on the birthdate of one of our group and actual return to Mexico happened on birthdate of another of our group! Very interesting",
          "I knew nothing about the history of the area or the border issues. So this memorial was worth a visit to learn a little piece of American history. You can watch the video and see the exhibit in less than an hour. Then take a walk on the paths outside.",
          "We drove on purpose to this close to border area to visit this memorial. During our 18 days southwest tour we had several disappointments such places being closed due to government financial blockade . Unfortunately, this was another one. We saw only the outside colorful murals",
          "During a recent road trip, I spent a night in El Paso on my way to Carlsbad Caverns. As I was exploring the city, I made a quick stop at Chamizal National Memorial since it was a highly rated attraction in the city. If you're in the area, it's worth a quick stop since there's no",
          "A very interesting site within sight of the U.S./Mexico border that explains a thorny issue (if the border is defined by the river, and the river moves, where exactly is the border?) and commemorates its diplomatic solution a century in the making, our family had a great visit",
          "Took my kiddos (3&10) to explore and the rangers were fantastic. Really knew how to talk to kids and explain or their level. You can get a stamp for your National park passport book and your kiddos can becae jr rangers.",
          "I would say this place is worth a quick stop, but don't expect to stay long. It is a nice park and mural commemorating the cultures of the bortder area and the end of territorial disputes between the US and Mexico.",
          "My husband and I visited the Chamizal National Memorial on a Sunday. The Park was small, but clean and well kept. The outside bathrooms were clean. However we were disappointed that the visitors center was closed.",
          "We were tipped off about Chamizal National Monument by the park ranger at Fort Davis National Historic Site. We spent the morning visiting the museum and strolling the grounds before our afternoon flight home. A beautiful memorial to the peaceful & diplomatic border resolution",
          "Interesting history between the US and Mexico and the border disputes. Was very happy we took the trip to see this memorial.",
          "The mural is a lot of fun but inside there's not that much history (or much else) inside the building.",
          "Chamizal is a hidden gem within a stones throw of the US/Mexico border in El Paso Texas. This is managed by the US National Park Service. Entrance is free and there\u2019s a wonderful museum on the history of Chamizal and how this became such an important monument. The grounds are",
          "Visited 5-11-18. We learned a great deal about an unknown to us border dispute with Mexico and the USA that lasted many years. This is a very large urban park with a lot of history. There is a nice display wall explaining the events in time lines. Very small book store",
          "We spent several hours here, both viewing the displays and doing the outdoor walking tour. There were plenty of shaded benches on the tour, which made it pleasant to walk in 80 degree weather. The ranger told us that the indoor displays are in transition to reflect current",
          "So my nieces wanted to visit because they had seen some pictures of the place on social media. It really is an \"instagram spot\". I like how they keep the place clean and by mixing multiple historical figures in the same space, it teaches you about how we connect our cultures",

          "Stopped by Chamizal on our way through El Paso. As with all NPS sites, this was worth the stop. It was really nice to learn how the two sides were able to cooperate and settle the land dispute in a civil way. It is a small National Memorial, but it was packed with",
          "This was one of our destinations, because of the historical purpose and the cooperation of two countries. We were surprised when we were able to see a play there also. Can't remember the name, but it was about a very progressive woman. We enjoyed the play and the park.",

          "It's a small museum and probably a lot of people will say it's outdated but it delivers the information about the area and its history very well in short enough form for a traveler who is ready to stop for an hour or two, not for the whole day. I also think the premises are nice",
          "This may be only an hour of your time but you learn about the long history of US-Mexico relations which puts the present border wall issue in perspective. Plus, we learned there are drug smuggling and illegals coming through the park so the rangers work with local authorities",
          "Unless you're from the area you probably don't know about Chamizal, so it's worth stopping just for that. However, this story is fascinating, and even a little sad, but it's an important part of the history of Texas, Chihuahua, Mexico and the United States. The museum inside",

        "wiki": "El Paso (; Spanish: [el \u02c8paso] \"the pass\") is a city and the county seat of El Paso County, Texas, United States, in the far western part of the state. The 2019 population estimate for the city from the U.S. Census was 681,728, making it the 22nd largest city in the United States. Its metropolitan statistical area (MSA) covers all of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in Texas, and has a population of 840,758.El Paso stands on the Rio Grande across the Mexico\u2013United States border from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua with 1.4 million people. Las Cruces, in the neighboring U.S. state of New Mexico, has a population of 215,579. On the U.S. side, the El Paso metropolitan area forms part of the larger El Paso\u2013Las Cruces CSA, with a population of 1,060,397.Bi-nationally, these three cities form a combined international metropolitan area sometimes referred to as the Paso del Norte or the Borderplex. The region of 2.5 million people constitutes the largest bilingual and binational work force in the Western Hemisphere.The city is home to three publicly traded companies, and former Western Refining, now Andeavor. as well as home to the Medical Center of the Americas, the only medical research and care provider complex in West Texas and Southern New Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso, the city's primary university. The city hosts the annual Sun Bowl college football post-season game, the second oldest bowl game in the country.El Paso has a strong federal and military presence. William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Biggs Army Airfield, and Fort Bliss are located in the area. Fort Bliss is one of the largest military complexes of the United States Army and the largest training area in the United States. Also headquartered in El Paso are the DEA domestic field division 7, El Paso Intelligence Center, Joint Task Force North, United States Border Patrol El Paso Sector, and the U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group (SOG).\nIn 2010 and 2018, El Paso received an All-America City Award. El Paso ranked in the top three safest large cities in the United States between 1997 and 2014, including holding the title of safest city between 2011 and 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks. The evidence suggests 10,000 to 12,000 years of human habitation. The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. When the Spanish arrived, the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area. These were subsequently incorporated into the Mestizo culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from Comancher\u00eda, and gen\u00edzaros of various ethnic groups. The Mescalero Apache were also present.\nSpanish explorer Don Juan de O\u00f1ate was born in 1550 in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and was the first New Spain (Mexico) explorer known to have observed the Rio Grande near El Paso, in 1598, celebrating a Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (decades before the English Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). However, the four survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza, and his enslaved Moor Estevanico, are thought to have passed through the area in the mid-1530s. El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) was founded on the south bank of the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande), in 1659 by Fray Garcia de San Francisco. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the Pueblo Revolt, until 1692 when Santa Fe was reconquered and once again became the capital.\nThe Texas Revolution (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of Cross-border town naming until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring Anson Mills to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.During the Civil War, a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union California Column in 1862. It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.\nAfter the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow as Texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority. El Paso itself, incorporated in 1873, encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river. In the 1870s, a population of 23 non-Hispanic whites and 150 Hispanics was reported. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, the population boomed to 10,000 by the 1890 census, with many Anglo-Americans, recent immigrants, old Hispanic settlers, and recent arrivals from Mexico. The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild boomtown known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness. Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). With the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city's geographic position, the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the U.S. Southwest.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio D\u00edaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D\u00edaz.By 1910, the overwhelming number of people in the city were Americans creating a settled environment. However, this period was short-lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees \u2013 and capital \u2013 to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast Plan de San Diego which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens. The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives. These actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the end result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.Simultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000 and Non-Hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites. In reply, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund. In 1916, the Census Bureau reported El Paso's population as 53% Mexican and 44% Non-Hispanic whites. Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.During and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.The Farah Strike, 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas. This strike was originated and led by Chicanas, or Mexican American women, due to Farah Manufacturing Company, one of the largest factories in the city, being unorganized, low wages, discrimination, no benefits, lack of gender-neutrality, health and safety hazards, and unattainable quotas. Texas Monthly described the Farah Strike as the \"strike of the century.\"On August 3, 2019, a mass shooting/domestic terrorist attack committed by a white supremacist occurred at a Walmart in El Paso, which left 23 people dead and 23 others injured.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEl Paso is located at the intersection of three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua) and two countries (the U.S. and Mexico). It is the only major Texas city on Mountain Time. Ciudad Juarez was once in Central Time, but both cities are now on Mountain Time.\nEl Paso is closer to the capital cities of four other states \u2013 Phoenix, Arizona (345 miles (555 km) away); Santa Fe, New Mexico, (273 miles (439 km) away); Ciudad Chihuahua, Chihuahua, (218 miles (351 km) away), and Hermosillo, Sonora (325 miles (523 km) away) \u2013 than it is to the capital of its own state, Austin (528 miles (850 km) away). It is closer to Los Angeles, California (700 miles (1,100 km) away) than it is to Orange (858 miles (1,381 km) away), the easternmost town in the state.\nEl Paso is located within the Chihuahuan Desert, the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region. The Franklin Mountains extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the west side forms the beginnings of the Mesilla Valley, and the east side expands into the desert and lower valley. They connect in the central business district at the southern end of the mountain range.\nThe city's elevation is 3,800 ft (1,200 m) above sea level. North Franklin Mountain is the highest peak in the city at 7,192 ft (2,192 m) above sea level. The peak can be seen from 60 mi (100 km) in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local Coronado High School gets its mascot's name. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 256.3 square miles (663.7 km2).The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park, the largest urban park in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and El Paso International Airport.\nThe Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey, an example of a pluton, rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Nearby volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (50 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEl Paso has a transitional climate between cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk) and hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh) featuring hot summers, with little humidity, and cool to mild dry winters. Rainfall averages 9.7 in (250 mm) per year, much of which occurs during the summer from July through September, and is predominantly caused by the North American Monsoon. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes thunderstorms, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.\nThe sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the National Weather Service; from this, the city is nicknamed \"The Sun City\". Due to its arid, windy climate, El Paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season, particularly during the springtime between March and early May. With an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph (50 km/h) and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph (120 km/h), these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.\nEl Paso and the nearby mountains also receive snow. Weather systems have produced over one foot (30 cm) of snow on several occasions. In the 1982\u20131983 winter season, three major snowstorms produced record seasonal snowfall. On December 25\u201326, 1982, 6.0 inches (15 cm) of snow fell, producing a white Christmas for the city. This was followed by another 7.0 inches (18 cm) on December 30\u201331, 1982. On April 4\u20137, 1983, 16.5 inches (42 cm) of snow fell on El Paso, bringing the seasonal total to nearly 30 inches (76 cm). On December 13\u201314, 1987, a record storm dumped over 22 inches (56 cm) of snow on El Paso, and two weeks later (December 25\u201326), another three inches (7.6 cm) fell, bringing the monthly total for December 1987 to an all-time record high of 25.9 inches (66 cm) of snow.\nThe average annual snowfall for the city varies widely between different neighborhoods at different elevations, but is 6.1 inches (15 cm) at the airport (but with a median of 0, meaning most years see no snow at all). Snow is most rare around Ysleta and the eastern valley area, which usually include large numbers of palm trees; in the higher neighborhoods, palm trees are more vulnerable to snow and cold snaps and are often seen with brown, frost-damaged fronds.\nOne example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C), the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was 1 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C), breaking the 5 \u00b0F (\u221215 \u00b0C) monthly record low set during the cold wave of 1899. Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results. Two local power plants failed, forcing El Paso Electric to institute rolling blackouts over several days, and electric wires were broken, causing localised blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days.\nMonthly means range from 45.5 \u00b0F (7.5 \u00b0C) in December to 83.5 \u00b0F (28.6 \u00b0C) in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon arrives, while daily low temperatures typically peak in July or early August with the higher humidity the monsoon brings (translating to warmer nights). On average, there are 52 nights of at- or below-freezing lows, 109 days of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C)+ highs and 20 days of 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ highs annually; it is extremely rare for temperatures to stay below the freezing mark all day. The city's record high is 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on June 30, 1994, and its record low is \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) on January 11, 1962; the highest daily minimum was 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the National Weather Service since 1879.\n\n\n==== Flooding ====\nAlthough the average annual rainfall is only about 9.7 in (250 mm), many parts of El Paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms. In late July and early August 2006, up to 10 in (250 mm) of rain fell in a week, the flood-control reservoirs overflowed and caused major flooding citywide. The city staff estimated damage to public infrastructure at $21 million, and to private property (residential and commercial) at $77 million. Much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood-control dams and reservoirs, and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water.\n\n\n=== Time zone ===\nEl Paso is located in the far western corner of Texas, which is roughly the only part of the state that is located within the Mountain Time Zone, as opposed to the Central Time Zone.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Downtown and central El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town contains some of the city's oldest and most historic neighborhoods. Located in the heart of the city, it is home to approximately 44,993 people. Development of the area started in 1827 with the first resident, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a wealthy merchant from Paso del Norte (present day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), who built the region's first structure establishing Rancho Ponce within the vicinity of S. El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the Sunset Heights district. It is close to the El Paso International Airport, the international border, and Fort Bliss. It is part of the El Paso Independent School District.\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the white American residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. Hispanic-American residents lived in an area called Chihuahuita (\"little Chihuahua\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area. Another downtown neighborhood is El Segundo Barrio, which is near the United States/Mexico border.\n\n\n=== Northwest El Paso ===\n\nBetter known as West El Paso or the West Side, the area includes a portion of the Rio Grande floodplain upstream from downtown which is known locally as the Upper Valley and is located on the west side of the Franklin Mountains. The Upper Valley is the greenest part of the county due to the Rio Grande. The west side is home to some of the most affluent neighborhoods within the city, such as the Coronado Hills and Country Club neighborhoods. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of El Paso.\n\n\n=== West central El Paso ===\n\nWest central El Paso is located north of Interstate 10 and west of the Franklin Mountains. The University of Texas at El Paso and the Cincinnati Entertainment district are located in the heart of the area. Historic districts Kern Place and Sunset Heights are in this part of town.\nKern Place was founded in 1914 by Peter E. Kern, for whom the neighborhood was named.The homes of Kern Place are unique in architecture and some were built by residents themselves. One of the better known homes is the Paul Luckett Home located at 1201 Cincinnati Ave. above Madeline Park, and is made of local rock. It is known as \"The Castle\" due to its round walls and a crenelated rooftop.Kern Place is extremely popular with college and university students. The area is known for its glitzy entertainment district, restaurants and coffee shops who cater to both business patrons and university students. After UTEP's basketball and football games, UTEP fans pack the Kern Place area for food and entertainment at Cincinnati Street a small bar district. This bar scene has grown over the years and has attracted thousands to its annual Mardi Gras block party as well as after sporting events or concerts. Young men and women make up the majority of the crowds who stop in between classes or after work.Sunset Heights is one of the most historic areas in town, which has existed since the latter part of the 1890s. Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory, but many have been neglected and have deteriorated. During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, Doroteo Arango (also known as Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s. During the 1910 Mexican Revolution many Mexicans fled Mexico and settled in Sunset Heights.\n\n\n=== Northeast El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town is located north of central El Paso and east of the Franklin Mountains. Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like east El Paso and northwest El Paso, but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at Ft. Bliss in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at Andress High School, Parkland High School, Irvin High School, and Chapin High School.\n\n\n=== East El Paso ===\n\nThe area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population of over 200,000. It includes the 79936 ZIP Code, which was considered in 2013 as the most populous in the nation with over 114,000 people.\n\n\n=== Mission Valley ===\n\nFormerly known as the lower valley, it includes part of Eastside and all lower valley districts. It is the third largest area of the city, behind east El Paso and central El Paso. Hawkins Road and Interstate 10 border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain).\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: Ysleta Mission-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), Socorro Mission-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and San Elizario Chapel (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King Philip II of Spain.\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n\n=== Texas and New Mexico suburbs ===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico. The most populated suburbs in Texas are Socorro, Horizon City, Fort Bliss and San Elizario. Other Texas suburbs are Anthony, Canutillo, Sparks, Fabens, and Vinton.\nAlthough Anthony, Santa Teresa, Sunland Park, and Chaparral lie adjacent to El Paso County, they are considered to be part of the Las Cruces, New Mexico metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings ===\n\nEl Paso's tallest building, the Wells Fargo Plaza, was built in the early 1970s as State National Plaza. The black-windowed, 302-foot (92 m) building is famous for its 13 white horizontal lights (18 lights per row on the east and west sides of the building, and seven bulbs per row on the north and south sides) that were lit at night. The tower did use a design of the United States flag during the July 4 holidays, as well as the American hostage crisis of 1980, and was lit continuously following the September 11 attacks in 2001 until around 2006. During the Christmas holidays, a design of a Christmas tree was used, and at times, the letters \"UTEP\" were used to support University of Texas at El Paso athletics. The tower is now only lit during the holiday months, or when special events take place in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2010 U.S. census, 649,121 people, 216,694 households, and 131,104 families resided in the city.

The tramway complex covers 196 acres (0.79 km2) on the east side of the Franklin Mountains. The gondolas travel along two 2,600-foot (790 m) \u200b1 3\u20448 diameter steel cables to Ranger Peak, 5,632 feet (1,717 m) above sea level. The trip takes about four minutes and lifts riders 940 feet (290 m) above the boarding area.The tramway was built in 1959 by KTSM radio to aid in the construction of a transmitter tower. Karl O. Wyler managed the project. First opening to the public as the El Paso Aerial Tramway, the facility provided rides from 1960 to 1986, when high liability insurance costs forced the tram to stop public operations. The tram was only used to service the transmitter towers. Wyler donated the tramway for public use in his will. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department accepted the donation in 1997 and renovated and re-opened the tramway to the public in 2001.\nHueco Tanks State Historic Site is a Texas historic site in the Hueco Tanks area, approximately 32 miles (51 km) northeast of downtown El Paso and just west of the Hueco Mountains.

This significance is partially manifested in the pictographs (rock paintings) that can be found throughout the region, many of which are thousands of years old. Hueco Tanks is also widely regarded as one of the best areas in the world for bouldering (rock climbing, low enough to attempt without ropes for protection), unique for its rock type, the concentration and quality of the climbing, and after which the Hueco bouldering grades are named. In any given climbing season, which generally lasts from October through March, it is common for climbers from across Europe, Asia, and Australia to visit the park. Since implementation of the Public Use Plan, following a brief closure of the entire park due to the park service's inability to manage the growing crowds of international climbers, volunteer or commercial guides are required to access more than 2/3 of the park's area. Only North Mountain is accessible without guides, and then only for about 70 people at any given time.

The first electrified line across the Rio Grande, which opened on January 11, 1902, was preceded by a network that relied on animal labor. The system quickly spread into residential and industrial areas of El Paso. In 1913, a 12-mile (19 km) interurban line was built to Ysleta. At the close of 1943, the holding company El Paso Electric sold its subsidiary, the El Paso Electric Railway Company and its Mexican counterpart, to one of National City Lines' subsidiaries. This resulted in the formation of El Paso City Lines, whose domestic streetcar lines were replaced by buses in 1947. The international streetcar line which crossed the border via the Stanton Street Bridge continued to operate until 1973.

The system was constructed under the authority of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, but when the major construction was completed, around spring 2018, it was transferred to Sun Metro, for operation and maintenance. As of 2016, construction of the system was projected to cost $97 million.\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\n\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of Nueva Espa\u00f1a, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe. Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area:\n\nBridge of the Americas, also known as the Cordova Bridge.\nGood Neighbor International Bridge, also known as the Stanton Street Bridge\nPaso del Norte International Bridge, also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge.\nYsleta\u2013Zaragoza International Bridge, also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.The city collects tolls at its international bridges.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of museums in West Texas\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Source notes ===\n\n\n== References ==\nHammond, John Hays (1935).

        "wiki": "A bosque ( BOHS-kay) is a type of gallery forest habitat found along the riparian flood plains of stream and river banks in the southwestern United States.  It derives its name from the Spanish word for woodlands.\n\n\n== Setting ==\nIn the predominantly arid or semi-arid southwestern United States, a bosque is an oasis-like ribbon of green vegetation, often canopied, that only exists near rivers, streams, or other water courses.  The most notable bosque is the 300-mile (480 km)-long ecosystem along the middle Rio Grande in New Mexico that extends from Santa Fe south to El Paso, Texas. One of the most famous and ecologically intact sections of the bosque is included in the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nCommon trees in the bosque habitat include mesquite, cottonwood, desert willow, and desert olive. Because there is often only a single canopy layer and because the tree species found in the bosque are generally deciduous, a wide variety of shrubs, grasses, and other understory vegetation is also supported.  Desert hackberry, blue palo verde, graythorn (Condalia lycioides), Mexican elder (Sambucus mexicana ), virgin's bower, and Indian root all flourish in the bosque. The habitat also supports a large variety of lichens.  For a semi-arid region, there is extraordinary biodiversity at the interface of the bosque and surrounding desert ecosystems. Certain subsets of vegetative association are defined within the Kuchler scheme, including the Mesquite Bosque.\nThe bosque is an important stopover for a variety of migratory birds, such as ducks, geese, egrets, herons, and Sandhill Cranes. Year-round avian residents include Red-tailed hawks, Cooper's hawks, American kestrels, hummingbirds, owls, woodpeckers, and the southwestern willow flycatcher. Aquatic fauna of the bosque include the endangered Rio Grande silvery minnow.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\nOngoing efforts to undo damage to the bosque ecosystem caused by human development, fires, and invasive species in the 20th century. Where possible, levees and other flood control devices along the Rio Grande are being removed, to allow the river to undergo its natural cycle. Since 1996, Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program (BEMP) of the University of New Mexico has worked on habitat restoration and ecological monitoring within the bosque, as well as raising awareness of the ecological importance of this habitat through educational outreach initiatives.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFlora of New Mexico\nRiparian forest\nTugay, an analogous forest type in the deserts and steppes of Central Asia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSave our Bosque Report (.pdf)\nBosque Management and Endangered Species (BMEP)\nFire commander: Bosque\u2019s urban area presents challenge\nRace to reduce bosque fires",

        "wiki": "An arroyo (; from Spanish arroyo Spanish: [a\u02c8ro\u029do], \"brook\"), also called a wash, is a dry creek, stream bed or gulch that temporarily or seasonally fills and flows after sufficient rain. Flash floods are common in arroyos following thunderstorms.\nIn Spain and Latin America any small river is called an arroyo, flowing continually all year and never drying.\nThe Spanish term for the subject of this article is rambla, while  wadi (Arabic) is used in North Africa, and Western Asia. Arroyos provide a water source to desert animals.\nThe desert dry wash biome is restricted to the arroyos of the southwestern United States.\n\n\n== Types and processes ==\nArroyos can be natural fluvial landforms or constructed flood control channels.  The term usually applies to a sloped or mountainous terrain in xeric and desert climates.  In addition: in many rural communities arroyos are also the principal transportation routes; and in many urban communities arroyos are also parks and recreational locations, often with linear multi-use bicycle, pedestrian, and equestrian trails. Flash flooding can cause the deep arroyos or deposition of sediment on flooded lands. This can lower the groundwater level of the surrounding area, making it unsuitable for agriculture. However a shallow water table lowered in desert arroyo valleys can reduce saline seeping and alkali deposits in the topsoil, making it suitable for irrigated farming.\n\n\n=== Natural ===\nIn the U.S. state New Mexico, the Do\u00f1a Ana County Drainage Ordinance defines an arroyo as \"a watercourse that conducts an intermittent or ephemeral flow, providing primary drainage for an area of land of 40 acres (160,000 m2) or larger; or a watercourse which would be expected to flow in excess of one hundred cubic feet per second as the result of a 100 year storm event.\" Research has been conducted in the hydrological modeling relative to arroyos.\nNatural arroyos are made through the process known as arroyo-cutting. This occurs in arid regions such as New Mexico, where heavy rains can lead to enlargement of rivers cutting into surrounding rock creating ravines which are dry under normal weather conditions.\nIt is argued, however, whether these excessively stormy periods are the sole cause of arroyo-cutting as other factors such as long-term climate changes must also be taken into account. Arroyo cutting which occurred in the 1900s in the southwestern United States caused serious farming issues such as a lowered water table and the destruction of agriculture and grazing lands.\n\n\n=== Constructed ===\nIn agricultural areas in climates needing irrigation, farmers traditionally relied on small constructed arroyos, acequias, zanjas or aqueduct channels and ditches for the distribution of water.\nAn example of larger constructed arroyos is in Albuquerque, New Mexico. There are several miles of open-air concrete lined drainage channels that drain an area into the main North Diversion Channel, a tributary of the Rio Grande joining upstream of Albuquerque. After the San Juan Project Water Treatment Plant here, the Rio Grande's flow exceeding that needed for the river's silvery minnow habitat is available for municipal water supply diversion. Signs are posted at the constructed arroyos warning to keep out due to danger of flash flooding.\nThe Arroyo Seco and Los Angeles River are more famous examples in Southern California of former natural arroyo seasonal watercourses that became constructed open drainage system arroyos.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBillabong\nDraw\nWadi\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is a public research university in El Paso, Texas. It is a member of the University of Texas System. UTEP is the second-largest university in the United States to have a majority Mexican American student population (about 80%) after the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity.\" The university's School of Engineering is the nation's top producer of Hispanic engineers with M.S. and Ph.D. degrees.UTEP is home to the Sun Bowl stadium, which hosts the annual college football competition the Sun Bowl every winter.\nThe campus is one of the few places in the world outside of Bhutan or Tibet to have buildings created with the Dzong architectural style. It sits on hillsides overlooking the Rio Grande river, with Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in view across the Mexico\u2013United States border.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nOn April 16, 1913, SB 183 was signed by the Texas governor allocating funding for a new educational institution which would later become UTEP, making it the second oldest academic institution in the University of Texas system. The school officially opened on September 28, 1914, with 27 students in buildings belonging to the former El Paso Military Institute on a site adjacent to Fort Bliss on the Lanoria Mesa. The school was founded in 1913 as the State School of Mines and Metallurgy, and a practice mineshaft survives on the campus. By 1916, enrollment had grown to 39 students, including its first two female students, Ruth Brown and Grace Odell.\nOn October 29, 1916, a devastating fire destroyed the main building of the school, prompting its relocation. In 1917, the new school facility was constructed on its present site above Mundy Heights at the Paso del Norte, with the land donated by several El Paso residents. In a period when United States architects were designing in styles adopted especially from Europe, Kathleen Worrell, wife of the university's dean, was attracted by photographs of the Kingdom of Bhutan in a 1914 issue of National Geographic magazine, which showed the dzong architecture style of its Buddhist monasteries. The resemblances between the local terrain and mountainous features of Bhutan inspired her to propose designing early buildings of the mining school in the dzong style. Liking its distinctiveness, administrations have continued to choose that style for additional facilities, including the Sun Bowl football stadium and parking garages. Dzong architecture has characteristics such as sloping sides, markedly overhanging roofs, and bands of colored decoration.The University of Texas Board of Regents changed the name of the institution in 1919 first to the Department of Mines and Metallurgy and then to the College of Mines and Metallurgy of the University of Texas (TCM) in 1920.  The school's name was changed again in 1949 to Texas Western College of The University of Texas (TWC).\nNotable events at UTEP include the training in 1961 of the nation's first Peace Corps class, the construction of Sun Bowl Stadium in 1963, and the winning of the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship in 1966.\n\n\n=== The University of Texas at El Paso ===\nWhen the 60th Texas State Legislature designated the University of Texas as The University of Texas System in 1967, the name of the school was changed to The University of Texas at El Paso. While the 1967 law designated \"U.T. El Paso\" as the school's official abbreviated name, the school is more commonly referred to by its trademarked name of \"UTEP\". Known as the Miners since the school's opening in 1914, TCM's students painted a large \"M\" for Miners on the Franklin Mountains in 1923; this was later moved to a site adjacent to the Sun Bowl Stadium in the 1960s where it remains today.\n\nThe school has had achievements in academic and sports areas. In 1969, UTEP won the first of seven NCAA Men's Cross Country Championships. In 1974, UTEP's first doctoral degree program in Geological Sciences was approved. Also in 1974, UTEP won the first of seven NCAA Men's Indoor Track and Field Championships. In 1975 UTEP won both the NCAA Men's Outdoor and Indoor National Championships. UTEP is only one of a handful of universities to win at least 21 NCAA national championships in multiple sports.\nThe campus expanded in 1976 with the completion of the Engineering-Science Complex. That same year, the College of Nursing was founded. In 1977, the Special Events Center (now the Don Haskins Center) was built, featuring a 12,000-seat capacity for sporting events, live concerts, and other performances. An expansion of Sun Bowl Stadium followed in 1982, increasing its capacity to 52,000. The six-story University Library opened its doors to the public for the first time in 1984.\nIn 1988, Diana Natalicio became UTEP's first woman president. When she stepped down in August 2019, she was the longest-serving sitting president of a major public research university. In 1989, UTEP's second doctoral program was approved (in electrical engineering). Doctoral programs in computer engineering, psychology, and environmental science and engineering followed in 1991, 1993, and 1995, respectively. The university's cooperative pharmacy and nursing doctorate programs began in 1996 and 2000, respectively. A biological sciences doctorate program was started in 1997 and a history doctorate followed in 1999. Doctoral programs in international business, civil engineering, and rhetoric and composition were started in 2003.\n\nIn 1999, UTEP launched its MBA online degree program. It was designated as a Comprehensive Doctoral/Research-Intensive University by the Carnegie Foundation the following year. In 2002, the $11 million Larry K. Durham Sports Center opened and the Sam Donaldson Center for Communication Studies was established. The Academic Services and Biosciences buildings as well as the Engineering-Science complex in 2003. UTEP celebrated its 90th anniversary the next year with the Miners football team going to the Houston Bowl, and the men's basketball team made its 15th NCAA Tournament appearance.\nIn August 2019, Heather Wilson, Ph.D., became UTEP's 11th president. She previously served as the Secretary of the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\n== Academics and research ==\n\nThe University of Texas at El Paso is subdivided into eight colleges and schools, each of which offers a variety of degree programs including undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate.\nUTEP offers 74 undergraduate degrees, 76 master's-level degrees, and 22 doctoral degrees. The university ranked, in 2006, second in federal research spending among UT System academic institutions, and in the fiscal year of 2006, the school reported $45.7 million in total research spending. In 2018, the school announced that total annual research expenditures had reached $95 million. Leading research is being conducted on campus.\nOn January 9, 2019, it was announced that UTEP is now classified as an \"R1: Research University (Highest research activity)\" in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. This designation is reserved for doctoral universities with the highest levels of research activity.\nIn November 2012, it was announced Igor C. Almeida, Ph.D., professor of biological sciences at UTEP, had developed a fully protective vaccine against Chagas disease.\nUTEP also holds the rights to a patent (# 5,798,392) for the use of methanesulfonyl fluoride (MSF) as a central nervous system selective cholinesterase inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease developed by Donald E. Moss Ph.D., in the department of psychology.  A Phase I human clinical trial of MSF as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease was recently successfully completed in Germany.Hispanic Business magazine has twice ranked UTEP as the number one graduate engineering school for Hispanics. The National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering has called UTEP \"a model for other engineering institutions who say that today's minority young people from low-income families can't succeed in a rigorous math- or science-based discipline.\"\nThe National Science Foundation has designated UTEP as a Model Institution for Excellence, one of only six in the country. UTEP is one of only 11 universities nationwide to receive a $5 million Teachers for a New Era (TNE) research grant from the Carnegie Corporation.UTEP follows a semester system with a spring, summer, and fall semester annually, along with a shorter wintermester in the month of January.UTEP offers the USA's only bilingual M.F.A. creative writing program.\n\n\n== Campus architecture ==\n\nIn 1916, only two years after the school opened, the original campus buildings were destroyed in a fire. The school was rebuilt on its present site in 1917. Kathleen Worrell, wife of the school's first dean Steve H. Worrell, had seen pictures of Bhutanese buildings in an April 1914 issue of National Geographic. Noting the similarity of mountainous Bhutan (which is in the Himalayas) to the location of the campus, she suggested the new buildings be in the style of Bhutanese dzongs (monastic fortresses), with massive sloping walls and overhanging roofs. This idea was enthusiastically accepted by all.\nProminent El Paso architect Henry Trost designed the first four buildings. All buildings since then have followed this style, including a fifth by Trost in 1920, and three more by his firm in 1933\u20131937. While the early structures only copied the general appearance of a dzong, recent buildings incorporate internal elements of the dzong form as well.\nThe kingdom of Bhutan has honored UTEP's adoption of their country's style. Prince Jigyel Ugyen Wangchuk has visited the campus, and in 2009 the Kingdom presented UTEP with a hand-carved wooden temple to be erected on the campus.The Himalayan style of UTEP's campus made it an appropriate site for the Chenrezig Himalayan Cultural Center of El Paso, a Tibetan Buddhist facility.\n\n\n== School colors and logo ==\nSince the school was established as a department of the main branch of the University of Texas at Austin, the school's colors were originally orange and white. However, in the early 1980s, Columbia blue was added so now the official colors are orange, white, and blue. When the new UTEP athletic department logo was introduced in the fall of 1999, a darker hue of blue was incorporated into the logo, as well as a silver accent to go with the customary orange.\n\n\n== Athletics ==\n\nUTEP was the first college in the American South to integrate its intercollegiate sports programs. This change was made in the 1950s. When Don Haskins became basketball coach in 1961, he aggressively recruited black players. In 1966, Haskins' Miners  won the NCAA basketball championship, defeating an all-white Kentucky team in the final game. In 1966, at a time when many claimed black players lacked the mental and emotional \"necessities\" to compete at a high level, the UTEP Miners coach Don Haskins put his usual starting players in the Championship game. They were the first all-black team to start in a game at that level \u2013 and to win. This story was retold in Haskins' autobiography Glory Road (2005) and in the 2006 film Glory Road.  Haskins compiled a 719\u2013353 record and experienced only five losing seasons.  He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1997, and the special events center was renamed the Don Haskins Center. He retired from coaching in 1999, and died in 2008. The entire 1966 UTEP team was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2007.In 1968, the UTEP Track and Field program revoked the scholarships of eight black athletes after they boycotted a meet at Brigham Young University in protest of perceived racism at BYU and in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints of the era.  This included future Gold Medal winner and world record long jump holder Bob Beamon, who would briefly return to the school after the incident but not graduate.  The coach at the time later regretted his actions, and felt that he and the school acted hastily.UTEP's sports programs have won a total of 21 NCAA Division I national championships. UTEP is tied for 10th overall among schools in Men's Sports Division I championships.\n\nMen's basketball: 1 (1966; the only NCAA men's basketball title won by a university from the state of Texas)\nMen's cross country: 7 (an eighth title was vacated by the NCAA following the championship)\nMen's indoor track & field: 7\nMen's outdoor track & field: 6UTEP owns the two largest venues in El Paso, Texas:\n\nSun Bowl Stadium, seating capacity 51,500, opened its doors in 1963 and is the home to the UTEP football team and to the annual Sun Bowl game.\nDon Haskins Center, seating capacity 12,000, was built in 1976 and is primarily used by the men's and women's basketball teams. It is also known as \"The Bear's Den\" as well as \"The Don.\" The arena is also used for concerts by mainstream artists.\nUniversity Field (UTEP), seating capacity 500, was built in 1991 and hosts the women's soccer team.\nKidd Field, seating capacity 15,000, home of UTEP Track and Field teams.In 2005, UTEP moved to Conference USA from the Western Athletic Conference and was classified \"RU/H\" by the Carnegie Foundation.Mike Price was hired as football coach in 2003 and announced his retirement in November 2012. On December 10, 2012, it was announced that Sean Kugler would be taking over as the new UTEP football coach.In 2010, Tim Floyd became the head basketball coach. He was a protege of Don Haskins and is a former coach at the University of New Orleans, the NBA's Chicago Bulls and New Orleans Hornets, and the University of Southern California. Floyd retired in 2017 due to recurring health issues and was succeeded by Rodney Terry, former head coach at Fresno State.\n\n\n=== Pickaxe hand symbol ===\n\nThis hand symbol represents the traditional tool used by Miners, the pickaxe, and is similar to the shaka sign and the letter Y in american sign language. This gesture is made by UTEP Miners fans when UTEP players are shooting free throws at basketball games, or any time UTEP kicks off at a football game. It was first introduced by the UTEP cheerleading squad during the 1976\u201377 football season.\n\n\n=== Nickname ===\nThe first reference to the nickname \"Miners\" is found in the February 1919 (volume 1, number 1) issue of the Prospector, the school's student newspaper. However, an earlier reference can be found in the handwritten bill (Senate Bill 183) that established the school in 1913, where the author, State Senator Claude Hudspeth, mistakenly wrote \"Miners\" instead of \"Mines,\" and thus referred to the school as the \"State School of Miners and Metallurgy.\" It is presumed the nickname \"Miners\" came from the fact the school was founded as the \"State School of Mines and Metallurgy.\" In doing research on this project, early mention of \"Ore Diggers\" and \"Muckers\" for the nickname was found, but nothing to determine if the name \"Miners\" was voted upon by the student body, or if a faculty member, John W. (Cap) Kidd, chose the name. Kidd was a big booster of athletics, especially football, and in 1915, when funds were lean at the school, Kidd donated $800 to equip the football team, though there is no evidence other than anecdotal he contributed this amount. He also assisted with coaching, although he was not the head coach. The present track facility on campus, Kidd Field, bears Cap Kidd's name.\n\n\n=== School songs ===\n\"The Eyes of Texas\" was adopted by the 1920 student body after the song had been \"declared the school anthem for the University of Texas at Austin\".UTEP's fight song, \"Miners Fight\" was also borrowed from the Austin campus.\nWith the estate of Marty Robbins, the UTEP Music Department in the late 1980s wrote new words to the melody of his Grammy Award-winning Country & Western hit \"El Paso\". This gave UTEP a fight song all its own, to a tune recognized across the nation.\n\n\n=== Rivalries ===\nNew Mexico State University: UTEP has a strong rivalry with New Mexico State University, known as \"The Battle of I-10\". UTEP and NMSU are just over 40 miles apart.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n=== Faculty ===\nZuill Bailey, professor of cello, professional cellist\nSteven Best, professor of philosophy and co-founder of the North American Animal Liberation Press Office\nAndy Cohen, Major League Baseball second baseman who coached university team for 17 years\nJorge Gardea-Torresdey, chemistry professor and nanoparticle researcher\nLaurie Ann Guerrero, writer and Texas Poet Laureate\nJohn Haddox, philosopher and Latin-Americanist\nAnna Jaquez, art professor\nJorge L\u00f3pez, physics professor and educator\nUrbici Soler y Manonelles, Spanish sculptor\nBenjamin Alire S\u00e1enz, writer\nEllwyn R.

          "I wish I had read the reviews before I drove two hours to get to the park. Perhaps then I would have seen that there were three parking options. I took the longer hike and was not prepared for the sun, the heat, and the distance it took to get there. Lesson learned: Read trip",
          "This is a must see area. My son and I checked this out and were delighted. He was able to do the steep incline path down. I was able to take great shots from up above.",
          "Not many people there, which was perfect. Kind of off the beaten path but worth it. It was so relaxing and beautiful. It was 100 degrees that day, but didn't feel that way at all. There are a few walk through small caves. Would recommend highly.",
          "People bring their dogs--they are not allowed and their is no water there. Bottom line is to bring water. It gets very hot there in the summer. Some of the areas are a challenge so if you have some walking or health issues beware. It is a long walk but very interesting and",
          "Worth the drive to walk around and discover this great geological site. Bring plenty of water and sunscreen and discover all the little trails that lead you to fun and interesting nooks and crannies.",
          "This was definitely out of our way, but was worth the drive. There are three different spots to park and trails that take you down into the mines if you wish. Wear good shoes and watch your step since some areas are steep and the stone is soft. Or just stay on the top of the",
          "This is a hidden gem. It's an easy hike and the scenery is beautiful. When we went (10 am-ish), it was extremely windy, so that helped with the heat. There are several trails and you get to see plenty without damaging the rocks. We did this on our last day in CO Springs, and",
          "Okay.. We have seen maybe beautiful landscapes on our westernly cross-country trip: Grand Canyon, Grand Teton, Glacier NP, Badlands etc.. But I really, really enjoyed coming here. First, it's not so large that its overwhelming to the senses, and second you can actually walk",
          "Paint Mines Interpretive Park is a wonderful visit and I would highly recommend it! First of all, it is free. Second, it is truly spectacular and unique. It is in the middle of nowhere and it is out in the open with no coverage, so maybe go in the morning or evening, but it is",
          "Trail hiking is easy, and we found this a beautiful place to enjoy prairie wildflowers, in addition to the incredible formations. It's unfortunate the place is not patrolled, because left to their own devices, people do NOT do the right thing. Despite multiple signs, most",
          "The paint mines are very beautiful and wroth visiting. The clay formations with all the different colors are great.",
          "Paint Mines Interpretive Park has awesome geologic features in the southeastern plains of Colorado, and it is an enchanting place for hiking. But the park needs to be developed by adding facilities to enhance visitor experience. Currently, the trails are developed but there is",
          "We had a family group of 11 touring and this was one of our stops. The family really thought the formations were interesting and the wind turbines. So cool. We were disturbed by the people climbing on the formations. Signs say not to. Some people are stupid. So go see these",
          "When you first pull up on this hidden gem you wonder if you just made a wasted trip. But, hike back into the heart of the park and you\u2019ll have no doubt it was worth it. This is a beautiful area full of color and awe. Like so many naturally beautiful areas in Colorado though,",
          "We\u2019ve lived in Colorado Springs 21 years and never knew it was here. Beautiful! My suggestion would be to come in early morning as the light would be better for photos as we were there in mid-day and it was very bright off the whiteness of the area. A great outdoor destination",
          "Stunning landscape and land formations. would recommend to go early morning to catch the sunrise over the hills.",
          "I do a lot of research before our travels and aways want to see something new each times. The Paint Mines fit the bill. Even a few of the Colorado visitor center fold did not know about it. Nice hiking paths through the park. Go to the south smaller parking lot and you are",
          "Absolutely beautiful. My daughter and I enjoyed the trails. Our photos are gorgeous. Went during the week, only a handful of visitors.",
          "I visited the Paint Mines during my 2 months long visit in Colorado where I had a second Work and Travel experience and as it happens, I am a big fan of canyons and canyon-like attractions so of course I found this open to public park which I had to see, especially because it",
          "This place is beautiful. A natural wonder. The wife and I packed a lunch and just enjoyed the view. Would have got 5 stars but the place was crowded. Walked around a corner and saw an almost naked woman getting her picture taken. I\u2019m guessing/hoping, modeling pictures? Will be",
          "Since it became an official park, visitors have increased 1000 percent. Used to visit before it was a park & I would be the only one there. Over-crowded nowadays. There are better spots to visit in the state.",
          "Different from what you expect of Colorado. Fun place to explore. Lots of jackrabbits. Not too far of a drive if you are going from Denver.",
          "About a month ago I was on a massive Pinterest binge when I stumbled upon photos of The Paint Mines Interpretive Park. I had NO idea a place like this existed, and it was a little over AN HOUR away from where we live?!? We had to go, and we had to go RIGHT AWAY! It's located",
          "We took the long drive out here to hike and it was beautiful. I would recommend this place for a good hike and chance to see such a pretty place.",
          "County park, no cost involved. It is out on the prairie so bring your own food/drinks. No trees so sunscreen probably also in order. It's only a couple miles outside of the Town of Calhan.",
          "First glance from the Overlook Parking area was disappointing to say the least! The short hike proved differently. Secondly, we took the Interpretative Trail, a longer hike and the beauty was astounding! It was snow packed and wet in spots! NOTE: Dogs are not allowed, but one",
          "Depending on your level of interest in Geology and history, this could be a short trip, or you could find yourself immersed in your surroundings. The casual tourist will see a bunch of clay and hole in the ground. Others will find it fascinating. Bring water in the summer.",
          "Weather was great nice hike can get windy so dress for the weather Restroom not available today Bring water",
          "Spent the afternoon hiking The Paint Mines Interpretive Park. It is very close to Colorado Springs and easy to find. Make sure you bring good hiking shoes, water and camera. It's one of Colorado's hidden gems. While you are hiking you will see the wind farm on the other side",
          "You will feel like you\u2019ve traveled to another planet. The paint mines are breathtaking. Like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before.",
          "We went with 3 little ones and didnt plan on spending as much time as we did there! The kids loved climbing the rocks and exploring the cavities. Great spot for photographers. Would reccomend bringing a lunch but seating is very limited as was the facilities. Go prepared,",
          "This scenic place is somewhat out in the middle of nowhere. It is very quiet and peaceful. We enjoyed a leisurely stroll at the top of the ridge looking down on all the unusual rock formations. Lots of people were enjoying hiking and climbing down among the rocks. It was so",
          "This is a largely unspoiled area. It is a good stretch out to walk along the trail to the mines with some up and down hill which might not be so easy for less able bodied people. Try and choose a fine dry day as the paths can become quite sloppy with the clay soil. Amazing",
          "This is a park about 1 hour east of Colorado Springs - it\u2019s out in the middle of the plains, a rather unlikely location. However wandering amongst the outcrops of white, ochre and maroon rocks, the odd shapes and narrow canyons is an interesting afternoon. This time of year the",
          "Peaceful and majestic site with beautiful upclose views of layered sand. Great for kids to run around and see wildlife, rabbits running around. It's a beautiful natural beauty spot with little tourism disruption of the rocks. It's alittle out of the way but worth your time. Be",
          "This is a must stop for geology fans. Or people who love the beauty that nature provides. We went late in the day to avoid the heat. Bring water. Sunscreen. It was nice and cool at dusk. So much so we needed sweatshirts. Teenager and my 6 year old nephew loved this place.",
          "I will confess that, due to certain circumstances on that day, we did not hike out into the formations as we had originally planned to do. However, much to my surprise, we were able to get some pretty good looks at them from various points along the dirt road that leads from the",
          "At first I thought the place was just ok. Kinda cool. As I walked back farther into the place it got neater and neater. You are surrounded by the formations that loom over you. There are enough that it took me about 90 minutes down and back to feel like I\u2019d explored them",
          "If you are near Colorado Springs that is worth the detour. It is not even on the AAA roadmap. Be sure to watch directions closely: at the turn off highway 24 there is a sign that reads \"1.5 miles\". There are NO FURTHER DIRECTION SIGNS. Be sure to watch for Funk Road, and turn",
          "I\u2019ve done a ton of hiking throughout the Rockies and the Southwest, but have never seen the variety of colored rock as in this park. An easy drive from Denver, Colorado Springs, and even Boulder. The park is relatively small, and can get a bit crowded, but it was certainly worth",
          "I was so surprised when I found out about the Paint Mines--such a beautiful place I didn't know about in Colorado! I loved seeing the rock formations. Please be careful about staying on the trails--we saw a lot of people climbing all over the rocks, which is very tempting, but",
          "My husband and I went with my brother and his family, just to check it out. I am so glad that we did, because it was beautiful. We weren\u2019t able to stay long, but we will go back the next time we come to Colorado.",
          "Visited this place on the way back from Pikes Peak. Beautiful scenery. The colors are amazing. Hike was a bit much for the kiddo, but a great walk nonetheless.",
          "What a hidden treasure. The structures are amazing as well as the many different colors. Make sure you park at the smaller parking lot which is closer to the site.",
          "We lived in the area for 6 months and went almost Dailey to walk are dogs . Lots of pictures taking a real must see if your in the area don\u2019t miss out on the chance to see the amazing beauty",
          "Loved this hike and all of the little things we saw on the trail. Started in the south parking lot where the 4 mile trail starts. First thing to know, there is very little shade. So go early, bring sunscreen and lots of water! The trail starts with formations right away and they",
          "While the actual Park doesn't come up to the standards of marketing photos, this site is remarkable. Bring water, wear a hat, and expect to hike a bit. Each section is worth a visit. Hard to believe this is in the \"middle of nowhere\" and so different than anything in the",
          "So much better when you find the closer parking lot to the rock formations. There are two parking lots, one more norther and one more southern. The southern one is smaller but brings you right into the formations and you don't have to walk as much. Love going here but now even",
          "Enjoyed the hike and seeing the rock formations. Fun to play with the photos in effects. Want to go back at sunset.",
          "We took our children, ages 11 and 14, on a very hot morning after reading all of the positive reviews. We weren't disappointed! Thankfully, we took one reviewers advice and drove to the 2nd parking lot, where we had immediate access to the mines. It is steep in some places, and",
          "We visited with friends who had been here once before, thankfully. AND I would like to go back, better prepared. The formations are very interesting, the colors a bit unusual, there are caves to explore too. We went into 3 different sections and each time saw more formation",
          "If you think you need to drive into the mountains in Colorado to enjoy a hike, you're wrong. GPS will guide you from Calhan along a couple county roads to a Badlands-esque park where soft minerals erode in layers making interesting hoodoos. If you're quiet and early you can see",
          "Drove 2 hours here, largely based on reviews. Big disappointment! Nowhere did I read that out of the 4 mile hike, at least 3 of those miles was walking through a field! I expected 4 miles of hiking through formations, and in reality there were only 1/2 dozen formations, that in",
          "The colors were amazing. This is a hike you want to do in the cooler part of the day and bring water. No dogs are allowed. The historic signs ere very helpful. It\u2019s wise to park on in the .south parking area as it is closer to the formations. There are restrooms.",
          "I've lived in Colorado for 33 years and have to say that visiting this incredibly beautiful location was like discovering a 'secret paradise'! I'd vaguely recalled hearing the name \"Paint Mines\", but really had NO clue about what's there until researching it online. It would",
          "Stop by to see this, whether you\u2019re passing through Colorado Springs or staying here, it\u2019s not far. It\u2019s gorgeous and so different from other natural formations.",
          "I wont redo what others have said. Just, go do this and bring a better camera than your cellphone. Tripadvisor says I should say more. The thing I wish I read was, there are two lots, one close to the formations and one about .75 mile away. The closer lot is NOT where the GPS",
          "I love coming to the Paint Mines. I always park at the first lot and walk the short distance to the rock formations. I love viewing the valley beforehand because you have no idea how big these formations are until you get closer. There are a few trails that are among the rocks",
          "We visted CO Springs to see some friends and they suggested we stop at the Painted Mines on our way back to Kansas. It was on our route home, and from route 24 we only had to go out of our way maybe 2 miles tops. It was SO worth it! We hit the place around 9am and it already",
          "This was a very nice place to visit. The hike was fairly easy & the trail was of a consistency we were able to push our baby in a stroller on it. The full hike gives a beautiful scenic view. The paint Mines themselves are gorgeous colors & really cool to look at. This place is",
          "Lived here 35 years and finally went this weekend. Short drive from Colorado Springs. Would recommend the parking lot that is further from the main entrance as the hike kind of ends at the formations with an overlook of them that you don't appreciate if starting at the main lot.",
          "This is just 30 minutes east of COS, and it was a great treasure. It is a free hike with few people. We didn\u2019t have to worry about getting other people in our pictures, and there was plenty of freedom to explore. Our kids climbed and tunneled and explored forever.",
          "A really cool park to hike around in. The color of the painted rock formations is like nothing ever seen before. However it is decently far from Colorado Springs.",
          "We are locals and never knew this place existed. Only a 50 minute drive from Colorado Springs. We went in March. It was cold and windy hiking to the formations, but warm once you were standing next to them. Dress in layers for sure. We explored for just a few hours and took lots",
          "Being a native I never knew this existed. The light was not the best to showcase the colors. I would suggest coming early in the day or later afternoon to get better pictures. Be prepared and dress in layers, the winds make it cold in some areas and the protected in other areas",
          "Very interesting natural formations and colors. There are actually three different parking areas. The \"main\" lot is the largest and has a restroom. I can't tell you about the trail from the main lot, but I imagine it's the easiest to traverse. My friend and I went to the",
          "We are probably not good people to review this place as we had 2 people in our party that could not walk very well. It would take several miles of walking on passable trails to see this attraction. Facilities wise there is minimal their. One picnic table & an out house. Poor",
          "It's kind of incredible this is right here and relatively unknown by Denver residents. It's 730 acres that includes wetlands, native-grass prairie, and diverse wildlife and wildflowers, but the most incredible part is the abundance of cliffs, spires, hoodoos, and labyrinth-like",
          "The paint mines are beautiful, and if you are looking for a nice relaxing walk without the crowds check this place out. My wife and I went on a weekend and there were very few people her. Loved the views and the trails are well kept.",
          "When I first went there, I thought the place did not have much to offer. It was literally in the middle of nowhere. However, when I made it to the formations, I was pleasantly surprised. It was similar to a miniature version of South Dakota's Badlands. However, you were able",
          "I drove out to Calhan, CO early to catch the sunrise, then went to The Paint Mines Interpretive Park to see the rock formations in the early light. The hike is very easy, and the colors provide great scenery for photographs.",
          "I had been wanting to go to the Paint Mines Park for several months and finally on Christmas Day was able to make it there. Boy, was I amazed! A stunning drive to the location, and Calhan such a quaint town. Friendly visitors awaited my 80-year-old Mother and me. The Paint",
          "Whenever people think of Colorado, they think of the exciting urban front range or the glorious mountains. But there are delightful surprises on the eastern plains, if you take the time to seek them out. One of these is the Paint Mines Interpretive Park in Calhan. It's the",
          "So glad we visited this place!!!! It\u2019s so stunning! It doesn\u2019t seem to be very well known. I\u2019d recommend wearing shoes with good grip and wearing gloves as the Rocks tear up your hands a bit! Also wear sunglasses. The sun reflecting on the limestone is pretty rough on your eyes!",
          "I will say that the children on the field trip appeared to enjoy exploring the rocks and crevices. My average rating is due more to how it rates compared to Garden of the Gods...or other rock formations I have seen on my travels. The lack of an actual restroom with flushing",
          "This historic and beautiful park is a worthwhile trip from Denver. It is approximately 1-1/2 hours travel time and you'll find directions on the park's website. The main entrance has the larger parking lot, and also a toilet facility. It is a quarter mile hike down a well",
          "That is what this reminded me of..a very mini Badlands! The colors are beautiful. If you are unsure of your footing, do not use the west parking lot. It has a fairly steep grade and no traction. Other than that, beautiful. Looking forward to having time to explore it more",
          "First off, we pulled into the parking lot and could only see a grassy field with a dirt path. We had driven all the way from Denver so the first impression was that this road trip was a bust. Could not have been more wrong about that, if you follow the path it opens up to",
          "Short hike, very pretty scenery. We went on a hot day, would have been much more enjoyable on a cooler one. We were there about an hour- gorgeous and worth seeing!",
          "Awesome place to come to. Either to fly a drone or catch milky way pictures behind the rock formations.",
          "I'm not a big hiker but I really enjoyed this hike. My husband and I enjoyed the peace and quiet of the Paint Mines. Along the trails are interpretive signs. As you look over the rock formations and onto the prairies, you can almost imagine what life was like for the Native",
          "Less than an hour drive east of Colorado Springs and you'll find mother nature in her glory with natural erosion over millions of years displaying structures and colors matching a micro version of the Grand Canyon, Painted desert and Moab all blended into one. Wear good hiking",
          "This is a favorite destination of ours, but this summer is especially the time to go. Rains have made this desert park bloom like it hasn't in years. The rock formations are scrubbed of their usual dust, as are the trails, making the colors more vibrant and the shapes of the",
          "This is a multi-orgasmic trail with plenty of photo opps! Worth the drive and a very amazing destination.",
          "This is a pretty basic 3 mile loop, but it is absolutely stunning. It reminded me of Bryce Canyon on a MUCH smaller scale. On the weekends, I would suggest getting there before noon. It was starting to get busy as we were leaving. There are a few benches and picnic tables if you",
          "Calhan Colorado...east of Colorado Springs. 90% fields then out of nowhere is a really colorful and cool attraction. The Paint Mines are such a surprise and fun to see. A short hike so take a bit of water. great place when you want to get out of Denver people!",
          "On the drive you'll feel like your GPS had you take a wrong turn. Even once you get there, you'll wonder where the formations are, but after a short hike, you'll feel like you entered another world. We took a chance and parked in the second lot, which had a steeper walk down,",
          "35 to 40 miles east of Colorado Springs, the park is worth the drive. It was a cool day when we visited so walking the 3.5 miles around the park was not too bad. Bring water. Please do not climb on the rock formations. Some are fragile and we would like to have them",
          "It's easy to decide not to see the Paint Mines with the hour drive to get to them from Colorado Springs. They really are worth the trip though. While there is a variety of color to the formations, the formations are most impressive for their shapes. If you enjoyed Garden of",
          "This Park is awesome. Pictures don't do it justice. If you go in hotter months I suggest sunscreen, water and hat. There is absolutely no shade. You do not need special hiking boots, we were fine with tennis shoes as the trails are sand and you are not allowed to climb the rocks",
          "Two moms and 4 kids (8 and 10 yr olds) headed out mid morning on an 80* day. We had plenty of water and there was a breeze (especially when getting up above the formations.) The kids enjoyed pretending they were explorers. And the moms marveled at the amazing landscape. It was",
          "Beautiful place! It's like being on another planet. And it's free. There not much else around. In town there's a real cool antique shop named Cadillac Jacks.",
          "The colorful rock formations themselves are beautiful and worth seeing. Wear sunscreen; it's easy to get both sun and wind-burn on the plains. Issues: not enough parking or trail signs. Hopefully the County will fix that. The one trail took us through an overgrown field, which",
          "This place takes a little effort to get to, but was a big hit for my 9 year old son and myself. Any kid who likes to climb (or adult in who wants to get back in touch with their inner child) will have a lot of fun climbing around the hoodoos and the slot canyons in between them.",
          "Really nice place to see and easy trails, even though some ups and downs, but you can take your time and enjoy the quiet surroundings.",
          "Our daughter took us here. The rock formations are stunning as are the colors. This is well worth the 40 minute drive from Colorado Springs. lots of hiking and climbing opportunities",
          "Last day of our US tour. Found this place whilst driving up the motorway back to Denver so spent a couple of hours walking around.",
          "A little out in the middle of nowhere, but interesting. You could easily spend about an hour or more walking around the trails in and around these interesting and colorful hoodoos. The most disappointing thing was seeing so many people disregarding the rules to not climb on the",
          "Not a long hike, easy to do unless you wish to climb about, the colors and formations here are simply beautiful. This is a perfect example of mother nature doing some artwork. Not far from Colorado Springs, CO, there is an added attraction of seeing a wind farm on the adjacent",
          "I've been here twice so far doing photographs. I'll come back. When the light is flat, the photos are flat. When the light's great, the photos are great. Just make sure you expect muddy clay, take extra shoes and a plastic bag for the shoes that get sticky mud on them. But",
          "Great established paths lead to a small colorful canyon. There are easy as well as more strenuous paths to choose from. Several benches scattered around for those that need to rest or just want to sit and enjoy looking out over the area. Places to explore and hide as well as a",
          "Excellent place with beautiful formations and Good easy hiking. Please respect the rules and stay off the formations so others can enjoy them as well.",
          "When I first moved out west, I thought this was much nicer than now that I have traveled extensively in Utah. That being said, the geology is different and you even get some purple colors on the rock. It is a small area and kids love it. There were many children freely roaming",
          "We happened upon Painted mine on the outskirts of Colorado Springs while looking for a nice place for a hike with a young child. The location which is a resplendent badlands formation consisting of iron and sulfur deposits which stain the earth in a kaleidoscope of yellows,",
          "We went on a cold windy day and that was a mistake but we will go back on a better day. The biggest issue was ice on the trails. Yesterday was warm day... The snow melted and ran down into the mine then froze back. It made most trails impassable, something like ice skating",
          "Such different terrain and a wonderful way to discover part of our history. We enjoyed visiting this park reminiscent of Badlands National Park, but far less busy.",
          "One of Mother Nature's small gems, the Paint Mines in Calhan, Colorado are just right for a morning hike or family exploration, far from city noise and traffic. If you park at the first lot (which has a restroom of sorts) and start hiking in, take the first turn off to the right",
          "I LOVE neat geological formations !!!! Love that this place is free with easy access. Just like photographing places like the Badlands in SD, the PRIME TIME for photographing the Paint Mines are the \"golden hours\" \u2014 early morning, late afternoon. During the midday hours,",

          "I have lived within 60 miles of this place all my life and finally got the chance to go! It is beautiful! Be prepared to walk, walk, walk! But it is worth it! The best time to go would be late Spring, early Fall. The summer heat would be a HOT one. If you do go in the summer",
          "In unexpected places the earth reveals its beauty. The paint mines is one such place. Cut out of the plains of Eastern El Paso County, the Paint Mines is a wonder of sculpted hoodoos and other formations. What makes this place special is the colors, whites, reds, greys and",

          "The drive to this place is beautiful. We parked at the main entrance and used the map provided there. The map shows a link between red and green paths but we were unable to find that spot and it was not marked. So we walked on the red line and reached the formation after walking",

          "If you've seen some of the big rock formations in Utah and Arizona you might not think much of this pretty little area as it is rather small (easy to walk through quickly). However, it is a beautiful little spot nonetheless. Great to get some gorgeous pictures of all the",

          "Having read a short travel article in our local paper, my elderly dad and I decided to check this place out. Upon arriving at the first parking lot, we consulted the guide map and decided that we would drive a tad bit farther (down the dirt road) to the second parking lot as it",
          "Before I begin my review, let me start with a plea. If you do choose to take this hike PLEASE stay off of the rock formations - STAY ON THE PATHS. We did notice vandalism in the form of etching into the rocks and paint splattered on the formations. Maintain the natural beauty of",
          "It's in the middle of nowhere in a town called Calhan that has Cadillac Jacks and a good pizza place but not much else. It looks like you're on the moon, in Utah and crazy beautiful colors. It's a flat easy hike with amazing views and good for families. Nice picture",
          "This small \"park\", located about 45 minutes Northeast of Colorado Springs, is a delightful respite to the simplicity of the Colorado plains. We were there on a cool day when melting snow turned many of the trails into small creeks. But, despite the wet feet, it was fascinating",
          "My daughter took us out to the Paint Mines on a cool breezy morning. As we pulled into the parking lot I was thinking that this was going to be a bust. Nothing but the prarie. Boy was I wrong. After walking up a short trail we entered the formations. Wow. So many beautiful",
          "We hiked this park with our two youngest sons and had a great time. We were the only hikers in view for 90% of the hike. Very quiet with clear trails. Beautiful colors in the terrain. Great example of grasslands if you need to do a Cub or Boy Scout hike. You'll find lots of",
          "Hiked around for about 2.5 hours, nice easy trails for my 6 and 8 year old along with gramma. Lots of little trails leading off the main trail to explore around.",
          "I wanted to shave a few years off my age and run around like a hyper 10 year old! Colors are great (reminiscent of the SD Badlands), moonscape formations, and who doesn't love a hoodoo!!! I'd avoid mid to late afternoon in the summer - the heat might be a bit much.",
          "This is an easy hike. Several trail options that can get you around or through the rock formations. It is actually quite fun to explore all the different options although limited in the climbing due to the fragility of the formations. I was surprised to see the windmill farm",
          "We visited the Paint Mines park on a lovely Saturday morning. It wasn't crowded and the path was easy to follow. The only problem is the post marking the trail isn't very useful. We just kept hiking and finding things to see. It is a pretty easy hike so good for families",
          "Worth the 45 minute drive from Colorado Springs. Very interesting place with lots of Native American history. The trails are very easy, and make sure you visit the overlook, which is just up the road from the trailhead. The scenery is beautiful and the colors in the rock are",
          "Worth the trip out there. You have to hike down to view the many colorful formations. Plan for your trip for about 3-4 hours, bring plenty of water and snacks. There is one picnic table at the entrance/parking lot as well as restrooms. Two parking areas, but the second is",
          "Went here for like 2 hours on a trip to southwest in September. I really enjoyed the scenery and color of rocks. The walk is pretty easy except there is some up hill walking if you chose one the parking lots closer to the main road. I compare it (to a degree) to Garden of the",

          "I recommend a sunrise visit, but I'm sure it's beautiful any time of day. It's an easy walk (I made it with two young kids) and well worth the hour or so you'll spend there.",
          "We spent about 3 hours exploring the area. My children really enjoyed it. I suggest going in the spring or fall because it can be hot.",
          "We were looking for something to do for an afternoon and we discovered the Paint Mines. We were pleasantly surprised by this hidden gem. You do have to drive quite far out of town but it is worth it. The rock formations are not as spectacular as Garden of the Gods but still",
          "Great easy to moderate hike. Trail is well maintained and has interpretive signs. The hoodoos are beautiful and amazing to see.",
          "An interesting drive through ranch country from Colorado Springs, it took about 40 minutes to get to Paint Mines. Went about an hour and half before sunset and there was no one there except the rabbits and jackrabbits. Beautiful formations, easy hike, peaceful and quiet. Lovely",
          "I wouldn't drive for hours to get to the Paint Mines but if you are in the area, it is definitely worth seeing. The formations are unique and beautiful and make sure that you walk down among them; just looking from above would definitely not do them justice.",
          "I felt like I was on a sci-fi movie or on mars. The formations were like I've never seen. We loved the beauty of the rocks. Make sure you bring lots of water!",

          "It's a pretty place to see. The hike is relatively easy and is short so it's fine for kids but dogs aren't allowed. There are also benches placed throughout the path. It's cool but it doesn't take too long to see it all. We drove 2 hours just to see it and spent less than an",
          "Out in the middle of nowhere, but worth the drive. Loop thru old Indian paint mines, stunning to see for the first time. Not dog friendly, but paths are good. Benches are placed in a few spots and interpretive maps are scattered about to tell you more about the history/geology.",

          "The Paint Mine is a unexpected surprise on the plains of Colorado. I was amazed at the change in topography from the plains to this cornucopia of color and beauty.",
          "Just east of Colorado Springs, near Calhan, is a unique spot for nature lovers and hikers. Called the \"Paint Mines,\" is is a geologic curiosity caused by erosion through layers of colorful rocks - pinks and oranges, reds and whites. The resulting menagerie of quirky shapes",
          "Read about this spot in a travel report and it made me curious. About 45 minutes east of Colorado Springs you reach the remote location. By already looking down from the parking lot into the small canyon you notice many different colors and after walking down a not too steep",
          "The mines are off the beaten track and the site is primitive but that's part of the unique charm. You've never seen anything like these. Bring clothing for the weather and WATER if it's hot. Take the hike around, then drop into the middle and explore. Please stay on the",
          "I am an amateur geology student, and this is a great place to visit for geology. The book Gelogy Underfoot Along Colorado's Front Range explains the various layers of rock, and a bit about what causes the pigmentation. There's not much for services in the park, so bring all",

          "Was looking for something to do, as we did everyday, so we decided to visit this place as it was kind of close. I could not believe that this place existed in Colorado, it almost reminded me of Bryce Canyon with all the hoodoo's. It was so pretty, with all the colors in the",
          "I was greatly underwhelmed by the park. Yes it was pretty with colored clay. It was also dead heat and small and claustrophobic feeling. There isn't anything to really be seen there that can't be seen at the Garden of the gods. Wish I would've spent my Saturday somewhere else",
          "Wow, this spot is amazing. I am so glad I found it here, on Trip Advisor before heading out to Colorado, because if you blink, or don't know where to look, you would miss it. Its in the middle of literally nowhere, but there is a small flagstone marker and a tiny parking lot,",

        "wiki": "Fort Bliss is a United States Army post in New Mexico and Texas, with its headquarters in El Paso, Texas. Named in honor of LTC William Bliss (1815-1853), a mathematics professor who was the son-in-law of President Zachary Taylor, Ft. Bliss has an area of about 1,700 square miles (4,400 km2); it is the largest installation in FORSCOM (United States Army Forces Command) and second-largest in the Army overall (the largest being the adjacent White Sands Missile Range).  The portion of the post located in El Paso County, Texas, is a census-designated place with a population of 8,591 as of the time of the 2010 census. Fort Bliss provides the largest contiguous tract (1,500 sq mi or 3,900 km2) of restricted airspace in the Continental United States, used for missile and artillery training and testing, and at 992,000 acres boasts the largest maneuver area (ahead of the National Training Center, which has 642,000 acres). The garrison's land area is accounted at 1.12 million acres, ranging to the boundaries of the Lincoln National Forest and White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.Fort Bliss is home to the 1st Armored Division, which returned to US soil in 2011 after 40 years in Germany. The division is supported by the 1st Armored Division Sustainment Brigade. The installation is also home to the 32nd Army Air and Missile Defense Command, the 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, the 212th Fires Brigade (now reflagged as the 1st Armored Division Artillery), and the 402nd Field Artillery Brigade.\nThe headquarters for the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC), a federal tactical operational intelligence center, is hosted at Fort Bliss. Its DoD (United States Department of Defense) counterpart, Joint Task Force North, is at Biggs Army Airfield. Biggs Field, a military airport located at Fort Bliss, is designated a military power projection platform.Fort Bliss National Cemetery is located on the post. Other forts in the frontier fort system were Forts Griffin, Concho, Belknap, Chadbourne, Stockton, Davis, Richardson, McKavett, Clark, McIntosh, Inge and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Fort Sill in Oklahoma.  There were \"sub posts or intermediate stations\" including Bothwick's Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early locations ===\n\n\n==== Post Opposite El Paso del Norte (1849\u20131854) ====\n\nIn 1846, Colonel Alexander Doniphan led 1st Regiment of Missouri mounted volunteers through El Paso del Norte, with victories at the Battle of El Brazito and the Battle of the Sacramento. Then on 7 November 1848, War Department General Order no. 58 ordered the establishment of a post across from El Paso del Norte (now Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). On 8 September 1849, the garrison party of several companies of the 3rd U.S. Infantry ('The Old Guard', currently  the oldest active duty regiment in the US Army), commanded by Major Jefferson Van Horne, found only four small and scattered settlements on the north side of the Rio Grande. The Post Opposite El Paso del Norte was first established at the site of Coon's Ranch (often erroneously referred to as Smith's Ranch, now downtown El Paso) and, along with Fort Selden and other Southwestern outposts, protected recently won territory from harassing Apaches and Comanches, provided law and order, and escorted the forty-niners.  Van Horne also had nominal command of the Post at San Elizario, the former Presidio of San Elizario, seventeen miles downstream from El Paso del Norte.  With constant Indian raids, garrisons had to be moved frequently to meet the shifting threats. In September 1851, the Post Opposite El Paso and the Post at San Elizario were closed, the soldiers moved 40 miles (64 km) north to Fort Fillmore.\n\n\n==== Post of El Paso (1854), Fort Bliss, (1854-1868) ====\nOn 11 January 1854, Companies B, E, I and K of the 8th Infantry, under the command of Lt. Col. Edmund B. Alexander, established Post of El Paso at Magoffinsville under orders from Secretary of War Jefferson Davis. The post was named 'Fort Bliss' on 8 March 1854 in honor of Lt. Col. William Wallace Smith Bliss, a veteran of the Mexican War (1846-1848) who was cited for gallantry in action.\nThere it remained for the next 14 years, serving as a base for troops guarding the area against Apache attacks. Until 1861 most of these troops were units of the 8th Infantry Brigade.  At the outbreak of the American Civil War, David E. Twiggs, the Commander of the Department of Texas, ordered the garrison to surrender Fort Bliss to the Confederacy, which Col. Isaac Van Duzen Reeve did on 31 March 1861. Confederate forces consisting of the 2nd Regiment of Texas, under the command of Col. John R. Baylor, took the post on 1 July 1861, and used it as a platform to launch attacks into New Mexico and Arizona in an effort to force the Union garrisons still in these states to surrender. Initially the Confederate Army had success in their attempts to gain control of New Mexico, but following the Battle of Glorieta Pass, Confederate soldiers were forced to retreat. The Confederate garrison abandoned Fort Bliss without a fight the next year when a Federal column of 2,350 men under the command of Colonel James H. Carleton advanced from California. The Californians maintained an irregular garrison at Fort Bliss until 1865, when 5th Infantry units arrived to reestablish the post; these were subsequently relieved by the 25th Infantry, Buffalo Soldiers, on 12 August 1866, followed by the 35th Infantry two months later.\n\n\n==== Camp Concordia (1868\u20131876) ====\nAfter May 1867 Rio Grande flooding seriously damaged the Magoffinsville post, Fort Bliss was moved to a site called 'Camp Concordia' in March 1868. Camp Concordia's location was immediately south of what is now Interstate 10, across from Concordia Cemetery in El Paso. The Rio Grande was about a mile south of the camp at that time; water was hauled daily by mule team to the camp. On 11 March 1869 the old name of Fort Bliss was resumed. Water, heating, and sanitation facilities were at a minimum in the adobe buildings of the fort; records reveal that troops suffered severely from dysentery and malaria and that supplies arrived irregularly over the Santa Fe Trail by wagon train. The Concordia post was abandoned in January 1877, and after troops left in January, El Paso was without a garrison for more than a year. By that time, the town and its environs on the north side of the river had swelled to a population of almost 800.\n\n\n==== Hart's Mill (1878\u20131893) ====\n\nOn New Year's Day,1878, Fort Bliss was established as a permanent post; the Company L Buffalo Soldiers of the Ninth Cavalry and Company C of the 15th Infantry, were sent to Fort Bliss to prevent further trouble over the salt beds and the usage of Rio Grande water for irrigation purposes.  Prior to this date, the government had had a policy of simply leasing property for its military installations. Now, however, a tract of 135 acres (0.55 km2) was purchased at Hart's Mill on the river's edge in the Pass, near what is today the UTEP. With a $40,000 appropriation, a building program was begun. The first railroad arrived in 1881, and tracks were laid across the military reservation, thereby solving the supply problems for the fort and the rapidly growing town of El Paso. By 1890, Hart's Mill had outlived its usefulness, and Congress appropriated $150,000 for construction of a military installation on the mesa approximately 5 miles (8.0 km) east of El Paso's 1890 city limits. Although no money was appropriated for the land, $8,250 was easily raised by the local residents, who realized the economic benefit to the area.\n\n\n==== Present site (1893-today) ====\nThe present site of Fort Bliss on La Noria mesa, was laid out by Captain John Ruhlen from 1891 to 1892 and was first occupied by four companies of the 18th Infantry in October 1893.\n\n\n=== Pershing Expedition ===\n\nIn January 1914, John J. Pershing arrived in El Paso to take command of the Army 8th Brigade that was stationed at Fort Bliss. At the time, the Mexican Revolution was underway in Mexico, and the 8th Brigade had been assigned the task of securing the Mexico\u2013United States border. In March 1915, under the command of General Frederick Funston, Pershing led the 8th Brigade on the failed 1916\u20131917 Punitive Expedition into Mexico in search of outlaw Pancho Villa.On Friday, 11 March 2016, members of the  2nd Squadron, 13th Cavalry Regiment, (3rd BCT, 1st Armored Division, Fort Bliss) conducted a staff ride at Pancho Villa State Park, NM, the former site of Camp Furlong, 2nd Squadron's billet in 1915. They reviewed the terrain of the  9 March 1916 raid by Pancho Villa's forces on the unit 100 years before. 2nd Squadron then participated  in a parade with reenactors, and Roll Call of the fallen.During this time, the military airfield in El Paso would become one of the homes to the United States Army Border Air Patrol and the 1st Aero Squadron, the U.S. Army's first tactical unit equipped with airplanes.\n\n\n=== World War I and postwar ===\nAs American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) commander (1917\u20131918), John J. Pershing transferred to Fort Bliss and was responsible for the organization, training, and supply of an inexperienced force that eventually grew from 27,000 men to over 2,000,000\u2014the National Army of World War I.\nFrom 10 December 1917 \u2013 12 May 1918, the wartime 15th Cavalry Division existed at Fort Bliss. Similarly, the Headquarters, 2nd Cavalry Brigade was initially activated at Fort Bliss on 10 December 1917 and then deactivated in July 1919, but then reactivated at Fort Bliss on 31 August 1920. Predominantly a cavalry post since 1912, Fort Bliss acquired three light armored cars, eight medium armored cars, two motorcycles, and two trucks on 8 November 1928.\n\n\n=== World War II and postwar ===\nDuring World War II, Fort Bliss focused on training anti-aircraft artillery battalions (AAA). In September 1940 the Coast Artillery's anti-aircraft training center was established, and in 1941 the 1st Tow Target Squadron arrived to fly target drones  (the 6th, 19th, and 27th Tow Target Squadrons were at the nearby Biggs Field). On 3 August 1944, the Anti-Aircraft Artillery School was ordered from Camp Davis to Fort Bliss to make the training of anti-aircraft gunners easier, and they became the dominant force at Fort Bliss following the departure of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division. On 15 September 1942, the War Dept. made space available for handling up to 1,350 POWs, while POW camps could be constructed.  During the war, the base was used to hold approximately 91 German and Italian Americans and Japanese from Hawaii (then a territory), who were arrested as potential fifth columnists but, in most cases, denied due process.\n\nBy February 1946, over 100 Operation Paperclip German scientists had arrived to develop rockets and were attached to the Office of the Chief of Ordnance Corps, Research and Development Service, Suboffice (Rocket), headed by Major James P. Hamill.  Although the scientists were initially \"pretty much kept on ice\" (resulting in the nickname \"Operation Icebox\"), they were subsequently divided into a research group and a group who assisted with V-2 test launches at White Sands Proving Grounds.  German families began arriving in December 1946, and by the spring of 1948, the number of German rocket specialists (nicknamed \"Prisoners of Peace\") in the US was 127.  Fort Bliss rocket launches included firings of the Private missile at the Hueco Range in April 1945.  In 1953, funding cuts caused the cancellation of work on the Hermes B2 ramjet work that had begun at Fort Bliss.In late 1953 after troops had been trained at the Ft Bliss Guided Missile School, field-firing operations of the MGM-5 Corporal were underway at Red Canyon Range Camp, WSPG.  In April 1950, the 1st Guided Missile Group named the Republic-Ford JB-2 the ARMY LOON.\n\n\n=== Cold War ===\n\nFort Bliss trained thousands of U.S. Soldiers during the Cold War. As the United States gradually came to master the art of building and operating missiles, Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range became more and more important to the country, and were expanded accordingly. On 1 July 1957 the U.S. Army Air Defense Center was established at Fort Bliss. Located at this Center, in addition to Center Headquarters, are the U.S. Army Air Defense School; Air Defense; the 6th Artillery Group (Air Defense); the 61st Ordnance Group; and other supporting elements. In 1957 Fort Bliss and its anti-aircraft personnel began using Nike Ajax, Nike Hercules, Hawk, Sprint, Chaparral, and Redeye missiles. Fort Bliss took on the important role of providing a large area for troops to conduct live fire exercises with the missiles.\nBecause of the large number of Army personnel enrolled in the air defense school, Fort Bliss saw two large rounds of construction in 1954 and 1958. The former was aimed at creating more barracks facilities, while the latter was aimed at building new classrooms, materials labs, a radar park, and a missile laboratory. Between 1953 and 1957 the Army also expanded McGregor Range in an effort to accommodate live fire exercises of the new missile systems.  Throughout the Cold War Fort Bliss remained a premier site for testing anti-aircraft equipment.\nFort Bliss was used as the Desert Stage of the Ranger School training course to prepare Ranger School graduates for operations in the deserts of the Middle East. From 1983 to 1987, Fort Bliss was home to the Ranger School's newly formed 4th (Desert Ranger) Training Company. This unit was later expanded in 1987 to form the newly created Ranger Training Brigade's short-lived 7th Ranger Training Battalion, which was then transferred to the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah. The deserts of Utah proved to be unsuitable so the 7th Ranger Training Battalion was returned to Fort Bliss from 1991 until the Ranger School's Desert Phase was discontinued in 1995.\nWhile the United States Army Air Defense Artillery School develops doctrine and tactics, training current and future soldiers has always been its core mission. Until 1990 the post was used for Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training (AIT), under the 1/56 ADA Regiment, part of 6th ADA. Before 1989, 1/56 had three basic training companies and two AIT batteries. After 1990, 1/56 dropped basic training, that mission assumed by Fort Sill. The unit now had four enlisted batteries for enlisted AIT, one battery for the Officer's Basic Course and Captain's Career Course (added in 2004) and one company that trained army truck drivers (MOS 88M).\n\n\n=== Base Realignment and Closure ===\nIn 1995, the Department of Defense recommended that the U.S. 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment be relocated to Fort Carson, Colorado. Efforts to consolidate units from another post with those units that remained at Fort Bliss were overruled by the Base Realignment and Closing Commission, leaving Fort Bliss without any armored vehicles. Units operating the US Army's MIM-104 Patriot Missile Defense System relocated to Fort Bliss during the 1990s. The Patriot system played an important role in the Persian Gulf War/Operation Desert Storm in 1991. In commemoration, the US 54 expressway in northeast El Paso was designated the Patriot Freeway.\n\n\n=== War on Terror ===\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, Fort Bliss provided ADA Battalions for US and NATO use in Afghanistan and Iraq, and has served as one of the major deployment centers for troops bound for Iraq and Afghanistan. This mission is accomplished via nearby Biggs Army Airfield, which is included in the installation's supporting areas.  Following the War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present) in 2001 Fort Bliss began training Afghan security forces at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy at Fort Bliss, with the hope that these newly trained soldiers would eventually be able to take control of their own national security.\n\n\n=== Base Realignment and Closure, 2005 ===\n\nIn 2005, the Pentagon recommended transforming Fort Bliss into a heavy armor training post, to include approximately 11,500 new troops from the U.S. 1st Armored Division \u2013 at that time stationed in Germany -, as well as units from Fort Sill and Fort Hood. An estimated 15,918 military jobs and 384 civilian jobs were planned to be transferred to Fort Bliss, brought the total number of troops stationed at Fort Bliss under this alignment to a total of 33,500 by 2012. Officials from Fort Bliss and the City of El Paso were thrilled with the decision; the general mood of the city government was perfectly captured by 14 May edition of the El Paso Times, which boldly proclaimed \"BLISS WINS BIG\".According to Senator Eliot Shapleigh, the BRAC commission considered three primary factors to make its decision: The military value of Fort Bliss, the potential for other branches of the armed service to use a post as large as Fort Bliss, and the lack of urban encroachment around Fort Bliss that would otherwise hinder its growth. The arrival of the 11,500 troops from the 1st Armored Division is also expected to create some 20,196 direct and indirect military and civilian jobs in El Paso. According to the Department of Defense, this is the largest net gain in the United States tied to the Base Realignment and Closure recommendations. Of the 20,196 new jobs expected to come to El Paso as a result of Bliss\u2019 realignment 9,000 would be indirect civilian jobs created by the influx of soldiers to the \"Sun City\". When the BRAC commission recommendations were released Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison's spokesman reported that El Paso was the only area that came out with a major gain of forces.The news that El Paso had been selected to receive major elements of the 1st Armored Division was met with joy, but at the same time many expressed surprise at the panel's recommendation to transfer the Air Defense Artillery School, 6th ADA Brigade, and its accompanying equipment (including the MIM-104 Patriot Missile Anti-Aircraft/Anti Missile defense system) to Fort Sill. On 25 August officials representing Fort Bliss went before the BRAC Commission to plead their case for maintaining the ADA school and its accompanying equipment at Fort Bliss, citing among other thing the size of Fort Bliss and the history of the ADA school in the region. The BRAC Commission ultimately ruled against Fort Bliss, and the roughly 4,500 affected soldiers were transferred to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The entire transfer of soldiers to and from Fort Bliss was completed no later than 15 September 2011.On 25 June 2009, authority over the post was shifted from Training and Doctrine Command to Forces Command.\n\n\n== Present day ==\nAmong Fort Bliss' missions:\n\nProvide anti-aircraft and missile defense capabilities.\nConduct live fire exercises of nearly every type of Army weapon.\nHost joint military exercises with other U.S. and foreign units,\nBe home to many maintenance crews and supply units.\nBe one of the Army's premier bases for test-driving tanks and other equipment.\nHouse thousands of military vehicles, including all the equipment needed to set up Patriot missile sites.\nHosted the USAADCEN Air Defense Artillery Center from 1942 to 2010. USAADCEN has completed its transfer to Fort Sill. Concomitantly, the German Air Force Air Defense school is going to move to new training facilities in Germany and Greece. In 2013, the German Air Force deactivated its presence at Fort Bliss, while retaining a presence at Holloman Air Force Base; over the previous 47 years, over 50,000 German Airmen received training at this command. In 2015, due to funding constraints on the planned new facilities in Europe, the German Air Force Air Defense school will stay open at Fort Bliss until 2020.\nMonitor missile launches conducted by White Sands Missile Range, located 70 miles (110 km) to the north, in New Mexico.\nHost the CONUS Replacement Center (CRC), the unit-level training site for Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen who are deploying or re-deploying on an individual basis. This CRC consolidates several other centers and now serves the entire Continental United States (CONUS).\nA secured drone airfield, with a separate 5000 foot runway and dedicated hangar, 20\u201325 miles north of the main post is under construction, with completion expected by 2016. It will host a company of 9 MQ-1C Gray Eagles for First Armored Division.Training missions are supported by the McGregor Range Complex, located some 25 miles (40 km) to the northeast of the main post, in New Mexico. Most of Fort Bliss lies in the state of New Mexico, stretching northeastward along U.S. Route 54 from El Paso County, Texas to the southern boundary of the Lincoln National Forest in Otero County, New Mexico; in addition, much of the northwestward side of Highway 54 is part of the Fort Bliss Military Reservation, ranging from the northern side of Chaparral, New Mexico to the southern boundary of White Sands Missile Range; the main facilities are within the city limits of El Paso, Texas. According to the city zoning map, the post officially resides in Central El Paso.\n\nSeparate from the main post are the William Beaumont Army Medical Center (which also serves the warrior transition battalion for the post's wounded warriors) and a Department of Veterans Affairs center at the eastern base of the Franklin Mountains. All of these supporting missions serve the military and retired-military population here, including having served General of the Army Omar N. Bradley in his last days. A new warrior transition complex, located at Marshall and Cassidy roads, was opened in June 2011 to replace the older facility serving the warrior transition battalion. A new location for William Beaumont Army Medical Center, to be located at Spur 601 and Loop 375, is now rescheduled to be completed in September 2019.The installation is also close to the El Paso Airport (with easy access from the post via Robert E. Lee Road\u2014 now renamed Buffalo Soldier Road), Highway 54, and Interstate 10. There is a replica of the Magoffinsville site for Fort Bliss on post, simulating the adobe style of construction.  Other items of interest include the Buffalo Soldier memorial statue on Buffalo Soldier Road, at the Buffalo Soldier Gate of entry to the post, and a missile museum on Pleasanton Road.\nThe walls of the old Fort Bliss Officers Club contains adobe bricks that are more than a century old. The building now houses a Family Readiness Group, where new personnel can learn about the post's activities and support groups. The Fort Bliss Welcome center, for new arrivals, is nearby, in the Building 500 area.\nFort Bliss has been designated a \"No Drone Zone\" by the FAA, out to 400 feet beyond the  lateral edges of the military reservation. This will be enforced by the Military Police. Counter-UAS training is available on-post.\n\n\n== Local impact ==\n\nAs of 2005, the base contributed about $1.7 billion to the economy of Central El Paso and Northeast El Paso, and many businesses in the region serve the post's troops. When troops are transferred to other posts or called up for service overseas, the economic fallout can be felt throughout the city.\nAs the U.S. Army began downsizing in 2014, Fort Bliss was expected to lose 1,200 Soldiers from the then-current 33,500 by 2017.Fort Bliss has assisted El Paso during local disasters. In 1897, and again in 1925, the fort provided food and housing to those displaced by flood waters. In 2006, Fort Bliss dispatched soldiers and helicopters to the flood-affected areas to help with rescue efforts there. The flooding of El Paso in 2013 and 2014 were not met with this type of official response.\nAs of July 2010, electric power consumption at Fort Bliss had been reduced by three megawatts as the base continues to work towards becoming a \"net zero\" energy installation. In April 2013, Major General Dana J.H. Pittard, USA, announced a $120 million project to be completed by 2015, consisting of the largest solar farm within the U.S. military.A joint study by Fort Bliss and El Paso-area city governments found that desalination was a viable method for increasing El Paso's water supply by 25%. The Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Plant, on Montana Avenue, is located on Fort Bliss property, and desalinates the groundwater of the Hueco Bolson for use by El Paso and Fort Bliss. This reverse-osmosis plant protects the fresh groundwater supplies from invasion by more brackish water.  This plant is currently the largest non-seawater desalination plant in the world.\nIn 2010, with the assumption of command by Major General Dana J.H. Pittard, a local that grew up in El Paso, Fort Bliss was made an \"open post\" which allowed anyone with a valid driver's license to enter the post. As of 2015 Fort Bliss is no longer an open post.\nIn 2020, 1st Armored Division's Operations Research and Systems Analysis officer (ORSA) created a COVID-19 progression rate model for the division; this model was also used by the COVID-19 task force for the City of El Paso.Fort Bliss archaeologists manage 20,000 sites on the 1.12 million acre reservation, and serve as tribal liaison to seven federally-funded Indian tribes. The Hueco Tanks historic site in El Paso county is adjacent to the military reservation. Cultural liaison with the tribes at the sacred sites of the reservation is an annual event.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Fort Bliss census-designated place is located at 31\u00b048\u203207\u2033N 106\u00b025\u203229\u2033W.  According to the United States Census Bureau, the census-designated place has a total area of 6.2 square miles (16.0 km\u00b2), all of it land. In terms of its United States physiographic region, it is a southern part of the Basin and Range Province.\n\n\n=== Bunker 11507 ===\nAn investigation into above-ground dirt-covered bunkers located on the military reservation was opened in June 2013. These former nuclear weapons bunkers were used by the Air Force during the Cold War, when Biggs Air Force Base was a SAC base. Low level radiation was detected in Bunker 11507. The bunker interiors were previously painted with epoxy paint to contain the radiation, and the paint has now chipped. The radiation contamination is confined to the area around the bunker. The area was closed on 11 July 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 8,264 people, 1,527 households, and 1,444 families residing on the post. The population density was 1,340.1 people per square mile (517.1/km\u00b2). There were 2,309 housing units at an average density of 374.4/sq mi (144.5/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the post was 58.1% White, 25.1% African American, 2.4% Asian, 1.3% Native American, 0.7% Pacific Islander, 8.9% from other races, and 3.5% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 19.3% of the population.\nThere were 1,527 households out of which 80.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 84.5% were married couples living together, 8.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 5.4% were non-families. 4.9% of all households were made up of individuals and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.54 and the average family size was 3.62.\nOn the post the population was spread out with 29.3% under the age of 18, 33.6% from 18 to 24, 34.7% from 25 to 44, 2.3% from 45 to 64, and 0.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females, there were 167.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 204.8 males.\nThe median income for a household on the post was $35,970, and the median income for a family was $34,679. Males had a median income of $19,920 versus $17,227 for females. The per capita income for the post was $13,201. About 9.5% of families and 11.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.5% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n== Museums and historic preservation ==\n\nThe Replica Museum is located next to the Noel Parade Field and depicts the Post at the Magoffinsville site.  This five building museum was authentically constructed with adobe bricks and painted stucco, and includes a sutler store, bunkhouse, blacksmith shop, saddlery and a pottery kiln.  The museum depicts the story of Fort Bliss and El Paso from 1848 to 1948 and was dedicated on the 100th anniversary.\nThe Fort Bliss and Ironsides Museums are located next to the Athletic Field and includes outdoor and indoor exhibits.  These include important historical artifacts from the founding of Fort Bliss to the present day, such as General Pershing's Dodge Command Car and a Patriot Missile.  \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Fort Bliss Main Post Historic District, a large historic district including 343 buildings deemed to be contributing, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of World War II prisoner-of-war camps in the United States\nEl Paso metropolitan area\nTransformation of the United States Army#Divisions and Brigades\n2015 Fort Bliss shooting\n24th Press Camp Headquarters\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEPCC library guides Borderlands\nOfficial website\nFort Bliss Morale, Welfare and Recreation Program website\nFort Bliss Monitor, the post newspaper was renamed The Fort Bliss Bugle; there is also a Fort Bliss Facebook page\nColonel Augustine D.

        "wiki": "Fort Bliss is a United States Army post in New Mexico and Texas, with its headquarters in El Paso, Texas. Named in honor of LTC William Bliss (1815-1853), a mathematics professor who was the son-in-law of President Zachary Taylor, Ft. Bliss has an area of about 1,700 square miles (4,400 km2); it is the largest installation in FORSCOM (United States Army Forces Command) and second-largest in the Army overall (the largest being the adjacent White Sands Missile Range).  The portion of the post located in El Paso County, Texas, is a census-designated place with a population of 8,591 as of the time of the 2010 census. Fort Bliss provides the largest contiguous tract (1,500 sq mi or 3,900 km2) of restricted airspace in the Continental United States, used for missile and artillery training and testing, and at 992,000 acres boasts the largest maneuver area (ahead of the National Training Center, which has 642,000 acres). The garrison's land area is accounted at 1.12 million acres, ranging to the boundaries of the Lincoln National Forest and White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.Fort Bliss is home to the 1st Armored Division, which returned to US soil in 2011 after 40 years in Germany. The division is supported by the 1st Armored Division Sustainment Brigade. The installation is also home to the 32nd Army Air and Missile Defense Command, the 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, the 212th Fires Brigade (now reflagged as the 1st Armored Division Artillery), and the 402nd Field Artillery Brigade.\nThe headquarters for the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC), a federal tactical operational intelligence center, is hosted at Fort Bliss. Its DoD (United States Department of Defense) counterpart, Joint Task Force North, is at Biggs Army Airfield. Biggs Field, a military airport located at Fort Bliss, is designated a military power projection platform.Fort Bliss National Cemetery is located on the post. Other forts in the frontier fort system were Forts Griffin, Concho, Belknap, Chadbourne, Stockton, Davis, Richardson, McKavett, Clark, McIntosh, Inge and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Fort Sill in Oklahoma.  There were \"sub posts or intermediate stations\" including Bothwick's Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early locations ===\n\n\n==== Post Opposite El Paso del Norte (1849\u20131854) ====\n\nIn 1846, Colonel Alexander Doniphan led 1st Regiment of Missouri mounted volunteers through El Paso del Norte, with victories at the Battle of El Brazito and the Battle of the Sacramento. Then on 7 November 1848, War Department General Order no. 58 ordered the establishment of a post across from El Paso del Norte (now Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). On 8 September 1849, the garrison party of several companies of the 3rd U.S. Infantry ('The Old Guard', currently  the oldest active duty regiment in the US Army), commanded by Major Jefferson Van Horne, found only four small and scattered settlements on the north side of the Rio Grande. The Post Opposite El Paso del Norte was first established at the site of Coon's Ranch (often erroneously referred to as Smith's Ranch, now downtown El Paso) and, along with Fort Selden and other Southwestern outposts, protected recently won territory from harassing Apaches and Comanches, provided law and order, and escorted the forty-niners.  Van Horne also had nominal command of the Post at San Elizario, the former Presidio of San Elizario, seventeen miles downstream from El Paso del Norte.  With constant Indian raids, garrisons had to be moved frequently to meet the shifting threats. In September 1851, the Post Opposite El Paso and the Post at San Elizario were closed, the soldiers moved 40 miles (64 km) north to Fort Fillmore.\n\n\n==== Post of El Paso (1854), Fort Bliss, (1854-1868) ====\nOn 11 January 1854, Companies B, E, I and K of the 8th Infantry, under the command of Lt. Col. Edmund B. Alexander, established Post of El Paso at Magoffinsville under orders from Secretary of War Jefferson Davis. The post was named 'Fort Bliss' on 8 March 1854 in honor of Lt. Col. William Wallace Smith Bliss, a veteran of the Mexican War (1846-1848) who was cited for gallantry in action.\nThere it remained for the next 14 years, serving as a base for troops guarding the area against Apache attacks. Until 1861 most of these troops were units of the 8th Infantry Brigade.  At the outbreak of the American Civil War, David E. Twiggs, the Commander of the Department of Texas, ordered the garrison to surrender Fort Bliss to the Confederacy, which Col. Isaac Van Duzen Reeve did on 31 March 1861. Confederate forces consisting of the 2nd Regiment of Texas, under the command of Col. John R. Baylor, took the post on 1 July 1861, and used it as a platform to launch attacks into New Mexico and Arizona in an effort to force the Union garrisons still in these states to surrender. Initially the Confederate Army had success in their attempts to gain control of New Mexico, but following the Battle of Glorieta Pass, Confederate soldiers were forced to retreat. The Confederate garrison abandoned Fort Bliss without a fight the next year when a Federal column of 2,350 men under the command of Colonel James H. Carleton advanced from California. The Californians maintained an irregular garrison at Fort Bliss until 1865, when 5th Infantry units arrived to reestablish the post; these were subsequently relieved by the 25th Infantry, Buffalo Soldiers, on 12 August 1866, followed by the 35th Infantry two months later.\n\n\n==== Camp Concordia (1868\u20131876) ====\nAfter May 1867 Rio Grande flooding seriously damaged the Magoffinsville post, Fort Bliss was moved to a site called 'Camp Concordia' in March 1868. Camp Concordia's location was immediately south of what is now Interstate 10, across from Concordia Cemetery in El Paso. The Rio Grande was about a mile south of the camp at that time; water was hauled daily by mule team to the camp. On 11 March 1869 the old name of Fort Bliss was resumed. Water, heating, and sanitation facilities were at a minimum in the adobe buildings of the fort; records reveal that troops suffered severely from dysentery and malaria and that supplies arrived irregularly over the Santa Fe Trail by wagon train. The Concordia post was abandoned in January 1877, and after troops left in January, El Paso was without a garrison for more than a year. By that time, the town and its environs on the north side of the river had swelled to a population of almost 800.\n\n\n==== Hart's Mill (1878\u20131893) ====\n\nOn New Year's Day,1878, Fort Bliss was established as a permanent post; the Company L Buffalo Soldiers of the Ninth Cavalry and Company C of the 15th Infantry, were sent to Fort Bliss to prevent further trouble over the salt beds and the usage of Rio Grande water for irrigation purposes.  Prior to this date, the government had had a policy of simply leasing property for its military installations. Now, however, a tract of 135 acres (0.55 km2) was purchased at Hart's Mill on the river's edge in the Pass, near what is today the UTEP. With a $40,000 appropriation, a building program was begun. The first railroad arrived in 1881, and tracks were laid across the military reservation, thereby solving the supply problems for the fort and the rapidly growing town of El Paso. By 1890, Hart's Mill had outlived its usefulness, and Congress appropriated $150,000 for construction of a military installation on the mesa approximately 5 miles (8.0 km) east of El Paso's 1890 city limits. Although no money was appropriated for the land, $8,250 was easily raised by the local residents, who realized the economic benefit to the area.\n\n\n==== Present site (1893-today) ====\nThe present site of Fort Bliss on La Noria mesa, was laid out by Captain John Ruhlen from 1891 to 1892 and was first occupied by four companies of the 18th Infantry in October 1893.\n\n\n=== Pershing Expedition ===\n\nIn January 1914, John J. Pershing arrived in El Paso to take command of the Army 8th Brigade that was stationed at Fort Bliss. At the time, the Mexican Revolution was underway in Mexico, and the 8th Brigade had been assigned the task of securing the Mexico\u2013United States border. In March 1915, under the command of General Frederick Funston, Pershing led the 8th Brigade on the failed 1916\u20131917 Punitive Expedition into Mexico in search of outlaw Pancho Villa.On Friday, 11 March 2016, members of the  2nd Squadron, 13th Cavalry Regiment, (3rd BCT, 1st Armored Division, Fort Bliss) conducted a staff ride at Pancho Villa State Park, NM, the former site of Camp Furlong, 2nd Squadron's billet in 1915. They reviewed the terrain of the  9 March 1916 raid by Pancho Villa's forces on the unit 100 years before. 2nd Squadron then participated  in a parade with reenactors, and Roll Call of the fallen.During this time, the military airfield in El Paso would become one of the homes to the United States Army Border Air Patrol and the 1st Aero Squadron, the U.S. Army's first tactical unit equipped with airplanes.\n\n\n=== World War I and postwar ===\nAs American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) commander (1917\u20131918), John J. Pershing transferred to Fort Bliss and was responsible for the organization, training, and supply of an inexperienced force that eventually grew from 27,000 men to over 2,000,000\u2014the National Army of World War I.\nFrom 10 December 1917 \u2013 12 May 1918, the wartime 15th Cavalry Division existed at Fort Bliss. Similarly, the Headquarters, 2nd Cavalry Brigade was initially activated at Fort Bliss on 10 December 1917 and then deactivated in July 1919, but then reactivated at Fort Bliss on 31 August 1920. Predominantly a cavalry post since 1912, Fort Bliss acquired three light armored cars, eight medium armored cars, two motorcycles, and two trucks on 8 November 1928.\n\n\n=== World War II and postwar ===\nDuring World War II, Fort Bliss focused on training anti-aircraft artillery battalions (AAA). In September 1940 the Coast Artillery's anti-aircraft training center was established, and in 1941 the 1st Tow Target Squadron arrived to fly target drones  (the 6th, 19th, and 27th Tow Target Squadrons were at the nearby Biggs Field). On 3 August 1944, the Anti-Aircraft Artillery School was ordered from Camp Davis to Fort Bliss to make the training of anti-aircraft gunners easier, and they became the dominant force at Fort Bliss following the departure of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division. On 15 September 1942, the War Dept. made space available for handling up to 1,350 POWs, while POW camps could be constructed.  During the war, the base was used to hold approximately 91 German and Italian Americans and Japanese from Hawaii (then a territory), who were arrested as potential fifth columnists but, in most cases, denied due process.\n\nBy February 1946, over 100 Operation Paperclip German scientists had arrived to develop rockets and were attached to the Office of the Chief of Ordnance Corps, Research and Development Service, Suboffice (Rocket), headed by Major James P. Hamill.  Although the scientists were initially \"pretty much kept on ice\" (resulting in the nickname \"Operation Icebox\"), they were subsequently divided into a research group and a group who assisted with V-2 test launches at White Sands Proving Grounds.  German families began arriving in December 1946, and by the spring of 1948, the number of German rocket specialists (nicknamed \"Prisoners of Peace\") in the US was 127.  Fort Bliss rocket launches included firings of the Private missile at the Hueco Range in April 1945.  In 1953, funding cuts caused the cancellation of work on the Hermes B2 ramjet work that had begun at Fort Bliss.In late 1953 after troops had been trained at the Ft Bliss Guided Missile School, field-firing operations of the MGM-5 Corporal were underway at Red Canyon Range Camp, WSPG.  In April 1950, the 1st Guided Missile Group named the Republic-Ford JB-2 the ARMY LOON.\n\n\n=== Cold War ===\n\nFort Bliss trained thousands of U.S. Soldiers during the Cold War. As the United States gradually came to master the art of building and operating missiles, Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range became more and more important to the country, and were expanded accordingly. On 1 July 1957 the U.S. Army Air Defense Center was established at Fort Bliss. Located at this Center, in addition to Center Headquarters, are the U.S. Army Air Defense School; Air Defense; the 6th Artillery Group (Air Defense); the 61st Ordnance Group; and other supporting elements. In 1957 Fort Bliss and its anti-aircraft personnel began using Nike Ajax, Nike Hercules, Hawk, Sprint, Chaparral, and Redeye missiles. Fort Bliss took on the important role of providing a large area for troops to conduct live fire exercises with the missiles.\nBecause of the large number of Army personnel enrolled in the air defense school, Fort Bliss saw two large rounds of construction in 1954 and 1958. The former was aimed at creating more barracks facilities, while the latter was aimed at building new classrooms, materials labs, a radar park, and a missile laboratory. Between 1953 and 1957 the Army also expanded McGregor Range in an effort to accommodate live fire exercises of the new missile systems.  Throughout the Cold War Fort Bliss remained a premier site for testing anti-aircraft equipment.\nFort Bliss was used as the Desert Stage of the Ranger School training course to prepare Ranger School graduates for operations in the deserts of the Middle East. From 1983 to 1987, Fort Bliss was home to the Ranger School's newly formed 4th (Desert Ranger) Training Company. This unit was later expanded in 1987 to form the newly created Ranger Training Brigade's short-lived 7th Ranger Training Battalion, which was then transferred to the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah. The deserts of Utah proved to be unsuitable so the 7th Ranger Training Battalion was returned to Fort Bliss from 1991 until the Ranger School's Desert Phase was discontinued in 1995.\nWhile the United States Army Air Defense Artillery School develops doctrine and tactics, training current and future soldiers has always been its core mission. Until 1990 the post was used for Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training (AIT), under the 1/56 ADA Regiment, part of 6th ADA. Before 1989, 1/56 had three basic training companies and two AIT batteries. After 1990, 1/56 dropped basic training, that mission assumed by Fort Sill. The unit now had four enlisted batteries for enlisted AIT, one battery for the Officer's Basic Course and Captain's Career Course (added in 2004) and one company that trained army truck drivers (MOS 88M).\n\n\n=== Base Realignment and Closure ===\nIn 1995, the Department of Defense recommended that the U.S. 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment be relocated to Fort Carson, Colorado. Efforts to consolidate units from another post with those units that remained at Fort Bliss were overruled by the Base Realignment and Closing Commission, leaving Fort Bliss without any armored vehicles. Units operating the US Army's MIM-104 Patriot Missile Defense System relocated to Fort Bliss during the 1990s. The Patriot system played an important role in the Persian Gulf War/Operation Desert Storm in 1991. In commemoration, the US 54 expressway in northeast El Paso was designated the Patriot Freeway.\n\n\n=== War on Terror ===\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, Fort Bliss provided ADA Battalions for US and NATO use in Afghanistan and Iraq, and has served as one of the major deployment centers for troops bound for Iraq and Afghanistan. This mission is accomplished via nearby Biggs Army Airfield, which is included in the installation's supporting areas.  Following the War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present) in 2001 Fort Bliss began training Afghan security forces at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy at Fort Bliss, with the hope that these newly trained soldiers would eventually be able to take control of their own national security.\n\n\n=== Base Realignment and Closure, 2005 ===\n\nIn 2005, the Pentagon recommended transforming Fort Bliss into a heavy armor training post, to include approximately 11,500 new troops from the U.S. 1st Armored Division \u2013 at that time stationed in Germany -, as well as units from Fort Sill and Fort Hood. An estimated 15,918 military jobs and 384 civilian jobs were planned to be transferred to Fort Bliss, brought the total number of troops stationed at Fort Bliss under this alignment to a total of 33,500 by 2012. Officials from Fort Bliss and the City of El Paso were thrilled with the decision; the general mood of the city government was perfectly captured by 14 May edition of the El Paso Times, which boldly proclaimed \"BLISS WINS BIG\".According to Senator Eliot Shapleigh, the BRAC commission considered three primary factors to make its decision: The military value of Fort Bliss, the potential for other branches of the armed service to use a post as large as Fort Bliss, and the lack of urban encroachment around Fort Bliss that would otherwise hinder its growth. The arrival of the 11,500 troops from the 1st Armored Division is also expected to create some 20,196 direct and indirect military and civilian jobs in El Paso. According to the Department of Defense, this is the largest net gain in the United States tied to the Base Realignment and Closure recommendations. Of the 20,196 new jobs expected to come to El Paso as a result of Bliss\u2019 realignment 9,000 would be indirect civilian jobs created by the influx of soldiers to the \"Sun City\". When the BRAC commission recommendations were released Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison's spokesman reported that El Paso was the only area that came out with a major gain of forces.The news that El Paso had been selected to receive major elements of the 1st Armored Division was met with joy, but at the same time many expressed surprise at the panel's recommendation to transfer the Air Defense Artillery School, 6th ADA Brigade, and its accompanying equipment (including the MIM-104 Patriot Missile Anti-Aircraft/Anti Missile defense system) to Fort Sill. On 25 August officials representing Fort Bliss went before the BRAC Commission to plead their case for maintaining the ADA school and its accompanying equipment at Fort Bliss, citing among other thing the size of Fort Bliss and the history of the ADA school in the region. The BRAC Commission ultimately ruled against Fort Bliss, and the roughly 4,500 affected soldiers were transferred to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The entire transfer of soldiers to and from Fort Bliss was completed no later than 15 September 2011.On 25 June 2009, authority over the post was shifted from Training and Doctrine Command to Forces Command.\n\n\n== Present day ==\nAmong Fort Bliss' missions:\n\nProvide anti-aircraft and missile defense capabilities.\nConduct live fire exercises of nearly every type of Army weapon.\nHost joint military exercises with other U.S. and foreign units,\nBe home to many maintenance crews and supply units.\nBe one of the Army's premier bases for test-driving tanks and other equipment.\nHouse thousands of military vehicles, including all the equipment needed to set up Patriot missile sites.\nHosted the USAADCEN Air Defense Artillery Center from 1942 to 2010. USAADCEN has completed its transfer to Fort Sill. Concomitantly, the German Air Force Air Defense school is going to move to new training facilities in Germany and Greece. In 2013, the German Air Force deactivated its presence at Fort Bliss, while retaining a presence at Holloman Air Force Base; over the previous 47 years, over 50,000 German Airmen received training at this command. In 2015, due to funding constraints on the planned new facilities in Europe, the German Air Force Air Defense school will stay open at Fort Bliss until 2020.\nMonitor missile launches conducted by White Sands Missile Range, located 70 miles (110 km) to the north, in New Mexico.\nHost the CONUS Replacement Center (CRC), the unit-level training site for Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen who are deploying or re-deploying on an individual basis. This CRC consolidates several other centers and now serves the entire Continental United States (CONUS).\nA secured drone airfield, with a separate 5000 foot runway and dedicated hangar, 20\u201325 miles north of the main post is under construction, with completion expected by 2016. It will host a company of 9 MQ-1C Gray Eagles for First Armored Division.Training missions are supported by the McGregor Range Complex, located some 25 miles (40 km) to the northeast of the main post, in New Mexico. Most of Fort Bliss lies in the state of New Mexico, stretching northeastward along U.S. Route 54 from El Paso County, Texas to the southern boundary of the Lincoln National Forest in Otero County, New Mexico; in addition, much of the northwestward side of Highway 54 is part of the Fort Bliss Military Reservation, ranging from the northern side of Chaparral, New Mexico to the southern boundary of White Sands Missile Range; the main facilities are within the city limits of El Paso, Texas. According to the city zoning map, the post officially resides in Central El Paso.\n\nSeparate from the main post are the William Beaumont Army Medical Center (which also serves the warrior transition battalion for the post's wounded warriors) and a Department of Veterans Affairs center at the eastern base of the Franklin Mountains. All of these supporting missions serve the military and retired-military population here, including having served General of the Army Omar N. Bradley in his last days. A new warrior transition complex, located at Marshall and Cassidy roads, was opened in June 2011 to replace the older facility serving the warrior transition battalion. A new location for William Beaumont Army Medical Center, to be located at Spur 601 and Loop 375, is now rescheduled to be completed in September 2019.The installation is also close to the El Paso Airport (with easy access from the post via Robert E. Lee Road\u2014 now renamed Buffalo Soldier Road), Highway 54, and Interstate 10. There is a replica of the Magoffinsville site for Fort Bliss on post, simulating the adobe style of construction.  Other items of interest include the Buffalo Soldier memorial statue on Buffalo Soldier Road, at the Buffalo Soldier Gate of entry to the post, and a missile museum on Pleasanton Road.\nThe walls of the old Fort Bliss Officers Club contains adobe bricks that are more than a century old. The building now houses a Family Readiness Group, where new personnel can learn about the post's activities and support groups. The Fort Bliss Welcome center, for new arrivals, is nearby, in the Building 500 area.\nFort Bliss has been designated a \"No Drone Zone\" by the FAA, out to 400 feet beyond the  lateral edges of the military reservation. This will be enforced by the Military Police. Counter-UAS training is available on-post.\n\n\n== Local impact ==\n\nAs of 2005, the base contributed about $1.7 billion to the economy of Central El Paso and Northeast El Paso, and many businesses in the region serve the post's troops. When troops are transferred to other posts or called up for service overseas, the economic fallout can be felt throughout the city.\nAs the U.S. Army began downsizing in 2014, Fort Bliss was expected to lose 1,200 Soldiers from the then-current 33,500 by 2017.Fort Bliss has assisted El Paso during local disasters. In 1897, and again in 1925, the fort provided food and housing to those displaced by flood waters. In 2006, Fort Bliss dispatched soldiers and helicopters to the flood-affected areas to help with rescue efforts there. The flooding of El Paso in 2013 and 2014 were not met with this type of official response.\nAs of July 2010, electric power consumption at Fort Bliss had been reduced by three megawatts as the base continues to work towards becoming a \"net zero\" energy installation. In April 2013, Major General Dana J.H. Pittard, USA, announced a $120 million project to be completed by 2015, consisting of the largest solar farm within the U.S. military.A joint study by Fort Bliss and El Paso-area city governments found that desalination was a viable method for increasing El Paso's water supply by 25%. The Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Plant, on Montana Avenue, is located on Fort Bliss property, and desalinates the groundwater of the Hueco Bolson for use by El Paso and Fort Bliss. This reverse-osmosis plant protects the fresh groundwater supplies from invasion by more brackish water.  This plant is currently the largest non-seawater desalination plant in the world.\nIn 2010, with the assumption of command by Major General Dana J.H. Pittard, a local that grew up in El Paso, Fort Bliss was made an \"open post\" which allowed anyone with a valid driver's license to enter the post. As of 2015 Fort Bliss is no longer an open post.\nIn 2020, 1st Armored Division's Operations Research and Systems Analysis officer (ORSA) created a COVID-19 progression rate model for the division; this model was also used by the COVID-19 task force for the City of El Paso.Fort Bliss archaeologists manage 20,000 sites on the 1.12 million acre reservation, and serve as tribal liaison to seven federally-funded Indian tribes. The Hueco Tanks historic site in El Paso county is adjacent to the military reservation. Cultural liaison with the tribes at the sacred sites of the reservation is an annual event.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Fort Bliss census-designated place is located at 31\u00b048\u203207\u2033N 106\u00b025\u203229\u2033W.  According to the United States Census Bureau, the census-designated place has a total area of 6.2 square miles (16.0 km\u00b2), all of it land. In terms of its United States physiographic region, it is a southern part of the Basin and Range Province.\n\n\n=== Bunker 11507 ===\nAn investigation into above-ground dirt-covered bunkers located on the military reservation was opened in June 2013. These former nuclear weapons bunkers were used by the Air Force during the Cold War, when Biggs Air Force Base was a SAC base. Low level radiation was detected in Bunker 11507. The bunker interiors were previously painted with epoxy paint to contain the radiation, and the paint has now chipped. The radiation contamination is confined to the area around the bunker. The area was closed on 11 July 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 8,264 people, 1,527 households, and 1,444 families residing on the post. The population density was 1,340.1 people per square mile (517.1/km\u00b2). There were 2,309 housing units at an average density of 374.4/sq mi (144.5/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the post was 58.1% White, 25.1% African American, 2.4% Asian, 1.3% Native American, 0.7% Pacific Islander, 8.9% from other races, and 3.5% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 19.3% of the population.\nThere were 1,527 households out of which 80.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 84.5% were married couples living together, 8.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 5.4% were non-families. 4.9% of all households were made up of individuals and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.54 and the average family size was 3.62.\nOn the post the population was spread out with 29.3% under the age of 18, 33.6% from 18 to 24, 34.7% from 25 to 44, 2.3% from 45 to 64, and 0.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females, there were 167.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 204.8 males.\nThe median income for a household on the post was $35,970, and the median income for a family was $34,679. Males had a median income of $19,920 versus $17,227 for females. The per capita income for the post was $13,201. About 9.5% of families and 11.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.5% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n== Museums and historic preservation ==\n\nThe Replica Museum is located next to the Noel Parade Field and depicts the Post at the Magoffinsville site.  This five building museum was authentically constructed with adobe bricks and painted stucco, and includes a sutler store, bunkhouse, blacksmith shop, saddlery and a pottery kiln.  The museum depicts the story of Fort Bliss and El Paso from 1848 to 1948 and was dedicated on the 100th anniversary.\nThe Fort Bliss and Ironsides Museums are located next to the Athletic Field and includes outdoor and indoor exhibits.  These include important historical artifacts from the founding of Fort Bliss to the present day, such as General Pershing's Dodge Command Car and a Patriot Missile.  \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Fort Bliss Main Post Historic District, a large historic district including 343 buildings deemed to be contributing, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of World War II prisoner-of-war camps in the United States\nEl Paso metropolitan area\nTransformation of the United States Army#Divisions and Brigades\n2015 Fort Bliss shooting\n24th Press Camp Headquarters\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEPCC library guides Borderlands\nOfficial website\nFort Bliss Morale, Welfare and Recreation Program website\nFort Bliss Monitor, the post newspaper was renamed The Fort Bliss Bugle; there is also a Fort Bliss Facebook page\nColonel Augustine D.

          "As not US non military, it's a bit of an ordeal getting your visitors pass but once you're in, it's well worth it. Make sure you take passport and driving license to be safe. Once in the base few people seem to know where the museum is but we found Google Maps works a treat.",
          "A nice display of a helicopter and tanks outside the museum, inside there are vehicles from WWII to the present along with lots of informative signs. The 48-star flag is fun to see, not many would remember that. There is also a nice section about the southwest and military",

          "Fort Bliss being the birthplace of Air Defense the fact that they moved the Air Defense School and Museum out and replaced it with the Armor is wrong. All respect to the Armor Soldiers but just because it is called Air Defense Artillery does not mean it should be at Fort Sill",
          "Our family loves military history, and find that most post museums are a good source of history for that particular post. Fort Bliss has a wealth of history, but you would be hard pressed to find that here. The museum is housed in the old post exchange, so they have plenty of",

          "Husband spent 2 years in Fort Bliss and hated every minute. I suggested that we see the museum and maybe bring up good memories.? We started at the gate without a pass, Took us 40 minutes to travel and get one. The museum is okay and would be liked by someone who is",
          "museum was ok. tanks were neat. were turned away at 2 gates before we found the correct one; directions/signage not very clear. base is nice. be aware that everyone over 18 needs a visitor pass now, not just one per vehicle. personnel were friendly and helpful.",
          "Tried the museum on a lark and pleasantly surprised. Don't be fooled by front room that houses only a few display cases....vehicles, uniforms, and military artifacts encompass large rooms beyond. They are displayed in chronological order which really shows the interesting",
          "An interesting and educational experience. The pictures and explanations are worth the trip. The exhibits of the tanks, missiles, launchers, and planes were a great addition to the whole experience.",

          "Fort Bliss is home to the famous 1st Armored Division, but the Fort has been home to lots of US history. Fort Bliss has been a Confederate base, home to the Buffalo Soldiers, the Calvary fought the Apaches from here, and Pershing chased Pancho Villa with Ft Bliss as his base.",

          "Enter the base at the main entrance as you need a pass to get on the base. It took us about 20 minutes to do this. Lots of great history here. Interesting to see all types of tanks, trucks, vintage army transport. We spent about 1 1/2 hours there. Lots of activities for kids!",
          "We were glad we took the time to visit this museum. The attention to detail was exceptional. All displays were well lighted and the artifacts were in good shape. You cant help but be filled with American pride as you walk through the facility. We really enjoyed the outside Tanks",
          "Even though they are at the end of a renovation at this time, there are several really good exhibits. The vehicles on display are numerous and in great condition, some are quite rare. In fact all of the artifacts are very well maintained. The only downs are pre World War Two",
          "Very nice museum although it appears a little disconcerted and seems to be in a temporary building. But a great history of a great armored division. Best are the static displays of both US and Axis WWII armor plus Cold War and more recent Gulf War items. Very well worth the",
          "My sons and husband really enjoyed this museum. They loved seeing the outside exhibits and touching them",

          "When my daughter and grandchildren came to visit me, I brought them to visit this museum on Ft. Bliss. The kids really liked the museum and had plenty of questions. They were able to touch many of the tanks and helicopters that are just outside the museum. They seemed surprised",

          "With a history like that of the 1st Armor, I expected more. Pershing's staff car and the role that Patton played in the Mexican raids was interesting. I was disappointed in the number of pieces on display. The best ones were actually outside. Would have liked to have seen more",
          "This is a must see museum for history buffs, and anyone interested in military history. Especially history about the 1st Armored Divisions colorful and amazing history.",
          "Really enjoyed this museum! Great exhibits and lots of things to interest children! Best part of all is that the place is free!",
          "First, as others have mentioned, you have to check in and get a pass before they will let you through the gate. This can take a little while (20 minutes for us) but it is worth the wait. Please also note that I was travelling with 2 foreign nationals (Poland and Italy), but",
          "I worked on post for several years and visited the museum several times. I recently had the opportunity to go with an Army veteran. The museum is very well laid out and easy to follow in chronological order of the conflicts and wars. The staff is very helpful and there to answer",
          "Both my children enjoy history so we always make it a point to visit the museums on post when we visit my son. This museum is next to the on post hotel. It's a wonderful museum with lots of information. My youngest son (10) was amazed at the helicopter and tanks that where",
          "Lots of exhibits from Mexican wars through WW2 to more recent conflicts. The exhibition has been thoughtfully laid out and is easy to follow. The staff were very helpful and anxious to advise that great changes are planned and great improvements to be achieved.",

          "The museum is quite large and best of all, it is free. Depending on who goes, they will love it, who doesn't love a bunch of tanks. The museum has a wide variety of both friendly and enemy tanks on display, the one piece that is lacking is that it is not very interactive. The",
          "My hubby was in old iron sides when stationed in Germany. So it was a nice piece of history for him. Having some items he used back in the early 2000's was neat to see as well. Great time to reflect.",

          "I thought this was interesting, although did not feel there was a lot to see. Finding and getting to the visitors building to get a pass was complicated and hard to locate by car. It was not well marked. Once we got to that building it was easy.",
          "They are in the process of updating the exhibit hall but it is a great place to visit! Loads of military equipment from various eras. Comprehensive history of the Fort and the surrounding area. The Federal Crossings Mall is a great place to grab a bite to eat. Plan to spend a",

          "Have to have ID's to enter the base. Close to the gate is the PX area with lots of shopping, some of which is restricted to military only. It is a new (much different than when I was in the Army) well organized area that is easily walk-able to all shops, stores after parking.",
          "Very confusing entrance details...use Sheridon Gate, go to the pass office, go through security, and you have access to the base. Museum huge, interesting history and artefacts. Also loved old bliss reconstructed fort on the base. The base itself is fascinating.",
          "Get past some of the dorky or outdated backdrops it is really an amazing museum. It even had German war tanks which was pretty cool.",
          "We enjoyed a tour of Old Fort Bliss and seeing how things looked when it first opened. It's a huge contrast to the base now that's for sure.",
          "This museum is big and has a lot of displays for visitors. It's really clean and organized. I've been a couple of times and have enjoyed myself. Has history of old El Paso and Fort Bliss.",
          "The 1st ADA lives at Fort Bliss. The museum (which, I suspect, used to be the commissary or PX) is still undergoing renovation. There were displays of various tanks and vehicles (both US and foreign nations) accompanied by storyboards that told the story of armor's contribution",
          "In addition to the base itself,we stayed at the Army Hotel. I loved it. Rooms were clean, bedding was awesome complete with a super thick mattress topper",
          "A reminder of the good old times at Fort Bliss when it was the home of ADA. The post is large and vacant a cry change from the late 80s and only the 32nd ADCOM is present. The museum is still open with an assortment of military equipment and tanks. Several large ones are also",
          "This museum is on Ft Bliss so you will have to obtain a visitor pass at the checkpoint unless you are military or federal government. Outside is a great display of armor, a German V-2 rocket, artillery pieces and a couple helicopters. Inside the giant museum is lots more armor",

          "The Museum is great. The artifacts collection at the ADA Museum consists of military items that relate to Air Defense Artillery, the 3rd Armored Cavalry, and Fort Bliss. The 3rd Calvary Museum contains artifacts that relate to the 3rd Calvary's history. These artifacts date",
          "The static display out front is interesting, though would benefit from refershing the signage and explanations for those not familiar with the pieces.",
          "The fort bliss museum honors artillery men from all of our wars. The exhibits are imposing, and very educational. Reading the placards just added to my knowledge base. Also interesting was the fact, that the Sgt Majors academy is located on the premises. Great day trip, don't",
          "The good - Lots of interesting artifacts and exhibits. The bad - completely disorganized...you'll jump from Indian wars to Iraq/Afghanistan to WW 2 then back to Civil war to the gulf war back to WW 2. There displays with Gulf war pictures and in front was a German WW 2 anti tank",
          "Great place to learn about US Air Defense history and weapons. Is inside the base but with permit people can access it.",
          "It was exciting for us to see this base. I can't say that if your not into this kind of thing, this is not for you. We were seeing some friends and I had never been on a base before. Extremely close to Mexico, be careful of your exits.",
          "Our good friend was stationed at For Bliss many years ago. The equipment and museum displays brought back good memories. It made him happy.",
          "I got lost and drove around on the base, it's very impressive. They even have their own mall there. I didn't like inside the museum as much as I liked the outSide. It's free to come here, nice little gem, a must do when visiting El Paso, Texas.",

          "loads of memories at this base. Enjoyed seeing the upgrades that the military has done, but yet still was able to see the old barracks ( a few of them are left) of where hubby lived while we were dating. If you are ever in the area, go see the museum of the original fort and",
          "We did stop here on our trip and took about 2 hours to really go through to look and read everything. They have some amazing equipment and real pieces that were brought back from different wars. I was pleased with this stop. I learned a lot and got to see things in person I have",

          "The museum's on post were disappointing to us! They have some great artifacts and history to share but it was very discombobulated, the desk personnel were less then helpful, there's no info on the post historical society at either one. We've been to many museums on the posts",
          "If you like history this is a great place to go. History at its finest they no longer teach about these things in the schools. Thanks to all those who have and are fighting for our freedom",

          "History was always a good subject. Everything has history. There are tanks small range missiles,,different guns and cannons that were used from the early 1800's to present day. Great for school field trips or folks new to the area. It tells you of past history and how",

          "1st off...i cant say enough how good the staff was. They were always smiling and willing to go the extra mile it seemed. Even the 2 guys in the kitchen were super helpful and polite. The party rooms are super tiny but we didnt use them. The play areas were nice. We went on a",
          "We celebrated my daughter's birthday party here 2 years in a row. She and all her friends had so much fun. WE love going to Jungle Jaks even just to hang out with friends and other children. The food is ok, the kids enjoy the play area more than the food anyways. I just wish",

          "We brought my two year old daughter here just hoping to allow her to get some energy out. It was less than six dollars to get in but you get what you pay for. The jungle gym area is very small. There are a few other \"attractions\" inside such as bumper boats and small go karts,",
          "You get charged for EVERYTHING. You have to pay to get in and with the exception of only a couple of things, you have to pay all other options. They will nickel and dime you too death.",
          "Great place to take the kids 12 and under. They always have so much fun and leave completely exhausted. There is a dress up area and a toddler zone for the really small ones. The race cars and water b umper boats are nice but they would be much better if they had more space.",
          "We purchased the admission plan with extra tickets. Sadly, we had to go back later and purchase even more tickets. The admission itself does not cover much of anything besides the play area. If the children want to do face painting, bumper boats, ride cars, do the jump, arts",
          "We went to this place the kids loved it but food was terrible! place is way to small for capacity and way to expensive! I expected more for the price. We are never coming here unless place improves, capacity, prices and food. Sorry I just didn't think it was worth it. I'd rather",
          "I went there with my two nieces and we all had a great moment. The attractions are safe and really fun, the place is clean and pretty and the food is fantastic! The team is really helpful and friendly. Will definitely be back!",

          "So i took my child here on a friday which is supposed to be a free Frozen show. At the counter, (my first time there) i asked the teen who was working there about the admission price for my toddler. I asked her for all the rides he was allowed to go in. So she said the go carts",
          "When the heat of El Paso is just too much to bear, Jungle Jacks is a great place to bring the kids for some fun. If there age is in the single digits and the heat is in the triple digits, you have a recipe for good times. Make sure they are wearing socks and watch them run",
          "I always enjoy going to Jungle Jaks because it is mutually beneficial - the kids eat and then disappear into the attractions and mom and dad can have some decent talking time. The entrance/exit is controlled - better than other similar attractions- so we don't have to worry that",
          "Had my kids 7th birthday here. We did the 300$ all you can play package and had 10 kids come out! It was so nice because we had a hostess who helped me with everything from bringing the food and drinks to serving the cake to cleaning up. She provided us with a place to sit after",

        "wiki": "El Paso (; Spanish: [el \u02c8paso] \"the pass\") is a city and the county seat of El Paso County, Texas, United States, in the far western part of the state. The 2019 population estimate for the city from the U.S. Census was 681,728, making it the 22nd largest city in the United States. Its metropolitan statistical area (MSA) covers all of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in Texas, and has a population of 840,758.El Paso stands on the Rio Grande across the Mexico\u2013United States border from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua with 1.4 million people. Las Cruces, in the neighboring U.S. state of New Mexico, has a population of 215,579. On the U.S. side, the El Paso metropolitan area forms part of the larger El Paso\u2013Las Cruces CSA, with a population of 1,060,397.Bi-nationally, these three cities form a combined international metropolitan area sometimes referred to as the Paso del Norte or the Borderplex. The region of 2.5 million people constitutes the largest bilingual and binational work force in the Western Hemisphere.The city is home to three publicly traded companies, and former Western Refining, now Andeavor. as well as home to the Medical Center of the Americas, the only medical research and care provider complex in West Texas and Southern New Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso, the city's primary university. The city hosts the annual Sun Bowl college football post-season game, the second oldest bowl game in the country.El Paso has a strong federal and military presence. William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Biggs Army Airfield, and Fort Bliss are located in the area. Fort Bliss is one of the largest military complexes of the United States Army and the largest training area in the United States. Also headquartered in El Paso are the DEA domestic field division 7, El Paso Intelligence Center, Joint Task Force North, United States Border Patrol El Paso Sector, and the U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group (SOG).\nIn 2010 and 2018, El Paso received an All-America City Award. El Paso ranked in the top three safest large cities in the United States between 1997 and 2014, including holding the title of safest city between 2011 and 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks. The evidence suggests 10,000 to 12,000 years of human habitation. The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. When the Spanish arrived, the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area. These were subsequently incorporated into the Mestizo culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from Comancher\u00eda, and gen\u00edzaros of various ethnic groups. The Mescalero Apache were also present.\nSpanish explorer Don Juan de O\u00f1ate was born in 1550 in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and was the first New Spain (Mexico) explorer known to have observed the Rio Grande near El Paso, in 1598, celebrating a Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (decades before the English Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). However, the four survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza, and his enslaved Moor Estevanico, are thought to have passed through the area in the mid-1530s. El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) was founded on the south bank of the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande), in 1659 by Fray Garcia de San Francisco. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the Pueblo Revolt, until 1692 when Santa Fe was reconquered and once again became the capital.\nThe Texas Revolution (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of Cross-border town naming until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring Anson Mills to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.During the Civil War, a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union California Column in 1862. It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.\nAfter the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow as Texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority. El Paso itself, incorporated in 1873, encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river. In the 1870s, a population of 23 non-Hispanic whites and 150 Hispanics was reported. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, the population boomed to 10,000 by the 1890 census, with many Anglo-Americans, recent immigrants, old Hispanic settlers, and recent arrivals from Mexico. The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild boomtown known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness. Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). With the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city's geographic position, the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the U.S. Southwest.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio D\u00edaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D\u00edaz.By 1910, the overwhelming number of people in the city were Americans creating a settled environment. However, this period was short-lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees \u2013 and capital \u2013 to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast Plan de San Diego which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens. The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives. These actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the end result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.Simultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000 and Non-Hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites. In reply, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund. In 1916, the Census Bureau reported El Paso's population as 53% Mexican and 44% Non-Hispanic whites. Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.During and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.The Farah Strike, 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas. This strike was originated and led by Chicanas, or Mexican American women, due to Farah Manufacturing Company, one of the largest factories in the city, being unorganized, low wages, discrimination, no benefits, lack of gender-neutrality, health and safety hazards, and unattainable quotas. Texas Monthly described the Farah Strike as the \"strike of the century.\"On August 3, 2019, a mass shooting/domestic terrorist attack committed by a white supremacist occurred at a Walmart in El Paso, which left 23 people dead and 23 others injured.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEl Paso is located at the intersection of three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua) and two countries (the U.S. and Mexico). It is the only major Texas city on Mountain Time. Ciudad Juarez was once in Central Time, but both cities are now on Mountain Time.\nEl Paso is closer to the capital cities of four other states \u2013 Phoenix, Arizona (345 miles (555 km) away); Santa Fe, New Mexico, (273 miles (439 km) away); Ciudad Chihuahua, Chihuahua, (218 miles (351 km) away), and Hermosillo, Sonora (325 miles (523 km) away) \u2013 than it is to the capital of its own state, Austin (528 miles (850 km) away). It is closer to Los Angeles, California (700 miles (1,100 km) away) than it is to Orange (858 miles (1,381 km) away), the easternmost town in the state.\nEl Paso is located within the Chihuahuan Desert, the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region. The Franklin Mountains extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the west side forms the beginnings of the Mesilla Valley, and the east side expands into the desert and lower valley. They connect in the central business district at the southern end of the mountain range.\nThe city's elevation is 3,800 ft (1,200 m) above sea level. North Franklin Mountain is the highest peak in the city at 7,192 ft (2,192 m) above sea level. The peak can be seen from 60 mi (100 km) in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local Coronado High School gets its mascot's name. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 256.3 square miles (663.7 km2).The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park, the largest urban park in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and El Paso International Airport.\nThe Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey, an example of a pluton, rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Nearby volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (50 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEl Paso has a transitional climate between cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk) and hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh) featuring hot summers, with little humidity, and cool to mild dry winters. Rainfall averages 9.7 in (250 mm) per year, much of which occurs during the summer from July through September, and is predominantly caused by the North American Monsoon. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes thunderstorms, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.\nThe sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the National Weather Service; from this, the city is nicknamed \"The Sun City\". Due to its arid, windy climate, El Paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season, particularly during the springtime between March and early May. With an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph (50 km/h) and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph (120 km/h), these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.\nEl Paso and the nearby mountains also receive snow. Weather systems have produced over one foot (30 cm) of snow on several occasions. In the 1982\u20131983 winter season, three major snowstorms produced record seasonal snowfall. On December 25\u201326, 1982, 6.0 inches (15 cm) of snow fell, producing a white Christmas for the city. This was followed by another 7.0 inches (18 cm) on December 30\u201331, 1982. On April 4\u20137, 1983, 16.5 inches (42 cm) of snow fell on El Paso, bringing the seasonal total to nearly 30 inches (76 cm). On December 13\u201314, 1987, a record storm dumped over 22 inches (56 cm) of snow on El Paso, and two weeks later (December 25\u201326), another three inches (7.6 cm) fell, bringing the monthly total for December 1987 to an all-time record high of 25.9 inches (66 cm) of snow.\nThe average annual snowfall for the city varies widely between different neighborhoods at different elevations, but is 6.1 inches (15 cm) at the airport (but with a median of 0, meaning most years see no snow at all). Snow is most rare around Ysleta and the eastern valley area, which usually include large numbers of palm trees; in the higher neighborhoods, palm trees are more vulnerable to snow and cold snaps and are often seen with brown, frost-damaged fronds.\nOne example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C), the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was 1 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C), breaking the 5 \u00b0F (\u221215 \u00b0C) monthly record low set during the cold wave of 1899. Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results. Two local power plants failed, forcing El Paso Electric to institute rolling blackouts over several days, and electric wires were broken, causing localised blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days.\nMonthly means range from 45.5 \u00b0F (7.5 \u00b0C) in December to 83.5 \u00b0F (28.6 \u00b0C) in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon arrives, while daily low temperatures typically peak in July or early August with the higher humidity the monsoon brings (translating to warmer nights). On average, there are 52 nights of at- or below-freezing lows, 109 days of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C)+ highs and 20 days of 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ highs annually; it is extremely rare for temperatures to stay below the freezing mark all day. The city's record high is 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on June 30, 1994, and its record low is \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) on January 11, 1962; the highest daily minimum was 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the National Weather Service since 1879.\n\n\n==== Flooding ====\nAlthough the average annual rainfall is only about 9.7 in (250 mm), many parts of El Paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms. In late July and early August 2006, up to 10 in (250 mm) of rain fell in a week, the flood-control reservoirs overflowed and caused major flooding citywide. The city staff estimated damage to public infrastructure at $21 million, and to private property (residential and commercial) at $77 million. Much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood-control dams and reservoirs, and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water.\n\n\n=== Time zone ===\nEl Paso is located in the far western corner of Texas, which is roughly the only part of the state that is located within the Mountain Time Zone, as opposed to the Central Time Zone.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Downtown and central El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town contains some of the city's oldest and most historic neighborhoods. Located in the heart of the city, it is home to approximately 44,993 people. Development of the area started in 1827 with the first resident, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a wealthy merchant from Paso del Norte (present day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), who built the region's first structure establishing Rancho Ponce within the vicinity of S. El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the Sunset Heights district. It is close to the El Paso International Airport, the international border, and Fort Bliss. It is part of the El Paso Independent School District.\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the white American residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. Hispanic-American residents lived in an area called Chihuahuita (\"little Chihuahua\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area. Another downtown neighborhood is El Segundo Barrio, which is near the United States/Mexico border.\n\n\n=== Northwest El Paso ===\n\nBetter known as West El Paso or the West Side, the area includes a portion of the Rio Grande floodplain upstream from downtown which is known locally as the Upper Valley and is located on the west side of the Franklin Mountains. The Upper Valley is the greenest part of the county due to the Rio Grande. The west side is home to some of the most affluent neighborhoods within the city, such as the Coronado Hills and Country Club neighborhoods. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of El Paso.\n\n\n=== West central El Paso ===\n\nWest central El Paso is located north of Interstate 10 and west of the Franklin Mountains. The University of Texas at El Paso and the Cincinnati Entertainment district are located in the heart of the area. Historic districts Kern Place and Sunset Heights are in this part of town.\nKern Place was founded in 1914 by Peter E. Kern, for whom the neighborhood was named.The homes of Kern Place are unique in architecture and some were built by residents themselves. One of the better known homes is the Paul Luckett Home located at 1201 Cincinnati Ave. above Madeline Park, and is made of local rock. It is known as \"The Castle\" due to its round walls and a crenelated rooftop.Kern Place is extremely popular with college and university students. The area is known for its glitzy entertainment district, restaurants and coffee shops who cater to both business patrons and university students.

Young men and women make up the majority of the crowds who stop in between classes or after work.Sunset Heights is one of the most historic areas in town, which has existed since the latter part of the 1890s. Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory, but many have been neglected and have deteriorated. During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, Doroteo Arango (also known as Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s. During the 1910 Mexican Revolution many Mexicans fled Mexico and settled in Sunset Heights.\n\n\n=== Northeast El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town is located north of central El Paso and east of the Franklin Mountains. Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like east El Paso and northwest El Paso, but its development is steadily increasing.

This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain).\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: Ysleta Mission-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), Socorro Mission-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and San Elizario Chapel (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King Philip II of Spain.\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n\n=== Texas and New Mexico suburbs ===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico.

The tower did use a design of the United States flag during the July 4 holidays, as well as the American hostage crisis of 1980, and was lit continuously following the September 11 attacks in 2001 until around 2006.

Over time, as more television stations signed on, more cable channels were added and those stations added network affiliations, the Los Angeles and San Antonio stations disappeared from the lineup.

The first electrified line across the Rio Grande, which opened on January 11, 1902, was preceded by a network that relied on animal labor. The system quickly spread into residential and industrial areas of El Paso. In 1913, a 12-mile (19 km) interurban line was built to Ysleta. At the close of 1943, the holding company El Paso Electric sold its subsidiary, the El Paso Electric Railway Company and its Mexican counterpart, to one of National City Lines' subsidiaries. This resulted in the formation of El Paso City Lines, whose domestic streetcar lines were replaced by buses in 1947. The international streetcar line which crossed the border via the Stanton Street Bridge continued to operate until 1973. In 1977, El Paso City Lines and two other bus companies were bought by the municipality and merged to form Sun City Area Transit (SCAT). In 1987, SCAT restyled itself Sun Metro.\n\n\n==== El Paso Streetcar ====\nThe El Paso Streetcar is a streetcar system that opened for service on November 9, 2018, and uses a fleet of restored PCC streetcars that had served the city's previous system until its closure in 1974. The system covers 4.8 miles (7.7 km) (round trip) in two loops from Downtown El Paso to University of Texas at El Paso. The system was constructed under the authority of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, but when the major construction was completed, around spring 2018, it was transferred to Sun Metro, for operation and maintenance. As of 2016, construction of the system was projected to cost $97 million.\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\n\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of Nueva Espa\u00f1a, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe. Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area:\n\nBridge of the Americas, also known as the Cordova Bridge.\nGood Neighbor International Bridge, also known as the Stanton Street Bridge\nPaso del Norte International Bridge, also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge.\nYsleta\u2013Zaragoza International Bridge, also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.The city collects tolls at its international bridges.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of museums in West Texas\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Source notes ===\n\n\n== References ==\nHammond, John Hays (1935).

        "wiki": "North Hills is a residential neighborhood in the Northeast section of El Paso, Texas. \nThe neighborhood is located off US 54 (Patriot Freeway) at the southern end of Martin Luther King Boulevard (Texas Farm Road 3255), on both sides of the street. It consists mainly of detached single-family homes built in the 1990s and has predominantly middle-income residents. North Hills has a neighborhood association (North Hills Neighborhood Pride Association, NHNPA). A portion of it is leased by the US Army as family housing for soldiers stationed at Fort Bliss. Many of the streets have names beginning with \"Loma\" (Spanish for hill), for example, Loma Clara, Loma del Sur, Loma Roja, Loma Franklin.\nNorth Hills is bordered on the west by a flood-control levee approximately half a mile west of Martin Luther King Boulevard; beyond it is Franklin Mountains State Park, which is closed to development and is open for hiking and biking. To the east, beyond a utility easement about three-eighths of a mile east of Martin Luther King Boulevard on the east side of the Richardson Middle School campus, is the newly developed Sandstone Ranch neighborhood; and to the north is undeveloped land used for grazing and slated for eventual development.\nNorth Hills contains Chuck Heinrich Park, a city park located in the southwestern portion of the neighborhood at the southern end of Andrew Barcena Drive, both of which are named for El Paso police officers killed in the line of duty; the park has a monument dedicated to El Paso law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty and sometimes hosts memorial services dedicated to them.\nNorth Hills is located within the El Paso Independent School District and is zoned to Andress High School and Richardson Middle School, and to Nixon Elementary School (which, like Richardson, is located within North Hills) except for the northwest portion (north of Marcus Uribe Drive to Loma Real Avenue and east of Martin Luther King Boulevard to the utility easement on the east side of the Richardson campus), which is zoned to Tom Lea Elementary School. Nixon Elementary is named for local African-American physician and civil rights hero Dr. Lawrence Nixon and is often referred to as Dr. Nixon Elementary to avoid giving the impression that the school is named for disgraced United States President Richard Nixon.",

          "This may be only an hour of your time but you learn about the long history of US-Mexico relations which puts the present border wall issue in perspective. Plus, we learned there are drug smuggling and illegals coming through the park so the rangers work with local authorities",
          "Unless you're from the area you probably don't know about Chamizal, so it's worth stopping just for that. However, this story is fascinating, and even a little sad, but it's an important part of the history of Texas, Chihuahua, Mexico and the United States. The museum inside",

          "This is a lesser known national landmark that we had all to ourselves for an hour or so. It takes its name from a saltbush plant that used to grow profusely in the vicinity. As the Rio Grande river cut a new flood channel in 1864 it cut off some parts of Mexico and some parts",
          "Really interesting to learn about this National Memorial, right on the border of El Paso and Ciudad Juarez. Neat children's area and short film which provides the background. Well kept grounds, enthusiastic Park Rangers and great Junior Ranger activities.",

          "We stopped here to because we liked the idea of looking across the border to Mexico even though we didn't plan to visit Mexico. The park is very pleasant with picnic tables and trees scattered on a grassy area. The big red x of the border crossing is visible, but not the river.",
          "We had our National Park Travelers Convention here. This is a smaller park but with a lot of history. They are going to be redoing some of the displays soon and can't wait to come back to see it. The Rangers were very friendly and helpful and pointed out several other",
          "If you have never heard of the memorial, then you are not alone. We are national park junkies who love collecting the passport stamps. We were close enough to make a trip to this site to see what it was all about. Yes, the disputed boundary between the US and Mexico was most",
          "This is a wonderful monument to the peaceful way in which a major border dispute was resolved. It sure would be nice to have a more open border but 9/11 took care of that for the foreseeable future. We attended a meeting at the site and with a presentation by a ranger and an",

          "The staff was great and learned a lot. Free to enter and view the park. Fun fact: our southern boarder was not so \" set in stone \" as you would have thought. Well it was fixed in the 1960's thanks to JKF. Hence the reason he is on the mural",

          "I had read the previous reviews and people had told me not to go but its a NP and there must be a reason for that. So I went and saw and it took all of 10mins. It's down the road from the zoo but don't make a special trip.",

          "Stopped by the visitor's center real quick. The museum just explains how the US and Mexico came to terms with a new International border. The park outside was surrounded by busy streets. The grass needed to be cut. Not one of the better NPS sites.",
          "So much to learn at the Memorial!! I was amazed by the history of El Paso, and how much of El Paso was actually part of Mexico, & how much I didn't learn in school!! During the summer months, there are free outdoor concerts every weekend - with an outdoor dance floor ....",
          "We came to the memorial to burn some time before catching a flight out if town. The memorial is dedicated to the peaceful end to a land dispute between Mexico and the United States. It's a great idea for the land, but overall it isn't anything overly special. The memorial has",
          "I honestly don't know why this is a national park. It is more like a shabby city park than anything else. There is nothing there to do outside of scheduled activities. Close to 2 freeways so you get to enjoy the sound of traffic and smell of exhaust while strolling through",
          "It's a small visitor center with some outdated displays they intend to redo shortly but still a source of very interesting info, and the staff is friendly and ready to share some history with you. This would be a great spot to visit with a history class. There is an event every",
          "Visitor center did not seem to be open hours posted on the sign. Park is in average condition and did not seem to be in the greatest of areas. Lots of special events were scheduled but seemed more geared to the local. Not worth going out of your way to and make sure you",

        "wiki": "Northeast El Paso  is part of the city of El Paso, Texas and is located north of Central El Paso, and east of the Franklin Mountains. Its southern boundary is variously given as Fred Wilson Boulevard or Cassidy Road and Van Buren Avenue, and it extends northward to the New Mexico state line; some portions of this region lie outside the city limits, including parts of Franklin Mountains State Park and areas of Fort Bliss: the Logan area of Fort Bliss around Chapin High School and Castner Range, an old firing range northwest of Hondo Pass Avenue and Gateway South Boulevard. Development of Northeast El Paso, which had begun before the Second World War around the Logan area, started in earnest during the 1950s, when many homes were demolished in the process of the construction of Interstate 10. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas of town due to a high concentration of enlisted military families. Northeast El Paso has historically not developed at a rate comparable to East El Paso and Northwest El Paso, but in recent years, it has seen an increase in development.  It is expected that the population in Northeast El Paso will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase for Fort Bliss in the coming years.  Northeast El Paso has gained recognition throughout the city for schools like Parkland, Irvin, Andress and Chapin because of their outstanding athletic programs.\n\n\n== History ==\nNortheast El Paso was once an un-mapped open plain prior to the 1880s, when the first surveys of the area took place. The area was first called LaNoria, which means \"the well,\" and which was suggested by Mrs. Joseph Magoffin. A cemetery was founded in the 1800s in the area now near Magoffin Middle School called the McGill Pauper Cemetery. The cemetery was founded by a judge, Joseph McGill, and stopped accepting new burials in 2009. In 1893, Fort Bliss was relocated to El Paso in the Northeast area. In 1906, around 20,000 cattle grazed in the area.An important portion of the Northeast, the plats of Tobin, New Tobin and Nations Map of Tobin date to 1907. In this area, Frank R. Tobin created a post office, electric plant, fire department and well.  An ad in the El Paso Herald touted that $1 was enough to get started in investing in \"Nations' Tobin Town.\" The community was owned by 1,200 people, but failed because it was too far away from the city of El Paso at the time.A small town called Lynchville grew up north of Fort Bliss and existed during World War I. This land was then granted to Fort Bliss for the Sierra Madre housing project in World War II. In 1955, the land was given back to the city.In 1926, Fort Bliss obtained land that became Biggs Field.Lots were platted in 1953 and 1954 along the edge of El Paso. Mountain View plat was filed by Charles H. Foster in 1953-54. The firm Haynesworth and Huckleberry filed the Tobin Park Plat in 1955. Also in 1955, William Mayfield filed the Mountain Park plat. The city also began to annex land going north, until in 1959, the city boundary was only five miles away from the Texas-New Mexico border.In 1960, the NorthPark Mall, made up of more than fifty stores was built on Dyer Street. The outdoor mall opened on May 1, 1960 and was designed by the firm Nesmith and Lane and built by J.E. Morgan and Son and Karam Construction Company.  It cost around $800,000 to build and was an alternative to shopping in downtown El Paso. It was also the largest shopping area in El Paso at the time. During the 1960s, the mall was the \"Northeast area's heartbeat,\" according to the El Paso Times.  By the late 70s and early 80s, Northgate faced competition from other malls and in the 1990s, it slowly died with store after store becoming boarded up. The city purchased the property for $6 million. After years of neglect, the mall was demolished in 2011. Other major shopping areas include Sunrise Center and Rushfair.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe area had only 201 residents in 1950. In 1953, there were around 8,000 residents. There were around 84,000 people living in Northeast El Paso in 1960. In 1964, the population had grown to 46,010. The quick growth of Northeast El Paso after 1950 was due to the post-war housing boom which attracted young professionals to the area.According to El Paso Parks and Recreation public relations coordinator, Wayne Thornton, the Northeast \"has the largest concentration of youth, especially teenagers, on the streets.\"\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nNortheast El Paso is bounded by the Franklin Mountains, New Mexico, Fort Bliss and railroad tracks at Memorial Park. In 1964, the Transmountain Road was approved in order to connect the northeast and northwest of El Paso across the Franklin Mountains.One of the main thoroughfares through the Northeast is Dyer Street. Former El Paso mayor, John Cook, said, \"Dyer is very indicative of Northeast El Paso. It is our living room. When people see Dyer they see the Northeast.\" Between Gateway North, Dyer street and Hondo Pass is the neighborhood known as Angel's Triangle.An unusual house known as the \"Sugar House\" is located in the Northeast. The home is owned by Rufino Loya who started decorating his home with statues and mosaics starting in 1973. The style is similar to art from Zacatecas.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nOne of the neighborhoods in the area was once known as the Devil's Triangle, though after police and resident action, became known as the Angel's Triangle. Other neighborhoods include Castner Heights, which is bordered by the Patriot Freeway, Diana Drive and Hondo Pass Drive. Castner Heights has a neighborhood association of around 400 people as of 2009. Castner Heights has faced controversy over the bright canary yellow that the local elementary school, Whitaker, was painted. Logan Heights is a military housing area close to Fort Bliss. The Milagro Hills neighborhood is bounded by Transmountain Road, Diana Street and Dyer Street. In 2009, the neighborhood established the Milagro Hills Neighborhood Association. Another neighborhood in the northeast is Mountain Park, which is built high into the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\nThe William Beaumont Army General Hospital was opened on July 1, 1921 on an area that had once been a rifle range. The name was changed to William Beaumont Army Medical Center and dedicated on July 1, 1972.\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\nThe Bowen Ranch is on the edge of Northeast El Paso and the Southern New Mexico border. It's an 88,000 acre working ranch with a restaurant called the Edge of Texas Steakhouse and Saloon. The ranch has been in the area since the 1800s where it was located along the Old Salt Trail. Jimmy Bowen began working the ranch in 1953 and bought the land piece by piece over time. There are four kinds of cattle raised on the ranch: Herefords, Brahmans, longhorns and Brafords.\n\n\n=== Area Museums ===\n\nThe Wilderness Park Museum, later known as the El Paso Museum of Archaeology, opened on October 12, 1977. The mayor, Fred Hervey, paid for the construction himself, which cost $75,000. This museum had dioramas about life before Spanish colonization of the area, a nature trail featuring a kiva, pithouse and Pueblo ruin and other exhibits. The museum sponsors an annual Franklin Mountain Poppies Fest in the spring when the Califormia poppies are in bloom.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\nResidents of the Northeast feel that their parks and recreation areas are very important, according to the El Paso Times. Recreation centers provide activities for families, children and teens to have interesting things to do in their own neighborhood.Grandview Park, on Jefferson Road was upgraded in 2005 to include an improved playground, new basketball courts, swimming pool and tennis courts.Todd Ware Park is located in the Castner Heights neighborhood and has a good view of the Franklin Mountains. Improvements to the park were made in 2009 which included additional trash cans and better lighting.\n\n\n=== Nations Tobin Park ===\n\nFrank Tobin established a rival town ten miles to the northeast of El Paso in the 1900s, but it was considered too far away and quickly failed. Today, Nations Tobin Park lies on part of this area. The original recreation center was built in 1961. Currently, the Nation's Tobin Recreation Center includes a regulation-sized hockey rink with raised seating for 500 spectators. The aquatic area was first opened in 1960. The pool is L-shaped, 25 meters long and has showers and dressing rooms available. At the end of the swimming season, the Nations Tobin Aquatic Center hosts a Dog Swim Day where dogs are allowed to swim in the pool and compete in various contests. After the swim day, the city cleans and drains the outdoor pool for the season. Dog Swim Day was first hosted on September 6, 2008.\n\n\n=== Veterans Park ===\nVeterans Park, which also has the Northeast Recreation Center, was upgraded in 2005. The park and rec center received a paved parking lot, repairs to fencing and additional picnic tables. The recreation center provides day care, and there is also a pool at Veterans Park.The southwest corner of the park, near the intersection of Salem and Rushing features the sculpture \"Days of Valor\".  \n\n\n=== Other parks ===\nMcKelligon Canyon was purchased by El Paso County in 1931. Federal relief money helped pay for a four-mile road into the canyon and originating at Alabama street.Castner Range is an area which is seeking park status and is located on the east slopes of the Franklin Mountains. It's an area that takes up around 7,081 acres and is one of the largest natural spaces in El Paso. Castner Range is part of the Chihuahuan Desert, home to over 100 different kinds of birds and is of archaeological significance, especially for the petroglyphs in the area. Castner Range was an artillery range for Fort Bliss and has been unused since the 1970s. In 2012, Representative Silvestre Reyes introduced a bill to transfer the area to the Franklin Mountains State Park. In 2016, efforts were underway to petition President Barack Obama to declare the area a national monument.\n\n\n=== Community gardens ===\nCommunity gardens are also present in the neighborhoods. The Weldon Yerby Senior Gardens are located in the Castner Heights neighborhood near the YWCA.  The Weldon Yerby garden is most likely the oldest community garden in El Paso, according to the El Paso Times. Approximately 100 people contribute to and work on the garden which was started to encourage senior citizens to get exercise and eat healthier.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWith the increase in population in the area, major public school construction was underway in the 1960s.\nPublic schools located in Northeast are in El Paso Independent School District (EPISD) and Ysleta Independent School District (YISD).\nEl Paso Independent Schools from Kindergarten - Grade 5 are 19 Elementary schools: \nTom Lea, Barron, Nixon, Bradley, Fannin, Newman, Collins, Dowell, Schuster, Crosby, Whitaker, Stanton, H. R. Moye, Park, \nRobert E. Lee, Logan, Powell, Milam, and Bliss.\nFive Middle Schools: Richardson, HE Charles, Terrace Hills, Canyon Hills, and Maggofin.\nFour High Schools: Andress, Transmountain Early College, Irvin, and Chapin.\n\n\n=== Public Libraries ===\nThe Richard Burges Library Branch of the El Paso Public Library was once located next to NorthPark Mall on Dyer Street. The Friends of the Northeast also ran a bookstore where NorthPark Mall once was located.\nRichard Burges Branch is closed to the public beginning on November 6, 2017 for expansion and renovation funded by the 2012 Quality of Life Bond Issue. The completion estimate is one year. \nThe project includes:\nNew dedicated children\u2019s room\nPublic art piece designed by local artist Hal Marcus\nExpanded & dedicated computer lab\nExpanded community meeting room space\nAdditional study room\nDedicated and revitalized teen area\nDedicated Friends of the Library bookstore\nSelf-service check out stations\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nIn 1951, residents faced a lack of water, possibly due to a lack of infrastructure for the Northeast. A new sewer line was installed in the area in 1952.In 2014, it was announced that a solar power station, the Newman Solar Project, would be built in the Northeast. This project was the largest solar project in El Paso in 2015.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nResidents in the Northeast began to complain about dust and damage to the Franklin Mountains due to the operation of the Hugh McMillan's rock quarry in 1953. The quarry was located near McKelligan Canyon.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJohn Cook\nRay Mickens\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nForsyth, Kimberly (1998).

          "As not US non military, it's a bit of an ordeal getting your visitors pass but once you're in, it's well worth it. Make sure you take passport and driving license to be safe. Once in the base few people seem to know where the museum is but we found Google Maps works a treat.",
          "A nice display of a helicopter and tanks outside the museum, inside there are vehicles from WWII to the present along with lots of informative signs. The 48-star flag is fun to see, not many would remember that. There is also a nice section about the southwest and military",

          "It took approximately 1/2-hour to get the required documentation to allow a civilian on base, but once at the museum, it was worth it. Lots of history, tanks, and weapons are presented for viewing. The lighting of the tanks is especially well done, resulting in",
          "The equipment on display is in okay condition. Some more details and historic background would definitely add up to this collection of old ironsides hardware. IF you've been there, don't forget to visit the old planes at the War Eagles Museum.",
          "The museum takes you through the history of Fort Bliss. There are a variety of interesting items on display. Children have a hands-on area where they can dress up in uniforms and touch items used by the soldiers. You can complete the tour in 60-90 minutes. The museum is free.",

          "Since the museum is on an active military base, you access the museum by obtaining a visitor pass at the pass building just before the gate (it is well marked). You'll need ID. The museum itself is well staffed and the displays are well laid out and well marked with pertinent",

          "Fort Bliss being the birthplace of Air Defense the fact that they moved the Air Defense School and Museum out and replaced it with the Armor is wrong. All respect to the Armor Soldiers but just because it is called Air Defense Artillery does not mean it should be at Fort Sill",
          "Our family loves military history, and find that most post museums are a good source of history for that particular post. Fort Bliss has a wealth of history, but you would be hard pressed to find that here. The museum is housed in the old post exchange, so they have plenty of",

          "After nearly circling Fort Bliss looking for the correct gate, I showed my ID and was given a pass to enter. Fort Bliss, named after LTC William Bliss, was established in 1848. Today it is home to nearly 40,000 service personnel. The main attraction is the Old Ironsides",
          "Husband spent 2 years in Fort Bliss and hated every minute. I suggested that we see the museum and maybe bring up good memories.? We started at the gate without a pass, Took us 40 minutes to travel and get one. The museum is okay and would be liked by someone who is",
          "museum was ok. tanks were neat. were turned away at 2 gates before we found the correct one; directions/signage not very clear. base is nice. be aware that everyone over 18 needs a visitor pass now, not just one per vehicle. personnel were friendly and helpful.",
          "Tried the museum on a lark and pleasantly surprised. Don't be fooled by front room that houses only a few display cases....vehicles, uniforms, and military artifacts encompass large rooms beyond. They are displayed in chronological order which really shows the interesting",
          "An interesting and educational experience. The pictures and explanations are worth the trip. The exhibits of the tanks, missiles, launchers, and planes were a great addition to the whole experience.",
          "They have so many tanks from different wars and time periods. Not only from the United States, but other countries. I found it to be very informative.",
          "You need to visit Ft. Bliss TX. The city in the middle of the City of El Paso . Make sure you show at the gate before entering post your ID. Vehicle Registration and insurance . That way you can enter military installation . Plan to be here all day. There are two",
          "We visited with our 5 and 2 year old grand daughters and had a great time. The guides were not busy and answered all our questions about the tanks and artillery and personnel carriers. They have a nice little activity area for kids with coloring dress up and activities. The",

          "I am retired and after 20 years and I retired from Ft Bliss. It\u2019s not only an active and retired community but for the local population and visitor as well.",
          "This is a must stop place if you're visiting Fort Bliss Texas. You must make sure that you stop to get a pass it could take up to an hour for that process so plan on spending some time there.",
          "Fort Bliss is home to the famous 1st Armored Division, but the Fort has been home to lots of US history. Fort Bliss has been a Confederate base, home to the Buffalo Soldiers, the Calvary fought the Apaches from here, and Pershing chased Pancho Villa with Ft Bliss as his base.",
          "This is a rather large museum, behind the Freedom Crossing/PX area. It has two major sections: an outdoor display of equipment from various wars since WWII and an indoor with more equipment and many displays of softer equipment such as uniforms. They also have an original",
          "Enter the base at the main entrance as you need a pass to get on the base. It took us about 20 minutes to do this. Lots of great history here. Interesting to see all types of tanks, trucks, vintage army transport. We spent about 1 1/2 hours there. Lots of activities for kids!",
          "We were glad we took the time to visit this museum. The attention to detail was exceptional. All displays were well lighted and the artifacts were in good shape. You cant help but be filled with American pride as you walk through the facility. We really enjoyed the outside Tanks",
          "Even though they are at the end of a renovation at this time, there are several really good exhibits. The vehicles on display are numerous and in great condition, some are quite rare. In fact all of the artifacts are very well maintained. The only downs are pre World War Two",
          "Very nice museum although it appears a little disconcerted and seems to be in a temporary building. But a great history of a great armored division. Best are the static displays of both US and Axis WWII armor plus Cold War and more recent Gulf War items. Very well worth the",
          "My sons and husband really enjoyed this museum. They loved seeing the outside exhibits and touching them",

          "When my daughter and grandchildren came to visit me, I brought them to visit this museum on Ft. Bliss. The kids really liked the museum and had plenty of questions. They were able to touch many of the tanks and helicopters that are just outside the museum. They seemed surprised",

          "Very nice military museum. Excellent place for tank and military vehicle enthusiast. Grandchildren learned a lot about the history of Fort Bliss.",
          "With a history like that of the 1st Armor, I expected more. Pershing's staff car and the role that Patton played in the Mexican raids was interesting. I was disappointed in the number of pieces on display. The best ones were actually outside. Would have liked to have seen more",
          "This is a must see museum for history buffs, and anyone interested in military history. Especially history about the 1st Armored Divisions colorful and amazing history.",
          "Really enjoyed this museum! Great exhibits and lots of things to interest children! Best part of all is that the place is free!",
          "First, as others have mentioned, you have to check in and get a pass before they will let you through the gate. This can take a little while (20 minutes for us) but it is worth the wait. Please also note that I was travelling with 2 foreign nationals (Poland and Italy), but",
          "I worked on post for several years and visited the museum several times. I recently had the opportunity to go with an Army veteran. The museum is very well laid out and easy to follow in chronological order of the conflicts and wars. The staff is very helpful and there to answer",

          "The museum is quite large and best of all, it is free. Depending on who goes, they will love it, who doesn't love a bunch of tanks. The museum has a wide variety of both friendly and enemy tanks on display, the one piece that is lacking is that it is not very interactive. The",
          "My hubby was in old iron sides when stationed in Germany. So it was a nice piece of history for him. Having some items he used back in the early 2000's was neat to see as well. Great time to reflect.",

          "I thought this was interesting, although did not feel there was a lot to see. Finding and getting to the visitors building to get a pass was complicated and hard to locate by car. It was not well marked. Once we got to that building it was easy.",
          "They are in the process of updating the exhibit hall but it is a great place to visit! Loads of military equipment from various eras. Comprehensive history of the Fort and the surrounding area. The Federal Crossings Mall is a great place to grab a bite to eat. Plan to spend a",

          "If you like tanks and military history this is the place to go. We learned things we didn't know and it was interesting to see all the vehicles they had. If you do not have a military ID, you need to get a visitor pass first. It isn't hard, but we didn't know that and had to",
          "Have to have ID's to enter the base. Close to the gate is the PX area with lots of shopping, some of which is restricted to military only. It is a new (much different than when I was in the Army) well organized area that is easily walk-able to all shops, stores after parking.",
          "Very confusing entrance details...use Sheridon Gate, go to the pass office, go through security, and you have access to the base. Museum huge, interesting history and artefacts. Also loved old bliss reconstructed fort on the base. The base itself is fascinating.",
          "Get past some of the dorky or outdated backdrops it is really an amazing museum. It even had German war tanks which was pretty cool.",
          "We enjoyed a tour of Old Fort Bliss and seeing how things looked when it first opened. It's a huge contrast to the base now that's for sure.",
          "This museum is big and has a lot of displays for visitors. It's really clean and organized. I've been a couple of times and have enjoyed myself. Has history of old El Paso and Fort Bliss.",
          "The 1st ADA lives at Fort Bliss. The museum (which, I suspect, used to be the commissary or PX) is still undergoing renovation. There were displays of various tanks and vehicles (both US and foreign nations) accompanied by storyboards that told the story of armor's contribution",
          "In addition to the base itself,we stayed at the Army Hotel. I loved it. Rooms were clean, bedding was awesome complete with a super thick mattress topper",
          "A reminder of the good old times at Fort Bliss when it was the home of ADA. The post is large and vacant a cry change from the late 80s and only the 32nd ADCOM is present. The museum is still open with an assortment of military equipment and tanks. Several large ones are also",
          "This museum is on Ft Bliss so you will have to obtain a visitor pass at the checkpoint unless you are military or federal government. Outside is a great display of armor, a German V-2 rocket, artillery pieces and a couple helicopters. Inside the giant museum is lots more armor",
          "Fort Bliss has improved the museum with addition of st Armored Division memorabilia from Germany a few years ago. Good selection of vehicles outside on display.",
          "While in El Paso we ventured just past the visitor checkpoint to see the memorial. You will need to provide identification and personal information , including your social security number to obtain a pass to enter Fort Bliss.",
          "The Museum is great. The artifacts collection at the ADA Museum consists of military items that relate to Air Defense Artillery, the 3rd Armored Cavalry, and Fort Bliss. The 3rd Calvary Museum contains artifacts that relate to the 3rd Calvary's history. These artifacts date",

          "The fort bliss museum honors artillery men from all of our wars. The exhibits are imposing, and very educational. Reading the placards just added to my knowledge base. Also interesting was the fact, that the Sgt Majors academy is located on the premises. Great day trip, don't",
          "The good - Lots of interesting artifacts and exhibits. The bad - completely disorganized...you'll jump from Indian wars to Iraq/Afghanistan to WW 2 then back to Civil war to the gulf war back to WW 2. There displays with Gulf war pictures and in front was a German WW 2 anti tank",
          "Great place to learn about US Air Defense history and weapons. Is inside the base but with permit people can access it.",
          "It was exciting for us to see this base. I can't say that if your not into this kind of thing, this is not for you. We were seeing some friends and I had never been on a base before. Extremely close to Mexico, be careful of your exits.",
          "Our good friend was stationed at For Bliss many years ago. The equipment and museum displays brought back good memories. It made him happy.",
          "I got lost and drove around on the base, it's very impressive. They even have their own mall there. I didn't like inside the museum as much as I liked the outSide. It's free to come here, nice little gem, a must do when visiting El Paso, Texas.",
          "I wanted to visit the museum on Saturday, by the time I arrived, it was late afternoon and they were already closed. But at least I got to enjoy viewing all the tanks and artillery displays in the parking lot. That was cool.",

          "loads of memories at this base. Enjoyed seeing the upgrades that the military has done, but yet still was able to see the old barracks ( a few of them are left) of where hubby lived while we were dating. If you are ever in the area, go see the museum of the original fort and",
          "We did stop here on our trip and took about 2 hours to really go through to look and read everything. They have some amazing equipment and real pieces that were brought back from different wars. I was pleased with this stop. I learned a lot and got to see things in person I have",

          "Check out the assortment of Army vehicles, tanks, air defense artillery, and helicopters. It's free and you can take all the photos you want. Do Not climb on any of the display equipment.",
          "The museum's on post were disappointing to us! They have some great artifacts and history to share but it was very discombobulated, the desk personnel were less then helpful, there's no info on the post historical society at either one. We've been to many museums on the posts",
          "If you like history this is a great place to go. History at its finest they no longer teach about these things in the schools. Thanks to all those who have and are fighting for our freedom",

          "Lots of information and great for military history buffs. Easy parking-signage while off-base could be better but on base really clear. Old Ironsides pictures and the General Patton pictures are really cool. I thought Ft. Knox had a good one but this one ranks right up there!",

        "wiki": "El Paso (; Spanish: [el \u02c8paso] \"the pass\") is a city and the county seat of El Paso County, Texas, United States, in the far western part of the state. The 2019 population estimate for the city from the U.S. Census was 681,728, making it the 22nd largest city in the United States. Its metropolitan statistical area (MSA) covers all of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in Texas, and has a population of 840,758.El Paso stands on the Rio Grande across the Mexico\u2013United States border from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua with 1.4 million people. Las Cruces, in the neighboring U.S. state of New Mexico, has a population of 215,579. On the U.S. side, the El Paso metropolitan area forms part of the larger El Paso\u2013Las Cruces CSA, with a population of 1,060,397.Bi-nationally, these three cities form a combined international metropolitan area sometimes referred to as the Paso del Norte or the Borderplex. The region of 2.5 million people constitutes the largest bilingual and binational work force in the Western Hemisphere.The city is home to three publicly traded companies, and former Western Refining, now Andeavor. as well as home to the Medical Center of the Americas, the only medical research and care provider complex in West Texas and Southern New Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso, the city's primary university. The city hosts the annual Sun Bowl college football post-season game, the second oldest bowl game in the country.El Paso has a strong federal and military presence. William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Biggs Army Airfield, and Fort Bliss are located in the area. Fort Bliss is one of the largest military complexes of the United States Army and the largest training area in the United States. Also headquartered in El Paso are the DEA domestic field division 7, El Paso Intelligence Center, Joint Task Force North, United States Border Patrol El Paso Sector, and the U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group (SOG).\nIn 2010 and 2018, El Paso received an All-America City Award. El Paso ranked in the top three safest large cities in the United States between 1997 and 2014, including holding the title of safest city between 2011 and 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks. The evidence suggests 10,000 to 12,000 years of human habitation. The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. When the Spanish arrived, the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area. These were subsequently incorporated into the Mestizo culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from Comancher\u00eda, and gen\u00edzaros of various ethnic groups. The Mescalero Apache were also present.\nSpanish explorer Don Juan de O\u00f1ate was born in 1550 in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and was the first New Spain (Mexico) explorer known to have observed the Rio Grande near El Paso, in 1598, celebrating a Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (decades before the English Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). However, the four survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza, and his enslaved Moor Estevanico, are thought to have passed through the area in the mid-1530s. El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) was founded on the south bank of the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande), in 1659 by Fray Garcia de San Francisco. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the Pueblo Revolt, until 1692 when Santa Fe was reconquered and once again became the capital.\nThe Texas Revolution (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of Cross-border town naming until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring Anson Mills to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.During the Civil War, a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union California Column in 1862. It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.\nAfter the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow as Texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority. El Paso itself, incorporated in 1873, encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river. In the 1870s, a population of 23 non-Hispanic whites and 150 Hispanics was reported. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, the population boomed to 10,000 by the 1890 census, with many Anglo-Americans, recent immigrants, old Hispanic settlers, and recent arrivals from Mexico. The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild boomtown known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness. Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). With the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city's geographic position, the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the U.S. Southwest.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio D\u00edaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D\u00edaz.By 1910, the overwhelming number of people in the city were Americans creating a settled environment. However, this period was short-lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees \u2013 and capital \u2013 to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast Plan de San Diego which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens. The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives. These actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the end result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.Simultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000 and Non-Hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites. In reply, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund. In 1916, the Census Bureau reported El Paso's population as 53% Mexican and 44% Non-Hispanic whites. Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.During and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.The Farah Strike, 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas. This strike was originated and led by Chicanas, or Mexican American women, due to Farah Manufacturing Company, one of the largest factories in the city, being unorganized, low wages, discrimination, no benefits, lack of gender-neutrality, health and safety hazards, and unattainable quotas. Texas Monthly described the Farah Strike as the \"strike of the century.\"On August 3, 2019, a mass shooting/domestic terrorist attack committed by a white supremacist occurred at a Walmart in El Paso, which left 23 people dead and 23 others injured.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEl Paso is located at the intersection of three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua) and two countries (the U.S. and Mexico). It is the only major Texas city on Mountain Time. Ciudad Juarez was once in Central Time, but both cities are now on Mountain Time.\nEl Paso is closer to the capital cities of four other states \u2013 Phoenix, Arizona (345 miles (555 km) away); Santa Fe, New Mexico, (273 miles (439 km) away); Ciudad Chihuahua, Chihuahua, (218 miles (351 km) away), and Hermosillo, Sonora (325 miles (523 km) away) \u2013 than it is to the capital of its own state, Austin (528 miles (850 km) away). It is closer to Los Angeles, California (700 miles (1,100 km) away) than it is to Orange (858 miles (1,381 km) away), the easternmost town in the state.\nEl Paso is located within the Chihuahuan Desert, the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region. The Franklin Mountains extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the west side forms the beginnings of the Mesilla Valley, and the east side expands into the desert and lower valley. They connect in the central business district at the southern end of the mountain range.\nThe city's elevation is 3,800 ft (1,200 m) above sea level. North Franklin Mountain is the highest peak in the city at 7,192 ft (2,192 m) above sea level. The peak can be seen from 60 mi (100 km) in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local Coronado High School gets its mascot's name. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 256.3 square miles (663.7 km2).The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park, the largest urban park in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and El Paso International Airport.\nThe Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey, an example of a pluton, rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Nearby volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (50 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEl Paso has a transitional climate between cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk) and hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh) featuring hot summers, with little humidity, and cool to mild dry winters. Rainfall averages 9.7 in (250 mm) per year, much of which occurs during the summer from July through September, and is predominantly caused by the North American Monsoon. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes thunderstorms, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.\nThe sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the National Weather Service; from this, the city is nicknamed \"The Sun City\". Due to its arid, windy climate, El Paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season, particularly during the springtime between March and early May. With an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph (50 km/h) and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph (120 km/h), these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.\nEl Paso and the nearby mountains also receive snow. Weather systems have produced over one foot (30 cm) of snow on several occasions. In the 1982\u20131983 winter season, three major snowstorms produced record seasonal snowfall. On December 25\u201326, 1982, 6.0 inches (15 cm) of snow fell, producing a white Christmas for the city. This was followed by another 7.0 inches (18 cm) on December 30\u201331, 1982. On April 4\u20137, 1983, 16.5 inches (42 cm) of snow fell on El Paso, bringing the seasonal total to nearly 30 inches (76 cm). On December 13\u201314, 1987, a record storm dumped over 22 inches (56 cm) of snow on El Paso, and two weeks later (December 25\u201326), another three inches (7.6 cm) fell, bringing the monthly total for December 1987 to an all-time record high of 25.9 inches (66 cm) of snow.\nThe average annual snowfall for the city varies widely between different neighborhoods at different elevations, but is 6.1 inches (15 cm) at the airport (but with a median of 0, meaning most years see no snow at all). Snow is most rare around Ysleta and the eastern valley area, which usually include large numbers of palm trees; in the higher neighborhoods, palm trees are more vulnerable to snow and cold snaps and are often seen with brown, frost-damaged fronds.\nOne example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C), the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was 1 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C), breaking the 5 \u00b0F (\u221215 \u00b0C) monthly record low set during the cold wave of 1899. Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results. Two local power plants failed, forcing El Paso Electric to institute rolling blackouts over several days, and electric wires were broken, causing localised blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days.\nMonthly means range from 45.5 \u00b0F (7.5 \u00b0C) in December to 83.5 \u00b0F (28.6 \u00b0C) in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon arrives, while daily low temperatures typically peak in July or early August with the higher humidity the monsoon brings (translating to warmer nights). On average, there are 52 nights of at- or below-freezing lows, 109 days of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C)+ highs and 20 days of 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ highs annually; it is extremely rare for temperatures to stay below the freezing mark all day. The city's record high is 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on June 30, 1994, and its record low is \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) on January 11, 1962; the highest daily minimum was 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the National Weather Service since 1879.\n\n\n==== Flooding ====\nAlthough the average annual rainfall is only about 9.7 in (250 mm), many parts of El Paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms. In late July and early August 2006, up to 10 in (250 mm) of rain fell in a week, the flood-control reservoirs overflowed and caused major flooding citywide. The city staff estimated damage to public infrastructure at $21 million, and to private property (residential and commercial) at $77 million. Much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood-control dams and reservoirs, and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water.\n\n\n=== Time zone ===\nEl Paso is located in the far western corner of Texas, which is roughly the only part of the state that is located within the Mountain Time Zone, as opposed to the Central Time Zone.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Downtown and central El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town contains some of the city's oldest and most historic neighborhoods. Located in the heart of the city, it is home to approximately 44,993 people. Development of the area started in 1827 with the first resident, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a wealthy merchant from Paso del Norte (present day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), who built the region's first structure establishing Rancho Ponce within the vicinity of S. El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the Sunset Heights district. It is close to the El Paso International Airport, the international border, and Fort Bliss. It is part of the El Paso Independent School District.\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the white American residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. Hispanic-American residents lived in an area called Chihuahuita (\"little Chihuahua\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area. Another downtown neighborhood is El Segundo Barrio, which is near the United States/Mexico border.\n\n\n=== Northwest El Paso ===\n\nBetter known as West El Paso or the West Side, the area includes a portion of the Rio Grande floodplain upstream from downtown which is known locally as the Upper Valley and is located on the west side of the Franklin Mountains. The Upper Valley is the greenest part of the county due to the Rio Grande. The west side is home to some of the most affluent neighborhoods within the city, such as the Coronado Hills and Country Club neighborhoods. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of El Paso.\n\n\n=== West central El Paso ===\n\nWest central El Paso is located north of Interstate 10 and west of the Franklin Mountains. The University of Texas at El Paso and the Cincinnati Entertainment district are located in the heart of the area. Historic districts Kern Place and Sunset Heights are in this part of town.\nKern Place was founded in 1914 by Peter E. Kern, for whom the neighborhood was named.The homes of Kern Place are unique in architecture and some were built by residents themselves. One of the better known homes is the Paul Luckett Home located at 1201 Cincinnati Ave. above Madeline Park, and is made of local rock. It is known as \"The Castle\" due to its round walls and a crenelated rooftop.Kern Place is extremely popular with college and university students. The area is known for its glitzy entertainment district, restaurants and coffee shops who cater to both business patrons and university students. After UTEP's basketball and football games, UTEP fans pack the Kern Place area for food and entertainment at Cincinnati Street a small bar district. This bar scene has grown over the years and has attracted thousands to its annual Mardi Gras block party as well as after sporting events or concerts. Young men and women make up the majority of the crowds who stop in between classes or after work.Sunset Heights is one of the most historic areas in town, which has existed since the latter part of the 1890s. Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory, but many have been neglected and have deteriorated. During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, Doroteo Arango (also known as Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s. During the 1910 Mexican Revolution many Mexicans fled Mexico and settled in Sunset Heights.\n\n\n=== Northeast El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town is located north of central El Paso and east of the Franklin Mountains. Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like east El Paso and northwest El Paso, but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at Ft. Bliss in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at Andress High School, Parkland High School, Irvin High School, and Chapin High School.\n\n\n=== East El Paso ===\n\nThe area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population of over 200,000. It includes the 79936 ZIP Code, which was considered in 2013 as the most populous in the nation with over 114,000 people.\n\n\n=== Mission Valley ===\n\nFormerly known as the lower valley, it includes part of Eastside and all lower valley districts. It is the third largest area of the city, behind east El Paso and central El Paso. Hawkins Road and Interstate 10 border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain).\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: Ysleta Mission-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), Socorro Mission-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and San Elizario Chapel (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King Philip II of Spain.\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n\n=== Texas and New Mexico suburbs ===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico. The most populated suburbs in Texas are Socorro, Horizon City, Fort Bliss and San Elizario. Other Texas suburbs are Anthony, Canutillo, Sparks, Fabens, and Vinton.\nAlthough Anthony, Santa Teresa, Sunland Park, and Chaparral lie adjacent to El Paso County, they are considered to be part of the Las Cruces, New Mexico metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings ===\n\nEl Paso's tallest building, the Wells Fargo Plaza, was built in the early 1970s as State National Plaza. The black-windowed, 302-foot (92 m) building is famous for its 13 white horizontal lights (18 lights per row on the east and west sides of the building, and seven bulbs per row on the north and south sides) that were lit at night. The tower did use a design of the United States flag during the July 4 holidays, as well as the American hostage crisis of 1980, and was lit continuously following the September 11 attacks in 2001 until around 2006. During the Christmas holidays, a design of a Christmas tree was used, and at times, the letters \"UTEP\" were used to support University of Texas at El Paso athletics. The tower is now only lit during the holiday months, or when special events take place in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2010 U.S. census, 649,121 people, 216,694 households, and 131,104 families resided in the city.

The first electrified line across the Rio Grande, which opened on January 11, 1902, was preceded by a network that relied on animal labor. The system quickly spread into residential and industrial areas of El Paso. In 1913, a 12-mile (19 km) interurban line was built to Ysleta. At the close of 1943, the holding company El Paso Electric sold its subsidiary, the El Paso Electric Railway Company and its Mexican counterpart, to one of National City Lines' subsidiaries. This resulted in the formation of El Paso City Lines, whose domestic streetcar lines were replaced by buses in 1947. The international streetcar line which crossed the border via the Stanton Street Bridge continued to operate until 1973.

The system was constructed under the authority of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, but when the major construction was completed, around spring 2018, it was transferred to Sun Metro, for operation and maintenance. As of 2016, construction of the system was projected to cost $97 million.\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\n\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of Nueva Espa\u00f1a, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe. Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area:\n\nBridge of the Americas, also known as the Cordova Bridge.\nGood Neighbor International Bridge, also known as the Stanton Street Bridge\nPaso del Norte International Bridge, also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge.\nYsleta\u2013Zaragoza International Bridge, also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.The city collects tolls at its international bridges.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of museums in West Texas\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Source notes ===\n\n\n== References ==\nHammond, John Hays (1935).

        "wiki": "Mission Valley is an area of El Paso, Texas, United States, which includes part of Eastside and all Lower Valley districts.  It is the third largest area of the city, behind East El Paso and Central El Paso.  Hawkins Road and Interstate 10 border the Mission Valley.  This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain).\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches:Ysleta Mission-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), Socorro Mission-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and San Elizario Chapel (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.On April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish and New World Spanish conquistadors crossed lage sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day Downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river. Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now Socorro, Texas. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King Philip II of Spain.\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty  is recognized by the United States Government.  Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\nHere is a list of some neighborhoods in the Mission Valley:\n\nAlta Vista\nCedar Grove Park\nDel Norte Heights\nHacienda Heights\nHidden Valley\nLakeside\nMarion Manor\nLoma Terrace\nMesa Vista\nThomas Manor\nRosedale Manor\nSan Jos\u00e9\nTigua\nYsleta\nWalnut Acres\n\n\n== References ==",

          "This is a good hiking trail for both experienced and novice hikers. It offers a variety of terrain such as dirt, exposed rock, and loose rock. There is a cave with a view at the end that makes the climb worthwhile. I'm not in top shape so I \u2026",
          "Very good Mountain hiking trails. Beautiful views with cave to get out of weather or sun to rest awhile. Restrooms available with picnic table and parking.",
          "Awesome. Do yourself a favor and go for it. Wear appropriate hiking shoes or boots because the shell rock is very slippery. Gloves would be a wise thing to pack for the descent as some areas are best suited for sliding on your backside if you want to play it safe.",
          "Good hiking trail. Beginning is tough and the decent is also tough on the bones. Great views though",

          "Did not mentally prepare when I read this was a trail for experienced hikers. This trail will definitely test you if you are not an experienced hiker, as I found out. Its late October and the weather was perfect, but the climb to the top is \u2026",
          "Ideal for health & fitness enthusiasts especially early weekend mornings when road leading into canyon is full of joggers & bicyclists.",
          "Good trails beautiful view parking with picnic area. Bathroom facilities. If you don't like Trail walking use paved Road.",
          "Intense, feel good work out. Not too hard but not easy either. Felt like a real hike. The view is amazing and beautiful! Peaceful and rewarding when you make it to cave 1, cave 2, and then the top view. Sunset was gorgeous.",
          "The climb up the the ridge is a tough one but once there is smooth sailing, just remember your path back because it\u2019s easy to get lost",

          "Beautiful hike. Bring good hiking shoes and lots of water.",

        "wiki": "Gail Russell (born Elizabeth L. Russell, September 21, 1924 \u2013 August 26, 1961) was an American film and television actress.\n\n\n== Early  years ==\nShe was born to George and Gladys (Barnet) Russell in Chicago, Illinois, and then moved to the Los Angeles, California, area when she was a teenager. Her father was initially a musician but later worked for Lockheed Corporation. Before she ventured into acting, she had planned to be a commercial artist. Her beauty saw her dubbed \"the Hedy Lamarr of Santa Monica.\"\n\n\n== Career ==\nRussell's beauty brought her to the attention of Paramount Pictures in 1942, and she signed a long-term contract with that studio when she was 18. Although she was almost clinically shy and had no acting experience, Paramount had great expectations for her and employed an acting coach to work with her.She later said, \"suddenly there was this terrific amount of work for myself and no time to myself. It was that way for ten years.\"\nAt the age of 19 she made her film debut in the 1943 film Henry Aldrich Gets Glamour. She also had a small part in Lady in the Dark (1943) and was meant to play a role in Henry Aldrich Haunts a House when, in March 1943, she was cast in a key role in The Uninvited (1944) with Ray Milland. Joan Mortimer played her role in Henry Aldrich instead.\n\n\n=== Stardom ===\nThe Uninvited was directed by Lewis Allen and was a big success. A delighted Paramount announced Russell for Her Heart in her Throat and True to the Navy with Eddie Bracken.Allen directed Russell in Our Hearts Were Young and Gay (1944), in which she co-starred with Diana Lynn. It was another success.Russell co-starred opposite Alan Ladd in Salty O'Rourke (1945), a horse racing drama.Her Heart in Her Throat became the third film Russell made with Allen, The Unseen (1945), an unofficial follow up to The Uninvited.  True to the Navy became Bring On the Girls; Russell did not appear in that film.Then she and Lynn were in Our Hearts Were Growing Up (1946), a sequel to Our Hearts Were Young and Gay.  Paramount announced her as the female lead in The Virginian (1946) but she did not appear in the final movie.She was reunited with Ladd in Calcutta (1947), shot in 1945 but not released until two years later. She made a cameo as herself in two all-star Paramount films, Duffy's Tavern (1945) and Variety Girl (1947).\n\n\n=== Loan Outs ===\n\nRussell was borrowed by Andrew Stone for The Bachelor's Daughters (1948) at United Artists.Republic Pictures borrowed her to be John Wayne's leading lady in a film Wayne was producing, Angel and the Badman (1948). Also at Republic she did Moonrise (1948) for Frank Borzage. \nRussell returned to Paramount for Night Has a Thousand Eyes (1948), directed by John Farrow, who had made Calcutta. She reteamed with Wayne at Republic for Wake of the Red Witch (1948), which was a hit.She appeared in a Western with John Payne for Pine-Thomas Productions, a production outfit who released through Paramount, El Paso (1949). Pine-Thomas normally made lower-budgeted films but El Paso was made on a bigger scale.Russell did Song of India (1949) for Columbia and The Great Dan Patch (1949) for United Artists.Russell married actor Guy Madison on 1 August 1949. They separated in less than six months but later reunited.\nShe made some more Pine-Thomas films: Captain China (1950) with Payne, and The Lawless (1951) with Macdonald Carey directed by Joseph Losey.By 1950 it was well known that she had become a victim of alcoholism, and Paramount did not renew her contract. She had started drinking on the set of The Uninvited to ease her paralyzing stage fright and lack of confidence.She made Air Cadet (1951) for Universal then did not act for a number of years.\n\n\n=== Legal troubles ===\nIn 1953 John Wayne's then-wife claimed during her divorce proceedings that Wayne and Russell had spent the night together. Wayne and Russell denied this.In November 1953 she was held in jail overnight after being arrested for drunk driving. The following month she and Madison separated permanently.\nIn January 1954, in a court in Santa Monica, California, Russell pleaded guilty to a charge of drunkenness, receiving a $150 fine. The fine was in lieu of a jail sentence, with the provision that she not use intoxicants or attend night spots for two years. In the same court session, she received a continuance on a charge of driving while drunk.A Democrat, she supported Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential election.She sued Madison for divorce in May 1954. The divorce was finalized in October 1954. During the court proceedings Madison claimed that Russell would never do any housework and would not allow visitors or servants in the house.In October 1954 she was admitted to hospital in a coma after an attack of hepatitis.In February 1955 she hit another car containing a couple and their baby while driving. She was fined $50. The couple later sued her for $30,000 and settled out of court.\n\n\n=== Comeback ===\nRussell returned to work in a co-starring role with Randolph Scott in the western Seven Men from Now (1956), produced by her friend Wayne and directed by Budd Boetticher. The film and Russell's performance were lauded and she seemed poised to make a comeback.Russell was expected to follow Seven Men from Now with Madame Courage, again with Boetticher as director, but the film was never made.Instead Russell appeared in an episode of Studio 57 and had a substantial role in The Tattered Dress (1957).In April 1957 she was found unconscious on the floor at her home.On July 5, 1957, she was photographed by a Los Angeles Times photographer after she drove her convertible into the front of Jan's Coffee Shop at 8424 Beverly Boulevard, injuring a janitor. After failing a sobriety test, Russell was arrested and charged with driving under the influence. The janitor sued her for $75,000. She failed to appear at a court appearance and was discovered at home passed out due to drinking. She was fined $420, given a 30 day suspended sentence and put on three years' probation.She appeared in No Place to Land (1958) for Republic.\nShe had roles in episodes of The Rebel and Manhunt. \"I guess there are still a lot of doubts about me,\" she said in April 1960. \"And this is one of the reasons why I want to get back to the business to prove to people I can do a picture. I'm stronger now. The future looks pretty good.\"In November 1960 she was announced for a film with Mark Stevens and George Raft called Cause of Death but it appears to have not been made. She was top billed in her last film, the low-budget The Silent Call (1961).\n\n\n== Death ==\nRussell moved to a small house where she lived alone. She would periodically try to stop drinking then start again. On one occasion she was hospitalized. On August 26, 1961, Russell was found dead in her apartment in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, at the age of 36. She was found by two neighbors who were concerned they had not seen her for several days. An empty vodka bottle was by her side and the house was full of empty bottles.She died from liver damage attributed to \"acute and chronic alcoholism\" with stomach contents aspiration as an additional cause. She was also found to have been suffering from malnutrition at the time of her death.  She was buried in Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nTelevision appearances\n\n\n== Radio appearances ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGail Russell on IMDb\nGail Russell at Find a Grave\nGail Russell at the TCM Movie Database",

        "wiki": "Northeast El Paso  is part of the city of El Paso, Texas and is located north of Central El Paso, and east of the Franklin Mountains. Its southern boundary is variously given as Fred Wilson Boulevard or Cassidy Road and Van Buren Avenue, and it extends northward to the New Mexico state line; some portions of this region lie outside the city limits, including parts of Franklin Mountains State Park and areas of Fort Bliss: the Logan area of Fort Bliss around Chapin High School and Castner Range, an old firing range northwest of Hondo Pass Avenue and Gateway South Boulevard. Development of Northeast El Paso, which had begun before the Second World War around the Logan area, started in earnest during the 1950s, when many homes were demolished in the process of the construction of Interstate 10. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas of town due to a high concentration of enlisted military families. Northeast El Paso has historically not developed at a rate comparable to East El Paso and Northwest El Paso, but in recent years, it has seen an increase in development.  It is expected that the population in Northeast El Paso will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase for Fort Bliss in the coming years.  Northeast El Paso has gained recognition throughout the city for schools like Parkland, Irvin, Andress and Chapin because of their outstanding athletic programs.\n\n\n== History ==\nNortheast El Paso was once an un-mapped open plain prior to the 1880s, when the first surveys of the area took place. The area was first called LaNoria, which means \"the well,\" and which was suggested by Mrs. Joseph Magoffin. A cemetery was founded in the 1800s in the area now near Magoffin Middle School called the McGill Pauper Cemetery. The cemetery was founded by a judge, Joseph McGill, and stopped accepting new burials in 2009. In 1893, Fort Bliss was relocated to El Paso in the Northeast area. In 1906, around 20,000 cattle grazed in the area.An important portion of the Northeast, the plats of Tobin, New Tobin and Nations Map of Tobin date to 1907. In this area, Frank R. Tobin created a post office, electric plant, fire department and well.  An ad in the El Paso Herald touted that $1 was enough to get started in investing in \"Nations' Tobin Town.\" The community was owned by 1,200 people, but failed because it was too far away from the city of El Paso at the time.A small town called Lynchville grew up north of Fort Bliss and existed during World War I. This land was then granted to Fort Bliss for the Sierra Madre housing project in World War II. In 1955, the land was given back to the city.In 1926, Fort Bliss obtained land that became Biggs Field.Lots were platted in 1953 and 1954 along the edge of El Paso. Mountain View plat was filed by Charles H. Foster in 1953-54. The firm Haynesworth and Huckleberry filed the Tobin Park Plat in 1955. Also in 1955, William Mayfield filed the Mountain Park plat. The city also began to annex land going north, until in 1959, the city boundary was only five miles away from the Texas-New Mexico border.In 1960, the NorthPark Mall, made up of more than fifty stores was built on Dyer Street. The outdoor mall opened on May 1, 1960 and was designed by the firm Nesmith and Lane and built by J.E. Morgan and Son and Karam Construction Company.  It cost around $800,000 to build and was an alternative to shopping in downtown El Paso. It was also the largest shopping area in El Paso at the time. During the 1960s, the mall was the \"Northeast area's heartbeat,\" according to the El Paso Times.  By the late 70s and early 80s, Northgate faced competition from other malls and in the 1990s, it slowly died with store after store becoming boarded up. The city purchased the property for $6 million. After years of neglect, the mall was demolished in 2011. Other major shopping areas include Sunrise Center and Rushfair.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe area had only 201 residents in 1950. In 1953, there were around 8,000 residents. There were around 84,000 people living in Northeast El Paso in 1960. In 1964, the population had grown to 46,010. The quick growth of Northeast El Paso after 1950 was due to the post-war housing boom which attracted young professionals to the area.According to El Paso Parks and Recreation public relations coordinator, Wayne Thornton, the Northeast \"has the largest concentration of youth, especially teenagers, on the streets.\"\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nNortheast El Paso is bounded by the Franklin Mountains, New Mexico, Fort Bliss and railroad tracks at Memorial Park. In 1964, the Transmountain Road was approved in order to connect the northeast and northwest of El Paso across the Franklin Mountains.One of the main thoroughfares through the Northeast is Dyer Street. Former El Paso mayor, John Cook, said, \"Dyer is very indicative of Northeast El Paso. It is our living room. When people see Dyer they see the Northeast.\" Between Gateway North, Dyer street and Hondo Pass is the neighborhood known as Angel's Triangle.An unusual house known as the \"Sugar House\" is located in the Northeast. The home is owned by Rufino Loya who started decorating his home with statues and mosaics starting in 1973. The style is similar to art from Zacatecas.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\nOne of the neighborhoods in the area was once known as the Devil's Triangle, though after police and resident action, became known as the Angel's Triangle. Other neighborhoods include Castner Heights, which is bordered by the Patriot Freeway, Diana Drive and Hondo Pass Drive. Castner Heights has a neighborhood association of around 400 people as of 2009. Castner Heights has faced controversy over the bright canary yellow that the local elementary school, Whitaker, was painted. Logan Heights is a military housing area close to Fort Bliss. The Milagro Hills neighborhood is bounded by Transmountain Road, Diana Street and Dyer Street. In 2009, the neighborhood established the Milagro Hills Neighborhood Association. Another neighborhood in the northeast is Mountain Park, which is built high into the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\nThe William Beaumont Army General Hospital was opened on July 1, 1921 on an area that had once been a rifle range. The name was changed to William Beaumont Army Medical Center and dedicated on July 1, 1972.\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\nThe Bowen Ranch is on the edge of Northeast El Paso and the Southern New Mexico border. It's an 88,000 acre working ranch with a restaurant called the Edge of Texas Steakhouse and Saloon. The ranch has been in the area since the 1800s where it was located along the Old Salt Trail. Jimmy Bowen began working the ranch in 1953 and bought the land piece by piece over time. There are four kinds of cattle raised on the ranch: Herefords, Brahmans, longhorns and Brafords.\n\n\n=== Area Museums ===\n\nThe Wilderness Park Museum, later known as the El Paso Museum of Archaeology, opened on October 12, 1977. The mayor, Fred Hervey, paid for the construction himself, which cost $75,000. This museum had dioramas about life before Spanish colonization of the area, a nature trail featuring a kiva, pithouse and Pueblo ruin and other exhibits. The museum sponsors an annual Franklin Mountain Poppies Fest in the spring when the Califormia poppies are in bloom.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\nResidents of the Northeast feel that their parks and recreation areas are very important, according to the El Paso Times. Recreation centers provide activities for families, children and teens to have interesting things to do in their own neighborhood.Grandview Park, on Jefferson Road was upgraded in 2005 to include an improved playground, new basketball courts, swimming pool and tennis courts.Todd Ware Park is located in the Castner Heights neighborhood and has a good view of the Franklin Mountains. Improvements to the park were made in 2009 which included additional trash cans and better lighting.\n\n\n=== Nations Tobin Park ===\n\nFrank Tobin established a rival town ten miles to the northeast of El Paso in the 1900s, but it was considered too far away and quickly failed. Today, Nations Tobin Park lies on part of this area. The original recreation center was built in 1961. Currently, the Nation's Tobin Recreation Center includes a regulation-sized hockey rink with raised seating for 500 spectators. The aquatic area was first opened in 1960. The pool is L-shaped, 25 meters long and has showers and dressing rooms available. At the end of the swimming season, the Nations Tobin Aquatic Center hosts a Dog Swim Day where dogs are allowed to swim in the pool and compete in various contests. After the swim day, the city cleans and drains the outdoor pool for the season. Dog Swim Day was first hosted on September 6, 2008.\n\n\n=== Veterans Park ===\nVeterans Park, which also has the Northeast Recreation Center, was upgraded in 2005. The park and rec center received a paved parking lot, repairs to fencing and additional picnic tables. The recreation center provides day care, and there is also a pool at Veterans Park.The southwest corner of the park, near the intersection of Salem and Rushing features the sculpture \"Days of Valor\".  \n\n\n=== Other parks ===\nMcKelligon Canyon was purchased by El Paso County in 1931. Federal relief money helped pay for a four-mile road into the canyon and originating at Alabama street.Castner Range is an area which is seeking park status and is located on the east slopes of the Franklin Mountains. It's an area that takes up around 7,081 acres and is one of the largest natural spaces in El Paso. Castner Range is part of the Chihuahuan Desert, home to over 100 different kinds of birds and is of archaeological significance, especially for the petroglyphs in the area. Castner Range was an artillery range for Fort Bliss and has been unused since the 1970s. In 2012, Representative Silvestre Reyes introduced a bill to transfer the area to the Franklin Mountains State Park. In 2016, efforts were underway to petition President Barack Obama to declare the area a national monument.\n\n\n=== Community gardens ===\nCommunity gardens are also present in the neighborhoods. The Weldon Yerby Senior Gardens are located in the Castner Heights neighborhood near the YWCA.  The Weldon Yerby garden is most likely the oldest community garden in El Paso, according to the El Paso Times. Approximately 100 people contribute to and work on the garden which was started to encourage senior citizens to get exercise and eat healthier.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWith the increase in population in the area, major public school construction was underway in the 1960s.\nPublic schools located in Northeast are in El Paso Independent School District (EPISD) and Ysleta Independent School District (YISD).\nEl Paso Independent Schools from Kindergarten - Grade 5 are 19 Elementary schools: \nTom Lea, Barron, Nixon, Bradley, Fannin, Newman, Collins, Dowell, Schuster, Crosby, Whitaker, Stanton, H. R. Moye, Park, \nRobert E. Lee, Logan, Powell, Milam, and Bliss.\nFive Middle Schools: Richardson, HE Charles, Terrace Hills, Canyon Hills, and Maggofin.\nFour High Schools: Andress, Transmountain Early College, Irvin, and Chapin.\n\n\n=== Public Libraries ===\nThe Richard Burges Library Branch of the El Paso Public Library was once located next to NorthPark Mall on Dyer Street. The Friends of the Northeast also ran a bookstore where NorthPark Mall once was located.\nRichard Burges Branch is closed to the public beginning on November 6, 2017 for expansion and renovation funded by the 2012 Quality of Life Bond Issue. The completion estimate is one year. \nThe project includes:\nNew dedicated children\u2019s room\nPublic art piece designed by local artist Hal Marcus\nExpanded & dedicated computer lab\nExpanded community meeting room space\nAdditional study room\nDedicated and revitalized teen area\nDedicated Friends of the Library bookstore\nSelf-service check out stations\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nIn 1951, residents faced a lack of water, possibly due to a lack of infrastructure for the Northeast. A new sewer line was installed in the area in 1952.In 2014, it was announced that a solar power station, the Newman Solar Project, would be built in the Northeast. This project was the largest solar project in El Paso in 2015.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nResidents in the Northeast began to complain about dust and damage to the Franklin Mountains due to the operation of the Hugh McMillan's rock quarry in 1953. The quarry was located near McKelligan Canyon.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJohn Cook\nRay Mickens\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nForsyth, Kimberly (1998).

          "I was in Beckley with a friend and this came up as the #1 attraction. It was pretty easy to find, had ample parking, but the visitor center was closed so I drove around and found it. The wooden ramp was covered in snow (hazardous?/maintenance?), but the stone path was clear.",

          "While staying in Beckley we overheard the hotel manager talking about the gorge to other visitors. We looked it up and thought it would be a great little stop before we headed out of town. The visitor center does not open until noon so there were only a few cars in that lot",
          "Beckley is a very active town and has lots to see and visit, the Grand view State park is one of those places where you can enjoy nature, great scenery and a relaxing time all at once.",
          "This national park offers a great amount of overlook spots if you\u2019re not into hiking - so it\u2019s great for a quick stop in while passing though. The hiking trails are great as well! We ventured to the trail that totaled .06 miles one way, the Castle Rock trail- rated as difficult.",

          "We arrived just as the Park Ranger was walking out of the visitors center at the close of the day. He walked with us up to see the view of the New River where it forms a horseshoe and you can see for miles and miles. He told us how to get to Turkey Run for another spectacular",
          "You need to make this one of your May Stops...Not just to see awesome views of New River, but beautiful Rhodedendrum and Mountain Laurels announcing Summer is on the way in West Virginia.",
          "We really enjoyed the lookout and the trails looked fantastic. Unfortunately, we were short on time and didn't get any hikes in, but we viewed the overlook and we plan to be back.",

        "wiki": "\"Felina\" is the series finale of the American drama television series Breaking Bad. It is the sixteenth episode of season five and the 62nd overall episode of the series. Written and directed by series creator Vince Gilligan, it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on September 29, 2013. It was followed by a sequel film, El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, which was made available on Netflix on October 11, 2019.\nThe plot involves Walt evading a nationwide manhunt for him in order to return to New Mexico and deliver the remaining profits from his illegal methamphetamine empire to his family. He also takes revenge on the Aryan Brotherhood gang who double-crossed him, killed his brother-in-law Hank, took Jesse captive and presented a threat to his family. Knowing the cancer will soon kill him, Walt revisits his former acquaintances to settle his affairs and prepare himself for the conflict and his death.\nUpon airing, \"Felina\" was met with widespread acclaim from critics. Several critics have called it one of the greatest series finales of all time.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter leaving the bar, Walt departs New Hampshire in a stolen car. He returns to New Mexico and tracks down Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz at their new house in Santa Fe. With help from Badger Mayhew and Skinny Pete using laser pointers to spoof weapon laser sights aimed on the couple, Walter coerces the Schwartzs to take his remaining $9.72 million and establish a trust fund in their name to Walt Jr., and as to \"make things right\" for minimizing Walt's involvement in Gray Matter. After paying Badger and Pete, he learns Jack Welker's gang is distributing blue meth, and thus Jesse is likely still alive as their \"cook\".\nOn his 52nd birthday, Walt purchases an M60 machine gun and retrieves the ricin from his abandoned house. He connects the machine gun to a pivoting turret inside the trunk of the car he is now driving, which is rigged to a remote unlock button. He interrupts Todd and Lydia's regular meeting at a coffee shop and makes a business proposal, offering what he claims is a new formula for methylamine-free meth. Todd turns him down, but Lydia feigns interest to lure Walt into meeting with Jack, knowing he will kill Walt. Later, Skyler receives a phone call from Marie, who warns her that Walt has been seen in Albuquerque. Walt, who is already with Skyler, leaves her the lottery ticket on which he had encoded the location of the money. Following the shootout in the desert, the coordinates now reveal Hank and Steve's hidden grave, and Walt advises Skyler to use the location as leverage in negotiating a favorable plea bargain. Walt admits to Skyler that contrary to his previous claims that he only wanted to make money to support his family after his death, his life as a drug kingpin was for himself. Skyler allows Walt to see Holly while she sleeps. After leaving, Walt watches from afar as Walt Jr. arrives home from school.\nWalt drives to Jack's hideout and parks alongside the building. He meets inside with Jack and his men, but Jack refuses Walt's meth formula offer and orders him killed. Walt diverts Jack's attention by accusing him of going back on his promise to kill Jesse and instead partnering with him to continue the meth business. Jack responds by ordering that Jesse be brought from the Quonset hut where he is cooking meth so Jack can prove Jesse is a captive, not a partner. Upon seeing Jesse, Walt tackles him out of the line of fire and uses the remote unlock button to fire the machine gun through the building's walls; everyone but Jack, Todd, Jesse, and Walt are killed. Jesse strangles and kills Todd with the chain attached to his handcuffs, and then frees himself with Todd's keys. A wounded Jack attempts to bargain for his life with the location of the money he stole from Walt, but Walt kills him mid-sentence. Walt gives the gun to Jesse and asks Jesse to kill him. Jesse notices Walt is wounded from the machine gun's fire and refuses, telling Walt that if he wants to die he should do it himself.\nAs Jesse and Walt leave Jack's house, Walt answers Todd's phone and speaks with an obviously ill Lydia. He informs her that Jack and his gang are all dead and that she'll soon be dead too because he planted ricin in her stevia during the meeting at the coffee shop. Jesse and Walt exchange a farewell glance before Jesse flees in Todd's El Camino. Walt enters the lab and smiles nostalgically as he admires the equipment, before he falls to the floor, collapsing from his wound. Police rush in with guns drawn as he lies motionless, a slight smile of satisfaction on his face, and dies soon after.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nProduction on \"Felina\" and the Breaking Bad series concluded on April 2, 2013, according to Cranston.On September 18, 2013, it was announced that both \"Granite State\" and \"Felina\" would run 75 minutes, including commercials. The actual runtime of the episodes is 55 minutes. The episode was written and directed by series creator Vince Gilligan.\n\n\n=== Title reference and music ===\nThe episode title, \"Felina\", is inspired by the character Feleena from the song \"El Paso\" by Marty Robbins, which plays a major role during the episode.The story of \"El Paso\" closely mirrors Walter White's character arc in the final season of Breaking Bad. Walt, who has become a notorious criminal, flees from Albuquerque, living as a fugitive. Despite this being a successful outcome in the context of the story, he finds himself increasingly isolated and dissatisfied. Because his desire for emotional closure outweighs his fear of capture and death, he is eventually driven to return to the scene of his crimes, where he finds the closure he seeks but ultimately meets his end. \"El Paso\" is on a Marty Robbins cassette in Walt's car, and is played during the episode. Additionally, Walt sings the song to himself while building his machine gun turret. The writers changed the subject's name from Feleena to Felina so that, when used as the title, it could serve as an anagram of Finale.There are also a number of fan theories regarding the significance of the music: the word Felina can be broken up into three different symbols of chemical elements found in the periodic table: iron (Fe), lithium (Li), and sodium (Na). The title was interpreted by some as \"blood, meth and tears\" because iron is a predominant element in blood, lithium is sometimes used in methamphetamine production, and sodium is a component of tears. According to Eric Brown of International Business Times:\n\n\"In its pure form ... methamphetamine is composed solely of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and nitrogen (N), no lithium involved. However, there are multiple ways to synthesize meth from other ingredients, and several involve lithium. The Birch reduction, also called the \"Nazi method,\" mixes lithium and ammonia to create a reaction. Another, called the \"Shake 'n' Bake\" method, involved throwing lithium and several other ingredients into a single pot to create the drug. Both methods are extremely dangerous, as lithium is a highly volatile element. Unfortunately, there's a big hole in this theory: Walt never uses a lithium-based synthesis in the show. ... Walt uses two methods throughout the show: first the Nagai method involving red phosphorus and later a methylamine P2P reaction resulting in the famous blue meth. Neither one uses lithium at any point, shooting a big hole in this theory.\"\nBadfinger's \"Baby Blue\" is played during the final scene. According to series creator Vince Gilligan, this is reference to the high-quality blue meth Walt had produced over the previous seasons and his life as a drug kingpin which the main character at last recognizes he had enjoyed. According to Rolling Stone, the music supervisors on the show disagreed with Gilligan's choice for the final song; however, music supervisor Thomas Golubi\u0107 stated that \"journalists sometimes try to create drama where there isn't any\" and that his quotes were \"mis-represented\". \"Baby Blue\" became an obvious choice as the editing came closer to completion with Golubi\u0107 describing the process of finalizing the song:\n\nBefore I saw the scene, I pulled together a number of ideas \u2013 one which I thought worked pretty beautifully against picture: The Bees' \"No More Excuses\" \u2013 but once I saw that beautiful shot, and saw the scene in context, I realized why Vince was so strongly attached to the Badfinger song. It's tricky for us as music supervisors in that we keep pulling together ideas and revising them. None of us know the right answer until we are at the very end of that process and have cut and locked picture to work with. Vince is just really talented at knowing what the final effect he is looking for, and knew early on that Badfinger's \"Baby Blue\" was the right choice for what he was looking to do. It took until the final picture was assembled that I was able to also see what a fantastic choice it was.\n\n\n=== El Camino ===\nAfter the conclusion of the series, Gilligan had considered Jesse's fate, stating that rather than getting caught by police, he had envisioned that Jesse would end up in Alaska to start his life anew. He had mulled this idea over for some years, and as the tenth anniversary of Breaking Bad neared, became interested in producing a work to follow Jesse's fate after this episode. This ultimately resulted in the film El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, which first aired on Netflix on October 11, 2019 and had limited theatric runs that weekend. El Camino, named for the car Jesse escapes in, takes place immediately after the events of \"Felina\", and was considered by Gilligan to be a coda to the overall series to close out Jesse's story. Paul returned to star as Jesse, and the film includes brief appearances by Cranston, Plemons, Fraser, Jones, and Baker, among others.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Ratings ===\n\"Felina\" had the highest ratings of any episode of Breaking Bad: 10.28 million in the United States, including 5.3 million adults aged 18\u201349. The episode generated millions of online comments and Nielsen Holdings rankings established that it was the most-discussed episode on Twitter for that week. The popularity of the episode resulted in a 2,981 percent increase of sales of the Badfinger song \"Baby Blue\", which features prominently in the ending sequence, as well as a 9,000 percent increase in streaming over Spotify.\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nUpon airing, the episode received nearly universal critical acclaim. In her review of \"Felina\", Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A rating, writing that \"Walt's purpose is fulfilled, and he just stops\". Seth Amitin at IGN also praised the episode, calling it \"fully satisfying\" and awarding it a score of 9.8 out of 10. Katey Rich agreed with these sentiments, calling the episode \"a deeply satisfying and surprisingly emotional finale\". However, Emily Nussbaum, writing in the New Yorker, criticized the episode, claiming it so neatly wrapped up the series in Walt's favor that it seemed more like \"the dying fantasy on the part of Walter White, not something that was actually happening\".In 2019 The Ringer ranked \"Felina\" as the 19th best out of the 62 total Breaking Bad episodes.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nThe MythBusters tested the machine-gun turret and proved that it was possible in real life.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \n\"Felina\" on IMDb\n\"Felina\" at TV.com",

        "wiki": "El Paso (; Spanish: [el \u02c8paso] \"the pass\") is a city and the county seat of El Paso County, Texas, United States, in the far western part of the state. The 2019 population estimate for the city from the U.S. Census was 681,728, making it the 22nd largest city in the United States. Its metropolitan statistical area (MSA) covers all of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in Texas, and has a population of 840,758.El Paso stands on the Rio Grande across the Mexico\u2013United States border from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua with 1.4 million people. Las Cruces, in the neighboring U.S. state of New Mexico, has a population of 215,579. On the U.S. side, the El Paso metropolitan area forms part of the larger El Paso\u2013Las Cruces CSA, with a population of 1,060,397.Bi-nationally, these three cities form a combined international metropolitan area sometimes referred to as the Paso del Norte or the Borderplex. The region of 2.5 million people constitutes the largest bilingual and binational work force in the Western Hemisphere.The city is home to three publicly traded companies, and former Western Refining, now Andeavor. as well as home to the Medical Center of the Americas, the only medical research and care provider complex in West Texas and Southern New Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso, the city's primary university. The city hosts the annual Sun Bowl college football post-season game, the second oldest bowl game in the country.El Paso has a strong federal and military presence. William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Biggs Army Airfield, and Fort Bliss are located in the area. Fort Bliss is one of the largest military complexes of the United States Army and the largest training area in the United States. Also headquartered in El Paso are the DEA domestic field division 7, El Paso Intelligence Center, Joint Task Force North, United States Border Patrol El Paso Sector, and the U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group (SOG).\nIn 2010 and 2018, El Paso received an All-America City Award. El Paso ranked in the top three safest large cities in the United States between 1997 and 2014, including holding the title of safest city between 2011 and 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks. The evidence suggests 10,000 to 12,000 years of human habitation. The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. When the Spanish arrived, the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area. These were subsequently incorporated into the Mestizo culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from Comancher\u00eda, and gen\u00edzaros of various ethnic groups. The Mescalero Apache were also present.\nSpanish explorer Don Juan de O\u00f1ate was born in 1550 in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and was the first New Spain (Mexico) explorer known to have observed the Rio Grande near El Paso, in 1598, celebrating a Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (decades before the English Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). However, the four survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza, and his enslaved Moor Estevanico, are thought to have passed through the area in the mid-1530s. El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) was founded on the south bank of the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande), in 1659 by Fray Garcia de San Francisco. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the Pueblo Revolt, until 1692 when Santa Fe was reconquered and once again became the capital.\nThe Texas Revolution (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of Cross-border town naming until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring Anson Mills to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.During the Civil War, a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union California Column in 1862. It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.\nAfter the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow as Texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority. El Paso itself, incorporated in 1873, encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river. In the 1870s, a population of 23 non-Hispanic whites and 150 Hispanics was reported. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, the population boomed to 10,000 by the 1890 census, with many Anglo-Americans, recent immigrants, old Hispanic settlers, and recent arrivals from Mexico. The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild boomtown known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness. Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). With the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city's geographic position, the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the U.S. Southwest.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio D\u00edaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D\u00edaz.By 1910, the overwhelming number of people in the city were Americans creating a settled environment. However, this period was short-lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees \u2013 and capital \u2013 to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast Plan de San Diego which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens. The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives. These actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the end result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.Simultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000 and Non-Hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites. In reply, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund. In 1916, the Census Bureau reported El Paso's population as 53% Mexican and 44% Non-Hispanic whites. Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.During and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.The Farah Strike, 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas. This strike was originated and led by Chicanas, or Mexican American women, due to Farah Manufacturing Company, one of the largest factories in the city, being unorganized, low wages, discrimination, no benefits, lack of gender-neutrality, health and safety hazards, and unattainable quotas. Texas Monthly described the Farah Strike as the \"strike of the century.\"On August 3, 2019, a mass shooting/domestic terrorist attack committed by a white supremacist occurred at a Walmart in El Paso, which left 23 people dead and 23 others injured.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEl Paso is located at the intersection of three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua) and two countries (the U.S. and Mexico). It is the only major Texas city on Mountain Time. Ciudad Juarez was once in Central Time, but both cities are now on Mountain Time.\nEl Paso is closer to the capital cities of four other states \u2013 Phoenix, Arizona (345 miles (555 km) away); Santa Fe, New Mexico, (273 miles (439 km) away); Ciudad Chihuahua, Chihuahua, (218 miles (351 km) away), and Hermosillo, Sonora (325 miles (523 km) away) \u2013 than it is to the capital of its own state, Austin (528 miles (850 km) away). It is closer to Los Angeles, California (700 miles (1,100 km) away) than it is to Orange (858 miles (1,381 km) away), the easternmost town in the state.\nEl Paso is located within the Chihuahuan Desert, the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region. The Franklin Mountains extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the west side forms the beginnings of the Mesilla Valley, and the east side expands into the desert and lower valley. They connect in the central business district at the southern end of the mountain range.\nThe city's elevation is 3,800 ft (1,200 m) above sea level. North Franklin Mountain is the highest peak in the city at 7,192 ft (2,192 m) above sea level. The peak can be seen from 60 mi (100 km) in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local Coronado High School gets its mascot's name. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 256.3 square miles (663.7 km2).The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park, the largest urban park in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and El Paso International Airport.\nThe Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey, an example of a pluton, rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Nearby volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (50 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEl Paso has a transitional climate between cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk) and hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh) featuring hot summers, with little humidity, and cool to mild dry winters. Rainfall averages 9.7 in (250 mm) per year, much of which occurs during the summer from July through September, and is predominantly caused by the North American Monsoon. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes thunderstorms, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.\nThe sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the National Weather Service; from this, the city is nicknamed \"The Sun City\". Due to its arid, windy climate, El Paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season, particularly during the springtime between March and early May. With an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph (50 km/h) and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph (120 km/h), these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.\nEl Paso and the nearby mountains also receive snow. Weather systems have produced over one foot (30 cm) of snow on several occasions. In the 1982\u20131983 winter season, three major snowstorms produced record seasonal snowfall. On December 25\u201326, 1982, 6.0 inches (15 cm) of snow fell, producing a white Christmas for the city. This was followed by another 7.0 inches (18 cm) on December 30\u201331, 1982. On April 4\u20137, 1983, 16.5 inches (42 cm) of snow fell on El Paso, bringing the seasonal total to nearly 30 inches (76 cm). On December 13\u201314, 1987, a record storm dumped over 22 inches (56 cm) of snow on El Paso, and two weeks later (December 25\u201326), another three inches (7.6 cm) fell, bringing the monthly total for December 1987 to an all-time record high of 25.9 inches (66 cm) of snow.\nThe average annual snowfall for the city varies widely between different neighborhoods at different elevations, but is 6.1 inches (15 cm) at the airport (but with a median of 0, meaning most years see no snow at all). Snow is most rare around Ysleta and the eastern valley area, which usually include large numbers of palm trees; in the higher neighborhoods, palm trees are more vulnerable to snow and cold snaps and are often seen with brown, frost-damaged fronds.\nOne example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C), the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was 1 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C), breaking the 5 \u00b0F (\u221215 \u00b0C) monthly record low set during the cold wave of 1899. Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results. Two local power plants failed, forcing El Paso Electric to institute rolling blackouts over several days, and electric wires were broken, causing localised blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days.\nMonthly means range from 45.5 \u00b0F (7.5 \u00b0C) in December to 83.5 \u00b0F (28.6 \u00b0C) in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon arrives, while daily low temperatures typically peak in July or early August with the higher humidity the monsoon brings (translating to warmer nights). On average, there are 52 nights of at- or below-freezing lows, 109 days of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C)+ highs and 20 days of 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ highs annually; it is extremely rare for temperatures to stay below the freezing mark all day. The city's record high is 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on June 30, 1994, and its record low is \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) on January 11, 1962; the highest daily minimum was 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the National Weather Service since 1879.\n\n\n==== Flooding ====\nAlthough the average annual rainfall is only about 9.7 in (250 mm), many parts of El Paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms. In late July and early August 2006, up to 10 in (250 mm) of rain fell in a week, the flood-control reservoirs overflowed and caused major flooding citywide. The city staff estimated damage to public infrastructure at $21 million, and to private property (residential and commercial) at $77 million. Much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood-control dams and reservoirs, and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water.\n\n\n=== Time zone ===\nEl Paso is located in the far western corner of Texas, which is roughly the only part of the state that is located within the Mountain Time Zone, as opposed to the Central Time Zone.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Downtown and central El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town contains some of the city's oldest and most historic neighborhoods. Located in the heart of the city, it is home to approximately 44,993 people. Development of the area started in 1827 with the first resident, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a wealthy merchant from Paso del Norte (present day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), who built the region's first structure establishing Rancho Ponce within the vicinity of S. El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the Sunset Heights district. It is close to the El Paso International Airport, the international border, and Fort Bliss. It is part of the El Paso Independent School District.\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the white American residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. Hispanic-American residents lived in an area called Chihuahuita (\"little Chihuahua\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area. Another downtown neighborhood is El Segundo Barrio, which is near the United States/Mexico border.\n\n\n=== Northwest El Paso ===\n\nBetter known as West El Paso or the West Side, the area includes a portion of the Rio Grande floodplain upstream from downtown which is known locally as the Upper Valley and is located on the west side of the Franklin Mountains. The Upper Valley is the greenest part of the county due to the Rio Grande. The west side is home to some of the most affluent neighborhoods within the city, such as the Coronado Hills and Country Club neighborhoods. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of El Paso.\n\n\n=== West central El Paso ===\n\nWest central El Paso is located north of Interstate 10 and west of the Franklin Mountains. The University of Texas at El Paso and the Cincinnati Entertainment district are located in the heart of the area. Historic districts Kern Place and Sunset Heights are in this part of town.\nKern Place was founded in 1914 by Peter E. Kern, for whom the neighborhood was named.The homes of Kern Place are unique in architecture and some were built by residents themselves. One of the better known homes is the Paul Luckett Home located at 1201 Cincinnati Ave. above Madeline Park, and is made of local rock. It is known as \"The Castle\" due to its round walls and a crenelated rooftop.Kern Place is extremely popular with college and university students. The area is known for its glitzy entertainment district, restaurants and coffee shops who cater to both business patrons and university students. After UTEP's basketball and football games, UTEP fans pack the Kern Place area for food and entertainment at Cincinnati Street a small bar district. This bar scene has grown over the years and has attracted thousands to its annual Mardi Gras block party as well as after sporting events or concerts. Young men and women make up the majority of the crowds who stop in between classes or after work.Sunset Heights is one of the most historic areas in town, which has existed since the latter part of the 1890s. Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory, but many have been neglected and have deteriorated. During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, Doroteo Arango (also known as Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s. During the 1910 Mexican Revolution many Mexicans fled Mexico and settled in Sunset Heights.\n\n\n=== Northeast El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town is located north of central El Paso and east of the Franklin Mountains. Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like east El Paso and northwest El Paso, but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at Ft. Bliss in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at Andress High School, Parkland High School, Irvin High School, and Chapin High School.\n\n\n=== East El Paso ===\n\nThe area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population of over 200,000. It includes the 79936 ZIP Code, which was considered in 2013 as the most populous in the nation with over 114,000 people.\n\n\n=== Mission Valley ===\n\nFormerly known as the lower valley, it includes part of Eastside and all lower valley districts. It is the third largest area of the city, behind east El Paso and central El Paso. Hawkins Road and Interstate 10 border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain).\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: Ysleta Mission-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), Socorro Mission-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and San Elizario Chapel (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King Philip II of Spain.\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n\n=== Texas and New Mexico suburbs ===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico. The most populated suburbs in Texas are Socorro, Horizon City, Fort Bliss and San Elizario. Other Texas suburbs are Anthony, Canutillo, Sparks, Fabens, and Vinton.\nAlthough Anthony, Santa Teresa, Sunland Park, and Chaparral lie adjacent to El Paso County, they are considered to be part of the Las Cruces, New Mexico metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings ===\n\nEl Paso's tallest building, the Wells Fargo Plaza, was built in the early 1970s as State National Plaza. The black-windowed, 302-foot (92 m) building is famous for its 13 white horizontal lights (18 lights per row on the east and west sides of the building, and seven bulbs per row on the north and south sides) that were lit at night. The tower did use a design of the United States flag during the July 4 holidays, as well as the American hostage crisis of 1980, and was lit continuously following the September 11 attacks in 2001 until around 2006. During the Christmas holidays, a design of a Christmas tree was used, and at times, the letters \"UTEP\" were used to support University of Texas at El Paso athletics. The tower is now only lit during the holiday months, or when special events take place in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2010 U.S. census, 649,121 people, 216,694 households, and 131,104 families resided in the city. The population density was 2,263.0 people per square mile (873.7/km\u00b2). There were 227,605 housing units at an average density of 777.5 per square mile (300.2/km\u00b2).

        "wiki": "El Paso (; Spanish: [el \u02c8paso] \"the pass\") is a city and the county seat of El Paso County, Texas, United States, in the far western part of the state. The 2019 population estimate for the city from the U.S. Census was 681,728, making it the 22nd largest city in the United States. Its metropolitan statistical area (MSA) covers all of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in Texas, and has a population of 840,758.El Paso stands on the Rio Grande across the Mexico\u2013United States border from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua with 1.4 million people. Las Cruces, in the neighboring U.S. state of New Mexico, has a population of 215,579. On the U.S. side, the El Paso metropolitan area forms part of the larger El Paso\u2013Las Cruces CSA, with a population of 1,060,397.Bi-nationally, these three cities form a combined international metropolitan area sometimes referred to as the Paso del Norte or the Borderplex. The region of 2.5 million people constitutes the largest bilingual and binational work force in the Western Hemisphere.The city is home to three publicly traded companies, and former Western Refining, now Andeavor. as well as home to the Medical Center of the Americas, the only medical research and care provider complex in West Texas and Southern New Mexico, and the University of Texas at El Paso, the city's primary university. The city hosts the annual Sun Bowl college football post-season game, the second oldest bowl game in the country.El Paso has a strong federal and military presence. William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Biggs Army Airfield, and Fort Bliss are located in the area. Fort Bliss is one of the largest military complexes of the United States Army and the largest training area in the United States. Also headquartered in El Paso are the DEA domestic field division 7, El Paso Intelligence Center, Joint Task Force North, United States Border Patrol El Paso Sector, and the U.S. Border Patrol Special Operations Group (SOG).\nIn 2010 and 2018, El Paso received an All-America City Award. El Paso ranked in the top three safest large cities in the United States between 1997 and 2014, including holding the title of safest city between 2011 and 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by Folsom points from hunter-gatherers found at Hueco Tanks. The evidence suggests 10,000 to 12,000 years of human habitation. The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. When the Spanish arrived, the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes populated the area. These were subsequently incorporated into the Mestizo culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from Comancher\u00eda, and gen\u00edzaros of various ethnic groups. The Mescalero Apache were also present.\nSpanish explorer Don Juan de O\u00f1ate was born in 1550 in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico and was the first New Spain (Mexico) explorer known to have observed the Rio Grande near El Paso, in 1598, celebrating a Thanksgiving Mass there on April 30, 1598 (decades before the English Pilgrims' Thanksgiving). However, the four survivors of the Narv\u00e1ez expedition, \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr\u00e9s Dorantes de Carranza, and his enslaved Moor Estevanico, are thought to have passed through the area in the mid-1530s. El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez) was founded on the south bank of the R\u00edo Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande), in 1659 by Fray Garcia de San Francisco. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the Pueblo Revolt, until 1692 when Santa Fe was reconquered and once again became the capital.\nThe Texas Revolution (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small; not being more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims. However, the villages which consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan government negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846. During this interregnum, 1836\u20131848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan Mar\u00eda Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San Jos\u00e9 de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas\u2013New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.\nEl Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Cathedral which became part of the state of Chihuahua.\n\nEl Paso County was established in March 1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called \"The Post opposite El Paso\" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; After the army left in 1851 the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852 a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of Cross-border town naming until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring Anson Mills to survey and lay out the town forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.During the Civil War, a Confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the Union California Column in 1862. It was then headquarters for the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry until December 1864.\nAfter the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow as Texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority. El Paso itself, incorporated in 1873, encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river. In the 1870s, a population of 23 non-Hispanic whites and 150 Hispanics was reported. With the arrival of the Southern Pacific, Texas and Pacific and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads in 1881, the population boomed to 10,000 by the 1890 census, with many Anglo-Americans, recent immigrants, old Hispanic settlers, and recent arrivals from Mexico. The location of El Paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild boomtown known as the \"Six Shooter Capital\" because of its lawlessness. Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I, when the Department of the Army pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus benefitting vice in neighboring Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez). With the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city's geographic position, the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the U.S. Southwest.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio D\u00edaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico But tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and D\u00edaz.By 1910, the overwhelming number of people in the city were Americans creating a settled environment. However, this period was short-lived as the Mexican Revolution greatly impacted the city, bringing an influx of refugees \u2013 and capital \u2013 to the bustling boom town. Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed with the large Mexican diaspora which had fled into El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast Plan de San Diego which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens. The subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives. These actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the end result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.Simultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000 and Non-Hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with Non-Hispanic whites. In reply, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund. In 1916, the Census Bureau reported El Paso's population as 53% Mexican and 44% Non-Hispanic whites. Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory. The 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city, partially enabled by Prohibition-era bootlegging. However, the military demobilization, and an agricultural economic depression which hit places like El Paso first before the larger Great Depression was felt in the big cities, hit the city hard. In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the Depression era overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II with most of population losses coming from the Non-Hispanic white community. Nonetheless, Non-Hispanic whites remained the majority to the 1940s.During and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly Non-Hispanic white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the Non-Hispanic white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.The Farah Strike, 1972\u20131974, occurred in El Paso, Texas. This strike was originated and led by Chicanas, or Mexican American women, due to Farah Manufacturing Company, one of the largest factories in the city, being unorganized, low wages, discrimination, no benefits, lack of gender-neutrality, health and safety hazards, and unattainable quotas. Texas Monthly described the Farah Strike as the \"strike of the century.\"On August 3, 2019, a mass shooting/domestic terrorist attack committed by a white supremacist occurred at a Walmart in El Paso, which left 23 people dead and 23 others injured.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nEl Paso is located at the intersection of three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua) and two countries (the U.S. and Mexico). It is the only major Texas city on Mountain Time. Ciudad Juarez was once in Central Time, but both cities are now on Mountain Time.\nEl Paso is closer to the capital cities of four other states \u2013 Phoenix, Arizona (345 miles (555 km) away); Santa Fe, New Mexico, (273 miles (439 km) away); Ciudad Chihuahua, Chihuahua, (218 miles (351 km) away), and Hermosillo, Sonora (325 miles (523 km) away) \u2013 than it is to the capital of its own state, Austin (528 miles (850 km) away). It is closer to Los Angeles, California (700 miles (1,100 km) away) than it is to Orange (858 miles (1,381 km) away), the easternmost town in the state.\nEl Paso is located within the Chihuahuan Desert, the easternmost section of the Basin and Range Region. The Franklin Mountains extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the west side forms the beginnings of the Mesilla Valley, and the east side expands into the desert and lower valley. They connect in the central business district at the southern end of the mountain range.\nThe city's elevation is 3,800 ft (1,200 m) above sea level. North Franklin Mountain is the highest peak in the city at 7,192 ft (2,192 m) above sea level. The peak can be seen from 60 mi (100 km) in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local Coronado High School gets its mascot's name. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 256.3 square miles (663.7 km2).The 24,000-acre (9,700 ha) Franklin Mountains State Park, the largest urban park in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and El Paso International Airport.\nThe Rio Grande Rift, which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Mt. Cristo Rey, an example of a pluton, rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande. Nearby volcanic features include Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole, which are Maar volcanic craters 30 miles (50 km) west of the Franklin Mountains.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nEl Paso has a transitional climate between cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk) and hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWh) featuring hot summers, with little humidity, and cool to mild dry winters. Rainfall averages 9.7 in (250 mm) per year, much of which occurs during the summer from July through September, and is predominantly caused by the North American Monsoon. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes thunderstorms, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.\nThe sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the National Weather Service; from this, the city is nicknamed \"The Sun City\". Due to its arid, windy climate, El Paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season, particularly during the springtime between March and early May. With an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph (50 km/h) and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph (120 km/h), these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.\nEl Paso and the nearby mountains also receive snow. Weather systems have produced over one foot (30 cm) of snow on several occasions. In the 1982\u20131983 winter season, three major snowstorms produced record seasonal snowfall. On December 25\u201326, 1982, 6.0 inches (15 cm) of snow fell, producing a white Christmas for the city. This was followed by another 7.0 inches (18 cm) on December 30\u201331, 1982. On April 4\u20137, 1983, 16.5 inches (42 cm) of snow fell on El Paso, bringing the seasonal total to nearly 30 inches (76 cm). On December 13\u201314, 1987, a record storm dumped over 22 inches (56 cm) of snow on El Paso, and two weeks later (December 25\u201326), another three inches (7.6 cm) fell, bringing the monthly total for December 1987 to an all-time record high of 25.9 inches (66 cm) of snow.\nThe average annual snowfall for the city varies widely between different neighborhoods at different elevations, but is 6.1 inches (15 cm) at the airport (but with a median of 0, meaning most years see no snow at all). Snow is most rare around Ysleta and the eastern valley area, which usually include large numbers of palm trees; in the higher neighborhoods, palm trees are more vulnerable to snow and cold snaps and are often seen with brown, frost-damaged fronds.\nOne example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011 was 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C), the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was 1 \u00b0F (\u221217 \u00b0C), breaking the 5 \u00b0F (\u221215 \u00b0C) monthly record low set during the cold wave of 1899. Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results. Two local power plants failed, forcing El Paso Electric to institute rolling blackouts over several days, and electric wires were broken, causing localised blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days.\nMonthly means range from 45.5 \u00b0F (7.5 \u00b0C) in December to 83.5 \u00b0F (28.6 \u00b0C) in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon arrives, while daily low temperatures typically peak in July or early August with the higher humidity the monsoon brings (translating to warmer nights). On average, there are 52 nights of at- or below-freezing lows, 109 days of 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C)+ highs and 20 days of 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C)+ highs annually; it is extremely rare for temperatures to stay below the freezing mark all day. The city's record high is 114 \u00b0F (46 \u00b0C) on June 30, 1994, and its record low is \u22128 \u00b0F (\u221222 \u00b0C) on January 11, 1962; the highest daily minimum was 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the National Weather Service since 1879.\n\n\n==== Flooding ====\nAlthough the average annual rainfall is only about 9.7 in (250 mm), many parts of El Paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms. In late July and early August 2006, up to 10 in (250 mm) of rain fell in a week, the flood-control reservoirs overflowed and caused major flooding citywide. The city staff estimated damage to public infrastructure at $21 million, and to private property (residential and commercial) at $77 million. Much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood-control dams and reservoirs, and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water.\n\n\n=== Time zone ===\nEl Paso is located in the far western corner of Texas, which is roughly the only part of the state that is located within the Mountain Time Zone, as opposed to the Central Time Zone.\n\n\n== Neighborhoods ==\n\n\n=== Downtown and central El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town contains some of the city's oldest and most historic neighborhoods. Located in the heart of the city, it is home to approximately 44,993 people. Development of the area started in 1827 with the first resident, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a wealthy merchant from Paso del Norte (present day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez), who built the region's first structure establishing Rancho Ponce within the vicinity of S. El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning to gain its roots. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks mostly in the Sunset Heights district. It is close to the El Paso International Airport, the international border, and Fort Bliss. It is part of the El Paso Independent School District.\nDr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s most of the white American residents lived to the north of the non-white areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. Hispanic-American residents lived in an area called Chihuahuita (\"little Chihuahua\"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street. Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area. Another downtown neighborhood is El Segundo Barrio, which is near the United States/Mexico border.\n\n\n=== Northwest El Paso ===\n\nBetter known as West El Paso or the West Side, the area includes a portion of the Rio Grande floodplain upstream from downtown which is known locally as the Upper Valley and is located on the west side of the Franklin Mountains. The Upper Valley is the greenest part of the county due to the Rio Grande. The west side is home to some of the most affluent neighborhoods within the city, such as the Coronado Hills and Country Club neighborhoods. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of El Paso.\n\n\n=== West central El Paso ===\n\nWest central El Paso is located north of Interstate 10 and west of the Franklin Mountains. The University of Texas at El Paso and the Cincinnati Entertainment district are located in the heart of the area. Historic districts Kern Place and Sunset Heights are in this part of town.\nKern Place was founded in 1914 by Peter E. Kern, for whom the neighborhood was named.The homes of Kern Place are unique in architecture and some were built by residents themselves. One of the better known homes is the Paul Luckett Home located at 1201 Cincinnati Ave. above Madeline Park, and is made of local rock. It is known as \"The Castle\" due to its round walls and a crenelated rooftop.Kern Place is extremely popular with college and university students. The area is known for its glitzy entertainment district, restaurants and coffee shops who cater to both business patrons and university students. After UTEP's basketball and football games, UTEP fans pack the Kern Place area for food and entertainment at Cincinnati Street a small bar district. This bar scene has grown over the years and has attracted thousands to its annual Mardi Gras block party as well as after sporting events or concerts. Young men and women make up the majority of the crowds who stop in between classes or after work.Sunset Heights is one of the most historic areas in town, which has existed since the latter part of the 1890s. Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory, but many have been neglected and have deteriorated. During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, Doroteo Arango (also known as Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s. During the 1910 Mexican Revolution many Mexicans fled Mexico and settled in Sunset Heights.\n\n\n=== Northeast El Paso ===\n\nThis part of town is located north of central El Paso and east of the Franklin Mountains. Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas like east El Paso and northwest El Paso, but its development is steadily increasing. It is expected that the population will grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at Ft. Bliss in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high school athletic programs at Andress High School, Parkland High School, Irvin High School, and Chapin High School.\n\n\n=== East El Paso ===\n\nThe area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population of over 200,000. It includes the 79936 ZIP Code, which was considered in 2013 as the most populous in the nation with over 114,000 people.\n\n\n=== Mission Valley ===\n\nFormerly known as the lower valley, it includes part of Eastside and all lower valley districts. It is the third largest area of the city, behind east El Paso and central El Paso. Hawkins Road and Interstate 10 border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 17th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of Nueva Espa\u00f1a (New Spain).\nIn 1680 the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: Ysleta Mission-1682 (La Misi\u00f3n de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), Socorro Mission-1759 (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n del Socorro)-1759 and San Elizario Chapel (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.\nOn April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the R\u00edo Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. O\u00f1ate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the R\u00edo Grande for King Philip II of Spain.\nYsleta Del Sur Pueblo (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua (pronounced Tiwa) is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a \"Y\" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital \"Y\" and a capital \"I.\"\nSome people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.\n\n\n=== Texas and New Mexico suburbs ===\nEl Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico. The most populated suburbs in Texas are Socorro, Horizon City, Fort Bliss and San Elizario. Other Texas suburbs are Anthony, Canutillo, Sparks, Fabens, and Vinton.\nAlthough Anthony, Santa Teresa, Sunland Park, and Chaparral lie adjacent to El Paso County, they are considered to be part of the Las Cruces, New Mexico metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Tallest buildings ===\n\nEl Paso's tallest building, the Wells Fargo Plaza, was built in the early 1970s as State National Plaza. The black-windowed, 302-foot (92 m) building is famous for its 13 white horizontal lights (18 lights per row on the east and west sides of the building, and seven bulbs per row on the north and south sides) that were lit at night. The tower did use a design of the United States flag during the July 4 holidays, as well as the American hostage crisis of 1980, and was lit continuously following the September 11 attacks in 2001 until around 2006. During the Christmas holidays, a design of a Christmas tree was used, and at times, the letters \"UTEP\" were used to support University of Texas at El Paso athletics. The tower is now only lit during the holiday months, or when special events take place in the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2010 U.S. census, 649,121 people, 216,694 households, and 131,104 families resided in the city. The population density was 2,263.0 people per square mile (873.7/km\u00b2). There were 227,605 housing units at an average density of 777.5 per square mile (300.2/km\u00b2).

About 17.3% of families and 20.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 28.5% of those under age 18 and 18.4% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEl Paso has a diversified economy focused primarily within international trade, military, government civil service, oil and gas, health care, tourism and service sectors. The El Paso metro area had a GDP of $29.03 billion in 2017. There was also $92 billion worth of trade in 2012. Over the past 15 years the city has become a significant location for American-based call centers. Cotton, fruit, vegetables, and livestock are also produced in the area. El Paso has added a significant manufacturing sector with items and goods produced that include petroleum, metals, medical devices, plastics, machinery, defense-related goods and automotive parts. The city is the second busiest international crossing point in the U.S. behind San Diego.El Paso is home to one Fortune 500 company, Western Refining, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This makes the city one of six Texas metro areas to have at least one Fortune 500 company call it home; the others being Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin and Corpus Christi. The second publicly traded company is Helen of Troy Limited, a NASDAQ-listed company that manufactures personal health care products under many labels, such as OXO, Dr. Scholl's, Vidal Sassoon, Pert Plus, Brut and Sunbeam, and the third is El Paso Electric listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a public utility engaging in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in west Texas and southern New Mexico.

In 1987, SCAT restyled itself Sun Metro.\n\n\n==== El Paso Streetcar ====\nThe El Paso Streetcar is a streetcar system that opened for service on November 9, 2018, and uses a fleet of restored PCC streetcars that had served the city's previous system until its closure in 1974. The system covers 4.8 miles (7.7 km) (round trip) in two loops from Downtown El Paso to University of Texas at El Paso. The system was constructed under the authority of the Camino Real Regional Mobility Authority, but when the major construction was completed, around spring 2018, it was transferred to Sun Metro, for operation and maintenance. As of 2016, construction of the system was projected to cost $97 million.\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\n\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of Nueva Espa\u00f1a, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe. Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area:\n\nBridge of the Americas, also known as the Cordova Bridge.\nGood Neighbor International Bridge, also known as the Stanton Street Bridge\nPaso del Norte International Bridge, also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge.\nYsleta\u2013Zaragoza International Bridge, also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.The city collects tolls at its international bridges.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of museums in West Texas\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Texas\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Source notes ===\n\n\n== References ==\nHammond, John Hays (1935).

          "We enjoyed the view once we finally got on Scenic Drive. You can see El Paso and Juarez Mexico from the overlook. We were there early afternoon. I would imagine the view would be great at night too. Definitely make the drive up if you\u2019re in the area.",
          "I'm not sure what all that glamour about this sightseeing is all about because all I saw was a bunch of slums in Mexico off of side of the freeway. But, I guess if that's your game ...",
          "Well worth the time to take this drive . Easy to find. Ideally should be prepared to walk for best views. Bring sunscreen, hat sunglasses. Nice area for a picnic lunch.",
          "Scenic drive is a great way to see much of El Paso and Juarez. On a clear day you can see forever. A must see for tourist and El Pasoans alike.",
          "I have never seen such vast expanses of differing terrain. I thought Africa was huge, but so is Texas!!! If you are at all interested in geology or volcanology, this is a must. Just don\u2019t try Old Maverick road unless you have a serious four wheel drive vehicle!",
          "This was my second trip to El Paso, but first excursion to the Overlook. If you are new to El Paso or visiting for the first time, I strongly recommend taking the time to get your bearings. The East side of the Range is totally different than the West.",
          "We were here with my family and also my sister and niece fro Germany it was just an amazing view specially when the sun sets..",
          "The view is excellent especially at night. The drive up the Franklin Mountain is short. Sometimes you might find strong winds but otherwise is a must stop to visit and spend some time. One of the nice things about El Paso.",
          "Scenic overlooks a little tricky to get to but worth it the view of El Paso, I would check it out day time and night time for the lights. Sunset would be awesome!",
          "Such a beautiful drive! Didn't know it was there until we looked at tourist information. Well worth the time!",
          "The winding road takes you past some nice big houses. There are a few places that you can stop and see the view across Texas and into Mexico. We went during the day. It was pretty and it takes less than 20 minutes. Short trip with good photo opportunities.",
          "They close it sunday for walkers and bikers. Nice view of el paso and mexico. Make sure you get out of your car and read the signs",
          "While in El Paso, I visited the Scenic Drive Overlook. It was one of the highlights of my trip. There are several places along Scenic Drive that you can pull off and see panoramic views of the city. There is a small park area near the top of the top of the drive where you can",
          "This was an amazing view of El Paso and Juarez. Tricky to find in an unfamiliar city in the dark, but well worth it.",
          "This is nothing special but packs a huge punch. The road to get here is winding and offers views of the city. Once you settle into the overlook the views of the city and into Mexico are breath taking and beautiful. It is rare to find such a nice place to enjoy an hour or so",
          "Excellent salad and soup bar. Beyond that positive expression, we found the main courses of steak and prime rib to be sub-par and disappointing. Wait service was equally disappointing as our waiter seemed preoccupied with other customers. Perhaps they were understaffed or had",
          "A really great starting point when touring El Paso. You can literally see the whole layout of the town.",
          "My son took us for a scenic drive to this overlook and was surprise since I did not know of this overlook.",
          "A beautiful view of el pas downtown during evening time as well you can able to view the Monument of mexico from here",
          "The winding roads up the mountain drive added to the excitement of the evening. The lites of the cities and the curving road made this excursion memorable. Definitely a \"must do\" when you are in El Paso and it was FREE!",
          "Worth the drive to see the overlook of El Paso and over the border into Mexico. Several pull outs but best one is on top. Bring your binoculars or use the pay viewers",
          "Whether you view during the sunny day or during our beautifu nights, coming up to Scenic Drive gives you a magestic view of not only El Paso, Texas but also our sister city of Juarez, Mexico, the amazing Chamizal National Park and the connecting Rio Grande River between the US",
          "This site has the best views of downtown El Paso and Juarez, Mexico. It is located at the base of the Franklin mountains. There is no charge to go here and the ride up to the point is fun for those who like the winding road driving and spectacular views. A great place for",
          "From downtown, go north and turn right on Rim Rd. In addition to a spectacular view, there are beautiful homes to see.",
          "Scenic drive is a nice, 20-30 minute drive with amazing bi-national views. This desert mountain road is popular with bicycles. Nice, cheap, outing while in El Paso.",
          "Drove up on sunny yet windy day. We had a super clear view of the city. Kids 14, 12, & 10 had fun using the quarter operated binocular things they have at the look out point. Good if you have some time, you can drive straight through or park for a bit. Our visit was about 15",
          "Metal plaques explain the history of what you can see in El Paso and Juarez. Acces through residential neighborhood and the curving drive in park property up the slope.",
          "Went here to see the sunset, but the clouds got on the way. Parking is limited and difficult to get in and out of when it\u2019s busy, which it was. Probably would be a nice view if it were a clear day.",
          "Went here to see the sunset. Parking is limited and difficult to get in and out of when it\u2019s busy, which it was. Otherwise, it is a wonderful view of the city and neighboring areas. The sunset was nice but is dependent on the weather. It was windy and cold so didn\u2019t stay too",
          "We only had a short time in El Paso, so we were recommended to take the scenic drive over looking the mountains and seeing the beautiful homes in the valley. Its nice and there are great photo opportunities.",
          "Well worth the short drive from downtown El Paso. Lovely view during the day. I'm sorry we weren't also able to do a late evening viewing.",
          "It\u2019s worth taking the scenic drive and stopping off at the lookouts, as well as the beautiful homes in the area. Great for picture taking. When done with the drive, the main city is just a short distance and well worth parking and exploring the historic buildings.",
          "We were on a tour with Rudy (Border tours) and enjoyed the vista back in the whole area and also looking into Juarez.",
          "If you\u2019re in El Paso, this is one thing you can\u2019t miss. It\u2019s absolutely breathtaking to watch the sun set over the mountains and then watch all the lights come up as it gets dark. I go every time I\u2019m in the area!",
          "My best advice would be to go shortly before sunset and watch the sun go down and the city lights come on. One can see for miles with the lights of both downtown El Paso and Juarez visible. Close to both downtown and the University. It was a highlight of our visit.",
          "This was so cool to see. I highly recommend you go here and see the city lights. We really enjoyed the view and would go back.",
          "This is a beautiful view during the day but at night overlooking downtown it takes on a completely different character. Great place to sit as the sun goes down and watch the lights come on. Very close to downtown and not expensive to go to even if you take a taxi. If you live",
          "Took a trip up while on business in El Paso. It was definitely worth the visit. Very quiet and beautiful especially at sunset.",
          "My husband and I took a drive along scenic drive when we were on a house hunting trip to El Paso. This is one of the most beautiful views in El Paso. You can see for miles and miles! Be sure to check it out if this is your first visit to El Paso.",
          "an absolut must do in el paso - there are several scenic drives to go - see the divided city in daylight and nightlight -",
          "Took a quick trip to El Paso to see friends. We drove up the scenic drive and the view was amazing. The lights stretched for miles and were just beautiful. The road is a bit narrow and winds up the mountain. We went up on Saturday night and the parking can get a bit congested.",
          "We were driving through El Paso and had a great lunch. We only had a short time there and I saw on the map there was a scenic drive. It was great. The day was hot, but beautiful. The overlook is gorgeous! The road is windy and fun to drive.",
          "A place not very far from the downtown. Has multiple view points from where the whole city can be seen including Mexico. The scene looks so different during the day and the night. Its worthwhile to take a trip during both times. There are parking multiple parking spots at",
          "The drive to the scenic overlook takes a few minutes but it is worth it. It looks very different in the day time than at night. Best time to go is sunset. Bring a good pair of binoculars for a better view of Juarez.",
          "Nice drive up and easy to find parking and a spot to take some pics, take in the views of the mountains and Juarez, Mexico. Must visit!",

          "Gorgeous view of Texas's El Paso city lights and downtown. Great photo opportunity. Entrance nearby at Tom Lea Park on Rim Road offers a Wedding Venue with Breath Taking views a backdrop and the opulent Mansions as frontage. Dreamy venue for a bride and groom.",
          "The views from the location live up to the place's name - just hang on to your hat. The day we went, it was VERY windy. =)",

          "This is a place to go for a beautiful view of the city of El Paso, Juarez, Texas, Mexico and numerous communities with in view in the area on a clear day or night lights. A very cool view and historical interesting site.",
          "Scenic drive is El Paso's iconic \"Top of The World\" view of our City by the Rio Grand, where you can see Mexico and Texas at the same time. A nice drive against our Mountain that at night displays our famous Star of Hope and Community that can be seen from your airplane seat if",
          "Really short drive, but it's a beautiful view of the city and surrounding areas, all the way into Mexico!",
          "Scenic Drive is exactly that. A short cliff hanging drive along the East side of the Franklin Mountains near downtown El Paso, Texas. It is very old, poorly paved, narrow two lane road that winds along the edge of the mountain. There is a very small parking area, marked by a",
          "We went at night. It was just beautiful to see all the lights. We wanted to go back durning the day but never made it. A must see if you are in El Paso.",
          "The view is nice during the day, but the night is when it really shines. You can see the lights of El Paso as well as Juarez, across the border. Very nice!",
          "I stopped at this scenic drive overlook on a recent trip to El Paso at night and during the day. The night view was spectacular and should not be missed.",

          "We had many people visit El Paso for our wedding. They came from New York, North Carolina, Florida and Mississippi. The day after our wedding we took a drive to Scenic Drive, El Paso. Everyone was amazed and thrilled to experience such a beautiful sight. Thank you for keeping",
          "Such an awesome view overlooking the city. Just a bit crowded but worth the effort. Limited parking spaces and lots of cars",
          "If you are in El Paso, make sure you take the time to drive up to the overlook. Parking can be very limited, especially around sunset, so you might need to go early if you want a parking spot. The view is phenomenal, overlooking most of El Paso and Juarez. A must see!",
          "The first time I stood at the Overlook I was blown away by how much I could see of the surrounding area, including El Paso, clear into Juarez and the dramatic Sierras surrounding the Valley. The Overlook can be reached from the East and West of El Paso along a narrow but very",
          "One of our local El Paso buddies recommend driving up for this and said the views were pretty good. He lied they were great. Wonderful view of El Paso and Juarez...truly gives you a full appreciation of how large and spread out the 2 cities are. If you can I'd recommend a day",
          "Beautiful views of the city best seen at dusk. Prepare for the heat May thru early September. Well worth the sweltering heat you will experience for the views of two cities in two countries.",
          "We took a brief drive on the scenic route. It was nice to see some of the luxury homes of El Paso as well as a mountain view above the city. Passed the police academy.",

          "It was a fascinating experience trying to identity the land marks from above the hill. Really scenic and interesting drive.",
          "Nothing like going to the high spot for the best view in town. Super nice and you see, of course, into Mexico and the Rio Grande. Windy drive is fun. Highly recommend this for as part of your tour.",
          "This is a great place to go to get a panoramic view of the El Paso metro area. You can see for miles, including across the Rio Grande into Ciudad Juarez. The mountains are scenic in a rugged and arid way (it's a desert, after all), and one can see just how large the metro area",
          "Highly recommended if you\u2019re in El Paso. It\u2019s a minimal time investment, free, and will give you the opportunity to see the city panoramas from incredible heights.",
          "Located in El Paso, at the top of the Franklin Mountains, the highest mountains in Texas. You may easily see Mexico, and Ciudad Juarez. Is a must if you are visiting El Paso Texas.",

          "The El Paso Scenic Park Drive is a worthwhile drive for the first time visitor to get a nice view of El Paso and Juarez. But the drive is used by the city folks as a commuting route, and they drive too fast for the first time visitor. Limited parking is available at the",

          "Go at sunset and then stay for the night lights of El Paso and old Mexico, you will not be disappointed .",
          "I thought it was an excellent place to take in views of the city. It is not high enough to cause altitude issues and the looking glass meeters help zoom in on places of interest. It is a short drive with a decent stopping point. It wasn't too crowded when I was there but told it",

          "Over 100 years old and improved dramatically by the Civilian Corp in the 1930s. There are several overlooks which are engaging. And it is a fun drive getting there. This is a must do while you are in El Paso. Free. If this review is helpful then please indicate so below.",
          "Took a drive on the scenic road and stopped at the top to take in the views and take photos. Many upscale homes on end portion of road. Worth a trip if you are nearby. Would not detour for it",

          "Great view of the City and beyond. I highly suggest getting there early as parking is limited. It looked like there were two locations to view/Park, we skipped the smaller one and found a parking spot further up. Photographers will love the vantage point at Dusk/Dawn.",
          "We managed to park the RV at the top of the drive. On the way up you pass some beautiful properties, and many laying against the backdrop. It wasn\u2019t busy when we were there, and I should image parking etc. Is trickier in tourist season. You can get some great photos from the",

          "This border city hasn't much to offer to tourists so we found this great view point the best attraction here. We came from northwest so this overlook was our first encounter with El Paso. It's easy to find, you have signs along the way and once there, several parking places. The",
          "Don't miss this especially at night. The star on the mountain shines bright every night in the honor or memory of someone special. It was lit on the 27th in memory of my 21 year old grandson who passed on the 27th of January 2018. Check it out you won't be sorry.",

          "El Paso is a difficult city to navigate (I am used to cities laid out on a grid), and on the streets I couldn\u2019t figure out which way to the Rio Grande. The birds-eye view from the overlook provided the necessary perspective. Great views.",
          "This was an easy drive from the city. The two times we drove up we were lucky to find not many cars as the parking is limited. It was just a little hazy but spectacular view of downtown and into Mexico. The road has stone guardrails so not too scary despite the steep climb.",
          "We drove to the \u201cScenic Drive\u201d at zip code 79902. It was easy to find with satnav and there is free parking at the best viewpoint. The day we were there was a little hazy, but we could easily see the US/Mexico border - the Rio Grande river. A sign points to the section of the",

          "We were at first a bit put off by all the roadworks around the Route here but we were pleased we persisted as the view is wonderful. There are a coup of places to pull in to and some explanation of what you are looking at. The day was clear so we had a good view of the cities",
          "If traveling to/through El Paso, this vantage point offers a more culturally significant vista than its better-known counterpart --- the Four Corners of New Mexico. While Four Corners defines the juncture of northern New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah, scenic drive provides",
          "What can be said...the road is a nice short drive over the mountain to the West side where nicer homes can be seen. Any of the pull offs offer a view of an average city and Mexico...not much to see.",
          "We had several hours to spend in El Paso and tried hard to find how to fill our time. The scenic drive was suggested so we did drive there but honestly? It is not really that much of an attraction. Perhaps it gives people a nostalgic look at a city in Texas and its twin city in",

          "Not sure if I would consider this scenic, but it does offer views of the city and Mexico. It was shorted than anticipated as well. Probably a ten minute drive. Don't get me wrong it was still enjoyable, just dont expect a nice long drive. I would suggest the 375 loop as a more",
          "This is definitely one of the best views of El Paso. The small site has several informative signs detailing the geography and history of the area. The surrounding landscape is very cool. Even on a hot day, it\u2019s a nice view. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s wonderful at night.",

          "Scenic Drive, like the Ariel Tram, has certainly changed. There are more pull offs for people to view different parts of the city and area. The lookout point is still there and very pet friendly with doggie bags available to remove unwanted litter. The drive is easy and the",

          "A lot of construction detours made it difficult to get to. But worth the challenge. We stopped at an observatory park along the way that was a nice quick stretch of the legs. Great view of the city, river, and Juarez.",
          "whenever we go to El Paso, I make it a point to go to scenic drive, kind of a short cut to get to either side of El Paso, The Northeast side is where I grew up attended grade school when EP was a small town, then in High Shool (Andress) when it was getting much bigger and now",

          "Absolutely gorgeous view! So glad we got to stop and hang out for a bit. My son(10) loved the view and my daughter (3) loved running around in the grassy area.",
          "Stumbled upon this by mistake, as I was on my way to eat at Kiki's and saw a sign that said Scenic Drive. Glad I took the detour. A very narrow road and at times my knuckles turned white, but was well worth the trip over and back. There are several points where you can stop",

          "I lived in El Paso a long time ago and they didn't have this option then, but I loved seeing this as new scenic drive for the first time and letting people see the views not only on the El Paso side but on the New Mexico/ Mexico side. Breathtaking views and scenery at sunrise",

          "I am originally from El Paso so I naturally love my hometown. The views from Scenic drive can range from just okay to break taking. Catching Scenic drive in the evening before sunset is the best in my opinion. I was in El Paso for Christmas and was able to capture these",

          "I've gone on scenic drive a few times, and each time, I always enjoy the views of the city and borderland. While it's not much of a cityscape, it still an amazing view. Downside is that the roads are narrow, dangerously shared with bicyclists, and limited on parking. Especially",

          "Amazing view at dusk. Minus the people smoking weed and playing loud music, this place is awesome to hang out at. I enjoyed the 10 minutes I spent walking around here with my friends. Probably wouldn't go if someone else wasn't driving, but it seemed to be worth the trip.",

          "The drive to the top of the mountain (part of the Franklin Mountains) is twisty and steep so go slow. When you get to the scenic overlook you'll see it is worth the effort it took to get there. There are several informative plaques but the real star is the view. Visit at",

          "This was a nice side trip that didn't take too long as we drove through El Paso. The route going up from the east as provided by Google Maps had a lot of streets closed due to construction but it was easy to navigate around the closed streets. We went during the afternoon",
          "We always drive this road with visitors to El Paso. It's free and offers a great view of the Rio Grande Valley, El Paso and Juarez Mexico. You can also plan to do this drive in the evening to see the city lights below and the international border outlined. Rim road passes",

          "Definitely take this drive, the views are amazing, the road is in excellent shape. The road takes you into the mountains, which are mostly rocky giving it a surreal look. Although I'm sure that the night views of the city from the mountain must be spectacular, try to take this",

          "El Paso's scenic drive is a very nice and enjoyable drive right by the mountains. the drive has many twists and turns through the road, so if you get car sick i probably would not recommend it. However it is a great view of the city as well as Juarez, Mexico. plenty of stop",

          "Note that when I went (Mar. 2017) the scenic road to the overlook was being repaired and closed, but there as a workaround if you get off on Virginia Street and head up that way. Well worth it as you get to a nicely developed overlook with telescopes and descriptive placards.",

        "wiki": "Samuel Pack Elliott (born August 9, 1944) is an American actor. His accolades include an Academy Award nomination, two Golden Globe Award nominations, two Primetime Emmy Award nominations, and a National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor.\nElliott is known for his distinctive lanky physique, full mustache, and deep, resonant voice. He began his film career with minor appearances in The Way West (1967) and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), and guest-starred on television in the Western Gunsmoke (1972) and the television films Murder in Texas (1981) and The Shadow Riders (1982). His film breakthrough was in the drama Lifeguard (1976). He then appeared in several Louis L'Amour adaptations such as The Quick and the Dead (1987) and Conagher (1991), the latter of which earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor \u2013 Miniseries or Television Film. He received his second Golden Globe and first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Buffalo Girls (1995). Other film credits from the early 1990s include as John Buford in the historical drama Gettysburg (1993) and as Virgil Earp in the Western Tombstone (also 1993).\nIn the 2000s, Elliott appeared in supporting roles in the drama We Were Soldiers (2002), and the action films Hulk (2003), and Ghost Rider (2007). In 2015, he guest-starred on the series Justified, which earned him a Critics' Choice Television Award, and in 2016 began starring in the Netflix series The Ranch. He subsequently had a lead role in the comedy-drama The Hero (2017). The following year, Elliott was cast in the musical drama A Star Is Born (2018), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Critics' Choice Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award and won a National Board of Review Award.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nSamuel Pack Elliott was born August 9, 1944 in Sacramento, California, the son of Glynn Mamie (n\u00e9e Sparks), a physical training instructor and high school teacher, and Henry Nelson Elliott, who worked as a predator control specialist for the Department of the Interior. His parents were originally from El Paso, Texas, and Elliott has an ancestor who served as a surgeon at the Battle of San Jacinto. He moved from California to Portland, Oregon, with his family when he was 13 years old.Elliott spent his teenage years living in northeast Portland, and graduated from David Douglas High School in 1962. After graduating from high school, Elliott attended college at the University of Oregon as an English and psychology major for two terms before dropping out. He returned to Portland and attended Clark College in nearby Vancouver, Washington, where he completed a two-year program and was cast as Big Jule, one of the leads, in a stage production of Guys and Dolls. The Vancouver Columbian newspaper suggested that Elliott should be a professional actor. After his graduation from Clark in 1965, Elliott re-enrolled at the University of Oregon and pledged at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He dropped out again before completing his studies after his father died  of a heart attack.In the late 1960s, Elliott relocated to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting, which his father had dissuaded him from doing, instead urging him to obtain a college degree. \"He gave me that proverbial line, \u2018You\u2019ve got a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of having a career in (Hollywood),\u2019\" Elliott recalled. \"He was a realist, my dad. He was a hard worker. He had a work ethic that I\u2019ve fashioned mine after, and I thank him for that every day.\" Elliott worked in construction while studying acting and served in the California Air National Guard's 146th Airlift Wing (the Hollywood Guard) at Van Nuys Airport before the unit moved to Channel Islands Air National Guard Station.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early work ===\n\nElliott began his career as a character actor; his appearance, voice, and bearing were well-suited to Westerns. In 1969, he earned his first television credit as Dan Kenyon in Judd for the Defense in the episode \"The Crystal Maze\".\nThat same year he appeared in the show Lancer in the episode \"Death Bait\", playing Renslo. He went on to appear in two additional episodes of the series between 1970 and 1971. One of his early film roles was as a card player in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). In the 1970\u20131971 television season, Elliott starred as Doug Robert for several episodes in the hit series Mission: Impossible. In 1975, Elliott was cast in a lead role as Charles Wood in the television film I Will Fight No More Forever, a dramatization of Chief Joseph's resistance to the U.S. government's forcible removal of his Nez Perce Indian tribe to a reservation in Idaho.From 1976 to 1977, he played the lead character Sam Damon in the miniseries Once an Eagle, an adaptation of the Anton Myrer novel of the same name, opposite Amy Irving, Kim Hunter, Clu Gulager, and Melanie Griffith. He also had a starring role as Rick Carlson in the summer sleeper hit Lifeguard (1976), which marked his feature film breakthrough. In the film, he portrayed a lifeguard in Southern California who reevaluates his life choices after being invited to a reunion. Variety deemed the film \"unsatisfying,\" adding: \"Elliott, who has some beefcake value, projects a character who is mostly a passive reactor rather than a person in sure command of his fate.\"\n\n\n=== Recognition as a character actor ===\n\nElliott played Tom Keating in the miniseries Aspen in 1977. He later played an abusive wife-killer in the miniseries Murder in Texas (1981) opposite Farrah Fawcett and his future wife Katharine Ross, and starred with Cheryl Ladd in A Death in California (1985). In 1979, he co-starred with Tom Selleck in the popular miniseries adaptation of Louis L'Amour's The Sacketts. Elliot and Selleck teamed again in 1982 in The Shadow Riders, another Louis L'Amour adaption.Elliott had a supporting role in Mask (1985) opposite Cher, and he played a sympathetic father figure in the Christmas film Prancer (1989). He has made guest appearances on shows such as Felony Squad, Gunsmoke, Lancer, and Hawaii Five-O, and has been featured in many TV movies, including Buffalo Girls (1995), in which he played Wild Bill Hickok.\nIn 1986, he starred in TV movie Gone to Texas, based on a biography of Sam Houston. The role allowed him to play Houston as both fighter and a man who grew into a skillful political leader; the film depicted his disgrace as governor of Tennessee, his return to his Cherokee Nation friends, and his pivotal role in the liberation of Texas from Mexico in 1836. Elliott played Wade Garrett in Road House (1989). In 1991, Elliott and his wife Katharine Ross starred in the adaptation of the Louis L'Amour novel Conagher (1991).He portrayed General John Buford in the 1993 historical drama Gettysburg, and the same year played Virgil Earp in the Western Tombstone (1993).  Elliott played The Stranger, a character narrating the story of The Big Lebowski (1998). He subsequently co-starred in We Were Soldiers (2002), an adaptation of We Were Soldiers Once\u2026 And Young, in which he portrayed Basil L. Plumley. He then played General Thunderbolt Ross in the 2003 action film Hulk.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nIn 2005, he appeared in Thank You for Smoking as a former Marlboro Man advertisement cowboy who has developed lung cancer.

He has appeared three times on Parks and Recreation as Ron Dunn, the Eagleton equivalent of Ron Swanson; Dunn is a hippie, compared to Swanson's staunch survivalist and Libertarian personality.

In film, Elliott supplied the voice of Butch in the animated film The Good Dinosaur (2015).In 2017, Elliott starred in The Hero, as Lee Hayden, an aging Western icon with a golden voice, whose best performances are decades behind him.

The Hero encapsulates everything you love about him into one package.\" Later that year, Elliot starred in The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot.The following year, Elliot costarred in A Star Is Born (2018), in which he plays Bobby Maine, the elder half-brother of Bradley Cooper's lead character. Elliott received critical acclaim for his performance, winning the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor. He was also nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role, as well as the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor,  his career-first nomination. Commenting on his Academy Award nomination, Elliot declared \"I think the thing off the top of my head might be, 'It\u2019s about fucking time!'\"\n\n\n== Other ventures ==\nIn 1998, Elliott was named the grand marshal of the Calgary Stampede parade and rode in the procession before an estimated 300,000 spectators.\n\n\n=== Voice work ===\nElliott has performed voice-over narration for various commercials. He has lent his voice to campaigns for Dodge, IBM, Kinney Drugs, Union Pacific, and, most notably, the American Beef Council, succeeding Robert Mitchum in the latter. Since late 2007, Elliott has done voice-overs for Coors beer, bringing his deep, rich voice and \"western\" appeal to the brand brewed in Colorado. In 2010, Ram Trucks hired Elliott to do the voice-over for their Ram Heavy Duty truck commercial; he has been voicing their commercials since. Starting in 2008, he has voiced Smokey Bear, and shares the mascot's birth date (August 9, 1944).

Ross starred in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, in which Elliott had a very small role (though no scenes with Ross) in 1969, but the two did not meet again and begin dating until 1978, when they both starred in The Legacy. They have a daughter, Cleo Rose Elliott (born September 17, 1984), who is now a musician in Malibu, California. Ross and Elliott live on a seaside ranch in Malibu, which they purchased in the 1970s. Elliott also maintains a property in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Following his mother's death in 2012 at the age of 96, he also took ownership of his childhood home in northeast Portland.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSam Elliott on IMDb\nSam Elliott at the TCM Movie Database\nHajek, Daniel (September 6, 2015). \"Typecast as a Cowboy, Sam Elliott Came to Embrace That 'Western Box'\".

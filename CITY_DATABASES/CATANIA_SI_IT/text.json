        "wiki": "Vincenzo Salvatore Carmelo Francesco Bellini (Italian: [vin\u02c8t\u0283\u025bntso salva\u02c8to\u02d0re kar\u02c8m\u025b\u02d0lo fran\u02c8t\u0283esko bel\u02c8li\u02d0ni] (listen); 3 November 1801 \u2013 23 September 1835) was an Italian opera composer, who was known for his long-flowing melodic lines for which he was named \"the Swan of Catania\". \nMany years later, in 1898, Giuseppe Verdi \"praised the broad curves of Bellini's melody: 'there are extremely long melodies as no-one else had ever made before'.\"A large amount of what is known about Bellini's life and his activities comes from surviving letters\u2014except for a short period\u2014which were written over his lifetime to his friend Francesco Florimo, whom he had met as a fellow student in Naples and with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. Other sources of information come from correspondence saved by other friends and business acquaintances.\nBellini was the quintessential composer of the Italian bel canto era of the early 19th century, and his work has been summed up by the London critic Tim Ashley as:\n\n... also hugely influential, as much admired by other composers as he was by the public. Verdi raved about his \"long, long, long melodies such as no one before had written\" Wagner, who rarely liked anyone but himself, was spellbound by Bellini's almost uncanny ability to match music with text and psychology. Liszt and Chopin professed themselves fans. Of the 19th-century giants, only Berlioz demurred. Those musicologists who consider Bellini to be merely a melancholic tunesmith are now in the minority.In considering which of his operas can be seen to be his greatest successes over the almost two hundred years since his death, Il pirata laid much of the groundwork in 1827, achieving very early recognition in comparison to Donizetti's having written thirty operas before his major 1830 triumph with Anna Bolena. Both I Capuleti ed i Montecchi at La Fenice in 1830 and La sonnambula in Milan in 1831 reached new triumphal heights, although initially Norma, given at La Scala in 1831 did not fare as well until later performances elsewhere. \"The genuine triumph\" of I puritani in January 1835 in Paris capped a significant career. Certainly, Il pirata, Capuleti, La sonnambula, Norma, and I puritani are regularly performed today.After his initial success in Naples, most of the rest of his short life was spent outside of both Sicily  and Naples, those years being followed with his living and composing in Milan and Northern Italy, and\u2014after a visit to London\u2014then came his final masterpiece in Paris, I puritani. Only nine months later, Bellini died in Puteaux, France at the age of 33.\n\n\n== Catania: early life ==\n\nBorn in Catania, at the time part of the Kingdom of Sicily, the eldest of seven children in the family, he became a child prodigy within a highly musical family. His grandfather, Vincenzo Tobia Bellini, had studied at the conservatory in Naples and, in Catania from 1767 forward, had been an organist and teacher, as had Vincenzo's father, Rosario.An anonymous twelve-page hand-written history, held in Catania's Museo Belliniano, states that he could sing an aria by Valentino Fioravanti at eighteen months, that he began studying music theory at two years of age and the piano at three. By the age of five, he could apparently play \"marvelously\". The document states that Bellini's first five pieces were composed when he was just six years old and \"at seven he was taught Latin, modern languages, rhetoric, and philosophy\". Bellini's biographer Herbert Weinstock regards some of these accounts as no more than myths, not being supported from other, more reliable sources. Additionally, he makes the point in regard to Bellini's apparent knowledge of languages and philosophy: \"Bellini never became a well-educated man\".One critic, Stellios Galatopoulos, deliberates the \"facts\" presented in the pr\u00e9cis, but also provides a reliable source for these compositions, Galatopoulos expresses some skepticism regarding the young Bellini's child prodigy status.After 1816, Bellini began living with his grandfather, from whom he received his first music lessons. Soon after, the young composer began to write compositions. Among them were the nine Versetti da cantarsi il Venerdi Santo, eight of which were based on texts by Metastasio.\nBy 1818 Bellini had independently completed several additional orchestral pieces and at least two settings of the Mass Ordinary: one in D Major, the other in G Major, both of which survive and have been commercially recorded. \nHe was ready for further study. For well-off students, this would include moving to Naples. While his family wasn't wealthy enough to support that lifestyle, Bellini's growing reputation could not be overlooked.  His break came when Stefano Notabartolo, the duca di San Martino e Montalbo and his duchess, became the new intendente of the province of Catania. They encouraged the young man to petition the city fathers for a stipend to support his musical studies. This was successfully achieved in May 1819 with unanimous agreement for a four-year pension to allow him to study at the Real Collegio di Musica di San Sebastiano in Naples. Thus, he left Catania in July carrying letters of introduction to several powerful individuals, including Giovanni Carafa who was the intendente of the Real Collegio as well as being in charge of the city's royal theatres. The young Bellini was to live in Naples for the following eight years.\n\n\n== Naples: musical education ==\n\nThe Conservatorio di San Sebastiano (as it had been named when the original Real Collegio di Musica,  established in 1806 and then renamed as such in 1808) had moved to more spacious facilities close to the church of Ges\u00f9 Novo and the building formerly occupied by the nuns of San Sabastiano, was run by the government and there, students, who wore a semi-military uniform, were obliged to live under a tight daily regimen of classes in principal subjects, in singing and instrumental coaching, plus basic education.  Their days were long, going from early morning mass at 5:15 am to finally ending by 10 pm. Although beyond the normal age for admission, Bellini had submitted ten pieces of music for consideration; these clearly demonstrated his talent, although he did need to do remedial work to correct some of his faulty technique.\nThe focus of study was on the masters of the Neapolitan school and the orchestral works of Haydn and Mozart, with the emphasis put upon the Italian classical era composers such as Pergolesi and Paisiello, rather than the \"modern-day\" approaches of composers such as Rossini. The young student's first teacher was Giovanni Furno, with whom \"he studied exercises in harmony and accompaniment\"; another, from whom he learned counterpoint, was the composer of over 50 operas, Giacomo Tritto, but whom he found to be \"old fashioned and doctrinaire\".  However, the artistic director of the school was the opera composer, Niccol\u00f2 Antonio Zingarelli.By 1822/23, Bellini had become a member of a class which he taught: the older man appears to have recognised Bellini's potential and treated his student like a son, giving him some firm advice:\n\nIf your compositions \"sing\", your music will most certainly please. ... Therefore, if you train your heart to give you melody and then you set it forth as simply as possible, your success will be assured. You will become a composer. Otherwise, you will end up being a good organist in some village.It was during these early years at the Collegio that Bellini met Francesco Florimo with whom he had a lifetime of correspondence. Other fellow students\u2014who were to become opera composers\u2014included Francesco Stabile and the Ricci brothers\u2014Luigi and Federico\u2014as well as Saverio Mercadante who, by this time, was a graduate student.\nAnother person to whom the young student/composer was introduced was Gaetano Donizetti whose ninth opera\u2014which had been a  great success in Rome\u2014was given at the Teatro di San Carlo. About 50 years later, Florimo gave an account of the meeting of the two men: \"Carlo Conti [one of Bellini's tutors] said to Bellini and me, \"Go and hear Donizetti's La zingara, for which my admiration increases at every performance.\"  After hearing the opera, Bellini acquired the score, convinced Conti to introduce him, and [Florimo] reports that Bellini's reaction was that he was \"a truly beautiful, big man, and his noble countenance\u2014sweet, but at the same time majestic\u2014arouses affection as well as respect.\"\n\n\n==== First Naples compositions ====\nIncreasingly, Bellini did better and better in his studies: in January 1820 he passed his examinations in\ntheory, and was successful enough to gain an annual scholarship, which meant that his stipend from Catania could be used to help his family. In the following January he was equally successful and, to fulfill his obligations to write music for Catania \u2014 a condition of his scholarship \u2014 he sent a Messa di Gloria in A Minor for soloists, choir and orchestra, which was performed the following October. \nBesides this melodious work, his output from these study years in Naples included two other settings of the Mass: a full Ordinary in E Minor and a second full Ordinary in G Minor, both of which probably date from 1823. There are two settings of the Salve regina (one in A Major for choir and orchestra, the other in F Minor for solo voice and piano), but these are less accomplished and may date from the first year of study after leaving Catania, 1820. His brief two-movement Oboe Concerto in E-flat from 1823 also survives and has been recorded by no less than the Berlin Philharmonic.Bellini's involvement in Zingarelli's class took place over the 1822/23 school year. By January 1824, after passing examinations in which he did well, he attained the title primo maestrino, requiring him to tutor younger students and allowing him a room of his own in the collegio and visits to the Teatro di San Carlo on Thursdays and Sundays, where he saw his first opera by Rossini, Semiramide. While Weinstock gives an account of how he was \"clearly captivated by the music of Rossini [and] put Rossini on a pedestal\", he relates that, returning from Semiramide Bellini was unusually quiet and then \"suddenly exclaimed to his companions, 'Do you know what I think? After Semiramide, it's futile for us to try and achieve anything!'\"But a tougher challenge confronted the young composer: how to win the hand of young Maddalena Fumarolis, whom he had met as a guest in her home and to whom he had become music tutor. As their affair became obvious to her parents, they were forbidden to see each other. Bellini was determined to obtain the parents' permission for them to marry, and some writers regard this as the propelling reason for his writing his first opera.\n\n\n==== Adelson e Salvini ====\nThe impetus to write this opera came about in late summer of 1824, when his primo maestrino status at the conservatory resulted in an assignment to compose an opera for presentation in the institute's teatrino. This became Adelson e Salvini, an opera semi-seria (half-serious) to a libretto by the Neapolitan Andrea Leone Tottola, who had written the one for Donizetti's La zingara. Adelson was first given sometime between mid-January and mid-March 1825, and featured an all-male cast of fellow students. It proved to be so popular among the student body that it was performed every Sunday for a year. \nWith that achievement behind him, it is believed that the young Bellini, who had been away from home for six years, set out for Catania to visit his family.  However, some sources attribute the visit to 1824, others to 1825. However, it is known that he was back in Naples by the summer or early autumn of 1825 in order to fulfill a contract to write an opera for the San Carlo or one of the other royal theatres, the Teatro Fondo.\n\n\n== Beginnings of a career ==\n\nFollowing the presentation of Adelson e Salvini and while he was in Milan, Bellini\u2014requesting help from Florio\u2014began to make some revisions, expanding the opera to two acts in the hope that it might be given stagings by Domenico Barbaja, the Intendant at the Teato di San Carlo since 1809.  But little is known about exactly how much Bellini or Florimo contributed to the revisions, and Weinstock asserts that no performances were ever given after 1825, but in March 1829, we find Bellini writing to Florimo that \"I have written you the changes that you should make in Adelson \".In the summer or early autumn of 1825 Bellini began work on what was to become his first professionally produced opera. A contract between the Conservatory and the royal theatres obliged the Conservatory\u2014when it nominated a sufficiently talented student\u2014to require that student to write a cantata or one-act opera to be presented on a gala evening in one of the theatres.  After  Zingarelli used his influence to secure this honour for his promising student, Bellini was able to obtain agreement that he could write a full-length opera and, furthermore, that the libretto did not have to be written by Tottola, the theatres' official dramatic poet. However, as Intendant of the San Carlo, \"Barbaja was the chief beneficiary: 'With a small investment he found among those young men the one who would lead him to large profits'\" notes Florimo.\n\n\n==== Bianca e Gernando ====\nThe young composer chose Domenico Gilardoni, a young writer who then prepared his first libretto, which he named Bianca e Fernando, based on an 1820 play, Bianca e Fernando alla tomba di Carlo IV, Duca d'Agrigento and set in Sicily.\nHowever, the title Bianca e Fernando had to be changed, because Ferdinando was the name of the heir to the throne, and no form of it could be used on a royal stage. After some delays caused by King Francesco I forcing postponement, the opera\u2014now named Bianca e Gernando\u2014was given its premiere performance at the Teatro di San Carlo on 30 May 1826, Prince Ferdinando's name day.\nIt was very successful, helped by the approval of the King, who broke the custom of there being no applause at a performance attended by royalty. It was also attended by Donizetti who enthusiastically wrote to Mayr: \"It is beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, especially as it is his first opera.\"\nBellini's music was highly regarded, with the Giornale delle Due Sicilie on 13 June noting that \"[several of the arias and duets] are some of the most laudable pieces of new music heard in recent times at the [San Carlo].\" However, there were reservations about Gilardoni's contribution.\nWithin nine months, in February/March 1827, Domenico Barbaja  offered Bellini a commission for an opera to be presented in the autumn of 1827 at La Scala in Milan, of which between 1821 and 1832, Barbaja was also part of the management.\n\n\n== Northern Italy ==\n\nBellini spent 1827 to 1833 mostly in Milan, never holding any official position within an opera company and living solely from the income produced from his compositions, for which he was able to ask higher than usual fees.\nUpon his arrival, he met Antonio Villa of La Scala and composer Saverio Mercadante whose new opera, Il Montanaro was in rehearsal.  The latter introduced him to Francesco and Marianna Pollini (an older couple, the husband a retired professor of piano, the wife a better-than-amateur musician) who immediately took the young man under their wing.\nIn addition, Bellini was introduced to the librettist Felice Romani, who proposed the subject of the composer\u2019s first project, Il pirata, to which the young man willingly agreed especially when he realised that the story \"provided several passionate and dramatic situations.. [and]..that such Romantic characters were then an innovation on the operatic stage.\" A strong professional relationship with Romani began from that time; he became Bellini\u2019s primary creative partner, providing the libretti for six of Bellini\u2019s operas which followed, in addition to about 100 libretti written for the major composers of the day, up to and including Verdi. As has been observed, \"no other Italian opera composer of the time showed such an attachment to a single librettist\" and although Romani was known to treat composers poorly, he evidently had great respect for Bellini, even acceding to his requests for revisions. For his part, Bellini admired \"the sonorous and elegance of the poet's verses\"While in Milan, \"[Bellini] quickly gained an entr\u00e9e into higher social circles\", although he also stayed for months at a time with friends, the Cant\u00f9 and the Turina families. It was with Giuditta Turina that he began an affair in 1828 during the premiere performances of Bianca e Fernando in Genoa.\nThe four years in Northern Italy between 1827 and 1831 produced four great masterpieces, Il pirata,\nI Capuleti e i Montecchi, La sonnambula, and Norma, along with a revival and a setback.\n\n\n==== Il pirata for Milan ====\nThe collaboration with Romani on Il pirata began in May 1827 and, by August, the music was being written. By then, the composer was aware that he was to write music for his favourite tenor Giovanni Battista Rubini and the soprano was to be Henriette M\u00e9ric-Lalande. Both singers had starred in Bianca in the original 1826 production. The strong cast also included Antonio Tamburini, a major bass-baritone of the time. But rehearsals did not progress without some difficulties, as both Weinstock and Galatopoulos recount: it appears that Bellini found Rubini, while singing beautifully, to be lacking  expressiveness: he was urged to \"throw yourself with all your sole into the character you are representing\" and to use [your] body, \"to accompany your singing with gestures\", as well as to act with [your] voice. It appears that Bellini's exhortations bore fruit, based on his own account of the audience's reactions to the first performance, as well as the reaction of the Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano of 2 December which noted that this opera \"introduced us to Rubini's dual personality as a singer and actor\". The reviewer continued to declare that this duality had never been expressed in other operas in which he had performed.The premiere, given on 17 October 1827, was \"an immediate and then an increasing, success. By Sunday, December 2, when the season ended, it had been sung to fifteen full houses\".\nFor Rubini, \"it marked the defining performance for the tenor\", and the newspaper reviews which followed all agreed with the composer's own assessment.After its Milanese debut, the opera received very successful performances in Vienna in February 1828 and also in Naples three months later. Both productions starred Rubini, Tamburini, and\u2014in the role of Imogene\u2014Rubini's wife, Adelaide Comelli-Rubini, about whom Bellini had initial misgivings, although it appears that she acquitted herself very well. By this time, Bellini had begun to achieve international fame.\n\n\n==== Bianca revised ====\nAfter Il pirata, Bellini remained in Milan with the hope of securing another commission. One came from Genoa via Bartolomeo Merelli on 13 January 1828 for a new opera for presentation on 7 April. However, without knowing which singers would be engaged, he was unwilling to commit at that time, but remained in hope of something definite from La Scala for the autumn. When no alternatives appeared, he accepted Genoa's offer in February, but it was then too late to write anything new. He immediately proposed a revival and re-working of Bianca e Gernando, this time with the original title Bianca e Fernando, there being no royal by the name of Fernando in the House of Savoy. Romani wrote to Florimo in Naples and told him that he had taken on the re-construction of the libretto, with the result that \"out of the whole of Bianca, the only pieces entirely unchanged are the big duet and the romanza; everything else is altered, and about half of it is new\", Bellini then re-arranged the music to suit the singers' voices, now knowing that the Bianca was to be Adelaide Tosi and the Fernando to be Giovanni David.\nAs Bellini reports, he had problems with Tosi wanting changes to be made to a cavatina and a stretta in one scene, but he stuck to his own opinion, proving to be correct when he reported the audience's reaction to Florimo: \"the public was very happy with the entire opera, particularly with the second act\". Overall, the first performance was even greater than it had been in Naples, and the opera was given a total of 21 times. However, critical reaction was not as positive as that of the audience: \"The second act is a long bore\" stated L'Eco di Milano, although the Gazzetta di Genova was more helpful, noting \"the more we listen to the style of the music, the more we appreciate its merit\".\n\n\n==== After Bianca ====\nBellini remained in Genoa until 30 April and then returned to Milan, but with no specific opportunity in place. His initial opposition to Comelli-Rubini being allowed to reprise the role of Imogene in Il pirata for performances in Naples (as she had done in Vienna\u2014but successfully) was proved to be wrong, since she did sing well there and received general approval. But this issue had caused complications in his relationship with Barbaja, who controlled both theatres, and when he visited Milan in June, he offered Bellini the opportunity to choose between Naples and Milan as the venue for his next opera. For the composer, the decision hung on the availability of singers for each of the houses, especially because Rubini was contracted to sing only in Naples. However, by 16 June, he had decided on the location to be Milan, and then signed a contract to write a new opera for the Carnival season for a fee of one thousands ducati, compared to 150 ducati for his first opera.\n\n\n==== La straniera for Milan ====\nFor La straniera, Bellini received a fee which was sufficient for him to be able to make his living solely by composing music, and this new work became an even greater success than Il pirata had been. As for singers, it appears there was some doubt about the tenor, but that Henriette M\u00e9ric-Lalande, Luigi Lablache (or Tamburini), would be available. In consultation with Romani as to the subject, it was agreed that it would be based on the novel L'\u00e9trang\u00e8re (Il solitario) of 1825 by Charles-Victor Pr\u00e9vot, vicomte d'Arlincourt, and planned for the premiere on the opening night of the season on 26 December.\nHowever, by 20 September, Bellini told Florimo that he did not think the performance could take place as scheduled due to Romani being ill. In addition, he was concerned about who would sing the tenor role when  he had been unable to obtain Rubini's release from his Naples contract. Berardo Calvari (known as Winter) was rejected because audiences had disliked him the previous July when he appeared in both a Pacini and a Donizetti opera at La Scala. Fortunately, having received good reports of the young tenor Domenico Reina, he was able to secure his services, describing him in a letter to Florimo as \"one who will want to do himself honour; everyone tells me that his voice is beautiful, and that he has all the acting and spirit one could wish for.\"Following Romani's recovery, the delivery of the libretto arrived piecemeal, but Bellini set to work again; progress was slow. By 7 January 1829, with Romani having recovered and set off for Venice to fulfill a contract, the composer was \"almost up to the 2nd act\". Filippo Cicconetti, in his 1859 biography, gives an account of Bellini's working methods, explaining how he set texts to music always with the words in front of him in order to see how inspired to compose he might become. When it came time to compose the final aria Or sei pago, ol ciel tremendo, the librettist's words gave him no inspiration at all and, at their next meeting, Romani agreed to re-write the text. Returning within half an hour, the second version left Bellini equally cold\u2014as did a third draft. Finally, when asked what it was that he was seeking, Bellini replied: \"I want a thought that will be at one and the same time a prayer, an imprecation, a warning, a delirium ...\". A fourth draft was quickly prepared: \"Have I entered into your spirit?\" asked the librettist\u2014and he was embraced by the young composer.Rehearsals began in early January with the premiere planned for 14 February 1829; it was an immediate and resounding success with the Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano on 16 February declaring it to be a:\n\nclamorous success..[with] the poet [serving] the composer well, and the composer could not have served the singers better; all competed to render themselves pleasing to the public, and succeeded in such a way as to be applauded greatly.Three days later, the same publication praised the quality of the music, describing Bellini as \"a modern Orpheus\" for the beauty of his melodies. Reporting to Romani, who was still in Venice, Bellini gave an account of the success: \"the thing went as we never had imagined it.  We were in seventh heaven.  With [this letter] receive my gratitude more than ever ...\" Others wrote equally enthusiastic reports, with abundant praise being given to the singers as well.  However, there were detractors who criticised both the opera and its composer: its new style and its restless harmonic shifts into remote keys did not please all. 45 years later it was stated that \"Bellini's style was abstruse, discontinuous, distorted, and lacking in distinction, that it alternated among the serio and the buffo and the semi-serio...\"\n\n\n==== Zaira: a setback in Parma ====\n\nZaira was the opera which came into being following discussions with Barbaja in Milan in June 1828 for a second opera for La Scala. At around the same time, Bellini reported to Florimo that he had been approached by Merelli about writing an inaugural opera for the soon-to-be completed Teatro Ducale (now the Teatro Regio) in Parma which was due to open during the following year on 12 May 1829. Initially, the opera was to be Carlo di Borgogna, but composer and librettist decided to tackle \"a drama so ... hallowed as Voltaire's Za\u00efre, but this proved to be more challenging for Romani than first imagined.\nWith this opera, Bellini encountered \"the first serious setback of a hitherto brilliant career\". Several reasons have been put forward: Lippmann and McGuire note, it was because \"Bellini showed too little enthusiasm for the undertaking\". Another writer attributes it to Parma's traditional love of and favouritism towards the music of Rossini, while yet another notes that a combination of the composer being constantly seen in cafes around the city (when it was assumed that he should have been composing) and the fact that Romani had included a long explanation of the difficulties of adapting Voltaire in the printed libretto provided to all operagoers. The librettist was critical of his own work: \"the style should have been more careful, and that here and there, certain repetitions of phrases and concepts should have been edited out\". At the same time, he stated that, with music composed to those verses now in place, \"I was not permitted to go back over what already had been done; and poetry and music were finished in less than a month\". This short period of time compares to the months which, for example, it took Bellini to write Il pirata.\nIn fact, Bellini arrived in Parma on 17 March giving him 56 days before the opening, but he then learned that some of the singers would only arrive 14 days before the date of the premiere, a date that was\u2014in theory\u2014 unchangeable. In fact, it had to be changed due to the inability of Lalande to arrive in time for sufficient rehearsal. Both composer and librettist were somewhat dilatory, delaying work as much and as long as possible. Count Sanvitale's request on 17 April, asking \"to let me know the reasons why our copyists are kept idle\", did not receive much of response to satisfy the theatre's management.  Eventually, both men got down to work and finished on time, although the premiere was delayed by four days.\nThe general impression given by reports in the press was that, overall, the music was weak, although some numbers and the trio were liked. However, for the most part, the singers were applauded, even if the composer received little. The opera received eight performances, followed by some poorly received ones in Florence in 1836, and then it disappeared until 1976.\n\n\n== Major achievements ==\nAfter the poor response in Parma to Zaira, Bellini stayed with Ferdinando and Giuditta Turina's family for a short period in May/June and then returned to Milan by the end of June and discovered that his grandfather, then 85, had died in Catania. No contract for another opera in sight, except for the possibility of working with the Teatro La Fenice in Venice. As is revealed by Herbert Weinstock, there is limited knowledge of what happened to Bellini between June 1833 and February 1834, since no letters to Florimo from that period have survived, and the only sources are those letters sent to others.Giovanni Pacini, another Catanese composer, was still in Milan in late June after the well-received premiere on 10 June of his opera Il Talismano at La Scala, where it went on to receive a total of 16 performances. To Bellini, he appeared to be a rival, and with his recent success, Pacini received offers to compose an opera for both Turin and Venice for the Carnival season. He accepted both offers, but the La Fenice impresario included a proviso that if he were to be unable to fulfill the Venice contract, then it would be transferred to Bellini.\nBellini then became preoccupied with staging a revival of his Il pirata during the summer season at the Teatro Canobbiana because La Scala was closed for repairs. Il Pirata was staged with the original cast and again was a triumph: it received 24 consecutive performances between 16 July and 23 August 1829, thus outnumbering Pacini's.During July and August, the composer Gioachino Rossini visited Milan on his way to Bologna. He saw the Il Pirata production and met Bellini; the two men were taken with each other, to the extent that when the younger composer was in Paris a year or two later, he developed a very strong bond with Rossini.A firm offer of a contract for a new opera for Venice appeared in the autumn, a contract which also included a provision that Il pirata would be given during the Carnival 1830 season. Tearing himself away from dalliances with Mrs. Turina, by mid-December Bellini was in Venice where Giuseppe Persiani's Constantino in Arles was in rehearsal with the same singers who were to perform in Pirata: they were Giuditta Grisi, the tenor Lorenzo Bonfigli, and Giulio Pellegrini.\n\n\n=== I Capuleti e i Montecchi: Venice, March 1830 ===\n\nWith rehearsals for Pirata underway in late December, Bellini was given notice by the La Fenice impresario, Alessandro Lanari, that it was doubtful whether Pacini would be present in time to stage an opera and that a contract was to be prepared with the proviso that it would only become effective on 14 January. Accepting the offer 5 January, Bellini stated that he would set Romani's libretto for Giulietta Capellio, that he required 45 days between receipt of the libretto and the first performance, and that he would accept 325 napoleoni d'oro (about 8,000 lire).The tentative contract deadline was extended until 20 January, but by that date Romani was in Venice, having already re-worked much of his earlier libretto which he had written for Nicola Vaccai's 1825 opera, Giulietta e Romeo, the source for which was the play of the same name by Luigi Scevola which had been written in 1818. The two men set to work, but with the winter weather in Venice becoming increasingly bad, Bellini fell ill; however, he had to continue to work under great pressure within a now-limited timetable. Eventually, revisions to Romani's libretto were agreed to, a new title was given to the work, and Bellini reviewed his score of Zaira to see how some of the music could be set to the new text, but composing the part of Romeo for Grisi. He also took Giulietta\u2019s \"Oh quante volte\" and Nelly\u2019s romanza from Adelson e Salvini. The Giulietta was to be sung by Rosalbina Caradori-Allan.\nAt the premiere of I Capuleti e i Montecchi on 11 March 1830 success for Bellini returned.  Weinstock describes the premiere as \"an unclouded and immediate success\" but it was only able to be performed eight times before the La Fenice season closed on 21 March. A local newspaper, I Teatri, reported that \"all things considered, this opera by Bellini has aroused as much enthusiasm in Venice as La straniera aroused in Milan from the first evening on\".By this time, Bellini knew that he had achieved a degree of fame: writing on 28 March, he stated that:\n\nMy style is now heard in the most important theatres in the world ... and with the greatest enthusiasm.Before leaving Venice, Bellini was offered a contract to produce another new opera for La Fenice for the 1830\u201331 Carnival season, and\u2014upon his return to Milan after a reunion with Turina\u2014he also found an offer from Genoa for a new opera but proposed for the same time period, an offer he was forced to reject.\nLater that year, Bellini prepared a version of Capuleti for La Scala which was given on 26 December, lowering Giulietta\u2019s part for the mezzo-soprano Amalia Sch\u00fctz Oldosi.\n\n\n=== La sonnambula: Milan, March 1831 ===\nReturning to Milan after the Capuleti performances, little occurred until the latter part of April when\nchanges began to appear in the management of La Scala. The organisation, \"Crivelli and Company\" which had managed both that house as well as La Fenice, was negotiating with a triumvirate consisting of Duke Pompeo Litta and two businessmen, their immediate concern being the engagement of singers and composers for La Scala. In order to contract with Bellini, he had to be released from his obligation to Venice; this was achieved by Litta buying out the Venice contract. When Bellini laid out his terms for writing for Milan, Litta gave him a very favourable response: \"I shall earn almost twice as much as if I had composed for Crivelli [then the  Venetian impresario]\" he noted in a letter to his uncle.However, the group led by Duke Litta failed to come to terms with the Crivelli-Lanari-Barbaja group which continued to manage both La Scala and La Fenice.  As a result, in the April\u2013May 1830 period, Bellini was able to negotiate a contract with both the Litta group\u2014which was planning performances in a smaller Milan house, the Teatro Carcano\u2014and with the Crivelli group to obtain a contract for an opera for the autumn of 1831 and another for the 1832 Carnival season.  These were to become Norma for La Scala and Beatrice di Tenda for La Fenice.Bellini then experienced the re-occurrence of an illness which had emerged in Venice due to pressure of work and the bad weather, but which consistently recurred after each opera and which would eventually cause his death. The gastro-enteric condition\u2014which he describes as \"a tremendous inflammatory gastric bilious fever\"\u2014 resulted in his being cared for by Francesco Pollini and his wife at their home because, as Bellini wrote, \"he loves me more than a son\".Having recovered from his illness by the summer, Bellini went to stay near Lake Como. The need to decide on the subject for the following winter's opera became pressing, although it had already been agreed that Giuditta Pasta, who had achieved success in the Teatro Carcano in 1829 and 1830 with in several major operas, would be the principal artist. That she owned a house near Como and would be staying there over the summer was the reason that Romani traveled to meet her and Bellini.\n\n\n==== Attempts to create Ernani ====\nBy 15 July they had decided on an adaptation of Victor Hugo's play, Hernani, although Weinstock speculates as to how this decision could have come about. The play's political subject matter would have been known to the group and they would certainly know of the strict censorship then in existence in Austrian-controlled Lombardy. In addition, it was uncertain as to whether Pasta was interested in singing a trousers role, that of the protagonist, Ernani. While it seems that all three were in agreement, no further progress was made. Romani, who promised to begin the Ernani libretto immediately,  went off to write one for what became Donizetti's Anna Bolena (which opened the Carcano's season in December 1830). Rather than resting, Bellini immediately set off for Bergamo to stage La straniera, then went back to the mountains. But, by the end of November, nothing had been achieved in the way of writing either the libretto or the score of Ernani.On 3 January 1831, a letter from Bellini stated: \"... I am no longer composing Ernani because the subject would have had to undergo some modifications at the hands of the police. ... [Romani] is now writing La sonnambula, ossia I Due Fidanzati Svizzeri. ... It must go on stage on 20 February at the latest.\"\n\n\n==== La sonnambula replaces Ernani ====\nRomani's libretto for La sonnambula was based on a ballet-pantomime by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe and Jean-Pierre Aumer called La somnambule, ou L'arriv\u00e9e d'un nouveau seigneur. With its pastoral setting and story, La sonnambula was to become another triumphant success during Bellini's five years in Milan.\nThe title role of Amina (the sleepwalker) with its high tessitura is renowned for its difficulty, requiring a complete command of trills and florid technique. It was written for Pasta who has been described as a soprano sfogato.\n\n \nThat music which he was beginning to use for Ernani was transferred to La Sonnambula is not in doubt, and as Weinstein comments, \"he was as ready as most other composers of his era to reuse in a new situation musical passages created for a different, earlier one\".The opera's premiere performance took place on 6 March 1831, a little later than the original date, at the Teatro Carcano. Its success was partly due to the differences between Romani's earlier libretti and this one, as well as \"the accumulation of operatic experience which both [Bellini] and Romani had brought to its creation.\" Press reactions were universally positive, as was that of the Russian composer, Mikhail Glinka, who attended and wrote overwhelmingly enthusiastically:\n\nPasta and Rubini sang with the most evident enthusiasm to support their favourite conductor [sic]; the second act the singers themselves wept and carried the audience along with them.After its premiere, the opera was performed in London on 28 July 1831 at the King\u2019s Theatre and in New York on 13 November 1835 at the Park Theatre.During Bellini's lifetime another sfogato, Maria Malibran, was to become a notable exponent of the role.\n\n\n=== Norma: Milan, December 1831 ===\n\nWith La sonnambula successfully behind them, Bellini and Romani began to consider the subject of the opera for which they had been contracted by the Crivelli group for a December 1831 premiere at La Scala and which would mark Giuditta Pasta's debut at that house. By the summer, they had decided upon Norma, ossia L'Infanticidio which was based on the play of the same name, Norma, or The Infanticide by Alexandre Soumet which was being performed in Paris at around that time and which Pasta would have seen.\nFor the roles of Adalgisa and Pollione, La Scala had engaged Giulia Grisi, the sister of Giuditta, and the well-known tenor Domenico Donzelli, who had made a name for himself with Rossini roles, especially that of Otello. He provided Bellini with precise details of his vocal capabilities which were confirmed by a report which Mercadante also provided. By the end of August it appears that Romani had completed a considerable amount of the libretto, enough at least to allow Bellini to begin work, which he certainly did in the first weeks of September as the verses were supplied. He reported in a letter to Pasta on 1 September:\n\nI hope that you will find this subject to your liking. Romani believes it to be very effective, and precisely because of the all-inclusive character for you, which is that of Norma. He will manipulate the situations so that they will not resemble other subjects at all, and he will retouch, even change, the characters to produce more effect, if need be.Pasta's vocal and dramatic ranges were extensive: that March, she had created the very different Bellini role of Amina, the Swiss village maiden, in La sonnambula.\nAs the year progressed, several things appeared which began to disturb the composer. Firstly, an outbreak of cholera had occurred in Austria in July, and concern about its spread to Italy was real, to the point that, by late September, Bellini was writing to Florimo: \"I am composing the opera without any real zeal because I am almost certain that the cholera will arrive in time to close the theatres; but as soon it threatens to come near, I'll leave Milan.\"About this time he had received an offer to compose for the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples and, in return, had imposed some harsh terms, totally objecting to the English soprano Marianna Lewis, \"a donna who is below mediocrity: does not know how to sing, is a sausage on stage ...\"  He continues by stressing the need for a good tenor were he to come to Naples and, in a separate letter to be forwarded by Florimo, tells Principe di Ruffano, then the superintendent of the royal theatres, that he doubts that Barbaja would even agree to the fee already offered to him by La Scala, a total of 2,400 ducati, when he would want 3,000 ducati from Naples for all the additional expenses which he would incur. In a post script, Bellini adds an indignant objection to what he has heard about the proposed casting of Capuleti in Naples. It is clear that he regards Barbaja as an enemy.Norma was completed by about the end of November.  Bellini then had to deal with the issue of piracy in regard to vocal reductions for piano of La sonnambula as published by Casa Ricordi. These scores were then fully orchestrated and sold to unsuspecting opera houses as full orchestral scores. This illegal action caused Bellini to publish a notice in major Italian newspapers putting such \"pirates\" on notice, but Weinstock comments that such attempts to control were not likely to succeed until Italian unification provided laws applicable to the country as a whole.After rehearsals began on 5 December, Pasta baulked at singing the Casta diva in act 1, now one of the most famous arias of the nineteenth century. She felt that it was \"ill adapted to her vocal abilities\", but Bellini was able to persuade her to keep trying for a week, after which she adapted to it and confessed her earlier error.  At the opening night, the opera was received with what Weinstock describes as \"chill indifference\". To Florimo on the night of the premiere, Bellini wrote \"Fiasco! Fiasco! Solemn fiasco!\" and proceed to tell him of the indifference of the audience and how it affected him.In addition, in a letter to his uncle on 28 December, Bellini tries to explain the reasons for the reactions.  As other commentators have also noted, some problems were innate to the structure and content of the opera, while others were external to it. Bellini discusses the tiredness of the singers (after rehearing the entire second on the day of the premiere) as well as noting how certain numbers failed to please\u2014and failed to please the composer as well! But then he explains that most of the second act was very effective. It appears from the letter that the second evening's performance was more successful. Among the external reasons, Bellini cites the adverse reaction caused by the attitudes of both the owner of a journal (and his claque) and also of \"a very rich woman\"\u2014who Weinstock identifies as Contessa Giulia Samoyloff\u2014 who was Pacini's mistress. He also notes that on this second evening, the theatre was full.In all, Norma was given 39 performances in its first season at La Scala, and reports from elsewhere, especially those from Bergamo when performances were given there in late 1832, suggested that it was becoming more and more popular. Bellini left Milan for Naples, and then Sicily, on 5 January 1832, but for the first time since 1827, it was a year in which he did not write an opera.\n\n\n=== Naples, Sicily, Bergamo: January to September 1832 ===\n\nBellini traveled to Naples, although he may have stopped in Rome to see Giuditta Turina and her brother Gaetano Cant\u00f9.  However, the sister and brother also went to Naples where Giuditta was finally able to meet Florimo and see the city in which Bellini had triumphed.  Within six days, Bellini was in Naples where he remained for six weeks.\nDuring that time he remained busy, spending some time with Turina (who was ill for part of it), visiting the conservatory and meeting with many of the students and his old teacher, Zingarelli (to whom he had dedicated Norma), and attending a performance of Capuleti at the San Carlo with Turina and Florimo on 5 February in the presence of King Ferdinand II. The King led the applause for the composer, resulting in his being called to the stage and thus enjoying a very warm welcome from the people of Naples.Planning to leave Naples by 25 February, he dealt with the invitation from Lanari at La Fenice to compose for that house by stating that he would not work for less than the sum received from the last production, and that he was also in discussions with the San Carlo. Arriving in Messina along with Florimo on the morning of 27 February, Bellini was greeted by several members of his family including his father. They remained in Messina for two days, attending a performance of Il pirata at the Teatro della Munizione, where he was greeted with \"loud shouts of pleasure, hand-clapping, and words of praise\".Bellini arrived in Catania on 3 March to a civic welcome. He was greeted by the city's authorities and citizens who also feted him at a concert the following evening.  This included excerpts from La sonnambula and Il pirata at the Teatro Communale, now replaced by the Teatro Massimo Bellini which was opened in 1890 and named in Bellini's honour.  After a month, Bellini and Florimo left for Palermo where, once again, there was a \"royal welcome\" and where he made the acquaintance of Filippo Santocanale and his wife. Although weather delayed their departure for Naples, they continued to spend an enjoyable time there, but Bellini was anxious to return to Naples before Easter and to be with Giuditta Turina, who had remained in that city. They reached Naples on 25 April where he was reunited with Turina.\nUpon his arrival, Bellini wrote to his new friend Santocanale in Palermo, telling him that he would be accepting a contract from La Fenice so the issue had resurfaced in the form of a contract from Lanari which appeared to have accepted  the composer's terms. But he had forgotten how much he had demanded: writing to Giuditta Pasta's husband, Giuseppe, he asked for the letter he had written to him (in which he had revealed the terms offered) to be sent to him to await his arrival in Florence.\n\nWhen returning to Naples, the couple reached Rome on 30 April. There is speculation that, when there, Bellini composed a one-act opera, Il fu ed it sara (The Past and the Present) for a private performance (which was supposedly not given until 1832), but little further information\u2014nor any of the music\u2014has been forthcoming. It appears that the couple (along with Giuditta's brother) left for Florence on or around 20 May traveling by private coach and that he attended what he described as \"a quite unrecognisable\" performance of La sonnumbula at the Teatro della Pergola.  In the same letter, Bellini informed his publisher that:\n\nI have arranged the contract with Lanari to compose the opera for Venice; there I'll have the divine Pasta, and on the same terms as the contract with La Scala for Norma\".He continues by stating that, in addition, he will receive one hundred percent of the rental rights of the scores.\nWithin a few days, Bellini was in Milan, from there writing to his friend Santocanale in Palermo that \"I'm ... trying to find a good subject for my new opera for Venice. In August, I shall go to Bergamo for the production of my Norma with Pasta.\" From Bergamo, he wrote to Romani, excited to tell him that:\n\nOur Norma is decidedly a great success. If you heard how it's performed in Bergamo, you'd almost think that it was a new work ... [Pasta] even moves me.  In fact, I wept [with] the emotions I felt in my soul.  I wanted you near me so that I could have these emotions with you, my good advisor and collaborator, because you alone understand me.  My glory is intrinsic to yours.After the successful production in Bergamo, which was favourably reviewed by the same writer from the Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano who was not enthusiastic about the original Milan production, Bellini spent a few days with Turina, and then, by mid-September, had returned to Milan anxious to meet Romani to decide on the subject for the following February's opera for La Fenice for which a contract had become official. In addition, it had been agreed that the new opera would be preceded by performances of Norma and that they would open the season.\n\n\n=== Beatrice di Tenda: Venice 1833 ===\n\nBeatrice di Tenda, with the leading role requiring a strong female character to be written for Pasta, composer and librettist met to consider a subject. Much of the initial work fell upon Romani, who had to look at a number of possible sources, and he became irritated by the task, finally hoping that a shipment of books from Paris would reveal a suitable one. It appears that by 6 October, a subject had been agreed upon: it would be Cristina regina di Svenzia from a play by Alexander Dumas which had appeared in Paris in 1830. However, by one month later, Bellini was writing to Pasta to state that:\n\"The subject has been changed, and we'll write Beatrice di Tenda [after the play of the same name by Carlo Tedaldi-Fores.] I had a hard time persuading Romani, but persuade him I did, and with good reasons. Knowing that the subject pleases you, as you told me the evening when you saw the ballet [in September 1832 in Milan when it accompanied a Mercadante opera] ... He is a man of good will, and I want him to show it also in wanting to prepare at least the first act for me swiftly.\"Bellini's expectation that Romani's good will would be demonstrated promptly, turned out to be a mistake.  The librettist had vastly over-committed himself: by the time that Cristina became Beatrice, he had made commitments to Mercadante for an October opera; also to Carlo Coccia for an opera for La Scala on 14 February 1833; and further, to Luigi Majocchi for a Parma production on 26 February; to Mercadante for La Scala on 10 March; and to Donizetti for Florence on 17 March. Nothing happened in November; Bellini announced that he would arrive in Venice in early December and after 10th, he became preoccupied with rehearsals for Norma.  However, the lack of any verses\u2014for an opera which was supposed to be staged in the second half of February\u2014caused him to have to take action against Romani.  This involved a complaint lodged with the governor of Venice who then contacted the governor of Milan, who then had his police contact Romani.  The librettist finally arrived in Venice on 1 January 1833.  He holed up to write Bellini's libretto, but, at the same time, Donizetti was equally incensed at delays in  receiving a libretto from Romani for an opera which was to be Parisina.\nWhen Norma opened on 26 December, it was a success but only because of Pasta. The Adalgisa of Anna Del Serre and the Pollione of Alberico Curioni were mediocre; Bellini feared for how Beatrice would turn out. Writing to Santocanale on 12 January, Bellini was in despair, complaining of the short time to write his opera because \"Whose fault is that? that of my usual and original poet, the God of Sloth!\" Their relationship quickly began to deteriorate: greetings including tu (the informal \"you\") gave way to voi (the formal \"you\") and they lived in different parts of Venice. However, by 14 February, Bellini was reporting that he had only \"another three pieces of the opera to do\" and that \"I hope to go onstage here on 6 March if I am able to finish the opera and prepare it.\"As it turned out, Bellini was only able to prepare the opera for rehearsals by deleting sections of the libretto as well as some of the music for the finale. To create more time for Bellini to finish, at La Fenice Lanari padded the programme with older works or revivals, but that allowed only eight days for Beatrice before the scheduled end of the season. Not surprisingly, the audience greeted the opening night on 16 March with little enthusiasm, especially after Romani's plea for \"the reader's full indulgence\" appeared in the libretto, but at the following two performances there was a large crowd. For Bellini, his opera \"was not unworthy of her sisters\".\n\n\n=== The break with Romani ===\n\nThere then began what Herbert Weinstock describes in over twelve pages of text, which include the long letters written by both sides in the dispute:\n\nThe journalistic storm over Beatrice di Tenda was about to evolve into the bitterest, most convoluted, and\u2014at our distance from it\u2014most amusing polemic in the annals of early nineteenth-century Italian opera.Three days before the premiere, the Venetian daily, the Gazzetta privilegiata di Venezia, had published a letter purportedly written to its editor by 'A.B.' of Fonzaso, in Weinstein's view most certainly fabricated by Tommaso Locatelli, the musically sophisticated man who edited the paper. In the letter, he complained about the delay in the production of Beatrice as the end of the season became closer.Weinstock assumes that it is Locatelli who replied to \"A.B.\", asserting that Bellini and Romani were trying to achieve perfection before taking the opera to London. Then a torrent of anti-Beatrice letters appeared after the first performance, followed by a pro-Bellini reply, signed \"A friend of M. Bellini\".  This letter removes the blame from Bellini and lays it at the feet of Romani, outlining the timetable for the delivery of the libretto, which was contracted to be due in two parts: one in October and then the second in November. The author states that, except for a limited amount of text, nothing had been received by mid-January and the piece continues by describing the legal proceedings taken by Bellini and the various setbacks which occurred even after Romani arrived in Venice.  On 2 April, this provoked a response from Romani himself, presenting his case against Bellini based largely on the composer's inability to decide on a subject, as well as justifying all the work which he did after arriving in Venice, only to find his melodramma \"touched up in a thousand ways\", in order to make it acceptable to \"the Milords of the Thames [who] await him\", a sarcastic reference to planned trip to London. Another, a more \"venomous\" version of this letter, was sent to Milan's L'Eco.\"Pietro Marinetti\" replied from the pro-Bellini camp in the Milan journal, Il Barbiere di Siviglia on 11 April. In \"Two Words for Signor Felice Romani\" [but which takes five pages in print], he states that it is not his intention to defend the composer but \"only to vent my displeasure given me and all sensitive people by the very sarcastic manner, full of personal rancor and hauteur, with which Signor Romani has undertaken to assail his antagonist.\" Not unexpectedly, a further \"cannonade\" (says Weinstock) appeared from Romani, published this time in L'Eco on 12 April 1833 with both an editor's preface, decrying the poor taste displayed by both sides, and a brief final response from Marinetti.The relationship begins to be repaired\nHaving been invited to write a new opera for the San Carlo for the 1834\u201335 Carnival season, but declined because of his Paris commitment, he stated that May 1835 might be possible when he knew who were to be the contracted singers.  Florimo immediately began to try to persuade his friend, indicating that Malibran had been engaged for Naples in January 1835. Continuing his letter to Florimo, he states:\n\nwhy the Management ... doesn't make a contract with Romani; not just for one libretto, but by the year ... with the understanding that he come to live in Naples; thus he could write the libretto for me as the only poet attached to the theatre, and if they want to negotiate with him, they can commission me to arrange it; I'd like to return good for evil to that wrongheaded and very talented man ...From that statement of March 1834, it does not appear that animosity still existed on the composer's part. Through an intermediary, Bordesi (or Bordese), a mutual friend of both men, Romani initially expressed interest in re-establishing friendly relations with Bellini. Thus, Bellini wrote back to the intermediary stating: \"Tell my dear Romani that I still love him even though he is a cruel man\" and he continues by wondering if Romani ever thinks about him where he, Bellini, says \"whereas I do nothing but to talk about him to the entire universe\". Then he ends with: \"Give him a kiss for me\". This was followed by a letter to Florimo in late May where Bellini wishes to know if Romani reciprocated his feelings, which\u2014it appears\u2014did happen when he writes to Romani himself (most likely expansion of the initial draft) laying out a series of concerns, but quoting back to him a part of his own letter to Bordese in which Romani states \"I have not ceased to love him [Bellini], for I recognise that the blame is not all his\".In conclusion, Bellini suggests \"draw[ing] a veil over everything that happened\", stating that he cannot come to Milan at this time but, since he was planning to write the opera for Naples for 1836, he could do so in January [1835: presumably after I puritani]. He ends by saying that, if he does not hear back from Romani, he will not write to him again. Little is known about Romani's reply, but  reply he did, as indicated in Bellini's letter to Florimo in October followed by a very friendly one on 7 October 1834 to the librettist (who had been engaged in Turin) and in which he states: \"It seemed impossible to exist without you\", closing with \"Write for Turin or for wherever, write for me alone: only for me, for your Bellini\".Within a year of writing that letter, Bellini was dead. The two men never did meet again.\n\n\n== London: April to August 1833 ==\n\nAfter leaving Venice on 26 March, before the barrage of letter-writing began, it is known that Bellini spent some time with Mrs. Turina in Milan and, leaving many of his personal possessions with her, appears to have planned to return there by August since he did not give up his rooms in the contrade dei Re Monasteri.\nWith the Pasta and other members of the Italian troupe contracted for London by the impresario of the King's Theatre, Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Laporte, Bellini and his troupe set off. On the journey it is known that he stopped in Paris and discussed with Dr. Louis V\u00e9ron, the director of the Paris Op\u00e9ra, the possibility of writing a French opera, but his intention was to focus on that subject on his return in the coming July.\nAs Weinstock notes, when the Italians arrived in London by 27 April, Bellini was a known factor, many of his operas having already been given over the previous few years. His name is listed as an attendee in the Morning Chronicle of 29 April at a performance of Rossini's La cenerentola, along with those of Maria Malibran, Felix Mendelssohn, Nicolo Paganini, as well as Pasta, Rubini, and other visiting Italian singers. His operas which had been presented in London included Il pirata (with Henriette M\u00e9ric-Lalande in April 1830) followed by La sonnambula (with Pasta) and La straniera (with Giuditta Grisi).\n\nIn addition\u2014and separate from Bellini's troupe at the King's Theatre\u2014Maria Malibran was about to present her London debut in La sonnambula at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 1 May in an English version with \"an adapted Bellini score\". It appears that Bellini had his first meeting with Malibran when attending a performance where, as he states:\n\nmy music was tortured, torn to shreds. ... Only when Malibran was singing did I recognise my [opera] ... but in the allegro of the final scene, and precisely at the words 'Ah! m'abbraccia' ... I was the first to shout at the top of my voice: 'Viva, viva, brava, brava,' and to clap my hands as much as I could. [When  he was recognised by the audience, who became more and more enthusiastic, he was called to the stage where he embraced Malibran.  He continues:] My emotion was at its climax. I thought I was in Paradise\".As the opera season progressed, Bellini found himself caught up in the social whirl, with invitations coming from all around him. His fame was now secure\u2014La sonnambula having established it\u2014and the premiere of Norma, given on 21 June with Pasta in the title role, was a triumph according to a long letter which Giuseppe Pasta wrote about the experience and his wife's huge success. Additionally, reports in the London press were favourable including the review which appeared in The Times of 23 June 1833.  It took until late July for I Capuleti e i Montecchi to be given its London premiere and his contract was then over, after which he left for Paris by about mid-August.\n\n\n== Paris: August 1833 to January 1835 ==\n\nWhen he arrived in Paris in mid-August 1833, Bellini had intended to stay only about three weeks, the main aim being to continue the negotiations with the Op\u00e9ra which had begun on his way to London a few months earlier.  While there was no agreement with V\u00e9ron at the Op\u00e9ra, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien made him an offer which, Bellini notes, he accepted because \"the pay was richer than what I had received in Italy up to then, though only by a little; then because of so magnificent a company; and finally so as to remain in Paris at others' expense.\"In fact, \u00c9duard Robert and Carlo Severini of the Italien had written to the composer, offering a seat in their theatre during his stay in the city and telling him that Grisi, Unger, and Rubini would be singing Pirata in October and Capuleti in November. But with no definite arrangements having been made to compose for the Italian house\u2014and Bellini essentially not wishing to proceed with an offer from Turin to stage Norma\u2014he settled into a new, small apartment. He wrote to Florimo, telling him about the lodgings and that he had written to Turina not to sell any of his furniture, but to send some of it to him.Quickly, Bellini entered the fashionable world of the Parisian salon, most importantly that run by the Italian exile Princess Belgiojoso whom he had met in Milan and who \"was by far the most overtly political of the salonni\u00e8res\". Her salon became a meeting place for Italian revolutionaries such as Vincenzo Gioberti, Niccol\u00f2 Tommaseo, and Camillo Cavour, and it was there that he would have most likely made the acquaintance of Count Carlo Pepoli. Others that Bellini would have met included Victor Hugo, George Sand, Alexandre Dumas p\u0117re, and Heinrich Heine. Among the many musical figures were several Italian such as Michele Carafa and the imposing Luigi Cherubini, then in his seventies.\nIn terms of musical activity\u2014or lack thereof\u2014Bellini pleaded guilty in the letter to Florimo in March 1834: \"If you reflect for a moment that a young man in my position, in London and Paris for the first time, cannot help amusing himself immensely, you will excuse me.\"  However, in January 1834, he had signed a contract to write a new opera for the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien which would be presented at the end of the year.  At the same time, he had been invited to write a new opera for the San Carlo in Naples for the 1834\u201335 Carnival season, but declined given the Paris commitment and stated that it might be possible to do so by May 1835 when he knew who were to be the contracted singers. Florimo immediately began to try to persuade his friend to take up this offer, indicating that Malibran had been engaged for Naples in January 1835.\nOn a professional level, Bellini became very concerned around the middle of April 1834, when he learned that Donizetti would be composing for the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien during the same season, 1834\u201335.  According to Weinstock, quoting letters sent to Florimo in Italy at around that time (and continuing almost up to the premiere of I puritani), Bellini perceived this to be a plot orchestrated by Rossini. In a long, rambling letter of 2,500 words to Florino of 11 March 1834, he expresses his frustrations.But over a year later and with hindsight\u2014after Puritani's great success which came way ahead of that of Donizetti's first work for Paris, Marin Faliero\u2014he outlines \"the plot which was being hatched against me\" and the strategies which he adopted to counter it. These strategies included expanding his contacts with Rossini to secure his growing friendship by continuing to see him on numerous occasions to seek his advice, noting \"I have always adored Rossini, and I succeeded, and happily ... [having] tamed Rossini's hatred, I no longer was frightened and finished that work of mine which won me so much honour\". In a series of letters to Florimo throughoutthe year, he wrote of Rossini's increasing support, even love: \"I hear that he speaks well of me\" (4 September 1834); \"... if I have Rossini's protection, I'll be situated very well\" (4 November); \"The most beautiful is that Rossini loves me very, very, very much\" (18 November); and \"... my very dear Rossini who now loves me as a son\" (21 January 1835, following the dress rehearsal).However, during the time during which he was  composing Puritani, Bellini recounted the details of another bout of what he describes as \"gastric fever\" and which Weinstock describes as \"that brief indisposition, which had been recurring almost every year at the onset of warm weather.\"\n\n\n=== I puritani: January 1834 to January 1835 ===\n\nHaving signed the contract for a new opera, Bellini began to look around for a suitable subject and, in a letter to Florimo of 11 March 1834, he alludes to the opera which was to become I puritani, noting: \"I am about to lose my mind over the plot of the opera for Paris, as it has been impossible to find a suitable subject for my purpose and adaptable to the company\".In the same letter he continues by stating that he was working towards finding a subject with the Italian \u00e9migr\u00e9, Count Pepoli, who came from a prominent Bologna family and who had been active in opposition to Austrian rule of Italy, until forced into exile in France and England. Although Pepoli had yet to write for the opera house, he made acquaintance with Bellini at one of the salons both attended. The process of writing the libretto and working with the composer was a struggle (notes Weinstock), added to by a period of illness which Bellini reports, although\u2014on 11 April\u2014he is able to report in a letter to Ferlito that he was well and that \"I have chosen the story for my Paris opera; it is of the times of Cromvello [Cromwell], after he had King Charles I of England beheaded.\" In his letter, he continues by providing a synopsis,  indicating that his favourite singers\u2014Giulia Grisi, Rubini, Tamburini, and Lablache\u2014would be available for the principal roles, and that he would begin to write the music by 15 April if he has received the verses. He also referred to the offer from Naples for April 1836 and noting his financial demands with the questions as to how this might be received.\nThe chosen source was a play performed in Paris only six months before, T\u00eates Rondes et Cavalieres (Roundheads and Cavaliers), written by Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Ancelot and Joseph Xavier Saintine, which some sources state was based on Walter Scott's novel Old Mortality, while others state that there is no connection. The composer had prepared the way for his librettist by providing him with a scenario of thirty-nine scenes (thus compressing the original drama into manageable proportions), reducing the number of characters from nine to seven and at the same time, giving them names of a more Italianate, singable quality.Continuing to work on the yet-unnamed I Puritani, Bellini moved to Puteaux\u2014\"a half an hour by road\" from central Paris, as the guest of an English friend, Samuel Levys, \"where I hope to complete my opera more carefully\".\nAt some in the late Spring (specific date unknown) Bellini wrote to Pepoli to remind him that he should bring the first act of the opera with him the following day \"so that we can finish discussing the first act, which ... will be interesting, magnificent, and proper poetry for music in spite of you and all your absurd rules ...\"  At the same time, he lays out one basic rule for the librettist to follow:\n\nCarve into your head in adamantine letters: The opera must draw tears, terrify people, make them die through singingBy late June, there had been considerable progress and, in a letter copied into one written to Florimo on 25 July, Bellini writes in reply to Alesandro Lanari, now the director of the Royal Theatres of Naples. Because Lanari had written to him on 10 April 1834 regarding an opera for Naples, Bellini tells him that the first act of Puritani is finished and that he expects to complete the opera by September, in order that he may then have time to write for Naples. In this letter to Lanari, the composer lays down some very strict terms, some of which received counter-offers in August, but none of which were accepted by the composer. Finally, Bellini stated that he did not want \"to negotiate with anybody until I see what success my opera will have\". This included a proposal from the Op\u00e9ra-Comique for a new opera for them.)By September he was writing to Florimo of being able to \"polish and re-polish\" in the three remaining months before rehearsals and he expresses happiness with Pepoli's verses (\"a very beautiful trio for the two basses and La Grisi\")and by around mid-December he had submitted the score for Rossini's approval, with rehearsals planned for late December/early January. The dress rehearsal on 20 January 1835 was attended by many people\u2014\"All of high society, all the great artists, and everyone most distinguished in Paris were in the theatre, enthusiastic.\"\u2014and the premiere, postponed by two days, took place on 24 January 1835.  Bellini's ecstatic letter to Florimo which followed recounts the enthusiastic reception of many of the numbers throughout the performance, most especially the second act stretta so that, by its end:\n\nThe French had all gone mad; there were such noise and such shouts that they themselves were astonished at being so carried away. ... In a word, my dear Florimo, it was an unheard of thing, and since Saturday, Paris has spoken of it in amazement. ... I showed myself to the audience, which shouted as if insane. ... How satisfied I am! [He concludes by noting the success of the singers]: \"Lablache sang like a god, Grisi like a little angel, Rubini and Tamburini the same.\"The opera became \"the rage of Paris\" and was given 17 performances to end the season on 31 March.\n\n\n== Paris: January to September 1835 ==\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of I puritani 's success, Bellini was awarded two honours: the first by King Louis-Philippe, naming him as chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur; the second by King Ferdinand II in Naples, awarding him the cross of the \"Order of Francesco I\". Bellini then dedicated I puritiani \"To the Queen of the French\", Queen Marie-Em\u00e9lie. But from a personal point of view, Bellini expressed his sadness at not having seen Florimo for so long, and there flowed a succession of invitations, then demands that Florimo come to Paris to visit him, but from February to July, Florimo ignored the offers and finally, in a letter to him, Bellini stated: \"I'll no longer ask for reasons, and I'll see you when I see you.\" After that, he attempted to persuade his uncle, Vincenzo Ferlito, to visit, but without success.\nDuring the final preparations in 1834 for the staging of Puritani and up to its delay into 1835, Bellini had concluded an agreement with Naples to present three operas there\u2014including the re-writing of parts of the music for Malibran\u2014beginning in the following January. All that went by the wayside when the revised score failed to arrive on time, and performances were abandoned and the contract scrapped. Thus, during March, Bellini did nothing, but did attend the final performance of Puritani on 31st. On 1 April, he wrote a very lengthy letter to Ferlito laying out the entire history of his life in Paris to date, as well as reviving the old jealousies about Donizetti and Rossini's so-called \"enmity\" toward him.  He ended by mentioning that \"my future plans are to be able to arrange a contract with the French Grand Op\u00e9ra and remain in Paris, making it my home for the present.  Additionally, he discusses the prospect of marriage to a young woman who \"is not rich, but she has an uncle and aunt who are: if they will give her 200,000 francs, I'll marry her\", but remarks that he is in no hurry.Throughout May, accounts came to him from London of the success of I puritani and the failure of a revival of Norma (due to the poor performances by both the Adalgisa and Pollione), although later reports of Giulietta Grisi's Norma\u2014in contrast to those of Pasta\u2014were not good either, and Bellini was pleased that it was not Grisi who gave the opera in Paris.  Over the summer, Bellini's general mood was reported to be \"dark\":  discussion with the Op\u00e9ra could not proceed until a new director was appointed; \"he writes long letters, crowded with projects, ideas, reveries that the hand seems to have trouble restraining\"; and, as Weintock concludes, all of these things seem to \"inescapably suggest a man deeply disturbed physically, psychologically, or both\".At one of the literary gatherings which Bellini attended earlier in the year, Bellini met the writer Heinrich Heine. Both men then attended a dinner that summer, at which the writer is reported to have remarked:\n\nYou are a genius, Bellini, but you will pay for your great gift with a premature death. All the great geniuses died very young, like Raphael and like Mozart.The rather superstitious Bellini was horrified.  Also, Heine's literary portrait of Bellini, which became part of his unfinished novel Florentinische N\u00e4chte (Florentine Nights) published in 1837, emphasized the less-appealing aspects of the composer's personality, summing up a description of him as \"a sigh in dancing pumps\".In his last-known letter to Filippo Santocanale Bellini wrote on 16 August, followed by one to Florimo on 2 September. In the latter, he mentions that \"for three days I've been slightly disturbed by a diarrhea, but I am better now, and think that it is over.\"\n\n\n=== Final illness and death ===\n\nIt was clear from Bellini's reaction to Heine's remarks that he did not like Heine.  Attempting to reconcile the two men, Madame Joubert, who had attended the summer event, invited both to dinner, along with her friend the Princess Belgiojoso. Bellini failed to appear, instead he sent a note stating that he was too ill. Weinstock reports that the princess sent  Doctor Luigi Montallegri to Puteaux. Over a few days, he reported to Carlo Severini of the Th\u00e9atre-Italien with four notes, the first (on 20 September) stated \"no appreciable improvement\". On the following day, Montallegri reported a slight improvement, and on 22nd, the doctor stated that he \"hopes to declare him out of danger tomorrow\". However, the fourth note\u2014on 22 September\u2014is far more pessimistic; it reported that it was the thirteenth day of the illness and that Bellini had \"passed a very restless night\". And then, during the daytime of the 23rd, Montallegri indicated that there had been what Weinstock describes as \"a terrifying convulsion\" and that death was close. It appears that Bellini died at around 5 pm on 23 September 1835.\n\nImmediately taking charge of arrangements, Rossini began to plan Bellini's funeral and entombment, as well as caring for his estate. He ordered that a post-mortem be performed, following an order which came directly from the King. The distinguished Court-appointed Doctor Dalmas performed the autopsy and reported his findings on the cause of death:\n\nIt is evident that Bellini succumbed to an acute inflammation of the colon, compounded by an abscess in the liver. The inflammation of the intestine had produced violent symptoms of dysentery during life.Rossini then created a committee of Parisian musicians in order to find support for a subscription to build a monument to the dead composer, as well as supporting a funeral mass to be given on 2 October in the chapel of the H\u00f4tel des Invalides.\n\nOn 27 September and 3 October, Rossini wrote to Santocanale in Palermo providing very detailed accounts of all that he had done immediately following Bellini's death as well as what had taken place on 2 October. Initially, Rossini regarded burial in P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery as a short-term arrangement, not knowing where the final resting place would turn out to be. Despite attempts over many years to have Bellini's remains transferred to Catania, that did not take place until 1876, when the casket containing his remains was taken to the cathedral in Catania and reburied.Of the many tributes which poured forth following Bellini's death, one stands out. It was written by Felice Romani and published in Turin on 1 October 1835. In it, he stated:\n\n ... Perhaps no composers other than ours, know as well as Bellini the necessity for a close union of music with poetry, dramatic truth, the language of emotions, the proof of expression. ... I sweated for fifteen years to find a Bellini! A single day took him from me! Today, the Museo Belliniano, housed in the Gravina Cruyllas Palace in Catania\u2014Bellini's birthplace\u2014preserves memorabilia and scores.  He was commemorated on the front of the Banca d'Italia 5,000 lire banknote in the 1980s and 90s (before Italy switched to the Euro) with the back showing a scene from the opera Norma.\n\n\n== Bellini, romanticism and melodrama ==\nWhen planning the subject of his next opera after La Scala's Il pirata, Bellini had been invited to write an opera for Parma's inauguration of the new Teatro Ducale in early 1829. In the initial contract, Bellini was given power over who was to write the libretto and, after meeting the composer and prima donna, the Parman librettist Luigi Torrigiani's work had been rejected. The aspiring librettist laid a complaint against Bellini in a report to Parma's Grand Chamberlain in December 1828 (which was ignored). In it, the aggrieved librettist sums up Bellini's tastes in Romantic drama as follows:\n\n[he] likes Romanticism and exaggeration.  He declares that Classicism is cold and boring. ... He is entranced by unnatural meetings in forests, among graves, tombs and the like ...In writing the libretto for Zaira, Romani expressed his position in relation to Voltaire's tragedy by noting in the preface to the libretto:\n\nZaira therefore is not covered with the ample cloak of Tragedy but wrapped in the tight form of Melodrama.\n\n\n== Personal life and relationships ==\nBellini was a notorious womanizer as evidenced in his letters to Francesco Florimo. However, three people had a prominent place in his life: Francesco Florimo, Maddelena Fumaroli and Giuditta Turina. \n\n\n=== Francesco Florimo ===\n\nOne of the closest people in Bellini's life was Francesco Florimo, whom he met as a fellow student at the Naples Conservatory. Throughout Bellini's lifetime, the two shared a close correspondence. During the 1820 revolution, Bellini and Florimo joined a secret society, the Carboneria. Their closeness is evident in their letters. For example, on 12 January 1828 Bellini wrote that theirs were \"hearts made only to be friends to the last breath.\" Bellini wrote in 1825 that \"Your existence is necessary to mine\". Further, on 11 February 1835, Bellini wrote: \" my excellent, my honest, my angelic friend! The more we know the world, the more we shall see how rare is our friendship.\" Based on these letters, some have speculated about Bellini's sexuality, but Weinstock (1971) believes such interpretations are anachronistic. Rosselli (1996) expands on this point: contrary to how they may seem to modern readers, the expressions of close friendship in these letters were commonplace in Mediterranean societies and the world of early 1800's Italian opera rather than a reflection of sexual attachment. Once Bellini left Naples for Milan, the two men seldom saw one another; their last meeting was in Naples in late 1832, when Bellini was there with Giuditta Turina, before the pair departed for Milan via Florence.  Florimo's published recollections\u2014written fifty years after the events they recall\u2014may be flawed. In later years, Bellini declared that Florimo \"was the only friend in whom [I] could find comfort\". Interpretation of Florimo's collection of letters is complicated however by evidence that he often altered or completely fabricated some of his correspondences with Bellini to create an idealized image of the composer. Florimo was also known to have destroyed some compromising letters involving Bellini's affairs with married women, including some in which Bellini wrote in detail about his affair with Giuditta Turina. After Bellini's death Florimo became his literary executor.\n\n\n=== Maddalena Fumaroli ===\nAlthough the frustrating affair with Maddalena Fumaroli which, as noted above, came to nothing during these early years, the success achieved by Bianca e Gernado gave Bellini fresh hope that her parents would finally relent, and a new appeal was made through a friend. This was utterly rejected by Maddalena's father, who returned all the letters which she had received along with a letter from him stating that \"my daughter will never marry a poor piano player (suonatore di cembalo)\".  However, when Florimo gave him the news, he said that he was going to try again and win, but the next move was to come later from the Fumarolis family.\nAt some time before March 1828, after the major success of Il pirata and just as Bellini was about to leave Milan for his production of Bianca e Ferdinando in Genoa, he received a notification from his go-between with the Fumarolis family that they had withdrawn their rejection of his proposal.  But by then\u2014with the efforts to build his career and with time and distance between him and Maddalena\u2014his feelings had changed and, using Florimo to communicate to the family, he rejected the offer, expressing the feeling that he would be unable to support her financially. Even Maddalena's own pleas in three letters which followed failed to change his mind.\n\n\n=== Giuditta Turina ===\n\nThe one significant relationship which Bellini had after 1828 was the five-year relationship with Giuditta Turina, a young married woman with whom he began a passionate affair when both were in Genoa in April 1828 for the production of Bianca e Fernando. Their relationship lasted until Bellini went to Paris. Bellini\u2019s letters to his friend Florimo indicate his satisfaction with the nature of the liaison, particularly because it kept him from having to marry\u2014and thus becoming distracted from his work.\nHowever, in May 1833 while he was in London, a significant change in Bellini's relationship with Giuditta followed from the discovery by her husband of a compromising letter from Bellini. The result was that he decided to seek a legal separation and have her removed from his house. For Bellini, it meant the possibility of taking on responsibility for her, and he had no interest in doing that, having cooled in his feelings for her.  When he wrote to Florimo from Paris the following year, he clearly stated that \"I constantly am being threatened from Milan with Giuditta's coming to Paris\", at which point he says he'll leave that city if that were to happen. Then he continues: \"I no longer want to be put in the position of renewing a relationship that made me suffer great troubles\". When Turina announced that she was leaving her husband, Bellini left her, saying \"with so many commitments, such a relationship would be fatal to me,\" expressing his fear of romantic attachments getting in the way of his musical career.  Ultimately, he resisted any long-term emotional commitment, and never married.\nHowever, Turina maintained contact with Florimo throughout her life, although [nothing] was heard from her after his death until she wrote a sad-but-friendly letter to Florimo Florimo eventually returned the friendship and, as Galatopoulos notes, \"the death of Bellini was a mutual loss and Florimo needed Giuditta as much as she needed him\" so that the two corresponded for years and Florimo visited her in Milan \"at least once, in 1858\". She died on 1 December 1871.\n\n\n== Complete works of Bellini ==\n\n\n=== Operas ===\nIn 1999, the Italian music publisher Casa Ricordi, in collaboration with the Teatro Massimo Bellini in Catania, embarked on a project to publish critical editions of the complete works of Bellini.\n\n\n=== Songs ===\nThe following fifteen songs were published as a collection, Composizioni da Camera, by Casa Ricordi in 1935 on the centenary of Bellini's death.\n\n\n=== Other works ===\neight symphonies, including a Capriccio, ossia Sinfonia per studio (Capriccio or Study Symphony)\nOboe Concerto in E-flat major\nseven piano works, three of them for four hands\nan Organ Sonata in G major\n40 sacred works, including:\n(\u201cCatania\u201d No. 1) Mass in D major (1818)\n(\u201cCatania\u201d No. 2) Mass in G major (1818)\nMessa di Gloria in A minor for Soloists, Choir and Orchestra (1821)\nMass in E minor (Naples, c. 1823)\nMass in G minor (Naples, c. 1823)\nSalve regina in A major for Choir and Orchestra (c. 1820)\nSalve regina in F minor for Soprano and Piano (c. 1820)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nOther important bel canto opera composers:\n\nGioachino Rossini\nGaetano Donizetti\nSaverio Mercadante\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nCited sources\n\nCambi, Luisa (Ed.)

        "wiki": "Castello Ursino (Sicilian: Casteddu Ursinu, lit. 'Bear Castle'), also known as Castello Svevo di Catania, is a castle in Catania, Sicily, southern Italy. It was built in the 13th century as a royal castle of the Kingdom of Sicily, and is mostly known for its role in the Sicilian Vespers, when it became the seat of the Sicilian Parliament. The castle is in good condition today, and it is open to the public as a museum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nCastello Ursino was built between 1239 and 1250, as one of the royal castles of Emperor Frederick II, King of Sicily, closing a chapter on the turbulent time in Sicily that followed the death of his predessor, William II. Local lords had attempted to assert independence, and in 1220 Frederick II had ordered the destruction of all non-royal castles in Sicily. Castello Ursino was built to stress royal power as well as for the defence of the capital, and was considered impregnable at the time.\n\n\n=== Sicilian Vespers ===\nIn 1295, during the Sicilian Vespers, the Parliament which declared deposed James II of Aragon as King of Sicily, replacing him with Frederick III, was held here.  The following year it was captured by Robert of Anjou but was later again in Aragonese hands.\n\n\n=== Royal seat ===\nKing Frederick III resided in the castle, as well as his successors Peter II, Louis, Frederick IV and Maria. Here the latter was kidnapped by Guglielmo Raimondo III Moncada to avoid her marriage with Gian Galeazzo Visconti (1392).  King Martin I held also his court in the castle.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\nAfter the move of the capital away from Catania and the appearance of powder weapons, the castle lost its military role and was used as a prison.  It is one of the few buildings in Catania to have survived the earthquake of 1693.\nWhen the castle was first built, it was on a cliff looking out to sea, however as the result of volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes, it is now a kilometre inland.  The former moat too in the 17th century was filled with lava from an eruption by Mount Etna.  Its present location, surrounded by streets and shops in a typical Catania piazza, may strike some visitors as unusual.\n\n\n=== Present day ===\nThe castle was acquired by the city of Catania in 1932, and it was restored. The Museo civico opened in the restored castle on 20 October 1934. Today, the museum houses artifacts and artwork from the castle as well as the greater geographical area. These items date from the Classical era onward, representing the diverse influences throughout Sicilian history.Further restoration work was carried out in November 2009.\n\n\n== Layout ==\nThe castle has a rectangular plan, with a large circular tower at each corner and an open-air inner court\n\n\n== Museum layout ==\n\n\n=== Ground Floor ===\n\n\n==== Salone d'Armi ====\nThis houses the museum's ticket office as well as Jewish inscriptions and inscriptions from the medieval senate-house where the decision was taken to expel the city's Jewish population in 1492, including a copy of the Julia Fiorentina inscription from the Louvre.

Particularly notable is a colossal ram, whilst the most important work in the room is a fragment of a cavalryman, probably from a historiated column, found near porta Carlo V.\n\n\n==== Torre del Sale ====\nNamed after its previous use as a storehouse for salt, it now houses a mosaic showing a head, thought to be an allegory for Africa, and a bust of an Egyptian woman.\n\n\n==== Sala di San Giorgio / Sala della Cappella ====\nThis displays around 2000 bronze figurines, of which 1600 are from the Benedettini collection and the rest from the Biscari collection. They date to the Archaic, Siceliot, Greek, Etruscan-Italic and Hellenistic eras.

          "I love Castles and their architecture and history! This was a great find for me. Medieval castles are just that Medieval! I especially liked the high vaulted ceilings. Lots of pottery inside also. Kids love Castles and it's a great place to teach them about history.",
          "When we read about the history of the castle at the entrance we had high hopes for an interesting visit but our hopes did not last long. The castle is essentially an art museum and much as we are not art followers we did our best to embrace the exhibition but came away",

          "This castle looks great from the outside, however, I found the architecture and contents on the inside a little bland; however, that's not to say other people might like it more than me, just wasn't my cup of tea I'm afraid.",
          "The castle is more impressive from the outside than the inside. The entry cost is 10 Euros and in our opinion not worth it. The exhibits are quite interesting, the special exhibition comprises one statue, save your money for elsewhere. Most of the commentary is in Italian.",
          "I was disappointed with this museum. Expected much more when viewed from the outside. If you like art, particularly religious art, then I'm sure you'll enjoy. I prefer buildings and beautiful architecture but there was none of that. Not worth \u20ac10 admission - go to Teatro Romano",
          "audio guide works only in italian, a collection of paintings, not so spectacular inside, my feeling is it was not worth the 10 eur entrance fee. i would have been better off just taking pictures from outside.",
          "This is an impressive building that houses a small collection of interesting items from local history. And it is nice and cool if you need a break from the heat. There is a free app you can use for a self guided tour, but you need to have it loaded before you go, as there is",

          "We visited this castle during a short stay in Catania. The castle cost 6 Euros to access. The opening hours are hit and miss and only appears to take visitors when they feel like it. The castle is large and some of the rooms quite cavernous, which felt as though the owners had",
          "You need to start here only if you are interested in the history of the Greeks and the Old Rome. But that is so little, and you have to pay 4 euros per person. We entered and paid 9 euros (seniors) for the Salvador Dali exhibition. But we did not have what else to do at Catania",
          "Ursino Castle, originally constructed in the mid-13th century, is the home of the city museum of Catania. The permanent collection includes some stunning paintings by Matthias Stom (also known as Stomer) and Michele Rapisardi, the work of other artists, antiquities, engravings,",

          "Wonderful castle with great exhibitions inside. It was very cheap to get in and the view was breathtaking from the terrace. Easy to get to-a real gem!",
          "We didn't actually pay for the museum entry as we were not enticed by the entrance hall exhibits & the price, but its worth walking round the square if nothing else. Its not lit up at night.",
          "Since neither my wife nor i are big museum people and since the cost to enter it was what we considered excessive, we decided to skip going into it and just walked around the exterior walls.",
          "the inside seems a bit improvised and chaotic. It doesn't seem to have a central theme, except for all the items on display to be from Catania. They have exibition pieces from various eras, but without any order or many explanations. If you don't have anything else to do, you",
          "We arrived just in time before closing. The part of the exhibition we enjoyed most is the very old sculptures and pottery. There is very very little info on the castle and its history, it's a pity. The price of ticket is large for the exhibition.",
          "We wanted to visit the old castle but they had an exhibition with some religious paintings and asked for 12 Euro entrance per person. Because we were not interested in the exhibition (did not want to see the thousandth madonna painting) and so I asked the female staff if we had",
          "The audio tour is for the art collection and quite a bit over my head. I am not well versed in painting techniques but I think it is always useful to take the device. This location is cooler than some in Catania since the Castle is hardly subject to penetrating sun. The",

          "Great collection of art with a focus on regional artists. Audio guide commenting several art pieces is included in the entrance. To many visitors, it seems absurd that such an impressive castle isn't the attraction in itself but merely a setting for a civic museum. In fact, you",
          "The castle is quite uninviting from the outside but it is worth trying as it houses an interesting collection of mainly local art from the antiquity to modernity. We were especially lucky to see a temporary exhibition which included the works of Giotto and a newly discovered",

          "Enjoyed this trip to the castle but it was more an art exhibition than a historic experience. The castle is well preserved and good to view . The exhibition cost 12euros each and has an English audio guide. Very good exhibition covering a history of Italian art. The castle is",

          "We stumbled upon this castle and wanted to go inside, turned out it is a 3 floor museum very well set-up.",
          "It is noteworthy that building was once near the shoreline, but Mt. Etna and land reclamation means that the sea front is now several K away. This Romanticist building reminded me of pictures of the Paris Bastille. You will not be overwhelmed by the number of exhibits. Most of",
          "We weren't planning to go, but it was raining and we wanted to keep touring Catania, where all the other interesting sites are out in the open. I found the exhibit quite interesting. In particular the drawing that depicts Catania at the time of Etna's eruption in 1669. It gives",
          "The Museum was not of the castle, the Museum was of the Museum. Every description of art work (after the poor translation) was about how the Museum creator bought the piece rather than about the piece... it was a mishmash of art, sculpture and pottery which had very little to do",
          "Located next to a very pretty square, the castle looks firm from the outside. Made me expect some cool medieval exhibitions. Yet, most of it has to offer is art: paintings, sculpture and pottery. All of it is very old to be sure and has survived under the protection of the Order",
          "An odd and not particularly well organised mix of exhibits and sweletringly hot on the day we visited.",
          "We had an appartment across the street of this museaum. We went there becuase it looked already cool from the outside. But when you go visit, take your time, because it full of nice pieces, paintings sculptures etc. I think its a hidden gem...",
          "The city museum is housed in the medieval castle Castelo Ursino. The piazza around the castello is very nice. The castle is well restored. Inside there is a collection of some archaeological finds and paintings. On the top of one of the towers there is a small self-service",
          "So beautiful paintings and historic findings. Also great photo gallery of Catania in the past. There are s lot of chairs to sit and enjoy the paintings while resting. There are also food and drinks vending machines, toilets. At the rooftop you can sit and enjoy.",
          "There is a good selection of Sicilian art from the 14th to 18th Centuries. Some beautifully preserved Greek urns and figures, that have been retrieved in the countryside around Catania. But the exhibition is quite hard work and best for those with a specific interest in this",
          "My wife and I visited the Castello Ursino in Catania with some friends during a two-week vacation in Sicily. It is located in the Piazza Federico di Svevia, a short walk from the Cathedral. It is a defiant-looking building consisting of four wings arranged in a square around a",
          "The Castle is the most extensive monument of medieval Catania and we were prepared to enjoy its stern stronghold fortifications. What we had not expected was the wonderfully diffuse collection of paintings and other artistic or historical objects. This was originally built up",
          "Well worth visiting. For only 3 euros not only do you get to see a collection of historical paintings and artifacts, but you can also access a viewing point from which you can see Etna.",
          "The fortress was built by the sea, like a castle near the bay. But in the 17th century after the eruption of Mount Etna, the castle has appeared on land and sea receded. Around now are residential neighborhoods. But the castle surrounded by a moat, which clearly shows the level",
          "Although it was an interesting building there was not as much to see inside as I thought from previous reviews, there is a huge amount of rather average religious painting and a few nice mosaics, it otherwise the architecture is the only redeeming feature",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to the castello, the entrance fee is 6 euros and there are several exhibits housed within the old castle walls. When I was there they had an Andy Warhol exhibition at no extra cost.",
          "At the time we visited there was a temporary Warhol exhibition on the 2nd floor, which was an interesting contrast to the historical art and sculpture exhibits on the lower floors.",
          "Fairy tale castle with towers. Inside it is a museum and art gallery with plenty to see, and most of the building is accessible.",
          "I happened to stumble across this lovely castle and I could not miss visiting it . The building itself is impressive and I nice collection of art in the premises on different floors , the Castle is unique . The only thing is that no guide was present to lead the way , but I must",
          "I had the chance to visit this museum/castle a few days ago while staying in Catania. Very well preserved building with nice and interesting paintings and other art pieces.",
          "This is an imposing edifice (for Catania) located in an attractive little square. BTW, in the square, directly opposite the castle entrance on opposite side of the square is an excellent restaurant (Antonio's). And Camelot, to the right serves great pizza and other dishes. Back",
          "Absolutely stunning castle in immaculate condition. We went and purchased tickets to look inside thinking we would be seeing the inners of an architectural masterpiece and how the castle was setup, used and its history. Instead its an art gallery. We paid a reduced enterance",
          "Didn't fancy paying 10 euro. The entrance area has some interesting artefacts, including some Hebrew inscriptions. Also a shop with a wide range of items. Impressive building with a nice courtyard in front.",
          "You can not saturate, to watch it !It is very well maintained and stately. if you are interested you can visit inside houses works of art, museum. Luckily I had to be accommodated right in front of the castle and watched him every morning and evening.",
          "We went to visit this castle with kids and our family' friends. The castle is set right in the middle of the city. The area is surrounded by beautiful gardens and further more there are plenty relevant sites just a step away from the castle. The entrance has a ticket to be paid",
          "The museum is in an old castle which adds to the experience. The collection is well presented and quite varied. I especially liked the statues. The museum is within walking distance of the main square.",
          "I visited the castle as I was doing a walking tour of Catania. It is located away from the main tourist centres and therefore is not crowded. The museum does not have much, but the castle itself if worth exploring as it is constructed differently than others of the same era.",
          "Just visited the current excellent Ligabue exhibition as well as the Museo della Folia....nice place for a couple of hours and easy to reach",
          "I visited the museum and seen the exhibition \"Tra arte e follia\" (art and crazyness) with paintings from Ligabue and a final part dedicated to madhouses. I found the exhibition very touchy and very well set. In the top rooms of the castle are shown paintings from sicilian",
          "Our expectations were high but what a disappointment. A mish mash of exhilbits with little or no effort made to tell the visitor what they were looking at, say for a short caption. Staff sat reading there kindles, no one offering to explain the exhibits. The exhibtion of Antonio",
          "The castle is quite impressive and close to the center. The museum has at the moment an exhibition of Ligabue certainly worth seeing. You will also find Roman vases and statues. Well organized Worth the visit",
          "Visited the castello in catania. Just go there, take pictures from the outside and leave. We payed 32 euro to go inside, which is a complete waste of money, hardly any historic artifacts. The filled the castle with exhibition of paintings with the theme crazy. If you are into",
          "I enjoyed the art and admired how it was set up in the castle. I was surprised at how many floors there were (take the lift!) and the wide range of art work. There were a couple of videos but since there were no subtitles I could not understand them. There are some posters",
          "Great castle with museum hidden inside. Mix of recent painters and 16th/17th century Catanian artists, worth the effort. Also good to escape the heat of the day as it is nice and cool inside. There is a discount on the first Sunday of the month (only 5 euros for everybody)",
          "I am giving a 5 star rating, not so much for the museum as for the awesome exhibit there, called museo della follia. Tremendous, creative art and sculpture.",
          "In 2016 there is a surprising exhibition on craziness. The greek ceramics are poorly exhibited, and the paintings a good simple of the island art.",
          "The place itself is situated in the middle of Catania which is quite surprising as you walk toward it. The best part for us are the exhibits and musical performances they have here occationally. The exhibits are interwoven into the usual parts of the Castello, this is done very",
          "i love this castle and square special in the evening You have the very light building colour stone and when the sun is reflecting the castle changes colour. The square is full of delicious restaurants at fantastic prices. a must visit with great food at the end of the visit.",
          "This really seems like a specialist museum, aside from the castle itself, though it is only barely preserved. The local painters apparently imitated Caravaggio and then Hayez. The show curated by Sgarbi was not that interesting, aside from one or two pieces.",
          "Within the historic enter of Catania a very interesting museum exists. A very old Castel has been converted into a blend of a contemporary art museum with ancient sculptures or remnants of stone pillars or sarcophagi mingled in. The Old and New in juxtaposition...and it works",
          "Until our visit we didn't realise that there are art exhibitions held in the castle. Really enjoyed the variety",
          "This castle is really cool to see. Admission was pretty cheap (maybe 4 euros per person?). The only thing that disappointed me was that there is no emphasis on the actual castle as your walk through. There are really cool artifacts and paintings, but no information on the",
          "We are from South America and our history is pretty short, so be in a well preserved castle built in 1250 is awesome. More awesome was the exhibition of Marc Chagall that we have the opportunity to see there.",
          "Chagal exhibition at the Ursino is first rate and the Castello itself is well worth a visit. To be recommended",
          "Nice and interesting place , whith a lot of school children inside made a lot of activities ( i am happy for this ) But the most important Chagall love and live it was amazing perfect day for me !",
          "The Ursino Castle holds a very well arranged exhibition with medieval paintings, Roman and Greek ceramics and statues and annually some itinerants art exhibitions...the castle are renovated and looks as a fortress from outside!...",
          "We visited the Chagall exhibition there and loved it, although it was there for a short time. The castello is about a 15 minute walk from the dome.",
          "It was not planned visit but we found that Chagall collection exhibition was in progress thus we just went in! Not only Chagall's exhibition, we could see the old art collections in this civic museo. Nice to invest our 2 hours!!",
          "A large 3 storied modernistic structure on the interior that except for the size of the rooms does not give one a sense of being in a true castle. The entrance fee is 12 Euro and 10 Euro for seniors , way to expensive. The hours are 9 AM to 7 PM, M -F and till 11 PM on Sat and",
          "wish we had more time to have gone round and take it all in. So much history and information. Shame there wasn't somewhere to eat there - we would have stayed longer.",
          "Lots of old artifacts. I had very low expectations. Lots of people told me it wasn't worth the money. I was very impressed by the sheer number of items they had. Just wandering around parts of the castle was very cool. There are english translations for most everything, so",
          "With a square shape, classical, big but not too big, Ursino Castle do not seem very special at first glance: an early-medieval classic castel. Well, it was a very very nice surprise! Well maintained, well thought out as a museum, the almost 2 hours we spent in it were the",
          "The castle itself is amazing and impressive, particularly considering its history and perseverance through volcanic eruption and earthquake action! Admission is inexpensive and the museum is well curated, including sculpture from as early as the first century AD and paintings",
          "For a 6 euro entry fee, this castle is well worth visiting, not least to escape the scorching heat of the midday sun with its thick stone towers and cool interiors. There are Greek and Roman marble busts and sarcophagi, urns and pottery as well as a floor of paintings. There is",
          "we were very pleased to discover this museum as we wandered away from the fish market. It has been well preserved and its contents are well displayed. There were only a few other visitors while we were there so certainly one of the less crowded tourist spots in Catania. There",
          "its really realy looking so good .behind of this castello urisino a lot of resturant.very good natural places",
          "Well worth \u20ac9.50. An excellent exhibition of Picasso well put together and displayed (I have seen other Picasso exhibitions). Shown alongside Roman finds in the area (the museum side) and other Sicilian art (the gallery side). Some Picasso ceramics shown alongside Roman ceramics",
          "We were just in Catania in May 2015 and visited Castello Ursino. It has a large central courtyard and if you like history or architecture you should enjoy this Castle. It has been upgraded with lights and there was a Pablo Picasso show that was very nice to see. From the top",
          "This beautiful 13th century castle founded by Frederick II of Swabia is a fantastic venue for the Picasso exhibit (or for other future exhibits). It was delightful to see Picasso's drawings of bullfights on the old stone walls.",
          "We went to see the Picasso exhibition there. Entrance fee was 10 Euros per person. The exhibition was limited and quite poor compared to other Picasso exhibitions we have seen. The maintenance of this museum is very bad: no soup, neither toilet paper nor paper towels in the",
          "Castelllo Ursino is quite impressive builsing. The Museum inside it, a mixture of modern art, paintings from local Artists, and artifacts from the Roman Empire. The castle is open thru the day. WC (messy) in top floor. Cafe was closed. Picasso exhibition till the end of June",
          "Visited this castle during the day, nice but didn't really earn the 8 euro entrance. There were musical performances in the central courtyard most evenings while we were in Catania. We saw two beautiful girls playing harps, heavenly and free!",
          "Castelllo Ursino is quite impressive, you are walking around a corner and than its just there. The Museum inside it, is a nice display of art, with a mixture of modern art, paintings from local Artists, and artifacts from the Roman Empire. The fee however has risen in the last",
          "It really is an impressive building that has undergone so many transformations and rulers and withstood the lava flows that extended the land around the castle (it used to stand exactly on the coast). It is well kept and had a nice collection of roman statues, mosaics and, on",
          "Got to the castle 1/2 hr before it was closing as on a Sunday. Was 6 euro to get in. Good exhibition of paintings on the second floor and roman sculptures etc on the ground.",

          "While docked in Catania and without a plan, we stumbled upon this castle and opted to go inside. The fee was reasonable and half price for my over-65-yrs-old parents. The castle is quite well preserved and you can learn a lot of history about the area to include the",
          "Our Hotel was just around the corner - itself a great little hotel! Anyway, myself and my son were just out walking, getting a feel for the land on the 1st day in Catania and hey presto - So we went in and werent dissapointed ... The castle was originally miliatry and",
          "This is one of the best preserved castles i have ever visited. There is more emphasis of the objects and artwork inside the castle, than life in the castle itself, which was disappointing. There is a lift(elevator) available for going up the levels. Well worth a visit for the",
          "The castle looks like its restoration is complete but unfortunately it was closed on the Sunday we were there. The castle is very imposing with all of its towers complete and it has a great, surrounding moat. Well worth the 5 minutes walk from the Piazza Duomo.",
          "says what it is great for a building that age. Interesting artefacts and beautiful paintings.You can imagine what it like when it was first built a huge fortiforcation.",
          "I am somewhat confused when reading reviews that say nothing is inside this museum. They had paintings upstairs but downstairs they had a terrific collection of architectural elements, sculptures, and ceramics as well as smaller objects of art, dating back to the fifth century",
          "Castello Ursino is what it is, a Castle. It looks like from the Norman origin and it's not too far away from the Duomo. Been there, done that experience. It's not something that's worth lingering around for.",
          "Honestly the outside is more interesting than the museum inside. Get some amazing pics from the outside, and enjoy one of the many restaurants nearby. If you are really interested in Sicilian history,go inside- just don't expect the same interesting architecture once you go in.",
          "I loved this Castles structure. The only problem with some places, that dont have frescoes, gold or something like that then paintings are placed in them, statues, old pottery etc to fill up you time ... This is what happened here. But I enjoyed waking outside and viewing this",
          "This castle in old Catania has been recently renewated, and the museum inside is nice to visit. This castle is part of the Italian fortresses by Federico II di Svevia, the Norman king which built impressive example of military architecture. To be seen, also only from outside.",
          "Perfect example of a Normann fortress, worth the view and the visit. The museum has plenty of artifacts.",
          "Well it's an impressive sight from the outside but on the inside its not what you might expect. There are sculptures,paintings and mosaic's all in large rooms that gave it a little bit of an empty feeling. But overall worth a look.",

          "This is worth a visit. Well looked after well displayed. Beautiful moasic. Unusual design compared to the other artitecture",
          "Interesting place for people who are interested in medieval architecture and history. Be prepared to see historical facts and paintings from different centuries. It would be better to say that this castle is more about cicilian history rather than a period of it.",
          "Interesting to visit if you like Middle Age history and arts. Especially interesting the building's structure, which is medieval and well kept.",
          "Very spacious and well laid out displays on the inside.Some explanations in English. This castle used to be situated near the port but a major eruption in 1669 resulted in the fortress moving further inland! see for yourself what i mean!",

          "This castle sits solidly in the middle of Catania. It is so like the picture-book representation of a medieval castle - square, with round towers at each corner, and a moat - that you almost thought it had been built specially for a film. But it is very real, and it was possible",
          "Great museum. Uncrowded. Castle built in 1239 originally. Lots of clothing/shoes/mosaics. Interesting courtyard where they used to keep prisoners in the 1700s who gouged grafitti on the walls.",
          "It is a bit of a surprise to come across a castle that wouldn't be out of place in England in the middle of a southern Italian town. The outside of the castle is almost fully restored and the Museo Civico has a good collection of paintings and statues.",
          "We enjoyed our trip to the castle and museum very much. The staff were particularly helpful especially one young girl who was learning to speak English, named Agata. She went out of her way to show us quite a few things not on the catalogue that they supplied us with. The",
          "It's worth going into this museum just to see the building, an impressive castle. I found the ground floor archeological collection fairly interesting, although there's not a huge amount to see and some information boards would be useful. The Greek vases are probably the best"

        "wiki": "Catania Cathedral (Italian: Duomo di Catania; Cattedrale di Sant'Agata), dedicated to Saint Agatha, is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Catania, Sicily, southern Italy. It was the seat of the Bishops of Catania until 1859, when the diocese was elevated to an archdiocese, and since then has been the seat of the Archbishops of Catania.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe cathedral has been destroyed and rebuilt several times because of earthquakes and eruptions of the nearby Mount Etna. It was originally constructed in 1078-1093, on the ruins of the ancient Roman Achillean Baths, by order of Roger I of Sicily, who had conquered the city from the Islamic emirate of Sicily. At the time it had the appearance of a fortified church (ecclesia munita). \n\nIn 1169 it was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake, leaving only the apse area intact. Further damage was caused by a fire in 1169, but the most catastrophic event was the 1693 earthquake, which again left it mostly in ruins. It was subsequently rebuilt in Baroque style.\nToday, traces of the original Norman edifice include part of the transept, the two towers and the three semicircular apses, composed of large lava stones, most of them recovered from imperial Roman buildings.\n\n\n== Exterior ==\nThe current appearance of the cathedral dates from the work in 1711 of Gian Battista Vaccarini, who designed a new Baroque fa\u00e7ade after the 1693 earthquake. It has three levels with Corinthian columns in granite, perhaps taken from the Roman Theatre of the city. All the orders are decorated with marble statues of Saint Agatha over the gate, Saint Euplius on the right and Saint Birillus on the left. The main door, in wood, has 32 sculpted plaques with episodes of the life and martyrdom of Saint Agatha, papal coats of arms and symbols of Christianity.\nThe dome dates from 1802. The bell tower was originally erected in 1387, with a height of some 70 meters. In 1662 a clock was added, the structure reaching 90 meters. After the destruction of 1693 it was rebuilt, with the addition of a 7.5 t  bell, the third largest in Italy after those in St. Peter's Basilica and in Milan Cathedral.\nThe parvise is accessed through a marble fa\u00e7ade culminating in a wrought iron .... decorated with 10 bronze statues of saints. The parvise is separated from the cathedral square by a balustrade in white stone, featuring five large statues of saints in Carrara marble.\n\n\n== Interior ==\nThe cathedral has a Latin cross groundplan, with a nave and two aisles. In the southern aisle are the baptistery and, at the first altar, a canvas of Saint Febronia of Nisibis by Borremans facing, on a pilaster, the tomb of the composer Vincenzo Bellini. Also on a pilaster between this aisle and the nave is the Baroque monument of Bishop Pietro Galletti. Also notable is the Chapel of St. Agatha.\nThe apse dates back to the original 12th-century construction: it features a medieval mullioned window and a late-16th-century choir by the Neapolitan artist Scipione di Guido. At the end of the north transept is the Chapel of the Holy Crucifix, by Domenico Mazzola (1577). It houses the tombs of members of the Aragonese branch of Sicily, including Kings Frederick III and Louis, John of Randazzo, and Constance.\nThe northern aisle has several 17th-century paintings of saints, including one by Borremans.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sources ==\nRas\u00e0 Napoli, Giuseppe (1984).

          "Having come back as it only opened at 4pm, the Cathedral isn't as imposing or jaw dropping as I was expecting, almost austere. Look for the old pillars made from I think volcanic rock. Square outside is great people watching place and has the elephant fountain,",
          "This is one among many historical churches in Catania. Located at the end of main street at main square.",
          "If you are in Catania, this is a must. Honestly, it is not the most impressive Basilica I have seen in Italy, but that doesn't mean it isn't impressive! The open piazza and the elephant fountain all make for great photo ops.",
          "Very, very nice and stunning building. It is located in the Piazza Duomo. Must to see. Do not miss visiting it.",
          "Visited the church today with friends. It is large inside with beautiful paintings and statues too look at. Tourists are not allowed in during the mass but worth the wait.",
          "Not as grand as some cathedrals in italy but still a must for catania. Can still see the parts from the pre-earthquake period. The facade us more impressive than the insude but tgat akso includes the tomb of Bellini",
          "I saw this cathedral at night and it was gorgeous. Definitely go to the City Center, even just to walk by this beautiful church!",
          "Beautiful cathedral occupying a prime spot in the city.some great statues adorn this church. Great that all are free to visit.",
          "The cathedral of the city patron saint is nice but I feel more spectacular churches in the city. Great location in this superb pizza.",
          "We just visited the cathedral for half an hour. It is more than enough to see everything you need. I just especially wanted to see the tomb of my beloved composer Vincenzo Bellini who was buried here. You can find his tomb at the right hand side when you enter the main entrance.",
          "The cathedral is pretty spectacular and big. Also the square is very wide and clean. We didn't see inside because it was closed but outside is relly beautiful.",
          "An impressive building from the outside but quite regular from the inside. Worth a look but I would not visit the inside.",
          "Catania presents a rather downtrodden image as you walk in from the port, but things get better once you reach the cathedral. It appears that if you want the view of the city, then it is best to go to the church across the road and pay the three euros to climb the cupola and",
          "Such an ancient beauty with great treasure under the cathedral which is nobody dare to touch cause whole catania will make those thieves disappeared!!",
          "Very bare interior. Most relics and ornamentation have been taken down, so other than the alter, there was little to see.",
          "the barqoue style facade is impressive. the interior of the cathedral is not as impressive as other italian cathedrals. some of the chappels are more interresting the the high altar the price for the visit is 2 euros",
          "Well worth a visit to this large cathedral. There are also thermal baths below for which you have to pay a small fee and an opportunity to climb to the dome and have good views over the city. Beware, the baths and dome are closed between 12 and 4pm (4.30pm on Sun), so go in the",
          "You never tire of these magnificent Sicilian Baroque structures and, as frequent in this earthquake zone, the site dates back to an earlier Norman venture. Harmonious design inside and out.",
          "Have been there but - compared to all the other churches in the world - it did not look different to the others. There might be other people who are impressed but I wasn\u00b4t.",
          "Visiting Catania means discovering the past and present that cohabit in a unique balance; it is found in people, in food, in monuments, in the atmosphere \u2764\ufe0f",
          "It seems wrong to give a cathedral only four stars but compared with many many in Italy I have seen, I felt it fair. The exterior and the entire duomo plaza are beautiful with the grey and white effect of the lava material.",
          "Quite lovely from the front but surprisingly plain (by Italian standards) inside. The tomb of Bellini is inside as are the remains of some Roman baths. The altar piece is magnificent.",
          "We had a city tour around Catania and then stopped to this lovely place. Worth of visit and get to know history of this place.",
          "These Cathedrals in italy and Spain are pieces of Art. They are so wonderful and rich in art. I like to visit the cathedral when I visit a new Italian city and in Sicily every Cathedral is a piece of art.",
          "Take the Time to have a Closer View at the Architecture. F\u00fcr church is really impressive. If you decide to go inside, Please Consider, it is a holy place. Act and dress accordingly",
          "When in Sicily, the many historic churches are not to be missed for lovers of art, architecture, and history \u2014 for some it may also be about religion or spirituality, but it need not be. While I saw people entering with bare shoulders, etiquette and respect, in my humble",
          "we bought our tickets for theCupola and up we went well worth the climb giving you amazing roof top views not to be missed",
          "This basilica is worth a visit. Its architecture is interesting. We were astonished to see that some people seem to sleep inside.",
          "We spent about 20 minutes here. Many of the paintings are dark and the interior is not nearly as interesting as other churches in Sicily.",
          "We visited this basilica and was really taken back at the character and the beauty of the building. There are lots to see inside.",
          "The cathedral dates to 1093 when it was constructed on the ruins of an earlier Roman Baths. The building has suffered a series of misfortunes throughout its history having been destroyed by earthquakes and fire. The present structure dates to 1711 with the dome added in 1802. It",
          "This is the main Catholic Church in Catania and is located in its main square. It contains elaborate frescos on its walls and dome, and beautifully carved figures on its main altar. While very nice, it is not as large or impressive as other European Cathedrals.",
          "This beautiful cathedral is one of the must sees in Catania. The inside is as beautiful as the outside.",
          "Plenty of beggars in the front of the Basilica Catedrale Sant'Agata and in the surroundings. Some interesting paintings on the walls inside.",
          "This is another beautiful Cathedral you must see. If you think the outside is stunning with it's statues and brilliant stone work, then inside will knock you out for a sixer. Murals, artwork, alters and a bust of a notable Franciscan priest are just some great things you will",
          "This is a beautiful place, very impressive. But it is shame that when I visited it seemed like some travellers were living there, were dancing, drinking and creating a nuisance. They also had their duvets and quilts over the gates of the place. It is such a shame that the local",
          "main place in catania .you my be confused with piazza duomo which is somewhere else in Catania.very nice",
          "A must see if you are in Catania, gorgeous architecture and views. If you have enough time you should take a tour inside.",
          "Beautiful architecture in the main square. Sadly closed when we visited but great to enjoy the building from the outside anyway. Lovely square",
          "great piece of architecture, nice desserts and beer opposite, right next to the fountain! quite impressive at night, difficult to miss!",
          "The duomo di Catania shows the beauty of the etnea city, it is also possible to go below the piazza duomo level from a tiny stairway inside the duomo yard",
          "Impressive building and if even inside was a.simple for a Catholic church architect and materials they used was really impressive.",
          "We visit it in the afternoon, The outlook is middle but inside is bigger than we expected. We enjoy the 30 minutes.",
          "The Basilica is located at Piazza Duomo. Admission is free. It's the seat of the Archbishops of Catania. It's been destroyed and rebuilt several times because of earthquakes and eruptions of Mt. Etna. It was originally constructed in 1078-1093. A must see - especially the",
          "Mass was in Italian, but beautiful. A little confusing with reserved seating, forces several people to move to other pews. Homeless people were provided shelter in back corner of Duomo; nice gesture for Xmas.",
          "Very expressive place at the heart of the city. We suggest to book your hotel near this place. so, you can reach many attractive places from there.",
          "We arrived at this church when there was a commemorative procession going on. Beautiful high baroque decorations.",
          "Must see Basilica when in Catania, without this blue Baroque style church Catania is nothing but small Sicilian city. You can simply enjoy the city vibes sitting in front of the cathedral.",
          "All the cities in Italy of any size have a cathedral. Some better that others. This one is middle of the road as far as the art . It has the vestiges of the Norman architecture of the area. Dont recommend a special trip out of the way to see it.",
          "Its one of 118 churches in the town and mostly rebuilt after various earthquakes. Just one end survives from its norman origin. There are some very interesting painted murals around the alter, the rest is forgettable.",
          "Impressive Duomo whic has been built and rebuilt several times due to devastation by earthquakes and Mt Etna eruptions of Lava. The last rebuild was done using lava rock. The architecture inside with the huge domes is very nice; and there are many such Duomo's that can be found",
          "A lovely place to visit when in Catania. A great old building in the square with plenty of activities going on.",
          "this was an impressive building as are all the buildings in the piazza well worth a visit along with the museums and other architectural delights on offer",
          "Well worth a visit if in Catania. Both the interior and exterior are stunning architecture examples. Not sure what else to add really . . . . . .",
          "In general Catania is dark, dirty and dreary city. In this same vein, the Cathedral de Sant Agata positioned on an open plaza a few blocks from the harbor was fairly traditional from the outside but relatively poorly light, unattractive and dreary inside. Much of the",
          "Interesting strolling around older Catania. Lots of restaurants and activities on and around the square. An old fashioned dancing class was being conducted by the central fountain as we walked by back to the car after dinner. Quite charming and gentle in this usually quite noisy",
          "This Cathedral is huge, and looks very plain from the outside. At night it is illuminated; the plaza around it is where people gather.",
          "The use of black lava for the entire interior makes this cathedral unique. It gets a very dark, sober mood, especially if the sun is not shining.",
          "Glad to be here on the last day of St. Agatha festival. You can see a lot of people filling the streets and bazaars full of Itallian local foods and tastes. And the church is huge and great!",
          "Finally I had the chance to visit it!! The temple is huge and chapel of the Holy Spirit is a great example of sicilian barocco. Very interesting both from a spiritual and an artistic point of view. The grave of Vincenszo Bellini, in the church was a really surprise for me.",
          "It's a beautiful church that has been built and rebuilt over the past thousand years under the smack of ancient earthquakes. The steeple is way newer.. Nonetheless, it has a presence and a beautiful interior...",
          "Well worth you time to visit - one of the highlights in any visit to Catania - particularly if you enjoy Cathedrals and historic buildings",
          "This is a big cathedral on a major square in the center of town. Very important site for Catania and worth a visit.",
          "A beautiful stop off during your days stroll. With all he cafes nearby you'll be able to enjoy the architectural views.",
          "Open during the day it seems to close in the evening, free to enter easy to find on the main square.",
          "As the title says... the Antipasti was possible the best I've ever eaten, every mouthful scrummy! Very friendly service and accommodating to children! We will be back !",
          "Interesting to see how lava was used in the construction - it looks like breeze block at first glance.",
          "Visited here on holiday right beside the square with the elephant beautiful building free to get in.",
          "Practically here is the city center and there are also other attractions and restaurants. It's a place full of tourists and policemen. So you're safe, just paying attention to personal belongings. The monuments themselves are very impressive and is a place full of history that",
          "Architecture and history are vivid experiences at Catania! Opera House, theater, School of sciences are particularly beautiful Spots in Duomo sorroundings.",
          "Visited for an unguided tour and to attend Sunday Morning Mass. The interior is finished in typical Southern Italian Bourbon style. Any visit is best followed by a coffee in one of the cafes on the piazza opposite.",
          "I have viated many churches in Italy. It is not the most extravagant, but still is the nicest you will find in Catania. It is free to visit but i suggest paying the 3\u20ac per person to viait the dome. You will be able to take city view pictures",
          "this important monument of local culture contains also la tomba di Bellini, the great maestro's tomb",
          "When it is too hot, there is fresh air inside, so you may consider a small rest there. The church is big but not so particular compared to Baroque churces in the southern Sicily",
          "As with all churches, this cathedral is free. It is well worth a visit to look at the tomb of Bellini, and the neo-classical architecture of the interior. The pulpit is a bit different and fits in well with the interior. The relics of the patron saint (St. Agatha) are in the",
          "We have been to Elefante many times. It's a great place to bring people visiting and is located within steps or walking distance to the fish market, gelato, shopping and of course the duomo and amphitheater. We love it here, rain or shine!",
          "Really relaxed area, might be a bit busy during evening times. Lovely elephant statue in the middle.",
          "The Neoclassical interior of the cathedral in Catania is a restrained building with less attention to decoration and more attention to refined elegance. The side chapels to S. Agata and others are worth looking at, as is the tomb to the composer Bellini. The exterior with its",
          "This is a nice church but after seeing so many churches in Italy and Sicily I wouldn't call it fantastic or a must see. If you were in Catania, and if you were in the Square, you should go to this church. But don't cry if you miss it.",
          "Free entry - maybe give the beggar on the door step your donation .. photography allowed. An interesting walk around - including Bellini's tomb - not a very ornate interior but still beautiful. They do close at midday for il reposa ( siesta ) ...",
          "What a beautiful piece of architecture. It is amazing that it still stands as it has been destroyed and rebuilt several times do the eruptions of Mt. Etna, and earthquakes. It started out as Norman architecture, and now because of all the damage rebuilds, it is now mostly",
          "The Duomo of Catania is one of the several buildings inscribed in the UNESCO world heritage list. It is worthy indeed. Magnificent basilica with fine baroque decoration.",
          "While en route to dinner, we stopped at the Duomo, which was closed. A large domed church across the street, however, we open and for 3 euros, you could climb to the top of the dome. It was fabulous! Views of Catania from the harbor to Mt Etna, with many domed church's in sight.",
          "Nothing spectacular - but stop by if you are in Catania - centrally located. Directly on a major square in the centre of Catania.",
          "If youve been to a few old churches in Europe this is pretty much the same. Very pretty from outside. Nothing exactly memorable about the inside. It IS closed during their afternoon break (like almost all not too touristy places in Italy!) which my friend and I weren't",
          "Wonderful place to be in this amazingly beautiful city. So much to see and explore and just enjoy being in the area of great history.",
          "Nice and interesting both inside and out . The visit is free but it not always open . So make sure you start your tour of the area visiting the Cathedral ,",
          "My wife and I visited the Sant\u2019 Agata Cathedral in Catania with some friends during a two-week vacation in Sicily. The Cathedral is situated in the Piazza del Duomo with its interesting elephant obelisk. Although the Cathedral\u2019s origins date back to Norman times, much of the",
          "We would walk past this beautiful cathedral as it was opposite our airbnb rental, never got tired of admiring it , in a busy location with alot of tours going into and around the cathedral. Nice to walk near it in the evening when the weather is cooler and less crowded.",
          "Unlike many Italian churches the Duomo has not got a largely flat fa\u00e7ade, but is richly varied with many projections, recesses and niches. Someone once described architecture as 'frozen music' and this magnificent example of Baroque taste is perfectly aligned to Italian opera:",
          "Italy is blessed with an abundance of magnificent Duomi and Catania is no exception. The interior and exterior are striking and inspiring.",
          "We were lucky to visit during the May festival and saw part of the service including the precession of Bishop's, which really brought this stunning church to life!",
          "What a great cathedral! it all restored, i came here when i was young it was dull and scary! but not today!!! it s great building, with great art! worth to see!",
          "As with most in Italy, this is a stunning Duomo. The architecture is magnificent. The square is clean and just wonderful. We were visiting friends that live in the area and they told us that this was a must see. They were right.",
          "Beautiful midevel church. Beautiful paintings,interior. Worth a visit if you like churches. It's the church for St Agatha, clearly an important saint for Catania.",
          "A wonderful Cathedral. Breathtaking both outside and in. Worth the admission to the side rooms to the sides of the main altar. A visit to Catania would not be complete without a visit.",
          "Most of the old buildings in Catania were build with lava stone thus a bit dark in colour. Nice square with the more attractive fish and vegetable market near by.",
          "After a couple of weeks in Sicily, your eyes are bleeding from the surfeit of churches and monasteries but this is a lovely enough example to add to the must see list. I will say it is only one of two churches we ventured into during our stay in Catania. It is quite pretty",
          "Worth a quick look, it has a pleasant pastel decor. Be careful, there are several people begging in this area.",
          "The Duomo was open only until 12:30pm the day of our visit. Climb to top is \u20ac3. Many churches in Catania are open only in the mornings or close for several hours during the afternoon.",
          "The square is nice, but the church isn't that impressive in the interior. You can have a quick walk inside, quite fast visit.",
          "The city of Catania is beautiful. We climbed to the top of the Duomo where you could see the port the whole city.",
          "We are practising Catholics so we went to Mass but I guess for non religious people it's probably worth just a quick look inside.",
          "This place makes it worth the trip. If you enjoy art and great pictures walk around and absorb, it gives you faith in the culture and you forget about the trash and crazy driving! Enjoy",
          "It's the big city church, worth a quick visit, but nowhere near as beautiful or interesting as some of Sicily's other stunning marble and mosaic-filled cathedrals.",
          "Beautiful inside and out. Definitely worth the visit. The piazza in front of it is a nice place as well.",
          "Impressive exterior but something of a disapointment inside, Rerlatively plain but still worth visiting.",
          "Impressive Baroque facade. Inside., very large nave. Solid decor. Not fancy. Wall paintings dating to 18th century. Poorly illuminated, making it hard to study properly. A miss.",
          "Beautiful church.. Amazing interiors. Good place for worship and relax.. Peaceful and relaxing.. Try to attend one of the Sunday services",
          "Catania' treasures were located in this church. It is worth to have a quick stop. The church is located at the end of Via Etnea.",
          "Just passed by and had a short look at this beautiful square. Very iconic landmark of Catania! It is a must see!",
          "Nice place for a walk, and if you are tourist same as me then you'll be able to make lots of nice selfies \ud83d\ude1c",
          "This cathedral with its beautifully crafted apses which survived the earthquake of 1693 is a \"must visit\" when in Sicily. It has a stunning Baroque fa\u00e7ade on which are tagged granite columns taken from the nearby Roman amphitheatre. Relics which are paraded through the city on",
          "Well, a complete must visit attraction in Catania, its magnificent cathedral, which is free to visit, and in a really nice square, full of shops and bars.",
          "A majestic interior with a cupola, tall transept and three apses. The three Norman apses and transept are original Norman. Worth seeing, and on the lovely Piazza Duomo. If this review is helpful then please indicate so below.",
          "I'm always impressed by the amount of effort and passion that went into building these cathedrals. This is no exception. For Catania, it is stunning. I found the interior particularly interesting- maybe because they were prepping for Carnivale, but also because it is brighter",
          "Very pleasant, photographs are permitted inside. So are dogs, which amused me. The duomo is free to visit and contains some interesting art of St Agneta. There are minimal things available to do in Catania, so definitely go here.",
          "Beautiful piece of art and architecture. Lovely style, very photogenic view. Lovely in the Piazza with same name.",
          "I visited this lovely cathedral right in the main Elephant Square of Catania, very close to the fish market. We visited during Christmas week, and even attended midnight mass on Christmas Eve and had the pleasure of seeing the processional led by the bishop holding Bambino",
          "Mooching around old buildings is a guilty pleasure of mine and the Cathedral in Catania is no exception. Destroyed and rebuilt several times (due to earthquakes), there is little bits of everything in what is now largely a baroque styled Duomo. Go in the off-season and you'll",
          "A very large open Pjazza in front of the Duomo,with The Elelphant statute in the middle of it,visited by people of every naation each day, and truly magnificent.The Dumo itself is worth visiting, so do not miss, down to the rght of the Duomo is a fish Market daily and around 5",
          "Our tour started in the heart of the old city center Piazza Duomo. The piazza is home to , U liotru, an elephant statue carrying an obelisk and the Cathedral di Sant' Agata or Saint Agatha. St Agata is patron saint of breast cancer patients. It is told that her breast were",
          "We went for a day out with our friends of a lifetime who live in Catania, and after our shopping day in Via Etnea (THE shopping desination of Catania!), they took us for a break in this part of the centre.. and it's really relaxing to look at! There's this big Cathedral, home to",
          "Catania Duomo is famous and is one of the many other churches you will visit in Catania and Sicily. Open all day, one can visit easily, attend a service or just sit around and rest, all for free.",
          "Really beautiful part of history in middle of then heart of Catania. Beautiful City with a such an bad luck and sad stories.",
          "Very bustling and colourful market, many cheap and good restaurants, and nice facad of the churches. Climbing up to the roof of the church of Santa Lucia gives impressive views of the city center, the sea, and the Etna.",
          "Have read that Catania is insustrial and relatively unattractive. In some ways this is true..a busting busy port with its associated shipping, cargo handling, commercial and industrial activities. I stayed in the historical center and enjoyed the attractions of Piazza",
          "A beautifully restored mix of all the symbols that make Catania special, the Duomo encompasses iconic images such as the elephant (Liotru), the black lava pavement, the fountain (acqua o linzolu) and the cathedral of course with Agata's crypt. I strongly recommend going at sun",
          "When you are in Catania it is very nice to just walk through the city and look around. This basilica right in the city centre is a good place to start after which you can visit the fish market or other places. Although a bit touristic still worth the visit.",
          "Each region of Italy is unique. The churches are all glorious and ornate and BEAUTIFUL! This one is amazing. If you have an opportunity to go, please do!",
          "Really beautiful cathedral which must be visited if you are in Catania. See if the Roman Baths are open within the cathedral enclosure too.",
          "Well worth a visit. Very impressive building inside and out. Fantastic paintings inside and amazing aritectural features outside. There was a service in progress on our visit.",
          "We bought I think on trip advisor or aviator. More people should take this tour. Walk around Catania seeing the sights learning history go through the fish market and taste food. Go around Catania and taste drinks, wines, foods, our guide Elena was awesome. Best tour ever!",
          "Worth a quick look if you're visiting Catania. The piazza out the front is really nice and surrounded by lovely architecture.",
          "Basilica Cattedrale Sant\u2019Agata is built on top of a Norman Cathedral built 11th century, which was repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes over the centuries. The transept and apse were the only surviving sections after the 1693 earthquake. The current cathedral was built 1709",
          "This Cathedral dedicated to St Agatha, is in the main piazza of Catania and is very busy with tourists. There are many tour groups around with guides so it doesn't feel like a place to of worship. However there is a chapel in which silence is expected. The baroque exterior is",
          "Tis cathedral lies on a very busy square in the centre of town less than 100 meters from the bustling fish market. Once you enter, however, you are transported to a serene and perhaps divine world of solitude. There is no need for signs asking for quiet as the building itself",
          "The Duomo is dominating the main sq in Catania. It was rebuilt several times due to earthquakes, but it retained its original Norman apses. The front facing the Piazza is Baroque. The inside is monumental, but I saw better in Sicily.",
          "based in the main square of catania. this building made a great backdrop for any selfie. clasing myself as being a bit of a photographer...i took several piks so i could come home and review this lovely building",
          "Looks like the whole city gathers in the Duomo Square of Catania in th evening, when heat is not that killing in July.. Doumo itself is obviously on this square. In the centre of the squere there is a monument: an elefant on the top of the coloumn. And some stairs bebeath,",
          "The cathedral is in the center of town on a huge open square. The inside of the cathedral is typical but impressive. Some of the foundation of the original building from Norman times can be seen.",
          "Great place to walk around and find some great shops and explore the night life . Just be aware , as the some places can be a little expense but overall . Enjoy and take on sites that you would only see in books or a movie.",
          "Architectural masterpiece, beautiful city, great food, lovely but little wee loud people. Adorable place.",
          "It is a must to visit and get information on the tragic death of the Patron Saint St Agatha. We were lucky to be on time for the celebrations of the feast of St. Agatha.",
          "Nice, humble but majestic church. Its nice to visit inside and take in the quaint life of the citizens who once built it.",
          "This cathedral has been turned from Romanesque into baroque, but done rather well. Slightly understated, from the outside its grey and white facades are the same as those of the rest of piazza duomo. Inside its slightly understated. Parts of the original floor can be seen and",
          "Piazza duomo has an amazing architecture, nice are to visit. a lot of shops and restaurants around the area so it will make your trip even better.",
          "August 17 is the day of St. Agatha and it the place to be. The litany is very nice and the fireworks are great and plenty.",
          "I loved the Duomo of Catania, stunning building in or out. A perfect venue for reflection that is dry or wait. All year around specially during the festivals around the year. A very pronounced building like most of them in Sicily",
          "very beautiful cathedral, and a lot of great detail. It houses the tomb of Bellini. several separate parts for prayer and for large central mass.",
          "As many travelers to Europe know, there are what seems like an unlimited number of churches and cathedrals, and after one sees a goodly number of them, the draw to see another is limited. However, I do recommend spending some time here. Decorations on the interior are",
          "Beautiful cathedral with interesting history and where St. Agatha is entombed. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "the entire plaza is a baroque masterpiece with the church as its centerpiece. Take a seat in a pew and absorb the sanctity.",

          "Well worth a visit, another lovely ornate Catholic cathedral. Nothing else to say about it really !!!",
          "This was a beautiful piece of architecture located in the center of Catania. We enjoyed the baroque beauty from both inside and out. It is definitely worth a visit!",
          "This cathedral is situated in a very pleasant piazza, where there is a lot of evening activity. The piazza is copied after a church in Rome called Santa Maria de la Minerva, which has the obelisk and elephant in front. It was fun to compare them since we visit Rome a lot and",
          "Our first views were at night and the square and fountain were lite up making for a romantic setting. Lots of activity during the day and many shops and restaurants adjoining. One evening the next square north had an outdoor screen setup to watch the eurocup. Thousands milled",
          "Generally, Catania is known for its baroque architecture. The Cathedral is one main example of that. In my opinion, it will be a nice visit for everyone, because you can find out more about the city and its history, and also, admire the architecture and the artsy details.",
          "In front of the cathedral is street market with unpleasant smell and atmosphere. Streets were dirty long time after market was closed. Building is surrounded by other ageing buildings . Sadly we couldn't realy enjoy the view",
          "Majestically elegant! Breathtaking! You should especially walk by in the evening so you can enjoy its illumination.",
          "Situated in the main square of Catania, a real must see, very beautiful! Also the steps provided a great resting place, where everyone including us just liked to sit and watch the world go by, maybe enjoying the odd ice cream that was available from the many surrounding cafes!",
          "Lovely cathedral, a must see in Catania. The surrounding plazas are lovely as well and worth visiting when you are in the area.",
          "Certainly a must see on a city tour albeit if short on time I would prefer the amphitheater over the Duomo.",
          "Well located, the architecture is an ancient one while it is being well kept. It attracts many tourists and groups. Visit + Pictures",
          "The duomo is beautiful; the inside is interesting . It is worth seeing(, not breathtaking) and it is free, beside it is the center of historic center and a central point in Catania. Hop on hop off departure from there. Tourist service the company is located next to it. Three",
          "The facade is quite beautiful, but the paintings inside are mediocre at best. The biggest disappoint -- as is often the case in Italy, the things you really want to see are in the area roped off for private prayer, so unless you are will to fake it, they remain inaccessible. The",
          "Excellent choice of a visit if you're interested in Baroque Churches, there is some time restrictions checkout their website or other review as we did",
          "I must admit to visiting a great many churches in Sicily and they were all beautiful in their unique style. No two were the same. This church was big and atmospheric and well worth a visit.",
          "Winding down after 5 weeks of Sicily travel by train and bus makes you wonder if you are up to see another church. Well I did visit the Basillica Cattedrale Sant' Agata. Dominating Piazza Duomo it is one of several sites to see while in the Piazza. From the exterior Agata is",
          "A very beautiful building in a lovely square- the first of three attractive square full of eating places.",
          "Only in Sicily will you encounter churches begun in Arabo-Norman style in the 12th or 13th century and later given the full baroque treatment. The duomo in Catania has the massive stone walls and three apses of Norman work along with baroque side chapels and an imposing baroque",
          "It's a great cathedral with imposing dimensions and beautiful fa\u00e7ade but signs if neglect on its exterior are troubling.",
          "Plenty of space to view the interior of the building lovely marble floor and guided font. Not too ornate. Closes at 12 noon.",
          "The cathedral is an impressive building and the interior is equally so. However after visiting Monreale etc this becomes just another very nice large religious building. Worth a half hour though",
          "The feeling on entering is one of serenity and peace. Unlike a large number of Cathedrals Duomo do Catania is joyously understated. A sense of devotion will overwhelm you.",
          "The Duomo is an absolutely stunning building and a must see if passing through or visiting the area. Unfortunately we coudkbt go inside so I'm not sure whether it was the timing or if it's just closed to the public full stop. But it is still impressive from the outside.",
          "Like most of the bigger churches in Sicily it is worth a visit, but not outstanding, so schedule a short visit.",
          "The cathedral is not as large as some, I have seen. It is, however, beautifully decorated inside and also has nice statues around in the garden outside. As it is a working building, it closes for siesta at 12 Noon and re-opens in the afternoon, so it is good to visit in the",
          "The duomo, situated at the end of Via Etnea is in a lovely open square, with nice cafes facing. Free entry. Absolutely stunning",
          "Cathedral Duomo was wonderful, historical and in the city center. Hardly recommended to be visited. Gorgeous.",
          "I visited the Duomo on a morning walk around Catania - it was a bit of a flying visit as we just had the one day in the area, but the Duomo was certainly one of the highlights. From the outside the cathedral stands majestically on the piazza, and wandering inside (no charge to",
          "We enjoyed our stroll down Via Etna and shopping. Arriving at the Piazza we took pictures and entered the Duomo and after spending less than ten minutes were ushered out as they close at noon!",
          "I spent four days in Sicily . Nina with a lovely driver of this company, without a doubt the most ' beautiful were the greek theater of Taormina the cathedral of Catania , Ortigia , and the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento . We were lucky with the weather , and more ' lucky to",
          "I could have spent a lot more time in and around the Duomo but our schedule didn't permit it. It's a beautiful building inside and out; and as one reviewer put it, not over-the-top. Don't miss the St. Agatha Chapel and the tomb of the operatic composer Vincenzo Bellini.",
          "...Cathedral of Catania make you traveling into the past and feel the medieval atmosphere...architecture are really stunning and interior fabulous, despite simple...",
          "This is a high light in catania, if you are lucky you can visit during the Saint Agatha festival days when all the houses are decorated and the promenade in being done. Enjoy real Sicily.",
          "A genuine treasure. Despite being re-modelled and rebuilt several times, it retains a unique quality. Well worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful as it is you can have too much Baroque and this Duomo had just the right blend of baroque with less ornamented arches which were calm and serene. We loved it.",
          "We arrived on 6/2/16 and seen what seemed to be a children's carnival with hundreds of children in costume and bags of confetti enjoying themselves. We realised we had missed a festival of St Agata the previous couple of days. We came back on 12/2/16 to see the cathedral",
          "I visited during the feast of St. Agatha and the Duomo was en fete, richly decorated. An important landmark in Piazza Duomo spilling out the festive atmosphere with the procession with the statue and loads of lighted candles.",
          "In Italy you can basically wander into any ol' church you find along the way. And some of them are pretty darn amazing! However, I thought the piazza duomo is best enjoyed outside, with a cup of granita. The inside of the church is not that special. Although there are some",
          "We visited many places in Sicily and the memory of some will stay with me for a very long time and this is certainly one of those.",
          "Sicilian baroque is famous and magnificent and this is one example. The monumental cathedral with Saint Agatha cult is very nice.",
          "This was another nice Cathedral. The people outside begging is a big distraction. Certainly worth spending a little time here.",
          "A great place to visit while in Catania. Hang out in the elephant square nearby, grab an espresso, and enjoy the people-watching!",
          "Sicilian Baroque, more particularly Catanese Baroque, is exemplified here. Some Norman bits, tomb of Bellini. The church in the side street adjacent is worth a look as well. On the main square.",
          "Love the architecture. Really loved walking through it. Don't forget to check out the Roman baths beneath the church. Facing the church, the entrance is to he very right of the building 10euros to get in (a little pricey) but still interesting non the less and very few people",
          "In the middle of piazza duomo, duomo di catania is very interesting building specially by sculptures and architectures. You must visit that nice cathedral when in catania.",
          "Fabulous views from the top of this, up a very narrow stairway, for three euros. Inside was quiet and contemplative.",
          "I didn't go inside the Duomo but just stayed around in Piazza Duomo to watch the families in the evening. Catania has a very different feel to Palermo- much less 'menacing' and tense - it felt like a family city. However, it's probably not worth making a special trip here,",
          "An imposing building with a spectacular interior, worth a visit, however bear in mind it is closed from 13.00 hrs to 16.00 hrs",
          "A huge Cathedral forming the heart of the city. Also popular on a Sunday morning service that all the pews were full and the tourists stood in large numbers at the entrance lis ending to the sermon from a priest so far away it was hard to guess his age. Not decorated to excess",
          "With impressive architecture and beautiful sculptures, \"Duomo di Catania\" is a must in any tourist route from Catania",
          "Very nice, impressive place. If you go inside, there are great presence of history. You can feel the breath of history and people, who build this building. good place to trust all areas of your life to Lord Jesus Christ.",
          "I've been here to this church many times during my trips to Catania, this church is located exactly in the main Piazza Duomo, I think even here lie the remains of the saint patron of the city or Santa Agata. The church is very large, the ornamental facade embellished by statues",
          "Very impressive outside, somewhat Spartan inside. Worth the visit while visiting Catania. Nice garden with statues near the duomo.",
          "There is. To much to see in Catania, but the duomo is impressive with statuary surrounding the grounds. The interior is a typically ornate building showing the power and wealth of the church. Worth a visit.",
          "its where everyone meets. :) nice church surrounded by lots of caf\u00e9s and souvenir shops. not much to tell as most italian cities have a duomo of their own. :)",
          "Large, in the heart of the city this Duomo has 3 original apses and 6 (Norman) transepts. The view from the Piazza is impressive Baroque. here is the tomb of the composer Bellini.",
          "You cant miss this place.Its stands tall and grand overlooking the piazza.It is simply beautiful and should not be missed.Its free to get in but one should put a small donation in the box .Its great after your visit to have a coffee and a delicious sicilian cake in one of the",
          "Every inch of the basilica is as beautiful as the fa\u00e7ade.The statues are HUGE. It faces a large plaza, perfect for a leisurely caf\u00e9' and people watch. The plaza also contains Catania's famous Elephant obelisk. When facing the Duomo look high up to the left and you will see",
          "Catanea's cathedral was our first Sicilian church: we loved the facade, with its colours and harmony, and the interior is a great introduction to the 'Sicilian soul' of its major churches.",
          "Well worth a visit to the Duomo, much larger than it looks. A church were you can see ancient roman pillars inside. Worth a visit to square outside that often has many things happening.",
          "A very authentic place, not spoiled by touristic activities. During our visit to the place we witnessed a funeral of a young person in a white coffin which was very moving.",
          "Free to enter and full of historical artefacts as well as stunning architecture & artwork. There is a separate side chapel for those who want to spend some time for quiet adoration.",
          "It can be difficult to get into the cathedral as it's in use for a lot of the time. But if you time it right, it's worth going inside and spending half an hour looking around. Then you can go into Piazza Duomo and visit one the excellent local restaurants or cafes.",
          "The Duomo in Catania has wonderful Sicilian baroque architecture and beautiful statuary. From the plaza in front of the catherdral, you can access other churches, fountains and a tour train that shows you other landmarks in Catania.",
          "Lovely and quite square, with potential for some good photographic shots. Exactly in the front one can see the statue of the elephant, an icon of Catania.",
          "Cannot beat the regal nature of this building - amazing restoration work on it - following the volcano of 1692!",
          "The original Norman cathedral (built above the ruins of the Roman Achillean Baths) was partially destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake and refashioned in Baroque style in the early 18th century. The fa\u00e7ade incorporates granite Corinthian columns, and is surmounted by marble",
          "After traveling around Sicily for a week we spent our last day in Catania. We'd had a wonderful time up to this point. We were having minor trouble with our rental car when we arrived downtown near the Duomo - we couldn't get the door locks to engage. We decided to take it to",
          "Catania is like a city that has just come out of a war. The place is pretty at the centre - the rest is covered in graffiti and feels very unsafe for a family - it is so run down and depressing I would never visit again with a small child. Never. If you are here for a few days",
          "It's not only the Duomo di Catania, the whole city is just wonderful. Full of young people because there is a very large university. For us it's the most beautiful city in Sicily.",
          "Nice duomo to visit. Very big building with baroque characteristics . Not as nice as in other famous baroque cities on the other site of the island ( and Puglia ) but worth a visit when in the neighborhood.",
          "The duomo di catania was one of the highlights of the trip. The artwork inside is stunning and the architecture is beautiful and well kept. Being religious, it was also a beautiful experience in that regard. The only thing I didn't appreciate were phones ringing and people",
          "The Cathedral is not always open. They close at 12 until 4 pm. Interior is very nice. Free access. Very spacious. Some gypsis sitting at the entrance begging for money.",
          "A striking square, but eating here can be cheaper. Go to Trattoria Giglio Rosso, Via S. Anna 19, some 500 metres away, for excellent food in a courtyard with friendly staff and fair prices.",
          "The Duomo and the square around it are beautiful and spots i'll never forget in Catania. The dumo is beautiful inside, as are almost all maintained buildings of the era. I hope to return someday.",
          "This cathedral is right on the main square in Catania and is free to visit, so if you are in the square it is definitely worth popping in for 15 minutes or so. It's a stunning building from the outside, and while the inside isn't ornate it is still worth a look and it's nice and",
          "This is one of the most beautiful squares in Sicily, made of lava stones with the big stone Elephant in the middle of it. The is squared is also home of city's town hall, cathedral, museums, fountain with a river passing by an amazing fish market.",
          "This church is so pretty on the outside and looks stunning in the sunshine - great for photos. It's quite plain on the inside though worth popping in - there are some good paintings and the alter is decorated and quite lovely.",
          "the central square of Catania is full of surprises and the Duomo is beautiful. There is so much to see in Catania and so many people just give it a miss and move on to Taormina or Siracusa. So stop a few nights here amd have a good look around. You will like what you see,",
          "Not the grandest cathedral, but worth visiting. Not as over the top as some, which may disappoint. But it is a lovely calm space to spend a little time in.",
          "very impressive and the time that i was there it was very peaceful the hordes have not yet penetrated this location",
          "I'm not a religous person, but you can't fail but to be impressed at this wonderful old building. Well worth a visit if you're in Catania",
          "It is right in the city center so you won't miss it. At the end of the Via Etnea. We passed it often.",
          "Good outside. slightly dull inside . On main square which is lively with the Catania Elephant in the middle.",
          "The cathedral is, as you'd expect, in the historic centre of Catania and quite some building. The interior is impressive, and note Bellini's tomb on the right-hand side, near the main entrance. Although he died in 1835, it wasn't until 1876 that his remains were moved to the",
          "The Duomo and Piazza are a wonder to see. It is surrounded by tourists, locals and plenty of beggars. Beware and hang on to your belongings. The cathedral has been destroyed and rebuilt several times because of earthquakes and eruptions of the nearby Mount Etna. It was",
          "The Duomo and Piazza are wonderful. Busy place with Historic buildings. And don't for to see the morning fish market behind the Piazza. It was amazing. I love the out door markets in Italy with all the fresh fish fruit a vegetables.",
          "The Duomo di Catania is the most important church in Catania. The inside is dramatic and beautiful. It is very easy to walk to and is on an only pedestrian way.",
          "Resurrection procession and Easter Mass was very nice, this is worth a visit. On the square and in front of the church are many of the beggars, watch out for your valuables, they are a little violent.",
          "We have been in many Cathedrals and everyone is different but beautiful..Take your time and sit..look up and around and enjoy the beauty of these Cathedrals..We always leave a euro or two to help in restoration and keeping them open..Enjoy this beautiful Cathedral",
          "The Duomo di Catania is beautiful and most definitely eye-catching. The unique St. Agatha features (patron saint of Catania) make it especially interesting, but my favorite part is what the Duomo contributes to the general atmosphere in the square. Multiple days during the week,",
          "The centre of Catania religious life. Here rest Sant'Agata relics, object of a great religious event lasting every year from February 3 to February 6",
          "Catania is a city not in the Focus of tourists.but you can find fine examples of Greek,staufer Kings and baroque architecture.the duomo is typically for the Lava Stone buildings.together with the townsquare and the fishmarket worth a visit.i like this city and the",
          "What I was very impressed with was the lectern that was sculpted metal with many reliefs on it. The altar also had similar carvings. Lots of details on both of them. Impressive duomo.",
          "The cathedral sits within a large square in the centre of town. The buildings are black and white and made of lava stone. Unique and worth a visit. Town centre is compact for walking.., but we did notice the little tourist train in the square if you find walking is limited.",
          "The church is beautiful but the people attending the morning mass are very noisy and they are only interested in the statue of St Agatha",
          "This imposing Cathedral, in typical dark, Catanese Baroque Houses the most venerated saint in all of Catania - Sant'Agata. The Catanese celebrate her feast from February 3-5 when the procession lasts for 36 hours or more. An event not to be missed!!",
          "I was not real impressed with Catania! This Duomo though was spectacular! The cathedral there was so gorgeous! I finally also found the rosary's I had been looking for and they were not expensive either! Sold them in the cathedral. Were very pretty too!",
          "The duomo di Catania, is truly spectacular! It was majestic and well preserved. Truly a hidden gem. If you visit in the summer make sure to see the procession of the partitioned saint of the city, Saint Agatha. A very different experience.",
          "If you are in the area take a stroll past and have a quick glance inside, the exterior is more majestic than the interior. You don't need to spend a lot of time here.",
          "Amazing, extraordinary. It is worth taking a stroll inside, but outside the architecture is very beautiful.It is in the main square, so you won't miss it.(Well, you shouldn't!)",
          "I got a chance to see this Cathedral during the day and then at night, lit up with a full moon over it. I just fell in love with the facade. The interior is...the interior (and I can't say that the Patroness of Catania's story is a pleasant one). If you like Cathedrals, go ahead",
          "Probably had seen to many cathedrals by the time we saw this one, but only bit of interest in my opinion was Bellini's grave. You obviously will pop in if in Catania, as far more interesting things round about the Cathedral so you will be in the area but 5 mins will do.",
          "big and cold, visit to jewellery exhibition was worth wile. the cathedral is almost bare from the inside but it is \"grand\"",
          "Stunning architecture and paintings, Never seen so many cathedrals and churches so close together. The cathedrals are like museums, so much history.",
          "A typical Italian cathedral - no more, no less - but certainly worth a visit just to see Bellini's tomb.",
          "Another piazza, not much around but a few churches, that I'm not too keen on. Someone else may have a bit more interest.",
          "the duomo is very large with high coloms,but for a duomo like that ,no painting on the ceiling and on the sides.it is very very old duomo dedicated to santa agatha,celebrating her feast on 5 th february in the streets of catania",
          "Inside, I was delighted to find an absence of OTT gothic; instead, a restful space despite the bustle.",
          "It is a marvelous unique architecture building! People from all over the world came there every year to visit it, take pictures and listen to the religious service",
          "unusual combination of lava and other materials were used to build this Cathedral, and it is also on top of Roman Baths. Not especially beautiful but interesting. The piazza outside has an obelisk with a lava elephant atop.",
          "Sicily has many striking buildings. One can consume a lot of time admiring the structure along with absorbing the history. This is a wow factor. I was stunned when I looked up the the (city up stairs)",
          "This is an amazing old building near tons of other amazing old buildings and from an architectural and historic perspective it's all very impressive. BUT - it's and awful dirty town. Pity, as I'd loved to have hung around more and looked at the architecture - but pick pockets,",
          "The Duomo di Catania from Sicily, Italy , is a marvelous unique architecture building! People from all over the world came there every year to visit it, take pictures and listen to the religious service",
          "It didn't open for the hours it said in our guidebook - it'd closed by 12 noon when we tried to visit, but it stands as a fine centrepiece in this massive, bustling city. We waited and did get in at 4pm, renovation work going on, but the alter and pulpit were particularly fine,",
          "Usual as our whole italy trip is on July 2014, 9 out of 10 duomo is on reconstruction. Not grand and very dim.",
          "The chapel is lovely, I believe it's still undergoing some renovations, but the inside and outside are both worth a visit.",
          "A beautiful and interesting church to look around. Outside of the cathedral is an elephant statue made fom the lava stoneof Etna. There is also a tourist train departing from outside the cathedral which takes you on a 30 minute city tour for 5 euros, with English commentary.",
          "The outside is very stunning, but inside they are currently renovating the church which kept us from seeing the altar at all. No proper English description of where to go for tour or the tower. Closes for siesta, so go before noon or early evening. No tourist visits during holy",
          "Beautiful stunning just make sure you go either in the morning or afternoon as they close for between 1 and 430.",
          "We did the tour to have the view from the top. Be careful to check closing times of the duomo. I believe on Thursday afternoon it was closed, so we came back Friday morning. Enjoyed a stunning view.",
          "The cathedral was rebuilt several times due to eruptions and earthquakes, that is why today it is very sober : a little bit too \"white\" for me. But the organ and the altar are very beautiful.",
          "We were very much enjoyed to visit Duomo di Catania. One of additional sentiments to visit it was the Godfarther's Capo del Capi virtual presence there. Duomo decoration is sober but very much elegant .3 seats are placed at the main altar. So we decided that the board of Capo",
          "Large interesting church and buildings set in Duomo square where the elephant fountain is... a nice place to relax and take some photos. you also catch the fun train and city tour bus from here.",
          "The front of the cathedral is very imposing with beautifully carvings, a dome & bell tower. I found the inside rather restrained with the most decorous parts being the chapels and the paintings in the isles.",
          "It has been a few years since I have last visited Catania and visiting the Duomo again brought back lots of nice memories.",
          "We considered this visit to be very expensive for the 10 mins we were given in the Cript. It could have been so interesting with a proper guide. One of the group did not speak Italian so lost out even more. They need to have guides who speak other languages.",
          "when you are there, visit the Cathedral Museum which is next door. Magnificent sculptures and arts and crafts",
          "Great piece of architecture and house of worship. Lovely details; quiet beauty and ornate details as well. The dome is simple, clean 'lines' inspiring intimate moments in a rather large building.",
          "it is very big, if you pop in at mess time you will be delighted as a live choir was singing when we arrived there",
          "A beautiful ancient city, filled with magnificent structures. you can see the lava flow from Mt Etna explosion in the 1500's, and the rebuild of the city. Found old Roman ruins, half of which are covered by the flow, quite impressive. tons of cafes, eateries, and modern",
          "Duomo is one the top things that you should visit in Catania. It is very difficult to miss it because of the central location. Also the entrance is free. You can visit Duomo for free. Church dedicated to St. Agatha holds some paintings but the impression is just ok.",
          "The Duomo is not so much a castle as a fortress, incorporating aspects of a much older structure - as you walk around, those things that look like mill wheels set into the ground are actually the bases of ancient columns, some of which (notably near the chapel to the right of",
          "My partner and I visited the duomo in Catania. Be aware of the opening times as its not always open. It's a lot nicer on the outside then the inside and free entry.",
          "Some of the smaller churches are much more impressive inside than the cathedral. The other St Agatha churches are all nearby and are much more interesting, they are rarely open though",
          "Good entrance for disabled but you must be aware when it is open to the public. Lots to see including old Roman baths.",
          "Destroyed and rebuilt several times because of eruptions of the Etna volcano, earthquakes and fires, rebuilt in Baroque style, it still keeps some traces of the original Norman apses. The Duomo is dedicated to Saint Agatha, patron the Catania. The \"Piazza Duomo\" has in the",
          "This is one of many nice churches in Catania. While not as large or elaborate as other cathedrals we visited throughout Europe, it is one of the major tourist sites in the city and is located in the main piazza. It\u2019s known for containing the tomb of St Agatha and the composer",
          "Particularly regarding the cathedral your viewing pleasure depends how much homework you do in advance. As a lover of Bellini I was pleased to see his tomb and site of burial. The statue on the boulevard is also marvellous. The general ambience on the main street is nothing to",
          "We spent a lovely hour here. It wasn't too hectic or noisy despite the ever present Italian school parties.",
          "An amazing historical monument. Placed right in the center of Catania, it attracts tourists of different religious beliefs and nationalities.",
          "Dedicated to the city's patron saint, Sant'Agata, this beautiful cathedral presents an elegant Baroque fa\u00e7ade, a cupola, beautiful columns. Besides, in it's interior is the tomb of the great Italian composer Vincenzo Bellini and also the remains of some Aragonese rulers.",
          "A beautiful church with the tomb of St Agatha and the tomb of Bellini. Again a nice cool place to escape the din and crowds of the Piazzo",
          "I have travelled widely in Europe and wouldn't go out of my way to visit this chapel. That said, there isn't a great deal else to see in Catania once you have visited this square. The main shopping street, Via Etnea leads off it and is refreshing for it's lack of multi national",

        "wiki": "Catania (UK: , US: , Sicilian and Italian: [ka\u02c8ta\u02d0nja] (listen)) is the second largest city in Sicily, after Palermo, and among the ten largest cities in Italy. Located on Sicily\u2019s east coast, it faces the Ionian Sea. It is the capital of the 58-municipality region known as the Metropolitan City of Catania, which is the seventh-largest metropolitan city in Italy. The population of the city proper is 311,584, while the population of the Metropolitan City of Catania is 1,107,702.Catania was founded in the 8th century BC by Chalcidians Greeks. The city was almost completely destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake in 1169.However, by the 14th century, and into the Renaissance period, Catania was one of Italy's most important cultural, artistic and political centres. It was the site of Sicily\u2019s first university, founded in 1434. It has been the native or adopted home of some of Italy's most famous artists and writers, including the composers Vincenzo Bellini and Giovanni Pacini, and the writers Giovanni Verga, Luigi Capuana, Federico De Roberto and Nino Martoglio.\nThe city has been devastated several times by volcanic eruptions from nearby Mount Etna, the most violent of which was in 1669. And it suffered through another severely damaging earthquake in 1693.Catania today is the industrial, logistical, and commercial center of Sicily. Its airport, the Catania-Fontanarossa Airport, is the largest in Southern Italy. \nHowever, it is also noted for its history, culture, architecture, and gastronomy. The section of the city known as the \u201cold town\u201d features some of the most striking examples of baroque architecture in Italy, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe ancient indigenous population of the Sicels named their villages after geographical attributes of their location. The Sicilian word, katane, means \"grater, flaying knife, skinning place\" or a \"crude tool apt to pare\". Other translations of the name are \"harsh lands\", \"uneven ground\", \"sharp stones\", or \"rugged or rough soil\". The latter etymologies are easily justifiable since, for many centuries following an eruption, the city has always been rebuilt within its black-lava landscape.Around 263 BC, the city was variously known as Cat\u012dna (Latin: [\u02c8kat\u026ana]) and Cat\u0103na (Latin: [\u02c8katana]; Ancient Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 [kat\u00e1n\u025b\u02d0]). The former has been primarily used for its supposed assonance with catina, the Latin feminization of the name catinus. Catinus has two meanings: \"a gulf, a basin or a bay\" and \"a bowl, a vessel or a trough\",  thanks to the city's distinctive topography.\nAround 900, when Catania was part of the emirate of Sicily, it was known in Arabic as Balad al-f\u012bl (\u0628\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644) and Mad\u012bnat al-f\u012bl (\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644), respectively meaning \"the Village (or Country) of the Elephant\" and \"the City of the Elephant\". The Elephant is the lava sculpture over the fountain in Piazza Duomo: most likely a prehistoric sculpture that was reforged during the Byzantine Era, it appears to be a talisman that was reputedly powerful enough to protect the city from enemies and to keep away misfortune, plagues, or natural calamities. Another Arab toponym was Qa\u1e6d\u0101niyyah (\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629), allegedly from the Arabic word for the \"leguminous plants\". Pulses like lentils, beans, peas, broad beans, and lupins were chiefly cultivated in the plains around the city well before the arrival of Aghlabids. Afterwards, many Arabic agronomists  developed these crops and the citrus orchards in the area around the city.\nThe toponym W\u0101d\u012b M\u016bs\u00e1 (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0649), or \"the Valley of Moses\" (from the Arabic name of the Simeto River), was rarely used.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCatania is located on the east coast of the island of Sicily, at the foot of Mount Etna.\nAs observed by Strabo, the location of Catania at the foot of Mount Etna has been both a curse and a blessing. On the one hand, violent outbursts of the volcano throughout history have destroyed large parts of the city, whilst on the other hand the volcanic ashes yield fertile soil, especially suited for the growth of vines. (Strab. vi. p. 269)\nTwo subterranean rivers run under the city; the Amenano, which surfaces at one single point south of Piazza Duomo, and the Longane (or Lognina).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Csa\" (Mediterranean Climate). It has hot summers, one of the hottest in the whole country of Italy (a feature characterising nearly every month). Temperatures of 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are surpassed almost every year a couple of times,Winters are mild with chilly nights (not rare peaks around 20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F) . Most of precipitation is concentrated from October to March, leaving late spring and summer virtually dry (some years there is no rain for 3\u20134 months). The city receives around 500 millimetres (20 inches) of rain per year, although the amount can vary greatly from year to year (wettest over 1,200 millimetres or 47 inches, driest under 250 millimetres or 9.8 inches,).\nDuring winter nights lows can occasionally go under 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Highs under 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) can happen during winter. Snow, due to the presence of Etna that protects the city from the northern winds, is an uncommon occurrence, but occasional snow flurries have been seen over the recent years especially in the hilly districts, more substantial in the northern hinterland. More recently, light snowfalls occurred on 9 February 2015, 6 January 2017 and 5 January 2019, but the last heavy snowfall dates back to 17 December 1988.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn January 2015, there were 315,601 people residing in Catania, of whom 47.2% were male and 52.8% were female. Minors (people under age 18) totalled 20.50 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 18.87 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners).\nThe average age of Catania residents is 41 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Catania declined by 3.35 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85 percent. The reason for this population decline in the comune di Catania is mainly due to a large segment of the population leaving the city centre to go to live in the uptown residential areas of the comuni of the Metropolitan area. As a result of this, while the population in the comune di Catania declines, the population of the hinterland comuni increases making the overall population of the Metropolitan area increase.The current birth rate of Catania is 10.07 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births. As of 2006, 98.03% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant groups come from Sub-Saharan Africa: 0.69%, South Asia: 0.46%, and from other European countries (particularly from Ukraine and Poland): 0.33%.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nAround 729 BC, the ancient village of Katane was occupied by Chalcidian Greek settlers from nearby Naxos along the coast. It became the Chalcidian colony of Kat\u00e1n\u0113 under a leader named Euarchos (Euarchus) and the native population was rapidly Hellenised.\nThucydides states that it came into existence slightly later than Leontini (modern Lentini), which he claims was five years after Syracuse, or 730 BC.The settlement's acropolis was on the hill of Monte Vergine, a defensible hill immediately west of the current city centre. The port of Catania appears to have been much frequented in ancient time and was the chief place of export for the corn of the rich neighbouring plains.\n\n\n=== Greek Catania ===\nIn ancient times Catania was associated with the legend of Amphinomos and Anapias, who, on occasion of a great eruption of Etna, abandoned all their property and carried off their aged parents on their shoulders. The stream of lava itself was said to have parted, and flowed aside so as not to harm them. Statues were erected to their honour, and the place of their burial was known as the Campus Piorum; the Catanaeans even introduced the figures of the youths on their coins, and the legend became a favorite subject of allusion and declamation among the Latin poets, of whom the younger Lucilius and Claudian have dwelt upon it at considerable length.Catania was the birthplace of the philosopher and legislator Charondas (late 6th c. BC) who introduced his celebrated laws there. His legislation was extended to the other Chalcidic cities, not only of Sicily, but of Magna Graecia also, as well as to his own country. It is evident that Catania had close relations with these other cities during this time.\nIt was residence of the poets Ibycus and Stesichorus (c. 630\u2013555 BC), who was buried in a magnificent sepulchre outside one of the gates, hence its name of Porta Stesichoreia. Xenophanes (c. 570-475 BC), one of the founders of the Eleatic school of philosophy, also spent the latter years of his life in the city so that it was evidently, at an early period, a place of cultivation and refinement.\nCatania appears to have retained its independence up to the reign of the despot Hieron of Syracuse, whereupon in 476 BC he expelled all the original inhabitants of Catania and replaced them with those he ruled over at Leontini \u2013 said to have numbered no less than 10,000, consisting partly of Syracusans and Peloponnesians. At the same time he changed the city's name to \u0391\u1f34\u03c4\u03bd\u03b7 (A\u00edtn\u0113, Aetna or \u00c6tna, after the nearby Mount Etna, and proclaimed himself the Oekist or founder of the new city. For this he was celebrated by Pindar, and after his death he received heroic honours from the citizens of his new colony.A few years after the death of Hieron and the expulsion of Thrasybulus, the Syracusans combined with Ducetius, king of the Sicels, to expel the newly settled inhabitants of Catania, who went on to settle in the fortress of Inessa (to which they gave the name Aetna). The old Chalcidic citizens were reinstated to the city in 461 BC.The period that followed appears to have been one of great prosperity for Catania, as well as for the Sicilian cities in general.\nIn the Peloponnesian War during the great Athenian expedition to Sicily  in 415 BC, the Catanaeans at first refused to allow the Athenians into their city, but after the latter had forced an entrance, they found themselves compelled to honour the alliance of their invaders after a famous speech that Alcibiades would have made in front of the assembly. Catania became the headquarters of the Athenian army throughout the first year of the expedition, and the base of their subsequent operations against Syracuse. After the defeat of the Athenians it was open to attack by Syracuse but was saved by the Carthaginian invasion of Sicily in 409 BC.\nBut in 403 BC it fell into the power of Dionysius I of Syracuse, who plundered the city and sold its citizens as slaves, after which he populated it with Campanian mercenaries. These, however, quit in 396 BC and retired to Aetna, on the approach of the great Carthaginian armament under Himilco and Mago. After the great naval Battle of Catana (397 BC) which was fought off Catania and in which the latter defeated Leptines of Syracuse, the city fell into the hands of the Carthaginians.Calippus, the assassin of Dion of Syracuse, held Catania for a time (Plut. Dion. 58); and when Timoleon landed in Sicily in 344 BC Catania was subject to the despot Mamercus who at first joined the Corinthian leader, but afterwards abandoned this allegiance for that of the Carthaginians. As a consequence he was attacked and expelled by Timoleon in 338 BC.Catania was now restored to liberty, and appears to have continued to retain its independence; during the wars of Agathocles of Syracuse from 311 BC with the Carthaginians, it sided at one time with the former, at others with the latter; and when Pyrrhus landed in Sicily in 278 BC, Catania was the first to open its gates to him, and received him with the great splendour.The first introduction of dancing to accompany the flute was also ascribed to Andron, a citizen of Catania.\n\n\n=== Roman rule ===\nIn the First Punic War Catania was one of the first cities of Sicily to submit to the Roman Republic after their first successes in 263 BC when it was taken by Valerius Messalla. A sundial was part of the booty which was placed in the Comitium in Rome. Since then the city became a civitas decumana i.e. was subject to the payment of a tenth of its agricultural income as a tax to Rome. The conqueror of Syracuse, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, built a gymnasium here.It appears to have continued afterwards to maintain its friendly relations with Rome and though it did not enjoy the advantages of a confederate city (foederata civitas), like its neighbours Tauromenium (modern Taormina) and Messana (modern Messina), it rose to a position of great prosperity under the Roman rule.\nAround 135 BC during the First Servile War, it was conquered by rebel slaves.One of the most serious eruptions of Mount Etna happened in 121 BC, when a great part of Catania was overwhelmed by streams of lava, and the hot ashes fell in such quantities in the city itself, as to break in the roofs of the houses. Catana was in consequence exempted, for 10 years, from its usual contributions to the Roman state. The greater part of the broad tract of plain to the southwest of Catana (now called the Piana di Catania, a district of great fertility), appears to have belonged, in ancient times, to Leontini or Centuripa (modern Centuripe), but that portion of it between Catana itself and the mouth of the Symaethus was annexed to Catana and must have furnished abundant supplies of grain.\nCicero repeatedly mentions it as, in his time, a wealthy and flourishing city; it retained its ancient municipal institutions, its chief magistrate bearing the title of Proagorus; and appears to have been one of the principal ports of Sicily for the export of corn.In the Sicilian revolt from 44 BC Sextus Pompeius selected Sicily as his base and Catania gave in to Sextus' revolt and joined his forces. Sextus amassed a formidable army and a large fleet of warships at his base at Messana, with many slaves joining from the villas of patricians. After the victory of Augustus in 36 BC much of the vast farmland in Sicily was either ruined or left empty, and much of this land was taken and distributed to members of the legions which had fought there. Catania suffered severely from the ravages but was afterwards one of the cities raised to the status of colony by Augustus which restored its prosperity through the settlement of veterans, so that in Strabo's time it was one of the few cities in the island that was flourishing.Another revolt led by the gladiator Selurus in 35 BC created mayhem for a while.The Roman aqueduct of Catania was the largest in Roman Sicily at 24 km length starting from the springs of Santa Maria di Licodia.\nIt retained its colonial rank, as well as its prosperity, throughout the period of the Roman Empire; so that in the 4th century Ausonius in his Ordo Nobilium Urbium, notices Catania and Syracuse alone among the cities of Sicily.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nCatania was sacked by the Vandals of Gaiseric in 440\u2013441. After a period under the Ostrogoths, it was reconquered in 535 by the Eastern Roman Empire, under which (aside from a short period in 550\u2013555) it remained until the 9th century. It was the seat of the Byzantine governor of the island.\nCatania was under the Islamic emirate of Sicily until 1072, when it fell to the Normans of Roger I of Sicily. Subsequently, the city was ruled by a bishop-count. In 1194\u20131197 the city was sacked by German soldiers during after the conquest of the island by emperor Henry VI. In 1232 it rebelled to the former's son, Frederick II, who later built a massive castle, Castello Ursino and also made Catania a royal city, ending the dominance of the bishops. Catania was one of the main centers of the Sicilian Vespers revolt (1282) against the House of Anjou, and was the seat of the incoronation of the new Aragonese king of Sicily, Peter I. In the 14th century it gained importance as it was chosen by the Aragonese as a Parliament and Royal seat. Here, in 1347, it was signed the treaty of peace that ended the long War of the Vesper between Aragonese and Angevines. Catania lost its capital role when, in the early 15th century, Sicily was turned into a member of the Crown of Aragon, and kept its autonomy and original privileges specially during the period from 1282 to 1410.\nIn 1434 King Alfonso V founded here the Siciliae Studium Generale, the oldest university in the island.\n\n\n=== Early Modern times ===\n\nWith the unification of Castile and Aragon (early 16th century), Sicily became part of the Spanish Empire. It rebelled against the foreign government in 1516 and 1647.In 1669 the city's surroundings suffered great material damage from the 1669 Etna eruption. The city itself was largely saved by its walls that diverted most of the lava into the port. Afterwards in 1693 the city was then completely destroyed by a heavy earthquake and its aftershocks. The city was then rebuilt in the Baroque architecture that nowadays characterizes it.\n\n\n=== Unified Italy ===\nCatania was one of the vanguards of the movement for the Sicilian autonomy in the early 19th century.\nIn 1860 Giuseppe Garibaldi's expedition of the Thousand conquered Sicily for Piedmont from the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Since the following year Catania was part of the newly unified Italy, whose history it shares since then.\n During World War II, Catania was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces, owing to the presence of two of the main Axis airfields in Sicily (Gerbini and Fontanarossa) and for its strategically important port and marshalling yard. Altogether, the city suffered eighty-seven air raids. The heaviest raids took place in the spring and summer of 1943, before and during the Allied invasion of Sicily; they caused heavy damage to che city (among others, twenty-eight churches and most historic palaces suffered damage), killed 750 inhabitants and prompted most of the population to flee to the countryside. After heavy fighting across eastern Sicily, Catania was eventually captured by the British 8th Army on 5 August 1943.After the conflict, and the constitution of the Italian Republic (1946), Catania attempted to catch up with the economic and social development of Italy's richer northern regions. The problems faced in Catania were emblematic of those faced by other towns in the Mezzogiorno, namely a heavy gap in industrial development and infrastructures, and the threat of the mafia. This notwithstanding, during the 1960s (and partly during the 1990s) Catania enjoyed development and a period of economic, social and cultural success. In the first decade of the 21st century, Catania's economic and social development somewhat faltered and the city is again facing economic and social stagnation. This was aggravated by the economical crisis left by the Forza Italia administration of mayor Scapagnini in 2008.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Metropolitan City ===\n\nThe Metropolitan City of Catania was established in 2015 and replaced the former Province of Catania. It includes the city proper and 57 comuni (municipalities). The population of the Metropolitan City is 1,107,702.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Metropolitan area of Catania includes the comune of Catania (311,584 inhabitants) and 26 surrounding comuni forming an urban belt (498,650 inhabitants). The total population of the Metropolitan area of Catania is therefore 810,234. The comuni of the Metropolitan area are:\n\nThese comuni form a system with the centre of Catania sharing its economical and social life and creating an organic urban texture.\n\n\n=== City proper ===\nThe city of Catania proper (comune di Catania) is divided in six administrative areas called circoscrizioni. The current administrative setup was established in 2013, modifying previous setups dating back to 1971, 1978 and 1995.\nThe six areas are:\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe symbol of the city is u Liotru, or the Fontana dell'Elefante, assembled in 1736 by Giovanni Battista Vaccarini. It portrays an ancient lavic stone elephant and is topped by an Egyptian obelisk from Syene. Legend has it that Vaccarini's original elephant was neuter, which the men of Catania took as an insult to their virility. To appease them, Vaccarini appropriately appended elephantine testicles to the original statue.\nThe Sicilian name u Liotru is a phonetic change of Heliodorus, a nobleman who, after trying without success to become bishop of the city, became a sorcerer and was therefore condemned to the stake. Legend has it that Heliodorus himself was the sculptor of the lava elephant and that he used to magically ride it in his fantastic travels from Catania to Constantinople. Another legend has it that Heliodorus was able to transform himself into an elephant.\nThe presence of an elephant in the millenary history of Catania is surely connected to both zooarcheology and popular creeds. In fact, the prehistoric fauna of Sicily from the Upper Paleolithic, included dwarf elephants. Paleontologist Othenio Abel suggested that the presence of dwarf elephants in Sicily may be the origin of the legend of the Cyclops. Ancient Greeks, after finding the skulls of dwarf elephants, about twice the size of a human skull, with a large central nasal cavity (mistaken for a large single eye-socket) supposed that they were skulls of giants with a single eye.\nThe Catanian Museum of Mineralogy, Paleontology and Vulcanology holds the integral unburied skeleton of an Elephas falconeri in an excellent state of conservation. The first inhabitants of Etna  molded such lavic artifact to idolize the mythical proboscidian.\n\n\n=== Classical buildings ===\nThe city has been buried by lava a total of seventeen times in recorded history, and in layers under the present day city are the Roman city that preceded it, and the Greek city before that. Many of the ancient monuments of the Roman city have been destroyed by the numerous seisms. Currently, different ancient remains can be seen and visited in the city-centre, as part of an archaeological park (Parco Archeologico Greco-Romano di Catania).\n\nAncient edifices include:\n\nGreek-Roman Theatre of Catania (2nd century)\nOdeon (3rd century). It could house up to 1500 spectators\nAmphitheatre\nGreek Acropolis of Montevergine\nRoman Aqueduct\nRoman Forum\nRoman broken arcades\nChristian basilicas, hypogea, burial monuments and Catacombs\nRoman Colonnade\n\n\n=== Roman thermal structures ===\nAchillean Baths\nTerme dell\u2019Indirizzo\nTerme di Santa Maria Odigitria\nTerme della Rotonda\nBaths of the Four Quoins\nTerme di Palazzo Asmundo\nTerme del Palazzo dell\u2019Universit\u00e0\nTerme di Casa Gagliano\nTerme della Chiesa di Sant'Antonio Abate\n\n\n=== Baroque and historical churches ===\n\nThe Baroque city centre of Catania is a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nThe Cathedral (1070\u20131093, rebuilt after the 1693 earthquake)\nSaint Agatha Abbey (1620)\nSaint Placidus (1769)\nChurch of San Giuseppe al Duomo\nChurch of Santissimo Sacramento al Duomo\nChurch of San Martino dei Bianchi\nChurch of Sant'Agata la Vetere (254)\nSaint Agatha by the Furnace or Saint Blaise (1098, rebuilt in 1700)\nChurch of the Saint Jail or Saint Agatha at the Jail (Santo Carcere or Sant'Agata al Carcere) (1760).

Ognina is the maritime quarter and the main fishing pole of Catania. Many bareboats and umpteen smacks gather and crowd here all year round. In its close vicinities there is a cylindric tower, known as Saint Mary's Tower (Torre Santa Maria), which was restructured in the 16th century to prevent the frequent plunders of the Saracen pirates. The church is the result of the gradual modification of the Greek Temple Athena Longatis or Parthenos Longatis that existed on the steep reef. This cult was imported from a Boeotian region of Greece called Longas from where the first Hellenic settlers of this borough probably came. After the earthquake of 1693 it was rebuilt on the same place but with a different orientation.\nOur Lady of Montserrat (1755)\nChurch of  Santa Maria della Salute\nSaint Mary of La Salette\nChurch of Santa Maria della Mercede\nChurch of Santa Caterina al Rinazzo\nOur Lady of Concordia\nChurch of Santa Maria della Guardia\nOur Lady of Consolation\nChurch of Santissimo Crocifisso Maiorana\nCrucifix of Miracles\nCrucifix of Good Death\nOur Lady of La Mecca\nSaint Cajetan at the Marina\nMost Holy Redeemer\nSaint Francis of Paola\nChurch of the Divina Maternit\u00e0\nChapel of Mary Auxiliatrix\nChapel of the Sacred Heart of Jesus\nChurch of the Sacro Cuore al Fortino (1898)\nSaints George and Denis\nChurch of the Sacred Heart of the Capuchins\nSaint Christopher\nSaints Cosmas and Damian\nChurch of Santa Maria del Soccorso or Santa Maria della Palma\nSaint Vitus\nChurch of the Santi Angeli Custodi\nChurch of the Santissimo Salvatore\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nUrsino Castle, built by emperor Frederick II in the 13th century.\nPalace of the Elephants, designed by Giovan Battista Vaccarini.

The city is famous for its mainly petrochemical industry, and the extraction of sulphur. In the year 2000, according to Census, Catania was the 14th richest city in Italy, with a GDP of US$6.6 billion (\u20ac6.304 billion), which was 0.54% of the Italian GDP, a GDP per capita of US$21,000 (\u20ac20,100) and an average GDP per employee of US$69,000 (\u20ac66,100).In the late-19th century and early-20th century, Catania began to be heavily industrialised, with its several factories and chimneys, often to the extant that it was referred to as Southern Italy's \"Manchester\". The economy of Catania suffered heavily from the bad effects of World War I, and was marked by an economic crisis and recession that culminated in the 1920s. Since then, the city lost its industrial and entrepreneurial importance. In the 1930s, Catania remained a small fishing town with derelict and disused industries. However, after the destruction of World War II, Catania's economy began to re-grow in the late-1950s and early-1960s. As a matter of fact, the city's economic growth was so rapid and dynamic that it was often nicknamed the \"Milan of the South\", or in Italian \"Milano del Sud\". This rapid economic growth prompted a great number of Sicilians living in the more rural areas, or smaller towns such as Enna, Ragusa and Caltanissetta, to move to the city to seek new jobs.\nToday, Catania, despite several problems, has one of the most dynamic economies in the whole of Southern Italy. It still has a strong industrial and agricultural sector, and a fast-growing tourist industry, with many international visitors coming to visit the city's main sights and the nearby Etna volcano. It contains the headquarters or important offices of companies such as STMicroelectronics, and also several chemical and pharmaceutical businesses. There have been several new business developments to further boost Catania's economy, including the construction of Etnapolis, a big shopping mall designed by Massimiliano Fuksas, the same architect who designed the FieraMilano industrial fair in Milan, or the Etna Valley, where several high-tech offices are located.\nTourism is a fast-growing industry in Catania. Lately the administration and private companies have made several investments in the hospitality industry in order to make tourism a competitive sector in the Metropolitan City. Etnaland, a big amusement and water park located in Belpasso, in the Metropolitan area of Catania, 12 kilometers (7 miles) from the city center, is the largest in Southern Italy and attracts thousands of tourists, not only from Sicily, but also from the rest of Italy: according to Tripadvisor (2018) it is the third water park in Europe.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Catania dates back to 1434 and it is the oldest university in Sicily. Its academic nicknames are: Siculorum Gymnasium and Siciliae Studium Generale. Nowadays it hosts 12 faculties and over 62,000 students, and it offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.\nCatania hosts the Scuola Superiore, an academic institution linked to the University of Catania, aimed at the excellence in education. The Scuola Superiore di Catania also offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.Apart from the University and the Scuola Superiore Catania is base of the prestigious Istituto Musicale Vincenzo Bellini an advanced institute of musical studies (Conservatory) and the Accademia di Belle Arti an advanced institute of artistic studies. Both institutions offer programs of university level for musical and artistic education.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe opera composer Vincenzo Bellini was born in Catania, and a museum exists at his birthplace.\nThe Teatro Massimo \"Vincenzo Bellini\", which opened in 1890, is named after the composer. The opera house presents a variety of operas through a season, which run from December to May, many of which are the work of Bellini.\nGiovanni Verga was born in Catania in 1840. He became the greatest writer of Verismo, an Italian literary movement akin to Naturalism. His novels portray life among the lower levels of Sicilian society, such as fishermen and stonemasons, and were written in a mixture of both literary language and local dialect. Francesco Longo Mancini was a painter known for paintings of nudes who was born in Catania in 1880.\n\nThe city's patron saint is Saint Agatha, who is celebrated with a religious pageantry, the Festival of Saint Agatha, on February 5 every year.\nThe city is base of the newspaper La Sicilia and of the TV-channel Antenna Sicilia also known as Sicilia Channel. Several others local television channels and free-press magazines have their headquarters in Catania.\nThe city is home to the Catania Jazz Festival, which typically runs for several winter months with concerts in different locations.\nIn the late 1980s and during the 1990s Catania had a sparkling and unique popular music scene. Indie pop and indie rock bands, local radio station and dynamic independent music record labels sprung. As a result, in those years the city experienced a vital and effervescent cultural period. Artists like Carmen Consoli and Mario Venuti and internationally known indie rock bands like Uzeda came out of this cultural milieu.\nThe city is the home of Amatori Catania rugby union team, Calcio Catania football team and Orizzonte Catania, the latter being a women's water polo club, winning eight European Champions Cup titles from 1994 to 2008. Noted Italian basketball coach Ettore Messina is a native of Catania. The city also hosted the first ever qualification tournament for the Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1992, and the associated Etna Cup, which was won by the host Sicily team. In addition, the Catania Elephants are currently members of the Italian Football League. Catania also hosted the 2011 FIE Fencing World Championships.\n\n\n== Food and cuisine ==\n\nFood is an important part of Catania's culture and way of life. Local cuisine emphasizes several traits of Sicilian one, whilst developing some of its own.\nStreet food is one of the best ways to experience traditional dishes. Arancini are perhaps the city's most iconic one: they are stuffed rice balls coated in bread-crumbs and deep fried; in Catania, they are shaped like a cone to remind of Mount Etna. Typical specialties from the city include cipollina (puff pastry with onion, tomato and prosciutto filling), bolognese (a small pizza topped with tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto and boiled egg and covered in puff pastry), crispelle (deep fried dough balls with ricotta or anchovies filling.)\nDuring street-fairs and religious festivals, street stalls sell calia e simenza (toasted chickpeas and pumpkin seeds). Typical from old street markets are sangeli (cooked pork blood), quarumi (pork tripe), zuzzu (pork jelly), mauru (edible seaweed), and raw seafood. Horse meat is very traditional and it is sold in shops called arrusti e mancia (\"roast it and eat it\"), which roast the meat in streetside barbecues.Apart from street food, typical dishes from Catania are: pasta alla Norma (pasta with fried eggplant, tomato sauce and ricotta salata cheese), named after the namesake opera by Vincenzo Bellini; pasta cco niuru (pasta in cuttlefish ink), maccu (fava beans pur\u00e9e), bastaddi affucati or brocculi affucati (stewed cauliflower or broccoli), caponata (saut\u00e9ed vegetables) and scacciata (a pie filled with tuma cheese) which is traditional during Christmastime.Catania is also famous for its pasticceria (pastries and cakes). Pastries vary according to season and to seasonal events: during the Festival of Saint Agatha, patron saint of the city, there are the cassatelle (small cassatas) and olivette (olive shaped almond paste). In Easter, there are aceddi ccu l\u2019ovu (boiled eggs covered in biscuit). In summer there is granita. During the Festa dei morti (traditional celebrations in All Souls' Day) there are biscuits called ossa di mortu, rame di Napoli and nsuddi.\nDrink kiosks are everywhere in town and serve soft drinks. Traditional soft drinks are made mixing fruit syrups with soda and other flavors such as anisette. They are thirst-killer and they are very popular with the locals and the tourists.\nLocal products include blood oranges, pistachios from Bronte, extra-virgin olive oil, cactus fruit, cherries, grapes from Mazzarrone, strawberries from Maletto, mushrooms, honey and wine.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nCatania has a commercial seaport (Catania seaport), an international airport (Catania Fontanarossa), a central railway station (Catania Centrale) and it is a main node of the Sicilian motorway system.\nThe motorways serving Catania are the A18 Messina-Catania and the A19 Palermo-Catania; extensions of the A18 going from Catania to Syracuse and to Gela are currently under construction.\nThe Circumetnea is a narrow-gauge railway that runs for 110 km (68 mi) from Catania round the base of Mount Etna. It attains the height of 976 m (3,202.10 ft) above sea level before descending to rejoin the coast at Giarre-Riposto to the North.\nIn the late 1990s the first line of an underground railway (Metropolitana di Catania) was built. The underground service started in 1999 and it is currently active on a route of 8.8 km (5.5 mi), from the station Nesima (West of town), passing through the stations of San Nullo, Cibali (still under construction), Milo, Borgo, Giuffrida, Italia, Galatea, Giovanni XXIII, to Stesicoro. These two stations, bringing Catania Underground in the city centre, have opened on 20 December 2016. First line is planned to extend from the satellite city of Patern\u00f2 to Fontanarossa Airport.\n\n\n=== Catania Public Transportation Statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Catania, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 56 min. 13% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 23 min, while 46% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.7 km, while 3% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nAaron ben Gershon abu al-Rabi, 15th century rabbi\nOriana Bandiera (1971\u2013), economist and academic\nPippo Baudo (1936-), TV presenter\nFranco Battiato (1945-), singer-songwriter, composer, filmmaker\nGianni Bella (1947-), singer-songwriter\nMarcella Bella (1952-), singer\nVincenzo Bellini (1801\u20131835), composer\nOrnella Bertorotta (1967-) politician\nGiuseppa Bolognara Calcagno (1826\u20131884), freedom fighter of the Risorgimento\nVitaliano Brancati (1907\u20131954), writer\nLuigi Capuana (1839\u20131915), writer\nCharondas (6th c.

In 1823, Light had fondly written of Catania: \"The two principal streets cross each other at right angles in the square in the direction of north and south and east and west. They are wide and spacious and about a mile [1.6 km] long\". This became the basis for his plan of Adelaide.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAmico, Vito Maria (1740).

          "Catania has not preserved many attractions, which is why it is not very popular with tourists. This was caused by earthquakes. Especially the famous earthquake of 1693, which destroyed the Noto valley and Catania in addition. It was this earthquake that destroyed the Norman",
          "To be honest it's not the most overwhelming cathedral I've ever visited! But if you're in Catania do look at the outside and pop in if it's open.",
          "The Cathedral in Catania is definitely well worth a visit especial when the sun is shining as it stands out more in your photographs",
          "Large space framed by superb monuments forming a harmonious architectural whole.

          "This site is well worth the visit. History for us Americans is maybe 300 years but here history takes on new meaning. There is something for everyone-architecture, artwork, history, and pastries in the square. I walked around in a stunned state at the beauty and magnificance",
          "Like any similar square in Rome, Florence, Venice etc. It\u2019s a square that draws the crowds and the attendant gaggle of looky looky men, buskers and the likes Invariably the surrounding bars are more expensive and offer less quality but we still enjoyed the experience Stunning",
          "This square is the centre of the pedestrianised area of the town. The Duomo, fountain and town hall that line the square are all worth a visit. It\u2019s a super place to sit with a drink and people watch.",

          "It's nice to go up to the tower. It cost 3Euro and several steps to climb. Church itself is very impressive by height",
          "We found it open and free in the morning. Do not forget to have a look at the absis, the only part remaining from the last big earthquake; you will see why.",
          "There are a few cafes on the square, great for chilling out or for lunch. You can't play cards there though! But sitting outside and watching the world go by is entertaining enough. Just a short walk to the market so good to shop then chill here after the hustle n bustle. Not",
          "We stayed in Catania for one week and thought that the Piazzo Duomo was the nicest place in the City. The Duomo had a service taking place and we were able to stand at the back of the building and observe. It is an impressive place with an elaborate interior and fa\u00e7ade. On",
          "The Duomo is well located in the hearth of Catania. It is surrounded by other nice buildings. Italy/Sicily has so many Duomo and Cathedrals.",

          "This was not a terribly inspiring cathedral, especially when compared to Firenze or Milano cathedrals or the magnificent Monreale and its mosaics.",
          "We visited Catania because of its UNESCO status. The Duomo is quite impressive looking. It's built over an ancient Roman bath, but unfortunately the gate to the archeological site is closed. Inside the Duomo, lthere are two small areas blocked off to view the structures below",
          "The piazza is very beautiful as all Catania, quite big, and a lovely sight to the eye but there are not many benches to sit there and relax. The way to the piazza is full with shops on via etnea, and some souvenirs selling on the piazza. Amazing at night.",
          "Almost every town/city/village in Sicily has its Duomo piazza. This one is really beautiful and the piazza is always full of visitors",
          "Some look at Catania and see blemishes and gray, even a less antiseptic environment than in some other cases. I remember when it was easy to bypass as even a consideration. But so anymore. It's robust, engaging, varied, historic, gastro panoramic, anthropologic and Byzantine",
          "Catania is a big town in Sicily and like Ragusa Elba and Noto full of baroque structures but not as pretty and has an underbelly of dirty and run down streets. The vegetable market was a redeeming feature with a lot of colour and saw snails being sold for the first time ever.",
          "The stop is must and you can enjoy the baroque architecture find on the square and buildings around in such a lovely city centre. Highly recommend in early morning or at sunset to avoid the mass of people Beware of the time schedule to enter the Church.",
          "Worth the stop when looking for beautiful baroque architecture in such a lovely city centre. Highly recommend, just watch you time, of early or late as there's a time during the day that access to the duomo is closed.",
          "You stand in the square by a lovely fountain and 360 degrees around you are wonderful classical sights. You feel overwhelmed by the beauty. Well worth a visit - this is a lovely city.",
          "As a focal point for the city the Cathedral is well maintained and very basically decorated. Whilst I visited there was a service which was nice as you could absorb the real quality of what the Cathedral is for.",
          "The Piazza Duomo is an attractive square in the city centre and is, in all reality, the only attractive feature of the town which really is a decrepit and rundown type of place.",
          "After a long but pleasant stroll down Via Etna, you reach the magnificent Piazza Duomo - a great starting point for seeing the Cathedral and nearby historical sites. Nearby quality restaurants, cafes and bars in the very heart of Catania - a lived-in city of some charm.",
          "Catania vies with Palermo for Sicilian bragging rights. Palermo has exquisite individual buildings, but Catania wins hands down for stunning, inviting urban spaces. The cathedral and Palace of the Elephant (now city hall) face the Piazza Duomo, with its elephant monument. Piazza",
          "The Piazza Duomo presents a large, nearly exclusively foot-traffic area, in the heart of the historic center of Catania. It borders the cathedral, the daily fish market, as well as great proximity to city-center shopping.",
          "Great looking plaza with a feel of the old grandeur but the signs of neglect are rampant. In fact this entire half on the old town shows the same trend of old glory neglected to the level of permanent decline. It's a shame when beautiful grand architecture decays on such a grand",
          "A beautiful square , very large and sunny. It is surely one of the most attractive in Sicily. It is the heart of the city, the place to start exploring Palermo.",
          "Built st the beginning of the 15th century on the ruins of a church from the Middle Ages, this is a fortress cathedral with a Latin cross plan. Open early morning and early evening. Not usually open during the day . Worth going though.",
          "Interesting square with a variety of Baroque buildings and later additions. Plenty of restaurants and the stop off point for the road train and open top buses.",
          "When we arrived it was pouring and this does take the edge off most places. However after a while the sun emerged and the square started to look like a really nice European square. It has good buildings on all sides ,one of them is the magnificent Cathedral, a couple of nice",
          "We drove 30 minutes through heavy traffic, alongside manic Sicilian drivers, to visit this much lauded landmark, only to be very disappointed by its lack of attraction. Dark and ugly, not even the Elephant mascot made the trip worthwhile. In fact, the whole area is unpleasant",
          "A must see in Catania to orientate yourself and to find your way to the famed fish market. A pleasant spot for photography and people watching.",
          "This square is the most charming and beautiful one in Catania. The buildings are architecturally beautiful, there is the fountain and the elephant statue. A nice place to stop for a coffee and a pastry (although the bars there are expensive)",

          "nice view of the catania barocco showing up from the square. night-time is lovely, well lighted and delightable...",
          "The jumbo in the middle of the square is fun and reminded me of one of my favourite statues: the elephantino in Rome. The smell comes from the fish market in the corner of the square - well worth a look. Of course you will also want to go inside the duomo too.",
          "Great to sit in the sun with a glass of wine or cocktails and people watch .Some lovely little cafes and restaurants. A bit pricy but we'll worth it",
          "It is a wonderful barocco square with duomo. You can visit museum with another prospective of square. You can visit terme under square and You Can see fountain with underground river.",
          "We were surprised that the Duomo is closed for long lunch time. Very nice inside (when we timed it so we could get in)...and very nice piazza although we preferred the beach city of Taormina and neighborhood of Ortygia in Syracuse to Catania.",
          "We got gelato and cannoli from one of the cafes and sat on the steps of Fontana D'Elefante to eat, relax, and admire the beautiful architecture. With the sound of the 2 fountains, kids playing soccer, and the bells, it was everything you could want in an Italian afternoon.",
          "Beautiful cathedral in beautiful Piazza in the heart of Catania. You can seat outside, drink the best capuchino and enjoy in every moment",
          "Piazza Duomo is the centre-piece and a large square with a statue of an elephant in the middle, flanked by the Cathedral on one side and small cafes/restaurants on the other side. There is also the entrance to the monument dedicated to the fallen soldiers. Nice place to sit and",
          "A beautiful public space. To the south below the fountain is the famous fish market in the morning. And a prehistoric elephant statue in the center. On the Mt Etna side is the mayor's office. Go in the very front part and look closely at the Sicilian horse cart. A work of art.",
          "There is nothing much to see (and do) in Catania, and in general, everything is baddy preserved. So, if you are in town, it is very easy to get there and walk around the old part of the city.",
          "Great piazza surrounded by spectacular architecture and several good bars. Great ice cream shop on the corner too. Beware of traffic if you are taking in the sights - roads run through it without being obviously marked as such.",

        "wiki": "Catania (UK: , US: , Sicilian and Italian: [ka\u02c8ta\u02d0nja] (listen)) is the second largest city in Sicily, after Palermo, and among the ten largest cities in Italy. Located on Sicily\u2019s east coast, it faces the Ionian Sea. It is the capital of the 58-municipality region known as the Metropolitan City of Catania, which is the seventh-largest metropolitan city in Italy. The population of the city proper is 311,584, while the population of the Metropolitan City of Catania is 1,107,702.Catania was founded in the 8th century BC by Chalcidians Greeks. The city was almost completely destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake in 1169.However, by the 14th century, and into the Renaissance period, Catania was one of Italy's most important cultural, artistic and political centres. It was the site of Sicily\u2019s first university, founded in 1434. It has been the native or adopted home of some of Italy's most famous artists and writers, including the composers Vincenzo Bellini and Giovanni Pacini, and the writers Giovanni Verga, Luigi Capuana, Federico De Roberto and Nino Martoglio.\nThe city has been devastated several times by volcanic eruptions from nearby Mount Etna, the most violent of which was in 1669. And it suffered through another severely damaging earthquake in 1693.Catania today is the industrial, logistical, and commercial center of Sicily. Its airport, the Catania-Fontanarossa Airport, is the largest in Southern Italy. \nHowever, it is also noted for its history, culture, architecture, and gastronomy. The section of the city known as the \u201cold town\u201d features some of the most striking examples of baroque architecture in Italy, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe ancient indigenous population of the Sicels named their villages after geographical attributes of their location. The Sicilian word, katane, means \"grater, flaying knife, skinning place\" or a \"crude tool apt to pare\". Other translations of the name are \"harsh lands\", \"uneven ground\", \"sharp stones\", or \"rugged or rough soil\". The latter etymologies are easily justifiable since, for many centuries following an eruption, the city has always been rebuilt within its black-lava landscape.Around 263 BC, the city was variously known as Cat\u012dna (Latin: [\u02c8kat\u026ana]) and Cat\u0103na (Latin: [\u02c8katana]; Ancient Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 [kat\u00e1n\u025b\u02d0]). The former has been primarily used for its supposed assonance with catina, the Latin feminization of the name catinus. Catinus has two meanings: \"a gulf, a basin or a bay\" and \"a bowl, a vessel or a trough\",  thanks to the city's distinctive topography.\nAround 900, when Catania was part of the emirate of Sicily, it was known in Arabic as Balad al-f\u012bl (\u0628\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644) and Mad\u012bnat al-f\u012bl (\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644), respectively meaning \"the Village (or Country) of the Elephant\" and \"the City of the Elephant\". The Elephant is the lava sculpture over the fountain in Piazza Duomo: most likely a prehistoric sculpture that was reforged during the Byzantine Era, it appears to be a talisman that was reputedly powerful enough to protect the city from enemies and to keep away misfortune, plagues, or natural calamities. Another Arab toponym was Qa\u1e6d\u0101niyyah (\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629), allegedly from the Arabic word for the \"leguminous plants\". Pulses like lentils, beans, peas, broad beans, and lupins were chiefly cultivated in the plains around the city well before the arrival of Aghlabids. Afterwards, many Arabic agronomists  developed these crops and the citrus orchards in the area around the city.\nThe toponym W\u0101d\u012b M\u016bs\u00e1 (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0649), or \"the Valley of Moses\" (from the Arabic name of the Simeto River), was rarely used.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCatania is located on the east coast of the island of Sicily, at the foot of Mount Etna.\nAs observed by Strabo, the location of Catania at the foot of Mount Etna has been both a curse and a blessing. On the one hand, violent outbursts of the volcano throughout history have destroyed large parts of the city, whilst on the other hand the volcanic ashes yield fertile soil, especially suited for the growth of vines. (Strab. vi. p. 269)\nTwo subterranean rivers run under the city; the Amenano, which surfaces at one single point south of Piazza Duomo, and the Longane (or Lognina).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Csa\" (Mediterranean Climate). It has hot summers, one of the hottest in the whole country of Italy (a feature characterising nearly every month). Temperatures of 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are surpassed almost every year a couple of times,Winters are mild with chilly nights (not rare peaks around 20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F) . Most of precipitation is concentrated from October to March, leaving late spring and summer virtually dry (some years there is no rain for 3\u20134 months). The city receives around 500 millimetres (20 inches) of rain per year, although the amount can vary greatly from year to year (wettest over 1,200 millimetres or 47 inches, driest under 250 millimetres or 9.8 inches,).\nDuring winter nights lows can occasionally go under 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Highs under 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) can happen during winter. Snow, due to the presence of Etna that protects the city from the northern winds, is an uncommon occurrence, but occasional snow flurries have been seen over the recent years especially in the hilly districts, more substantial in the northern hinterland. More recently, light snowfalls occurred on 9 February 2015, 6 January 2017 and 5 January 2019, but the last heavy snowfall dates back to 17 December 1988.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn January 2015, there were 315,601 people residing in Catania, of whom 47.2% were male and 52.8% were female. Minors (people under age 18) totalled 20.50 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 18.87 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners).\nThe average age of Catania residents is 41 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Catania declined by 3.35 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85 percent. The reason for this population decline in the comune di Catania is mainly due to a large segment of the population leaving the city centre to go to live in the uptown residential areas of the comuni of the Metropolitan area. As a result of this, while the population in the comune di Catania declines, the population of the hinterland comuni increases making the overall population of the Metropolitan area increase.The current birth rate of Catania is 10.07 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births. As of 2006, 98.03% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant groups come from Sub-Saharan Africa: 0.69%, South Asia: 0.46%, and from other European countries (particularly from Ukraine and Poland): 0.33%.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nAround 729 BC, the ancient village of Katane was occupied by Chalcidian Greek settlers from nearby Naxos along the coast. It became the Chalcidian colony of Kat\u00e1n\u0113 under a leader named Euarchos (Euarchus) and the native population was rapidly Hellenised.\nThucydides states that it came into existence slightly later than Leontini (modern Lentini), which he claims was five years after Syracuse, or 730 BC.The settlement's acropolis was on the hill of Monte Vergine, a defensible hill immediately west of the current city centre. The port of Catania appears to have been much frequented in ancient time and was the chief place of export for the corn of the rich neighbouring plains.\n\n\n=== Greek Catania ===\nIn ancient times Catania was associated with the legend of Amphinomos and Anapias, who, on occasion of a great eruption of Etna, abandoned all their property and carried off their aged parents on their shoulders. The stream of lava itself was said to have parted, and flowed aside so as not to harm them. Statues were erected to their honour, and the place of their burial was known as the Campus Piorum; the Catanaeans even introduced the figures of the youths on their coins, and the legend became a favorite subject of allusion and declamation among the Latin poets, of whom the younger Lucilius and Claudian have dwelt upon it at considerable length.Catania was the birthplace of the philosopher and legislator Charondas (late 6th c. BC) who introduced his celebrated laws there. His legislation was extended to the other Chalcidic cities, not only of Sicily, but of Magna Graecia also, as well as to his own country. It is evident that Catania had close relations with these other cities during this time.\nIt was residence of the poets Ibycus and Stesichorus (c. 630\u2013555 BC), who was buried in a magnificent sepulchre outside one of the gates, hence its name of Porta Stesichoreia. Xenophanes (c. 570-475 BC), one of the founders of the Eleatic school of philosophy, also spent the latter years of his life in the city so that it was evidently, at an early period, a place of cultivation and refinement.\nCatania appears to have retained its independence up to the reign of the despot Hieron of Syracuse, whereupon in 476 BC he expelled all the original inhabitants of Catania and replaced them with those he ruled over at Leontini \u2013 said to have numbered no less than 10,000, consisting partly of Syracusans and Peloponnesians. At the same time he changed the city's name to \u0391\u1f34\u03c4\u03bd\u03b7 (A\u00edtn\u0113, Aetna or \u00c6tna, after the nearby Mount Etna, and proclaimed himself the Oekist or founder of the new city. For this he was celebrated by Pindar, and after his death he received heroic honours from the citizens of his new colony.A few years after the death of Hieron and the expulsion of Thrasybulus, the Syracusans combined with Ducetius, king of the Sicels, to expel the newly settled inhabitants of Catania, who went on to settle in the fortress of Inessa (to which they gave the name Aetna). The old Chalcidic citizens were reinstated to the city in 461 BC.The period that followed appears to have been one of great prosperity for Catania, as well as for the Sicilian cities in general.\nIn the Peloponnesian War during the great Athenian expedition to Sicily  in 415 BC, the Catanaeans at first refused to allow the Athenians into their city, but after the latter had forced an entrance, they found themselves compelled to honour the alliance of their invaders after a famous speech that Alcibiades would have made in front of the assembly. Catania became the headquarters of the Athenian army throughout the first year of the expedition, and the base of their subsequent operations against Syracuse. After the defeat of the Athenians it was open to attack by Syracuse but was saved by the Carthaginian invasion of Sicily in 409 BC.\nBut in 403 BC it fell into the power of Dionysius I of Syracuse, who plundered the city and sold its citizens as slaves, after which he populated it with Campanian mercenaries. These, however, quit in 396 BC and retired to Aetna, on the approach of the great Carthaginian armament under Himilco and Mago. After the great naval Battle of Catana (397 BC) which was fought off Catania and in which the latter defeated Leptines of Syracuse, the city fell into the hands of the Carthaginians.Calippus, the assassin of Dion of Syracuse, held Catania for a time (Plut. Dion. 58); and when Timoleon landed in Sicily in 344 BC Catania was subject to the despot Mamercus who at first joined the Corinthian leader, but afterwards abandoned this allegiance for that of the Carthaginians. As a consequence he was attacked and expelled by Timoleon in 338 BC.Catania was now restored to liberty, and appears to have continued to retain its independence; during the wars of Agathocles of Syracuse from 311 BC with the Carthaginians, it sided at one time with the former, at others with the latter; and when Pyrrhus landed in Sicily in 278 BC, Catania was the first to open its gates to him, and received him with the great splendour.The first introduction of dancing to accompany the flute was also ascribed to Andron, a citizen of Catania.\n\n\n=== Roman rule ===\nIn the First Punic War Catania was one of the first cities of Sicily to submit to the Roman Republic after their first successes in 263 BC when it was taken by Valerius Messalla. A sundial was part of the booty which was placed in the Comitium in Rome. Since then the city became a civitas decumana i.e. was subject to the payment of a tenth of its agricultural income as a tax to Rome. The conqueror of Syracuse, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, built a gymnasium here.It appears to have continued afterwards to maintain its friendly relations with Rome and though it did not enjoy the advantages of a confederate city (foederata civitas), like its neighbours Tauromenium (modern Taormina) and Messana (modern Messina), it rose to a position of great prosperity under the Roman rule.\nAround 135 BC during the First Servile War, it was conquered by rebel slaves.One of the most serious eruptions of Mount Etna happened in 121 BC, when a great part of Catania was overwhelmed by streams of lava, and the hot ashes fell in such quantities in the city itself, as to break in the roofs of the houses. Catana was in consequence exempted, for 10 years, from its usual contributions to the Roman state. The greater part of the broad tract of plain to the southwest of Catana (now called the Piana di Catania, a district of great fertility), appears to have belonged, in ancient times, to Leontini or Centuripa (modern Centuripe), but that portion of it between Catana itself and the mouth of the Symaethus was annexed to Catana and must have furnished abundant supplies of grain.\nCicero repeatedly mentions it as, in his time, a wealthy and flourishing city; it retained its ancient municipal institutions, its chief magistrate bearing the title of Proagorus; and appears to have been one of the principal ports of Sicily for the export of corn.In the Sicilian revolt from 44 BC Sextus Pompeius selected Sicily as his base and Catania gave in to Sextus' revolt and joined his forces. Sextus amassed a formidable army and a large fleet of warships at his base at Messana, with many slaves joining from the villas of patricians. After the victory of Augustus in 36 BC much of the vast farmland in Sicily was either ruined or left empty, and much of this land was taken and distributed to members of the legions which had fought there. Catania suffered severely from the ravages but was afterwards one of the cities raised to the status of colony by Augustus which restored its prosperity through the settlement of veterans, so that in Strabo's time it was one of the few cities in the island that was flourishing.Another revolt led by the gladiator Selurus in 35 BC created mayhem for a while.The Roman aqueduct of Catania was the largest in Roman Sicily at 24 km length starting from the springs of Santa Maria di Licodia.\nIt retained its colonial rank, as well as its prosperity, throughout the period of the Roman Empire; so that in the 4th century Ausonius in his Ordo Nobilium Urbium, notices Catania and Syracuse alone among the cities of Sicily.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nCatania was sacked by the Vandals of Gaiseric in 440\u2013441. After a period under the Ostrogoths, it was reconquered in 535 by the Eastern Roman Empire, under which (aside from a short period in 550\u2013555) it remained until the 9th century. It was the seat of the Byzantine governor of the island.\nCatania was under the Islamic emirate of Sicily until 1072, when it fell to the Normans of Roger I of Sicily. Subsequently, the city was ruled by a bishop-count. In 1194\u20131197 the city was sacked by German soldiers during after the conquest of the island by emperor Henry VI. In 1232 it rebelled to the former's son, Frederick II, who later built a massive castle, Castello Ursino and also made Catania a royal city, ending the dominance of the bishops. Catania was one of the main centers of the Sicilian Vespers revolt (1282) against the House of Anjou, and was the seat of the incoronation of the new Aragonese king of Sicily, Peter I. In the 14th century it gained importance as it was chosen by the Aragonese as a Parliament and Royal seat. Here, in 1347, it was signed the treaty of peace that ended the long War of the Vesper between Aragonese and Angevines. Catania lost its capital role when, in the early 15th century, Sicily was turned into a member of the Crown of Aragon, and kept its autonomy and original privileges specially during the period from 1282 to 1410.\nIn 1434 King Alfonso V founded here the Siciliae Studium Generale, the oldest university in the island.\n\n\n=== Early Modern times ===\n\nWith the unification of Castile and Aragon (early 16th century), Sicily became part of the Spanish Empire. It rebelled against the foreign government in 1516 and 1647.In 1669 the city's surroundings suffered great material damage from the 1669 Etna eruption. The city itself was largely saved by its walls that diverted most of the lava into the port. Afterwards in 1693 the city was then completely destroyed by a heavy earthquake and its aftershocks. The city was then rebuilt in the Baroque architecture that nowadays characterizes it.\n\n\n=== Unified Italy ===\nCatania was one of the vanguards of the movement for the Sicilian autonomy in the early 19th century.\nIn 1860 Giuseppe Garibaldi's expedition of the Thousand conquered Sicily for Piedmont from the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Since the following year Catania was part of the newly unified Italy, whose history it shares since then.\n During World War II, Catania was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces, owing to the presence of two of the main Axis airfields in Sicily (Gerbini and Fontanarossa) and for its strategically important port and marshalling yard. Altogether, the city suffered eighty-seven air raids. The heaviest raids took place in the spring and summer of 1943, before and during the Allied invasion of Sicily; they caused heavy damage to che city (among others, twenty-eight churches and most historic palaces suffered damage), killed 750 inhabitants and prompted most of the population to flee to the countryside. After heavy fighting across eastern Sicily, Catania was eventually captured by the British 8th Army on 5 August 1943.After the conflict, and the constitution of the Italian Republic (1946), Catania attempted to catch up with the economic and social development of Italy's richer northern regions. The problems faced in Catania were emblematic of those faced by other towns in the Mezzogiorno, namely a heavy gap in industrial development and infrastructures, and the threat of the mafia. This notwithstanding, during the 1960s (and partly during the 1990s) Catania enjoyed development and a period of economic, social and cultural success. In the first decade of the 21st century, Catania's economic and social development somewhat faltered and the city is again facing economic and social stagnation. This was aggravated by the economical crisis left by the Forza Italia administration of mayor Scapagnini in 2008.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Metropolitan City ===\n\nThe Metropolitan City of Catania was established in 2015 and replaced the former Province of Catania. It includes the city proper and 57 comuni (municipalities). The population of the Metropolitan City is 1,107,702.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Metropolitan area of Catania includes the comune of Catania (311,584 inhabitants) and 26 surrounding comuni forming an urban belt (498,650 inhabitants). The total population of the Metropolitan area of Catania is therefore 810,234. The comuni of the Metropolitan area are:\n\nThese comuni form a system with the centre of Catania sharing its economical and social life and creating an organic urban texture.\n\n\n=== City proper ===\nThe city of Catania proper (comune di Catania) is divided in six administrative areas called circoscrizioni. The current administrative setup was established in 2013, modifying previous setups dating back to 1971, 1978 and 1995.\nThe six areas are:\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe symbol of the city is u Liotru, or the Fontana dell'Elefante, assembled in 1736 by Giovanni Battista Vaccarini. It portrays an ancient lavic stone elephant and is topped by an Egyptian obelisk from Syene. Legend has it that Vaccarini's original elephant was neuter, which the men of Catania took as an insult to their virility. To appease them, Vaccarini appropriately appended elephantine testicles to the original statue.\nThe Sicilian name u Liotru is a phonetic change of Heliodorus, a nobleman who, after trying without success to become bishop of the city, became a sorcerer and was therefore condemned to the stake. Legend has it that Heliodorus himself was the sculptor of the lava elephant and that he used to magically ride it in his fantastic travels from Catania to Constantinople. Another legend has it that Heliodorus was able to transform himself into an elephant.\nThe presence of an elephant in the millenary history of Catania is surely connected to both zooarcheology and popular creeds. In fact, the prehistoric fauna of Sicily from the Upper Paleolithic, included dwarf elephants. Paleontologist Othenio Abel suggested that the presence of dwarf elephants in Sicily may be the origin of the legend of the Cyclops. Ancient Greeks, after finding the skulls of dwarf elephants, about twice the size of a human skull, with a large central nasal cavity (mistaken for a large single eye-socket) supposed that they were skulls of giants with a single eye.\nThe Catanian Museum of Mineralogy, Paleontology and Vulcanology holds the integral unburied skeleton of an Elephas falconeri in an excellent state of conservation. The first inhabitants of Etna  molded such lavic artifact to idolize the mythical proboscidian.\n\n\n=== Classical buildings ===\nThe city has been buried by lava a total of seventeen times in recorded history, and in layers under the present day city are the Roman city that preceded it, and the Greek city before that. Many of the ancient monuments of the Roman city have been destroyed by the numerous seisms. Currently, different ancient remains can be seen and visited in the city-centre, as part of an archaeological park (Parco Archeologico Greco-Romano di Catania).\n\nAncient edifices include:\n\nGreek-Roman Theatre of Catania (2nd century)\nOdeon (3rd century). It could house up to 1500 spectators\nAmphitheatre\nGreek Acropolis of Montevergine\nRoman Aqueduct\nRoman Forum\nRoman broken arcades\nChristian basilicas, hypogea, burial monuments and Catacombs\nRoman Colonnade\n\n\n=== Roman thermal structures ===\nAchillean Baths\nTerme dell\u2019Indirizzo\nTerme di Santa Maria Odigitria\nTerme della Rotonda\nBaths of the Four Quoins\nTerme di Palazzo Asmundo\nTerme del Palazzo dell\u2019Universit\u00e0\nTerme di Casa Gagliano\nTerme della Chiesa di Sant'Antonio Abate\n\n\n=== Baroque and historical churches ===\n\nThe Baroque city centre of Catania is a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nThe Cathedral (1070\u20131093, rebuilt after the 1693 earthquake)\nSaint Agatha Abbey (1620)\nSaint Placidus (1769)\nChurch of San Giuseppe al Duomo\nChurch of Santissimo Sacramento al Duomo\nChurch of San Martino dei Bianchi\nChurch of Sant'Agata la Vetere (254)\nSaint Agatha by the Furnace or Saint Blaise (1098, rebuilt in 1700)\nChurch of the Saint Jail or Saint Agatha at the Jail (Santo Carcere or Sant'Agata al Carcere) (1760).

Ognina is the maritime quarter and the main fishing pole of Catania. Many bareboats and umpteen smacks gather and crowd here all year round. In its close vicinities there is a cylindric tower, known as Saint Mary's Tower (Torre Santa Maria), which was restructured in the 16th century to prevent the frequent plunders of the Saracen pirates. The church is the result of the gradual modification of the Greek Temple Athena Longatis or Parthenos Longatis that existed on the steep reef. This cult was imported from a Boeotian region of Greece called Longas from where the first Hellenic settlers of this borough probably came. After the earthquake of 1693 it was rebuilt on the same place but with a different orientation.\nOur Lady of Montserrat (1755)\nChurch of  Santa Maria della Salute\nSaint Mary of La Salette\nChurch of Santa Maria della Mercede\nChurch of Santa Caterina al Rinazzo\nOur Lady of Concordia\nChurch of Santa Maria della Guardia\nOur Lady of Consolation\nChurch of Santissimo Crocifisso Maiorana\nCrucifix of Miracles\nCrucifix of Good Death\nOur Lady of La Mecca\nSaint Cajetan at the Marina\nMost Holy Redeemer\nSaint Francis of Paola\nChurch of the Divina Maternit\u00e0\nChapel of Mary Auxiliatrix\nChapel of the Sacred Heart of Jesus\nChurch of the Sacro Cuore al Fortino (1898)\nSaints George and Denis\nChurch of the Sacred Heart of the Capuchins\nSaint Christopher\nSaints Cosmas and Damian\nChurch of Santa Maria del Soccorso or Santa Maria della Palma\nSaint Vitus\nChurch of the Santi Angeli Custodi\nChurch of the Santissimo Salvatore\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nUrsino Castle, built by emperor Frederick II in the 13th century.\nPalace of the Elephants, designed by Giovan Battista Vaccarini.

The city is famous for its mainly petrochemical industry, and the extraction of sulphur. In the year 2000, according to Census, Catania was the 14th richest city in Italy, with a GDP of US$6.6 billion (\u20ac6.304 billion), which was 0.54% of the Italian GDP, a GDP per capita of US$21,000 (\u20ac20,100) and an average GDP per employee of US$69,000 (\u20ac66,100).In the late-19th century and early-20th century, Catania began to be heavily industrialised, with its several factories and chimneys, often to the extant that it was referred to as Southern Italy's \"Manchester\". The economy of Catania suffered heavily from the bad effects of World War I, and was marked by an economic crisis and recession that culminated in the 1920s. Since then, the city lost its industrial and entrepreneurial importance. In the 1930s, Catania remained a small fishing town with derelict and disused industries. However, after the destruction of World War II, Catania's economy began to re-grow in the late-1950s and early-1960s. As a matter of fact, the city's economic growth was so rapid and dynamic that it was often nicknamed the \"Milan of the South\", or in Italian \"Milano del Sud\". This rapid economic growth prompted a great number of Sicilians living in the more rural areas, or smaller towns such as Enna, Ragusa and Caltanissetta, to move to the city to seek new jobs.\nToday, Catania, despite several problems, has one of the most dynamic economies in the whole of Southern Italy. It still has a strong industrial and agricultural sector, and a fast-growing tourist industry, with many international visitors coming to visit the city's main sights and the nearby Etna volcano. It contains the headquarters or important offices of companies such as STMicroelectronics, and also several chemical and pharmaceutical businesses. There have been several new business developments to further boost Catania's economy, including the construction of Etnapolis, a big shopping mall designed by Massimiliano Fuksas, the same architect who designed the FieraMilano industrial fair in Milan, or the Etna Valley, where several high-tech offices are located.\nTourism is a fast-growing industry in Catania. Lately the administration and private companies have made several investments in the hospitality industry in order to make tourism a competitive sector in the Metropolitan City. Etnaland, a big amusement and water park located in Belpasso, in the Metropolitan area of Catania, 12 kilometers (7 miles) from the city center, is the largest in Southern Italy and attracts thousands of tourists, not only from Sicily, but also from the rest of Italy: according to Tripadvisor (2018) it is the third water park in Europe.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Catania dates back to 1434 and it is the oldest university in Sicily. Its academic nicknames are: Siculorum Gymnasium and Siciliae Studium Generale. Nowadays it hosts 12 faculties and over 62,000 students, and it offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.\nCatania hosts the Scuola Superiore, an academic institution linked to the University of Catania, aimed at the excellence in education. The Scuola Superiore di Catania also offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.Apart from the University and the Scuola Superiore Catania is base of the prestigious Istituto Musicale Vincenzo Bellini an advanced institute of musical studies (Conservatory) and the Accademia di Belle Arti an advanced institute of artistic studies. Both institutions offer programs of university level for musical and artistic education.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe opera composer Vincenzo Bellini was born in Catania, and a museum exists at his birthplace.\nThe Teatro Massimo \"Vincenzo Bellini\", which opened in 1890, is named after the composer. The opera house presents a variety of operas through a season, which run from December to May, many of which are the work of Bellini.\nGiovanni Verga was born in Catania in 1840. He became the greatest writer of Verismo, an Italian literary movement akin to Naturalism. His novels portray life among the lower levels of Sicilian society, such as fishermen and stonemasons, and were written in a mixture of both literary language and local dialect. Francesco Longo Mancini was a painter known for paintings of nudes who was born in Catania in 1880.\n\nThe city's patron saint is Saint Agatha, who is celebrated with a religious pageantry, the Festival of Saint Agatha, on February 5 every year.\nThe city is base of the newspaper La Sicilia and of the TV-channel Antenna Sicilia also known as Sicilia Channel. Several others local television channels and free-press magazines have their headquarters in Catania.\nThe city is home to the Catania Jazz Festival, which typically runs for several winter months with concerts in different locations.\nIn the late 1980s and during the 1990s Catania had a sparkling and unique popular music scene. Indie pop and indie rock bands, local radio station and dynamic independent music record labels sprung. As a result, in those years the city experienced a vital and effervescent cultural period. Artists like Carmen Consoli and Mario Venuti and internationally known indie rock bands like Uzeda came out of this cultural milieu.\nThe city is the home of Amatori Catania rugby union team, Calcio Catania football team and Orizzonte Catania, the latter being a women's water polo club, winning eight European Champions Cup titles from 1994 to 2008. Noted Italian basketball coach Ettore Messina is a native of Catania. The city also hosted the first ever qualification tournament for the Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1992, and the associated Etna Cup, which was won by the host Sicily team. In addition, the Catania Elephants are currently members of the Italian Football League. Catania also hosted the 2011 FIE Fencing World Championships.\n\n\n== Food and cuisine ==\n\nFood is an important part of Catania's culture and way of life. Local cuisine emphasizes several traits of Sicilian one, whilst developing some of its own.\nStreet food is one of the best ways to experience traditional dishes. Arancini are perhaps the city's most iconic one: they are stuffed rice balls coated in bread-crumbs and deep fried; in Catania, they are shaped like a cone to remind of Mount Etna. Typical specialties from the city include cipollina (puff pastry with onion, tomato and prosciutto filling), bolognese (a small pizza topped with tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto and boiled egg and covered in puff pastry), crispelle (deep fried dough balls with ricotta or anchovies filling.)\nDuring street-fairs and religious festivals, street stalls sell calia e simenza (toasted chickpeas and pumpkin seeds). Typical from old street markets are sangeli (cooked pork blood), quarumi (pork tripe), zuzzu (pork jelly), mauru (edible seaweed), and raw seafood. Horse meat is very traditional and it is sold in shops called arrusti e mancia (\"roast it and eat it\"), which roast the meat in streetside barbecues.Apart from street food, typical dishes from Catania are: pasta alla Norma (pasta with fried eggplant, tomato sauce and ricotta salata cheese), named after the namesake opera by Vincenzo Bellini; pasta cco niuru (pasta in cuttlefish ink), maccu (fava beans pur\u00e9e), bastaddi affucati or brocculi affucati (stewed cauliflower or broccoli), caponata (saut\u00e9ed vegetables) and scacciata (a pie filled with tuma cheese) which is traditional during Christmastime.Catania is also famous for its pasticceria (pastries and cakes). Pastries vary according to season and to seasonal events: during the Festival of Saint Agatha, patron saint of the city, there are the cassatelle (small cassatas) and olivette (olive shaped almond paste). In Easter, there are aceddi ccu l\u2019ovu (boiled eggs covered in biscuit). In summer there is granita. During the Festa dei morti (traditional celebrations in All Souls' Day) there are biscuits called ossa di mortu, rame di Napoli and nsuddi.\nDrink kiosks are everywhere in town and serve soft drinks. Traditional soft drinks are made mixing fruit syrups with soda and other flavors such as anisette. They are thirst-killer and they are very popular with the locals and the tourists.\nLocal products include blood oranges, pistachios from Bronte, extra-virgin olive oil, cactus fruit, cherries, grapes from Mazzarrone, strawberries from Maletto, mushrooms, honey and wine.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nCatania has a commercial seaport (Catania seaport), an international airport (Catania Fontanarossa), a central railway station (Catania Centrale) and it is a main node of the Sicilian motorway system.\nThe motorways serving Catania are the A18 Messina-Catania and the A19 Palermo-Catania; extensions of the A18 going from Catania to Syracuse and to Gela are currently under construction.\nThe Circumetnea is a narrow-gauge railway that runs for 110 km (68 mi) from Catania round the base of Mount Etna. It attains the height of 976 m (3,202.10 ft) above sea level before descending to rejoin the coast at Giarre-Riposto to the North.\nIn the late 1990s the first line of an underground railway (Metropolitana di Catania) was built. The underground service started in 1999 and it is currently active on a route of 8.8 km (5.5 mi), from the station Nesima (West of town), passing through the stations of San Nullo, Cibali (still under construction), Milo, Borgo, Giuffrida, Italia, Galatea, Giovanni XXIII, to Stesicoro. These two stations, bringing Catania Underground in the city centre, have opened on 20 December 2016. First line is planned to extend from the satellite city of Patern\u00f2 to Fontanarossa Airport.\n\n\n=== Catania Public Transportation Statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Catania, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 56 min. 13% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 23 min, while 46% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.7 km, while 3% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nAaron ben Gershon abu al-Rabi, 15th century rabbi\nOriana Bandiera (1971\u2013), economist and academic\nPippo Baudo (1936-), TV presenter\nFranco Battiato (1945-), singer-songwriter, composer, filmmaker\nGianni Bella (1947-), singer-songwriter\nMarcella Bella (1952-), singer\nVincenzo Bellini (1801\u20131835), composer\nOrnella Bertorotta (1967-) politician\nGiuseppa Bolognara Calcagno (1826\u20131884), freedom fighter of the Risorgimento\nVitaliano Brancati (1907\u20131954), writer\nLuigi Capuana (1839\u20131915), writer\nCharondas (6th c.

In 1823, Light had fondly written of Catania: \"The two principal streets cross each other at right angles in the square in the direction of north and south and east and west. They are wide and spacious and about a mile [1.6 km] long\". This became the basis for his plan of Adelaide.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAmico, Vito Maria (1740).

          "It is interesting to see the Anfiteatro Romano. While it is not as impressive as the Greco Roman theater, it is still nice to see that it has been uncovered and preserved. We only made a quick stop since it was raining and it wasn't open, but it is always amazing to see these",
          "Interesting site in the middle of Catania. Not to compare with the other Greco Roman theatre. Still, a piece of history",
          "We first went here on the Monday when we arrived but it is closed Went back on the Tuesday Worth the visit Amazes me how so much history gets built upon (and in this case also subsumed by lava( over the years Love the fact there is still so much of the theatre accessible by",
          "Anfiteatro Romano on Piazza Stesicoro is a nice ancient remains in Catania. You are free to enter the well preserved amphiteater and view the remains at street level. Highly recommended.",
          "This was on the way so we stopped in and had a look. Not a whole lot to see or overly informative but nevertheless worth a quick look. So much history to see in Catania.",
          "Walked by and can\u2019t complain to see a free local piece of history and the story is remarkable back in the day of how it was made. How many people could fit inside the amphitheater ok maybe it has not been so well preserved but what is there is worth seeing, you\u2019re free to walk",
          "Wow.....not much remaining to see since the surrounds of Catania have built up over the ancient ruins! Access entrance is from Piazza Stesicoro and free to visit! Walking down some metal stairs you reach the ground level to walk freely around the ruins of the amphitheater that",
          "Centrally positioned, neglected and built over, this is hardly worth the effort and best seen from your coach as you drive around it. Catania itself has little to offer, dirty and neglected too so I suggest visitors travel further afield to really see the best of Sicily. Try",
          "wonderful site , signs confusing sould not get into the ntique collections toilets malfunctions and closed no sign explaining",
          "We found this spot by accident. It is a nice little roman theatre though it would garner a lot of attention if the signs are well displayed. There was not much written about this archaeological site and it is kinda dirty too and poorly maintained.",
          "It is sad to see this kind of piece of history abandoned to itself. Rubbish, mud, dirty walls and some areas used as warehouse...",
          "I am a huge fan of ancient ruins. Amphitheaters as well preserved as this one is high on my things to do list. You can take this one in at your own pace and explore all the tunnels and pathways in the theater. Enjoy this one.",
          "The amphiteatre shows us the actual base and ground level of the city. We can assume that the population of the city might be 50k at least in those times. I wish it was possible to get in the archeological site but it was not possible. Situated across Piazza Stesicoro and must",
          "It is very good place about Roman historia and Etna\u2019 historia. You can go to there. You can go with your children.",
          "Visited the amphitheater today with friends. It is very small and not completely excavated due to the buildings in the area. It is free to visit the outside.",
          "Part of a Roman amphitheatre that's free to visit. In Plazza and near a nice church. A good place to visit.",
          "It may not be a must-see place to visit, but it's worth it for free. However, part of Catania's multi-stage history.",
          "If short of cash, just find the exposed part while walking around Catania, and you still get an idea of the scale of it.",
          "Not the most recommended of its sort. The theater in Taormina is a much better site. A short visit. We were quite disappointed.... The site is small, and takes a short visit... The people in the reception speak only Italian and to say the least not very friendly... Catania",
          "I returned to see the Anfiteatro Romano since I remember walking past it years ago when I had been in Catanias. It's worth a short stop. We visited on a Monday when it is closed. Otherwise, one can walk around it.",
          "You can see part of what was a large, ancient, Roman theatre which is now below ground level, which gives you an indication of how big it must have been. Entry is free and there are information boards in English.",
          "These are remarkable remains of a Greek /Roman amphitheater right in the middle of the city. We found it easy enough. Yep it\u2019s not complete and yep there are other buildings encroaching on the ruins but that is part of its uniqueness. We loved poking about and we were the only",
          "look in the main street for the entrance on Victor Emanuele . euros 8 or 10. ??? small colosseum. but lots of hidden part to explore .",
          "Struggling to find the entrance, we pretty much walked around the block. We were rather disappointed in the condition and descriptions of the ruins. Considering the other gorgeous sites we saw in Taormina, Agrigento and Marinella di Selinunte and even Siracusa, these, the",
          "If you enjoy seeing ancient Roman amphitheatres this one is quite accessible in the city centre. It is not well preserved but still amazing to see.",
          "Our tour bus detoured so that we could view these ruins. the guide advised that they were the remains of a colosseum that once rivalled the Rome Colosseum in size. Over the centuries the ruins had been covered to allow housing and commercial developments and associated",
          "You can't believe such an amazing ruin can be in the center of town with houses all around. Well worth a visit",
          "Unfortunately you can see just a little part of it, but it is very cool because it is in the Center of the City. The rest of it is under your feet covered by the modern streets. No fees, it is free",
          "Considering it\u2019s free this isn\u2019t a bad place to have a quick look around. This consists of a small ruin that has been encroached upon by development of the city. Still retains some of its arches under the theatre.",
          "Right in the centre of the city this is a striking piece of archeological discovery. The way that this site has been recovered and preserved is amazing especially when you consider when it was done around 1903 and the eruption from Etna that had occurred. It shows a small",
          "They discovered this when re surfacing the road around the small square. Having found it the rebuilt the road anyway, so only a small section remains. Its hardly worth the effort, but if you are passing you may as well take a peep. It won't take you long.",
          "For a fee you can walk through the ruin and get a guided tour. Nevertheless there are sidewalks around the small area of the surviving parts of this site. There is signage which tells about the history of the theater.",
          "In the center of the city, there is a hole in the streat, with ruins inside ;) Don't be afraid - It is safe - with a fance. You can see how big the theatre was, mainly thanks to tables - makes impression. If you are not proffesional - just for a moment. Amfiteatros in Tarmina",
          "The venue is located in the city center of Catania. Parking on the street is difficult. The site is showing ruins of a Roman amphitheater. The site shows only a small part of the theater. The thing was huge in relation. Very interesting.",
          "It is posible to walk around the ground level of this theatre. The pay booth is down a few steps and then you can go on around independently. However, from the amount of filth that we could see below ground we were very 'put off'. We walked round and the best impressions are",
          "Located at the eastern side of busy Piazza Stesicoro , this amazing piece of archeology is there for you to discover . Don't be lazy , go down and look at it . Entry is free .",
          "It is an interesting little stop as venture up Via Etnea. It is marvelous to see how the theatre was carved into the volcanic rock in the area. We did not go in but made a couple rounds of the site taking photos from the street. It is an easy stop to glean a little history",
          "If you like history, do not miss a visit although you need to read about the history of the place it will help,but Catania is full of history every corner you nturn, enjoy",
          "This roman amphitheater is great to see in the centre of Catania. I loved to see how it was built as you view it from street level looking down into it. It's easy to visualise what it was on he hill, and imagine the magnificence of the amphitheatre.",
          "Near one of the busiest squares the visitor finds the relatively well preserved excavation of a Roman amphiteater.",
          "Let me start by saying that the 3 stars are not a reflection of the theatre itself but a judgement on the stay it is kept in. The ruins of this Roman piece of glorious architecture, are left in a despicable state. For the wondering Indiana jones thou it is still amazing to walk",
          "Right in the middle of Catania and well worth a visit. Well presented and some lovely sculptures and pieces of ancient statues displayed separately.",
          "Located on Piazza Stesicoro, there is only a small portion of the amphitheatre visible as most of it is buried beneath the city. It was entirely buried after the 1693 earthquake, until excavations began in 1904 and finished in 1906. The amphitheatre is made from lava blocks,",
          "Right in the centre of the city, the amphitheatre cut out of lava rock, showing the public terraces, and exposed and covered cellars for the gladiators. You are free to wander around at will and explore this truly historic remains.",
          "A small portion of the roman theatre is exposed and open for exploring. The rest is under the city! It only takes about 10 minutes to see the entire attraction.",
          "Only a small part of this structure has been uncovered above ground, so you can imagine it must have been very large indeed. You might feel underwhelmed by this but it is historically quite significant and worth looking at. Some of the walls and inner workings of the",
          "Despite how much of the structure is under the city I think the city has gone a great job in excavating a section of it so anyone can see what an amphitheater looks like if you were going through the tunnels to go to your seat. Obviously they will not be able to display more due",
          "The entrance to the site is quite interesting, as it looks like it's inside a building, although there is a sign of Roman Theater on the building. We only found the site based on the picture of the building on the web, otherwise we would have missed it. We were expecting",
          "The foundation remains occupy a city block surrounded by impressive palazzos and across the street from the monument to composer Bellini.",
          "Just a small part of the amphitheater has been excavated as the most of it lies under the modern buildings. The ruins display the same signs of neglect that plague the entire city of Catania",
          "If you have extra time for Catania visit but it is not very interesting special in a rainy days . But a lot of nice , beautiful cats \ud83d\ude00",
          "If you want to see a copy of Colosseo you must see anfiteatro romano in Catania. With a peculiarity most of it is underground",
          "Another amphitheare that had been mostly built over after being abandoned in the 6th century (it was built in the 2nd century!). Can be seen for free from the street.",
          "In the past it was for sure a nice place but problem is that really not a lot of the anftheater left so there is almost nothing to see. But you can see it for free from the street so that's good :)",
          "The roman theater (as written in the entrance) or greek theater (as the street name says) is very easy to reach. It's not so big like these in Taormina or Syracuza, but nice. The staff doesn't speak any english, but is very kind and with online translator (!) equiped.",
          "I have been to Catania many times and although to see this only takes a few minutes it is well worth it. A real sense of history.",
          "Juxtaposed against busy traffic and lower than street level you can really imagine the passage of time and its effects on this ancient monument. You can go down some steps and walk among the tunnels leading to the amphitheatre which is nice but there were information signs.",
          "It is impossible not to face that anfiteatro if you have a walk in the center catania. In my first visit, two years ago I was not able to see inside. Now I have seen everywhere of the theather, it is really attractive and worth a visit when in catania",
          "After numerous visits to Catania finally the day has come that much expected, passing along Via Etnea fortuitously saw the gates of the amphitheater opened and lost no time in asking to visit this corner of the city now submerged. Admission is free. A charming place full of",
          "Absolutely fantastic hard to believe that it could survive all the volcanic eruptions! Right in centre of the city what a joy to see.",
          "Ruins of a Roman amphitheatre that once held nearly 16000 spectators dating back over 2000 years ago. Located on a square just off the main street Via Etnea. Can view it from street or can also wander amongst ruins for free.",
          "You have to see it inside! Infrastructure of amphitheatre is impressive. There was no one but me, so I could feel like an ancient dresser :)",
          "The visible remains of Catania's once-massive Roman amphitheatre are limited, and below street level. Much of this extensive complex is still unexcavated and stretches beneath the surrounding buildings in this busy part of the town. Some reviewers have expressed disappointment",
          "Being only one of a few places to see in Catania it's really a pity that it's not more well kept. That being said it's still worth a visit.",
          "Nobody else was in this amphitheatre. To get to the arena you have to walk through the Gladiator's tunnels. If you visit Catania you should visit this historic gem.",
          "Anifiteatro Romano, or Roman amphitheatre is over two thousand years old and in the middle of the street, believed to have been partially buried in the late 1600s Mt Etna eruption. This is an amazing piece of history and shows why historians and geologists are always digging for",
          "Always worth to see. But sadly not much to visit. There are much better areas in the old roman empire to visit. Somehow sad to see a bunch of old stones in the middle of the city with the students and shops around. But these stones were there first!",
          "About 2 thousands years old, very rare historical monument. Partially buried after the 1693 earthquake, it was a very big amphitheater, similar but smaller to the Colosseum in Rome. it is possible to look at it from the street and visit it inside, walking in the several tunnels.",
          "It is amazing to see these ruins in the middle of this big city so well preserved. It is a must see if you are an history buff",
          "A small but lovely ampitheatre in the heart of Catania. Very well laid out with information clearly displayed in Italian and English. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "unfortunately the arena is surrounded by buildings at piazza stesicoro, so it is not possible to enjoy the whole picture of this anfiteatro, that surely was dominating this area in the time of its brilliancy ... it is unique, because it was constructed of volcanic rocks, like",
          "This is a small slice of Roman amphitheatre. Belatedly, the archaeologists have also tried to provide explanation of the way 17-19th century buildings were composed on top of and alongside the site.",
          "There is no fee to enter this site, although it is quite small so it will not take you long to walk around as most of the nearby buildings are covering the remains. However, I really enjoyed walking around the amphitheatre regardless of the size. I did notice a lot of cats",
          "The ruins cant be missed in the Piazza Stesicoro and thankfully all of the ruins can be seen from the Piazza without paying the admission fee to go down amongst the ruins to join the local cats & dogs. The remaining ruins are impressive but you cant help wonder how impressive",
          "such beautiful ruins... dated around 2nd Century BC. Unfortunately this is only a small part of the massive structure as in its time it could seat 16000 / 17000 people and it was the 2nd largest after the Colosseum in Rome. It is surely worth a look even from the street, but",
          "Archeologically very interesting, but mainly buried beneath more modern buildings and busy streets. The buildings themselves are monuments so I understand that only part of the theatre has been exposed.",
          "The are surrounded by main roads on all side and are worth a look if your in the area. It's very close to the main shopping areas and if you're there it's a nice way to spend a while. It's free in and nice to wander and take some photos.",
          "It was a bit disappointing, compared to the impression I had of it from pictures in books and travel guides. As it's surrounded by so many buildings, one has the impression that very little has remained of it.",
          "Not worth a special trip to see this - it is mainly buried beneath Catania and what is viewable is not too remarkable (unless never seen any Roman ruins before)"

          "Amazing \u201cmust see\u201d Roman theatre in central Catania.  It is well worth the entrance fee and our whole family enjoyed exploring this facility which was built several hundred years BC.",
          "The most interesting place in Catania. Required to visit. The ancient word is hidden among dirty, noise and unsafe streets of Catania. Close to the main square we faced this place accidentally. Ruins saved really well and there is lot to discover among stones, stairs and catacombs.",
          "It was quite a nice visit. The atmosphere there is brilliant because of its positioning close to the historic centre.\nThere are underground access paths that are very fun to explore - prepare to climb many tall stairs if you plan on visiting it.\nNo English audio guides. Free for EU <26y/olds.",
          "Very neat to walk through the tunnels & around the theatre. Appears they are still adding more for display, such as columns. Can't wait to visit again once they've added.",
          "A real secret find! You enter from the street expecting something quite small and find yourself in a huge set up with ambulatories, stadium theatre and what seems like a giant 3D jigsaw \nset underneath existing houses! In fact it's been \u2026",
          "A very nice Greek/Roman theatre that you can walk all around and go on. There is a much smaller one beside it which you can't go into.\n\nThere is a little museum there too which consists of two rooms with maybe two dozen objects. Most of the \u2026",
          "Strongly recommend visiting this Roman theatre when in Catania. It's very centrally based and just a few minutes walk from the Duomo. Well preserved, too, and quite vast in size.",
          "Amazing structure more than 2000 years old with remnants of civilisations even earlier. At 6\u20ac entry is cheap and is worth it to explore the tunnels beneath the amphitheater and recovered artefacts.",
          "Beautiful church! That style was pretty",
          "Interesting visit! You see how over the centuries buildings were built using the walls of this Roman amphitheater and they now completely surround it.",
          "A hidden gem, really really nice to visit and you can walk pretty much everywhere. Payed 3 euros as I'm under 24(or 26 aha)",
          "Love visiting this place even to find a quiet spot away from the city. \nLots of history to take in from Roman to how people built their homes above the rubble.",
          "Lots to see here, best to allow at least 2 hours.\nThere's been a lot of restoration work, and there's a lot of reading material on display to explain the history A roman amphitheatre built on top of a Greek one,  remember to bring some cold water and a snack, it's easy to remain interested for several hours as there's a lot to see!",
          "a truly beautiful place, not too crowded, a peaceful place in the centre.",
          "Less impressive than the Theater in Taormina\nStill a place to see and stop by if you have the time and are enough days in Catania.\nIt is well preserved but it is not huge and it is enclosed between the neighbor buildings  which somehow lessens the effect.",
          "Very interesting place lying just under the buildings of modern Catania. A complex of ancient Roman theatre and an Odeon. Worth visiting.",
          "Amazing Place! If you go to Catania you must visit the Museum!!",
          "Fantastic hidden away place, well worth a visit.",
          "Lovely exclusion - I got more then I hoped for. Entrance is 6e per person (discounts are granted to students, elderly and groups) and for it we got a print-out tour guide as well. This stop wasn't rated high on any tourist maps I saw online \u2026",
          "It was quite awesome to discover the small hidden details of the building. It is interesting to see how close are the homes of the local people to the theatre, and to see the story how they used the ruins for living. \n\nI recommend to just \u2026",
          "A great visit in the middle of the city. Affordable price",
          "The kids just loved it. Unfortunately, for the same price, some of the area was closed \ud83d\ude41",
          "Very well preserved. Right in the city.",
          "Very good place to visit. \n\u20ac6 per person",
          "Great place to visit. Really interesting. See the theatre, the Odeon and the house for just 6 euros. Plus lots of shade so it gets you out if the sun for an hour. Good dual Italian/English signage fur a change too.",
          "Very interesting site right in the centre of Catania. Easy access but not suitable for people with mobility challenges.",
          "Well witty a visit. Take your time to fully discover this ancient site. A leaflet guide should have been provided.",
          "Great place to visit in Catania, went on Sunday morning and there was no one else there, had the place to ourselves",
          "Excavated and opened to visitors 2015. Wonderful exposure of this 3rd century theatre, see website for details.",
          "You can spend a few minutes to get lost into the ancient in the middle of  a busy city. You can feel the contrast of times.",
          "Amazing place. Must see",
          "Great experience. I love the atmosphere such historical spits feed me with. Go there and see the view ancient greeks had when watching to their \"movies\"",
          "Very impressive though a bit expensive (6eur). Staff was not too kind and did not know where our country is even though it is neighbor to Italy. But the theatre is well worth the visit and not to crowded",
          "Great example of classical theatre right in the centre of Catania, worth seeing, giving 4 stars not 5 because of close vicinity of Siracusa and Taormina with their jewels!",
          "When checking the photos you would say that its only the theatry there to see. But you get to see exhibits, hallways, original pieces and some of the rooms, all beneath the stands. Entrance is \u20ac6 per person. On average, you would see it in 20-30 mins.",
          "It was a very nice experience. Really liked it.",
          "Amazing place. Ancient spirit lives there.",
          "Amazing place hiden behind The houses",
          "Very interesting place, great to see the old structure integrated and combined with new archirecture. There could be more Info-Boards, otherwise I think the 6\u20ac entrance was a little overpriced.",
          "Really interesting place! Definitely worth a visit when you're in Catania.",
          "A lot of history covered up over time, but excavated to reveal the theater now. Seems the sicilians don't appreciate the historical significance of their past. But then, it is everywhere.",
          "3 euros if you are an EU citizen aged between 18 and 25. And totally worth it. So nice to sit in a place knowing it was so popular some decades ago.",
          "Interesting place that I strongly recommend to visit. It looks bigger than it is from outside. I was here last week. So it's  very quiet and seeing at the ampheteatre is actually very relaxing.",
          "Nice artefacts from ancient Rome and medieval buildings nearby.. Sometimes concerts are organized. Kind and welcoming  staff.",
          "If the theatre in Taormina has a great view on the sea, this one is surrounded and almost hidden by new houses. It is still a great piece of history, not so old as the one from Taormina but well conserved. A pity for it not being well presented nor promoted",
          "Although worth visiting this could be so much better. Lacks depth in its displays and you are left very much to your own while there. Shame really.",
          "Amazing theatre and well preserved. Nice and quiet and you are free to walk around as you like.",
          "Worth seeing!It is different from the one e.g in Taormina because this one has the tunnels on the side",
          "Saw it by accident. Went in the door, paid the 6e and felt that it was money well spent.",
          "Interesting place. It looks bigger than it is from the outside. There are some tiny exhibitions as well with pottery and coins dug up from the excavation. I was here in February, so it's very quiet and sitting at the amphitheatre is \u2026",
          "Nice place! But not the greatest organisation in the place.",
          "Brilliant to see the houses simply planted on top of the ancient site. Not sure they need to remove the last one though.",
          "Magnificant place where history speak with you through ages.",
          "It's okay, but if you're planning to go to the Roman Theatre in Taormina I wouldn't bother with this one",
          "Absolutely astonishing -- my favorite Roman theater in Sicily. Spent hours there and it exceeded all expectations. The dark, lower-level corridors with long heaps of architectural detritus are something else. Went on a weekday and -- aside from a couple school groups -- there were almost no other tourists. Jackpot!",
          "Much cooler than you think it'll be",
          "Must ses if you are in Catania. Theatre is only 10 minutes walking from cantre. Valuable piece of histroy. Theatre is well preserved. Recommend to visit.",
          "Great visit well restored and kept greek roman amphitheatre...\nSuggest to have other languages on the signs in the small museum.\nWorth the visit",
          "Awsome site!!!! In the middle of town..",
          "Fantastic place loaded with history. Great restauration works. Could be better maintained (abandoned explanatory boards, broken glass and seringes). Well worth an hour or two inside.",
          "Great place with great history",
          "It was a good time",
          "Amazing place. And unimaginable composition of ancient and medieval",
          "Well there's not much you can say about a Roman amphitheater really.",
          "If you've been to one of these outdoor ancient theatres before, it's not that much of a difference. What's interesting is that residential buildings have come up around this theatre so from the outside, you wouldn't even know it's there. You could walk beneath the stone steps/sitting areas.",
          "Wonderful place, full of history, difficult to find the entry though.",
          "Worth to see but I can imagine it restored better.",
          "Great history and keep an eye out for events. A night orchestra show in the venue is a must.",
          "If I lived in Catania, I would never go to a park to read a book. I.d go to the Roman Theatre instead. \u2764",
          "Amazing place with lots to walk around and see, fantastic history",
          "The beautiful place",

          "The antique ruin right in the middle of regular residential houses left quite an impression. Not as spectacular as the amphitheatres in Taormina or Greece but worth a visit. Also, some of the friendliest cats in Catania live here. \u263a",

          "It is worth the attention. Entrance is inexpensive, 6 euros per adult. It's even more interesting to see how the locals built on top and near Teatro Romano. The specifics of this city are present here as well. \u2026",
          "The only theater in a neighborhood. Beautiful example of Roman architecture but unfortunately they do not demolish the abusive houses that are built inside the theater. To see absolutely beautiful\n\n",

          "Finding the entrance was very hard. I accidentally found some of the grandstands inside the windows of the building and found them. The entrance was in a mediocre building on the street. It was amazing to go inside. \u2026",
          "A big surprise in one and inside some buildings. It is not only theater if not amphitheater, because it has basements and caverns or for the fight of gladiators and beasts. Spectacular place where it is and the state \u2026",

          "Definitely worth a visit. One of the best preserved theaters in Sicily. Inside it mixes Greek and Roman parts. Hidden and little known by the Sicilians, but certainly on the same level as those of Taormina and \u2026",
          "Fantastic ruins, like me, whatever ruins, Roman monuments love me. Do not miss it.\n\n",

Founded in 1434, it is the oldest university in Sicily, the 13th oldest in Italy, and the 29th oldest university in the world. With a population of over 60,000 students, it is the main university in Sicily.\n\n\n== Departments ==\nFollowing the Italian higher education reform introduced by the law 240/10 and adopted by the University of Catania in its new Statute, faculties have been deactivated and departments have been reorganized.\nThe University of Catania has now 17 departments, the Faculty of Medicine, and two special didactic units established in the decentralized offices of Ragusa (Modern Languages) and Syracuse (Architecture). that, additionally to the traditional assignments of scientific research, are in charge of the organization and management of educational activities. A special didactic unit is also the school of excellence \"Scuola Superiore di Catania\", a higher education centre of the University of Catania conceived in 1998 to select the best young minds and offer them a course of studies including analysis, research and experimentation.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe university was founded by King Alfonso V of Aragon (who was also King Alfonso I of Sicily) on 19 October 1434. A charter was granted after two royal councillors (Adamo Asmundo and Battista Platamone) convinced the king to accept the founding of a \"Studium Generale\" in Catania, with the papal recognition arriving ten years later from Pope Eugene IV (18 April 1444). Alfonso V with this gesture wanted to compensate the city (in which there had been recently established the Royal Court) for moving the Sicilian capital from Catania to Palermo. The activity of the Atheneum actually started a year later, in 1445, with 6 professors and 10 students. The first four faculties were Medicine, Philosophy, Canon and Civil Law and Theology. Lessons were initially held in a building in Piazza del Duomo, next to the Cathedral of St. Agatha, and eventually moved to the Palazzo dell'Universit\u00e0 in the late 1690s. This building remains the seat of the university to this day. The first degree was awarded to Antonio Mantello, from Syracuse, in 1449. During the course of the 16th century, approximately 20-25 degrees were awarded each year. The University (which from the 16th century was referred to as \"Siculorum Gymnasium\") was named \"Studium Generale\" because it was the only entity that could release degrees equal to those released in the old Studia of Salamanca, Valladolid, Bologna and this contributed to spread envy in the other Sicilian cities that in culture and traditions didn't feel inferior to Catania. In 1934, the university celebrated its 500th anniversary with King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy, and, in 1984 the 550th one.\nIn the early centuries of its existence, the university was administered by the comune (municipality) of Catania, overseen by the bishop of Catania and protected by the royal power. But with a reform operated by the viceroy in 1679 the authority of the bishop (who was \"Gran Cancelliere\" = \"Great Chancellor\") prevailed: he had the control over the lecturers, the freshmen and students' curriculum. This led to various conflicts between the civil and religious authorities. From 1818 the office of Gran Cancelliere was assigned to the President of the Great Civil Court, instead of the bishop.\n\n\n== List of university scholars historic and famous ==\n\n\n=== Humanities ===\nGiuseppe De Felice Giuffrida, important Italian politician and journalist, was elected the first Socialist mayor of Catania in 1902.\nMario Rapisardi, noted Italian poet and translator, taught at the University in the 1870s. \"Love truth more than glory, more than peace, more than life.

        "wiki": "Catania (UK: , US: , Sicilian and Italian: [ka\u02c8ta\u02d0nja] (listen)) is the second largest city in Sicily, after Palermo, and among the ten largest cities in Italy. Located on Sicily\u2019s east coast, it faces the Ionian Sea. It is the capital of the 58-municipality region known as the Metropolitan City of Catania, which is the seventh-largest metropolitan city in Italy. The population of the city proper is 311,584, while the population of the Metropolitan City of Catania is 1,107,702.Catania was founded in the 8th century BC by Chalcidians Greeks. The city was almost completely destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake in 1169.However, by the 14th century, and into the Renaissance period, Catania was one of Italy's most important cultural, artistic and political centres. It was the site of Sicily\u2019s first university, founded in 1434. It has been the native or adopted home of some of Italy's most famous artists and writers, including the composers Vincenzo Bellini and Giovanni Pacini, and the writers Giovanni Verga, Luigi Capuana, Federico De Roberto and Nino Martoglio.\nThe city has been devastated several times by volcanic eruptions from nearby Mount Etna, the most violent of which was in 1669. And it suffered through another severely damaging earthquake in 1693.Catania today is the industrial, logistical, and commercial center of Sicily. Its airport, the Catania-Fontanarossa Airport, is the largest in Southern Italy. \nHowever, it is also noted for its history, culture, architecture, and gastronomy. The section of the city known as the \u201cold town\u201d features some of the most striking examples of baroque architecture in Italy, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe ancient indigenous population of the Sicels named their villages after geographical attributes of their location. The Sicilian word, katane, means \"grater, flaying knife, skinning place\" or a \"crude tool apt to pare\". Other translations of the name are \"harsh lands\", \"uneven ground\", \"sharp stones\", or \"rugged or rough soil\". The latter etymologies are easily justifiable since, for many centuries following an eruption, the city has always been rebuilt within its black-lava landscape.Around 263 BC, the city was variously known as Cat\u012dna (Latin: [\u02c8kat\u026ana]) and Cat\u0103na (Latin: [\u02c8katana]; Ancient Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 [kat\u00e1n\u025b\u02d0]). The former has been primarily used for its supposed assonance with catina, the Latin feminization of the name catinus. Catinus has two meanings: \"a gulf, a basin or a bay\" and \"a bowl, a vessel or a trough\",  thanks to the city's distinctive topography.\nAround 900, when Catania was part of the emirate of Sicily, it was known in Arabic as Balad al-f\u012bl (\u0628\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644) and Mad\u012bnat al-f\u012bl (\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644), respectively meaning \"the Village (or Country) of the Elephant\" and \"the City of the Elephant\". The Elephant is the lava sculpture over the fountain in Piazza Duomo: most likely a prehistoric sculpture that was reforged during the Byzantine Era, it appears to be a talisman that was reputedly powerful enough to protect the city from enemies and to keep away misfortune, plagues, or natural calamities. Another Arab toponym was Qa\u1e6d\u0101niyyah (\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629), allegedly from the Arabic word for the \"leguminous plants\". Pulses like lentils, beans, peas, broad beans, and lupins were chiefly cultivated in the plains around the city well before the arrival of Aghlabids. Afterwards, many Arabic agronomists  developed these crops and the citrus orchards in the area around the city.\nThe toponym W\u0101d\u012b M\u016bs\u00e1 (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0649), or \"the Valley of Moses\" (from the Arabic name of the Simeto River), was rarely used.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCatania is located on the east coast of the island of Sicily, at the foot of Mount Etna.\nAs observed by Strabo, the location of Catania at the foot of Mount Etna has been both a curse and a blessing. On the one hand, violent outbursts of the volcano throughout history have destroyed large parts of the city, whilst on the other hand the volcanic ashes yield fertile soil, especially suited for the growth of vines. (Strab. vi. p. 269)\nTwo subterranean rivers run under the city; the Amenano, which surfaces at one single point south of Piazza Duomo, and the Longane (or Lognina).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Csa\" (Mediterranean Climate). It has hot summers, one of the hottest in the whole country of Italy (a feature characterising nearly every month). Temperatures of 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are surpassed almost every year a couple of times,Winters are mild with chilly nights (not rare peaks around 20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F) . Most of precipitation is concentrated from October to March, leaving late spring and summer virtually dry (some years there is no rain for 3\u20134 months). The city receives around 500 millimetres (20 inches) of rain per year, although the amount can vary greatly from year to year (wettest over 1,200 millimetres or 47 inches, driest under 250 millimetres or 9.8 inches,).\nDuring winter nights lows can occasionally go under 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Highs under 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) can happen during winter. Snow, due to the presence of Etna that protects the city from the northern winds, is an uncommon occurrence, but occasional snow flurries have been seen over the recent years especially in the hilly districts, more substantial in the northern hinterland. More recently, light snowfalls occurred on 9 February 2015, 6 January 2017 and 5 January 2019, but the last heavy snowfall dates back to 17 December 1988.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn January 2015, there were 315,601 people residing in Catania, of whom 47.2% were male and 52.8% were female. Minors (people under age 18) totalled 20.50 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 18.87 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners).\nThe average age of Catania residents is 41 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Catania declined by 3.35 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85 percent. The reason for this population decline in the comune di Catania is mainly due to a large segment of the population leaving the city centre to go to live in the uptown residential areas of the comuni of the Metropolitan area. As a result of this, while the population in the comune di Catania declines, the population of the hinterland comuni increases making the overall population of the Metropolitan area increase.The current birth rate of Catania is 10.07 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births. As of 2006, 98.03% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant groups come from Sub-Saharan Africa: 0.69%, South Asia: 0.46%, and from other European countries (particularly from Ukraine and Poland): 0.33%.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nAround 729 BC, the ancient village of Katane was occupied by Chalcidian Greek settlers from nearby Naxos along the coast. It became the Chalcidian colony of Kat\u00e1n\u0113 under a leader named Euarchos (Euarchus) and the native population was rapidly Hellenised.\nThucydides states that it came into existence slightly later than Leontini (modern Lentini), which he claims was five years after Syracuse, or 730 BC.The settlement's acropolis was on the hill of Monte Vergine, a defensible hill immediately west of the current city centre. The port of Catania appears to have been much frequented in ancient time and was the chief place of export for the corn of the rich neighbouring plains.\n\n\n=== Greek Catania ===\nIn ancient times Catania was associated with the legend of Amphinomos and Anapias, who, on occasion of a great eruption of Etna, abandoned all their property and carried off their aged parents on their shoulders. The stream of lava itself was said to have parted, and flowed aside so as not to harm them. Statues were erected to their honour, and the place of their burial was known as the Campus Piorum; the Catanaeans even introduced the figures of the youths on their coins, and the legend became a favorite subject of allusion and declamation among the Latin poets, of whom the younger Lucilius and Claudian have dwelt upon it at considerable length.Catania was the birthplace of the philosopher and legislator Charondas (late 6th c. BC) who introduced his celebrated laws there. His legislation was extended to the other Chalcidic cities, not only of Sicily, but of Magna Graecia also, as well as to his own country. It is evident that Catania had close relations with these other cities during this time.\nIt was residence of the poets Ibycus and Stesichorus (c. 630\u2013555 BC), who was buried in a magnificent sepulchre outside one of the gates, hence its name of Porta Stesichoreia. Xenophanes (c. 570-475 BC), one of the founders of the Eleatic school of philosophy, also spent the latter years of his life in the city so that it was evidently, at an early period, a place of cultivation and refinement.\nCatania appears to have retained its independence up to the reign of the despot Hieron of Syracuse, whereupon in 476 BC he expelled all the original inhabitants of Catania and replaced them with those he ruled over at Leontini \u2013 said to have numbered no less than 10,000, consisting partly of Syracusans and Peloponnesians. At the same time he changed the city's name to \u0391\u1f34\u03c4\u03bd\u03b7 (A\u00edtn\u0113, Aetna or \u00c6tna, after the nearby Mount Etna, and proclaimed himself the Oekist or founder of the new city. For this he was celebrated by Pindar, and after his death he received heroic honours from the citizens of his new colony.A few years after the death of Hieron and the expulsion of Thrasybulus, the Syracusans combined with Ducetius, king of the Sicels, to expel the newly settled inhabitants of Catania, who went on to settle in the fortress of Inessa (to which they gave the name Aetna). The old Chalcidic citizens were reinstated to the city in 461 BC.The period that followed appears to have been one of great prosperity for Catania, as well as for the Sicilian cities in general.\nIn the Peloponnesian War during the great Athenian expedition to Sicily  in 415 BC, the Catanaeans at first refused to allow the Athenians into their city, but after the latter had forced an entrance, they found themselves compelled to honour the alliance of their invaders after a famous speech that Alcibiades would have made in front of the assembly. Catania became the headquarters of the Athenian army throughout the first year of the expedition, and the base of their subsequent operations against Syracuse. After the defeat of the Athenians it was open to attack by Syracuse but was saved by the Carthaginian invasion of Sicily in 409 BC.\nBut in 403 BC it fell into the power of Dionysius I of Syracuse, who plundered the city and sold its citizens as slaves, after which he populated it with Campanian mercenaries. These, however, quit in 396 BC and retired to Aetna, on the approach of the great Carthaginian armament under Himilco and Mago. After the great naval Battle of Catana (397 BC) which was fought off Catania and in which the latter defeated Leptines of Syracuse, the city fell into the hands of the Carthaginians.Calippus, the assassin of Dion of Syracuse, held Catania for a time (Plut. Dion. 58); and when Timoleon landed in Sicily in 344 BC Catania was subject to the despot Mamercus who at first joined the Corinthian leader, but afterwards abandoned this allegiance for that of the Carthaginians. As a consequence he was attacked and expelled by Timoleon in 338 BC.Catania was now restored to liberty, and appears to have continued to retain its independence; during the wars of Agathocles of Syracuse from 311 BC with the Carthaginians, it sided at one time with the former, at others with the latter; and when Pyrrhus landed in Sicily in 278 BC, Catania was the first to open its gates to him, and received him with the great splendour.The first introduction of dancing to accompany the flute was also ascribed to Andron, a citizen of Catania.\n\n\n=== Roman rule ===\nIn the First Punic War Catania was one of the first cities of Sicily to submit to the Roman Republic after their first successes in 263 BC when it was taken by Valerius Messalla. A sundial was part of the booty which was placed in the Comitium in Rome. Since then the city became a civitas decumana i.e. was subject to the payment of a tenth of its agricultural income as a tax to Rome. The conqueror of Syracuse, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, built a gymnasium here.It appears to have continued afterwards to maintain its friendly relations with Rome and though it did not enjoy the advantages of a confederate city (foederata civitas), like its neighbours Tauromenium (modern Taormina) and Messana (modern Messina), it rose to a position of great prosperity under the Roman rule.\nAround 135 BC during the First Servile War, it was conquered by rebel slaves.One of the most serious eruptions of Mount Etna happened in 121 BC, when a great part of Catania was overwhelmed by streams of lava, and the hot ashes fell in such quantities in the city itself, as to break in the roofs of the houses. Catana was in consequence exempted, for 10 years, from its usual contributions to the Roman state. The greater part of the broad tract of plain to the southwest of Catana (now called the Piana di Catania, a district of great fertility), appears to have belonged, in ancient times, to Leontini or Centuripa (modern Centuripe), but that portion of it between Catana itself and the mouth of the Symaethus was annexed to Catana and must have furnished abundant supplies of grain.\nCicero repeatedly mentions it as, in his time, a wealthy and flourishing city; it retained its ancient municipal institutions, its chief magistrate bearing the title of Proagorus; and appears to have been one of the principal ports of Sicily for the export of corn.In the Sicilian revolt from 44 BC Sextus Pompeius selected Sicily as his base and Catania gave in to Sextus' revolt and joined his forces. Sextus amassed a formidable army and a large fleet of warships at his base at Messana, with many slaves joining from the villas of patricians. After the victory of Augustus in 36 BC much of the vast farmland in Sicily was either ruined or left empty, and much of this land was taken and distributed to members of the legions which had fought there. Catania suffered severely from the ravages but was afterwards one of the cities raised to the status of colony by Augustus which restored its prosperity through the settlement of veterans, so that in Strabo's time it was one of the few cities in the island that was flourishing.Another revolt led by the gladiator Selurus in 35 BC created mayhem for a while.The Roman aqueduct of Catania was the largest in Roman Sicily at 24 km length starting from the springs of Santa Maria di Licodia.\nIt retained its colonial rank, as well as its prosperity, throughout the period of the Roman Empire; so that in the 4th century Ausonius in his Ordo Nobilium Urbium, notices Catania and Syracuse alone among the cities of Sicily.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nCatania was sacked by the Vandals of Gaiseric in 440\u2013441. After a period under the Ostrogoths, it was reconquered in 535 by the Eastern Roman Empire, under which (aside from a short period in 550\u2013555) it remained until the 9th century. It was the seat of the Byzantine governor of the island.\nCatania was under the Islamic emirate of Sicily until 1072, when it fell to the Normans of Roger I of Sicily. Subsequently, the city was ruled by a bishop-count. In 1194\u20131197 the city was sacked by German soldiers during after the conquest of the island by emperor Henry VI. In 1232 it rebelled to the former's son, Frederick II, who later built a massive castle, Castello Ursino and also made Catania a royal city, ending the dominance of the bishops. Catania was one of the main centers of the Sicilian Vespers revolt (1282) against the House of Anjou, and was the seat of the incoronation of the new Aragonese king of Sicily, Peter I. In the 14th century it gained importance as it was chosen by the Aragonese as a Parliament and Royal seat. Here, in 1347, it was signed the treaty of peace that ended the long War of the Vesper between Aragonese and Angevines. Catania lost its capital role when, in the early 15th century, Sicily was turned into a member of the Crown of Aragon, and kept its autonomy and original privileges specially during the period from 1282 to 1410.\nIn 1434 King Alfonso V founded here the Siciliae Studium Generale, the oldest university in the island.\n\n\n=== Early Modern times ===\n\nWith the unification of Castile and Aragon (early 16th century), Sicily became part of the Spanish Empire. It rebelled against the foreign government in 1516 and 1647.In 1669 the city's surroundings suffered great material damage from the 1669 Etna eruption. The city itself was largely saved by its walls that diverted most of the lava into the port. Afterwards in 1693 the city was then completely destroyed by a heavy earthquake and its aftershocks. The city was then rebuilt in the Baroque architecture that nowadays characterizes it.\n\n\n=== Unified Italy ===\nCatania was one of the vanguards of the movement for the Sicilian autonomy in the early 19th century.\nIn 1860 Giuseppe Garibaldi's expedition of the Thousand conquered Sicily for Piedmont from the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Since the following year Catania was part of the newly unified Italy, whose history it shares since then.\n During World War II, Catania was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces, owing to the presence of two of the main Axis airfields in Sicily (Gerbini and Fontanarossa) and for its strategically important port and marshalling yard. Altogether, the city suffered eighty-seven air raids. The heaviest raids took place in the spring and summer of 1943, before and during the Allied invasion of Sicily; they caused heavy damage to che city (among others, twenty-eight churches and most historic palaces suffered damage), killed 750 inhabitants and prompted most of the population to flee to the countryside. After heavy fighting across eastern Sicily, Catania was eventually captured by the British 8th Army on 5 August 1943.After the conflict, and the constitution of the Italian Republic (1946), Catania attempted to catch up with the economic and social development of Italy's richer northern regions. The problems faced in Catania were emblematic of those faced by other towns in the Mezzogiorno, namely a heavy gap in industrial development and infrastructures, and the threat of the mafia. This notwithstanding, during the 1960s (and partly during the 1990s) Catania enjoyed development and a period of economic, social and cultural success. In the first decade of the 21st century, Catania's economic and social development somewhat faltered and the city is again facing economic and social stagnation. This was aggravated by the economical crisis left by the Forza Italia administration of mayor Scapagnini in 2008.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Metropolitan City ===\n\nThe Metropolitan City of Catania was established in 2015 and replaced the former Province of Catania. It includes the city proper and 57 comuni (municipalities). The population of the Metropolitan City is 1,107,702.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Metropolitan area of Catania includes the comune of Catania (311,584 inhabitants) and 26 surrounding comuni forming an urban belt (498,650 inhabitants). The total population of the Metropolitan area of Catania is therefore 810,234. The comuni of the Metropolitan area are:\n\nThese comuni form a system with the centre of Catania sharing its economical and social life and creating an organic urban texture.\n\n\n=== City proper ===\nThe city of Catania proper (comune di Catania) is divided in six administrative areas called circoscrizioni. The current administrative setup was established in 2013, modifying previous setups dating back to 1971, 1978 and 1995.\nThe six areas are:\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe symbol of the city is u Liotru, or the Fontana dell'Elefante, assembled in 1736 by Giovanni Battista Vaccarini. It portrays an ancient lavic stone elephant and is topped by an Egyptian obelisk from Syene. Legend has it that Vaccarini's original elephant was neuter, which the men of Catania took as an insult to their virility. To appease them, Vaccarini appropriately appended elephantine testicles to the original statue.\nThe Sicilian name u Liotru is a phonetic change of Heliodorus, a nobleman who, after trying without success to become bishop of the city, became a sorcerer and was therefore condemned to the stake. Legend has it that Heliodorus himself was the sculptor of the lava elephant and that he used to magically ride it in his fantastic travels from Catania to Constantinople. Another legend has it that Heliodorus was able to transform himself into an elephant.\nThe presence of an elephant in the millenary history of Catania is surely connected to both zooarcheology and popular creeds. In fact, the prehistoric fauna of Sicily from the Upper Paleolithic, included dwarf elephants. Paleontologist Othenio Abel suggested that the presence of dwarf elephants in Sicily may be the origin of the legend of the Cyclops. Ancient Greeks, after finding the skulls of dwarf elephants, about twice the size of a human skull, with a large central nasal cavity (mistaken for a large single eye-socket) supposed that they were skulls of giants with a single eye.\nThe Catanian Museum of Mineralogy, Paleontology and Vulcanology holds the integral unburied skeleton of an Elephas falconeri in an excellent state of conservation. The first inhabitants of Etna  molded such lavic artifact to idolize the mythical proboscidian.\n\n\n=== Classical buildings ===\nThe city has been buried by lava a total of seventeen times in recorded history, and in layers under the present day city are the Roman city that preceded it, and the Greek city before that. Many of the ancient monuments of the Roman city have been destroyed by the numerous seisms. Currently, different ancient remains can be seen and visited in the city-centre, as part of an archaeological park (Parco Archeologico Greco-Romano di Catania).\n\nAncient edifices include:\n\nGreek-Roman Theatre of Catania (2nd century)\nOdeon (3rd century).

In its close vicinities there is a cylindric tower, known as Saint Mary's Tower (Torre Santa Maria), which was restructured in the 16th century to prevent the frequent plunders of the Saracen pirates. The church is the result of the gradual modification of the Greek Temple Athena Longatis or Parthenos Longatis that existed on the steep reef. This cult was imported from a Boeotian region of Greece called Longas from where the first Hellenic settlers of this borough probably came.

The city is famous for its mainly petrochemical industry, and the extraction of sulphur. In the year 2000, according to Census, Catania was the 14th richest city in Italy, with a GDP of US$6.6 billion (\u20ac6.304 billion), which was 0.54% of the Italian GDP, a GDP per capita of US$21,000 (\u20ac20,100) and an average GDP per employee of US$69,000 (\u20ac66,100).In the late-19th century and early-20th century, Catania began to be heavily industrialised, with its several factories and chimneys, often to the extant that it was referred to as Southern Italy's \"Manchester\". The economy of Catania suffered heavily from the bad effects of World War I, and was marked by an economic crisis and recession that culminated in the 1920s. Since then, the city lost its industrial and entrepreneurial importance. In the 1930s, Catania remained a small fishing town with derelict and disused industries. However, after the destruction of World War II, Catania's economy began to re-grow in the late-1950s and early-1960s. As a matter of fact, the city's economic growth was so rapid and dynamic that it was often nicknamed the \"Milan of the South\", or in Italian \"Milano del Sud\". This rapid economic growth prompted a great number of Sicilians living in the more rural areas, or smaller towns such as Enna, Ragusa and Caltanissetta, to move to the city to seek new jobs.\nToday, Catania, despite several problems, has one of the most dynamic economies in the whole of Southern Italy. It still has a strong industrial and agricultural sector, and a fast-growing tourist industry, with many international visitors coming to visit the city's main sights and the nearby Etna volcano. It contains the headquarters or important offices of companies such as STMicroelectronics, and also several chemical and pharmaceutical businesses. There have been several new business developments to further boost Catania's economy, including the construction of Etnapolis, a big shopping mall designed by Massimiliano Fuksas, the same architect who designed the FieraMilano industrial fair in Milan, or the Etna Valley, where several high-tech offices are located.\nTourism is a fast-growing industry in Catania. Lately the administration and private companies have made several investments in the hospitality industry in order to make tourism a competitive sector in the Metropolitan City. Etnaland, a big amusement and water park located in Belpasso, in the Metropolitan area of Catania, 12 kilometers (7 miles) from the city center, is the largest in Southern Italy and attracts thousands of tourists, not only from Sicily, but also from the rest of Italy: according to Tripadvisor (2018) it is the third water park in Europe.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Catania dates back to 1434 and it is the oldest university in Sicily. Its academic nicknames are: Siculorum Gymnasium and Siciliae Studium Generale. Nowadays it hosts 12 faculties and over 62,000 students, and it offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.\nCatania hosts the Scuola Superiore, an academic institution linked to the University of Catania, aimed at the excellence in education. The Scuola Superiore di Catania also offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.Apart from the University and the Scuola Superiore Catania is base of the prestigious Istituto Musicale Vincenzo Bellini an advanced institute of musical studies (Conservatory) and the Accademia di Belle Arti an advanced institute of artistic studies. Both institutions offer programs of university level for musical and artistic education.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe opera composer Vincenzo Bellini was born in Catania, and a museum exists at his birthplace.\nThe Teatro Massimo \"Vincenzo Bellini\", which opened in 1890, is named after the composer. The opera house presents a variety of operas through a season, which run from December to May, many of which are the work of Bellini.\nGiovanni Verga was born in Catania in 1840. He became the greatest writer of Verismo, an Italian literary movement akin to Naturalism. His novels portray life among the lower levels of Sicilian society, such as fishermen and stonemasons, and were written in a mixture of both literary language and local dialect. Francesco Longo Mancini was a painter known for paintings of nudes who was born in Catania in 1880.\n\nThe city's patron saint is Saint Agatha, who is celebrated with a religious pageantry, the Festival of Saint Agatha, on February 5 every year.\nThe city is base of the newspaper La Sicilia and of the TV-channel Antenna Sicilia also known as Sicilia Channel. Several others local television channels and free-press magazines have their headquarters in Catania.\nThe city is home to the Catania Jazz Festival, which typically runs for several winter months with concerts in different locations.\nIn the late 1980s and during the 1990s Catania had a sparkling and unique popular music scene. Indie pop and indie rock bands, local radio station and dynamic independent music record labels sprung. As a result, in those years the city experienced a vital and effervescent cultural period. Artists like Carmen Consoli and Mario Venuti and internationally known indie rock bands like Uzeda came out of this cultural milieu.\nThe city is the home of Amatori Catania rugby union team, Calcio Catania football team and Orizzonte Catania, the latter being a women's water polo club, winning eight European Champions Cup titles from 1994 to 2008. Noted Italian basketball coach Ettore Messina is a native of Catania. The city also hosted the first ever qualification tournament for the Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1992, and the associated Etna Cup, which was won by the host Sicily team. In addition, the Catania Elephants are currently members of the Italian Football League. Catania also hosted the 2011 FIE Fencing World Championships.\n\n\n== Food and cuisine ==\n\nFood is an important part of Catania's culture and way of life. Local cuisine emphasizes several traits of Sicilian one, whilst developing some of its own.\nStreet food is one of the best ways to experience traditional dishes. Arancini are perhaps the city's most iconic one: they are stuffed rice balls coated in bread-crumbs and deep fried; in Catania, they are shaped like a cone to remind of Mount Etna. Typical specialties from the city include cipollina (puff pastry with onion, tomato and prosciutto filling), bolognese (a small pizza topped with tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto and boiled egg and covered in puff pastry), crispelle (deep fried dough balls with ricotta or anchovies filling.)\nDuring street-fairs and religious festivals, street stalls sell calia e simenza (toasted chickpeas and pumpkin seeds). Typical from old street markets are sangeli (cooked pork blood), quarumi (pork tripe), zuzzu (pork jelly), mauru (edible seaweed), and raw seafood. Horse meat is very traditional and it is sold in shops called arrusti e mancia (\"roast it and eat it\"), which roast the meat in streetside barbecues.Apart from street food, typical dishes from Catania are: pasta alla Norma (pasta with fried eggplant, tomato sauce and ricotta salata cheese), named after the namesake opera by Vincenzo Bellini; pasta cco niuru (pasta in cuttlefish ink), maccu (fava beans pur\u00e9e), bastaddi affucati or brocculi affucati (stewed cauliflower or broccoli), caponata (saut\u00e9ed vegetables) and scacciata (a pie filled with tuma cheese) which is traditional during Christmastime.Catania is also famous for its pasticceria (pastries and cakes). Pastries vary according to season and to seasonal events: during the Festival of Saint Agatha, patron saint of the city, there are the cassatelle (small cassatas) and olivette (olive shaped almond paste). In Easter, there are aceddi ccu l\u2019ovu (boiled eggs covered in biscuit). In summer there is granita. During the Festa dei morti (traditional celebrations in All Souls' Day) there are biscuits called ossa di mortu, rame di Napoli and nsuddi.\nDrink kiosks are everywhere in town and serve soft drinks. Traditional soft drinks are made mixing fruit syrups with soda and other flavors such as anisette. They are thirst-killer and they are very popular with the locals and the tourists.\nLocal products include blood oranges, pistachios from Bronte, extra-virgin olive oil, cactus fruit, cherries, grapes from Mazzarrone, strawberries from Maletto, mushrooms, honey and wine.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nCatania has a commercial seaport (Catania seaport), an international airport (Catania Fontanarossa), a central railway station (Catania Centrale) and it is a main node of the Sicilian motorway system.\nThe motorways serving Catania are the A18 Messina-Catania and the A19 Palermo-Catania; extensions of the A18 going from Catania to Syracuse and to Gela are currently under construction.\nThe Circumetnea is a narrow-gauge railway that runs for 110 km (68 mi) from Catania round the base of Mount Etna. It attains the height of 976 m (3,202.10 ft) above sea level before descending to rejoin the coast at Giarre-Riposto to the North.\nIn the late 1990s the first line of an underground railway (Metropolitana di Catania) was built. The underground service started in 1999 and it is currently active on a route of 8.8 km (5.5 mi), from the station Nesima (West of town), passing through the stations of San Nullo, Cibali (still under construction), Milo, Borgo, Giuffrida, Italia, Galatea, Giovanni XXIII, to Stesicoro. These two stations, bringing Catania Underground in the city centre, have opened on 20 December 2016. First line is planned to extend from the satellite city of Patern\u00f2 to Fontanarossa Airport.\n\n\n=== Catania Public Transportation Statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Catania, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 56 min. 13% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 23 min, while 46% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.7 km, while 3% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nAaron ben Gershon abu al-Rabi, 15th century rabbi\nOriana Bandiera (1971\u2013), economist and academic\nPippo Baudo (1936-), TV presenter\nFranco Battiato (1945-), singer-songwriter, composer, filmmaker\nGianni Bella (1947-), singer-songwriter\nMarcella Bella (1952-), singer\nVincenzo Bellini (1801\u20131835), composer\nOrnella Bertorotta (1967-) politician\nGiuseppa Bolognara Calcagno (1826\u20131884), freedom fighter of the Risorgimento\nVitaliano Brancati (1907\u20131954), writer\nLuigi Capuana (1839\u20131915), writer\nCharondas (6th c.

In 1823, Light had fondly written of Catania: \"The two principal streets cross each other at right angles in the square in the direction of north and south and east and west. They are wide and spacious and about a mile [1.6 km] long\". This became the basis for his plan of Adelaide.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAmico, Vito Maria (1740).

        "wiki": "The University of Catania (Italian: Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Catania) is a university located in Catania, Sicily. Founded in 1434, it is the oldest university in Sicily, the 13th oldest in Italy, and the 29th oldest university in the world. With a population of over 60,000 students, it is the main university in Sicily.\n\n\n== Departments ==\nFollowing the Italian higher education reform introduced by the law 240/10 and adopted by the University of Catania in its new Statute, faculties have been deactivated and departments have been reorganized.\nThe University of Catania has now 17 departments, the Faculty of Medicine, and two special didactic units established in the decentralized offices of Ragusa (Modern Languages) and Syracuse (Architecture). that, additionally to the traditional assignments of scientific research, are in charge of the organization and management of educational activities. A special didactic unit is also the school of excellence \"Scuola Superiore di Catania\", a higher education centre of the University of Catania conceived in 1998 to select the best young minds and offer them a course of studies including analysis, research and experimentation.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe university was founded by King Alfonso V of Aragon (who was also King Alfonso I of Sicily) on 19 October 1434. A charter was granted after two royal councillors (Adamo Asmundo and Battista Platamone) convinced the king to accept the founding of a \"Studium Generale\" in Catania, with the papal recognition arriving ten years later from Pope Eugene IV (18 April 1444). Alfonso V with this gesture wanted to compensate the city (in which there had been recently established the Royal Court) for moving the Sicilian capital from Catania to Palermo. The activity of the Atheneum actually started a year later, in 1445, with 6 professors and 10 students. The first four faculties were Medicine, Philosophy, Canon and Civil Law and Theology. Lessons were initially held in a building in Piazza del Duomo, next to the Cathedral of St. Agatha, and eventually moved to the Palazzo dell'Universit\u00e0 in the late 1690s. This building remains the seat of the university to this day. The first degree was awarded to Antonio Mantello, from Syracuse, in 1449. During the course of the 16th century, approximately 20-25 degrees were awarded each year. The University (which from the 16th century was referred to as \"Siculorum Gymnasium\") was named \"Studium Generale\" because it was the only entity that could release degrees equal to those released in the old Studia of Salamanca, Valladolid, Bologna and this contributed to spread envy in the other Sicilian cities that in culture and traditions didn't feel inferior to Catania. In 1934, the university celebrated its 500th anniversary with King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy, and, in 1984 the 550th one.\nIn the early centuries of its existence, the university was administered by the comune (municipality) of Catania, overseen by the bishop of Catania and protected by the royal power. But with a reform operated by the viceroy in 1679 the authority of the bishop (who was \"Gran Cancelliere\" = \"Great Chancellor\") prevailed: he had the control over the lecturers, the freshmen and students' curriculum. This led to various conflicts between the civil and religious authorities. From 1818 the office of Gran Cancelliere was assigned to the President of the Great Civil Court, instead of the bishop.\n\n\n== List of university scholars historic and famous ==\n\n\n=== Humanities ===\nGiuseppe De Felice Giuffrida, important Italian politician and journalist, was elected the first Socialist mayor of Catania in 1902.\nMario Rapisardi, noted Italian poet and translator, taught at the University in the 1870s. \"Love truth more than glory, more than peace, more than life.

        "wiki": "Catania (UK: , US: , Sicilian and Italian: [ka\u02c8ta\u02d0nja] (listen)) is the second largest city in Sicily, after Palermo, and among the ten largest cities in Italy. Located on Sicily\u2019s east coast, it faces the Ionian Sea. It is the capital of the 58-municipality region known as the Metropolitan City of Catania, which is the seventh-largest metropolitan city in Italy. The population of the city proper is 311,584, while the population of the Metropolitan City of Catania is 1,107,702.Catania was founded in the 8th century BC by Chalcidians Greeks. The city was almost completely destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake in 1169.However, by the 14th century, and into the Renaissance period, Catania was one of Italy's most important cultural, artistic and political centres. It was the site of Sicily\u2019s first university, founded in 1434. It has been the native or adopted home of some of Italy's most famous artists and writers, including the composers Vincenzo Bellini and Giovanni Pacini, and the writers Giovanni Verga, Luigi Capuana, Federico De Roberto and Nino Martoglio.\nThe city has been devastated several times by volcanic eruptions from nearby Mount Etna, the most violent of which was in 1669. And it suffered through another severely damaging earthquake in 1693.Catania today is the industrial, logistical, and commercial center of Sicily. Its airport, the Catania-Fontanarossa Airport, is the largest in Southern Italy. \nHowever, it is also noted for its history, culture, architecture, and gastronomy. The section of the city known as the \u201cold town\u201d features some of the most striking examples of baroque architecture in Italy, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe ancient indigenous population of the Sicels named their villages after geographical attributes of their location. The Sicilian word, katane, means \"grater, flaying knife, skinning place\" or a \"crude tool apt to pare\". Other translations of the name are \"harsh lands\", \"uneven ground\", \"sharp stones\", or \"rugged or rough soil\". The latter etymologies are easily justifiable since, for many centuries following an eruption, the city has always been rebuilt within its black-lava landscape.Around 263 BC, the city was variously known as Cat\u012dna (Latin: [\u02c8kat\u026ana]) and Cat\u0103na (Latin: [\u02c8katana]; Ancient Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 [kat\u00e1n\u025b\u02d0]). The former has been primarily used for its supposed assonance with catina, the Latin feminization of the name catinus. Catinus has two meanings: \"a gulf, a basin or a bay\" and \"a bowl, a vessel or a trough\",  thanks to the city's distinctive topography.\nAround 900, when Catania was part of the emirate of Sicily, it was known in Arabic as Balad al-f\u012bl (\u0628\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644) and Mad\u012bnat al-f\u012bl (\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644), respectively meaning \"the Village (or Country) of the Elephant\" and \"the City of the Elephant\". The Elephant is the lava sculpture over the fountain in Piazza Duomo: most likely a prehistoric sculpture that was reforged during the Byzantine Era, it appears to be a talisman that was reputedly powerful enough to protect the city from enemies and to keep away misfortune, plagues, or natural calamities. Another Arab toponym was Qa\u1e6d\u0101niyyah (\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629), allegedly from the Arabic word for the \"leguminous plants\". Pulses like lentils, beans, peas, broad beans, and lupins were chiefly cultivated in the plains around the city well before the arrival of Aghlabids. Afterwards, many Arabic agronomists  developed these crops and the citrus orchards in the area around the city.\nThe toponym W\u0101d\u012b M\u016bs\u00e1 (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0649), or \"the Valley of Moses\" (from the Arabic name of the Simeto River), was rarely used.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCatania is located on the east coast of the island of Sicily, at the foot of Mount Etna.\nAs observed by Strabo, the location of Catania at the foot of Mount Etna has been both a curse and a blessing. On the one hand, violent outbursts of the volcano throughout history have destroyed large parts of the city, whilst on the other hand the volcanic ashes yield fertile soil, especially suited for the growth of vines. (Strab. vi. p. 269)\nTwo subterranean rivers run under the city; the Amenano, which surfaces at one single point south of Piazza Duomo, and the Longane (or Lognina).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Csa\" (Mediterranean Climate). It has hot summers, one of the hottest in the whole country of Italy (a feature characterising nearly every month). Temperatures of 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are surpassed almost every year a couple of times,Winters are mild with chilly nights (not rare peaks around 20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F) . Most of precipitation is concentrated from October to March, leaving late spring and summer virtually dry (some years there is no rain for 3\u20134 months). The city receives around 500 millimetres (20 inches) of rain per year, although the amount can vary greatly from year to year (wettest over 1,200 millimetres or 47 inches, driest under 250 millimetres or 9.8 inches,).\nDuring winter nights lows can occasionally go under 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Highs under 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) can happen during winter. Snow, due to the presence of Etna that protects the city from the northern winds, is an uncommon occurrence, but occasional snow flurries have been seen over the recent years especially in the hilly districts, more substantial in the northern hinterland. More recently, light snowfalls occurred on 9 February 2015, 6 January 2017 and 5 January 2019, but the last heavy snowfall dates back to 17 December 1988.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn January 2015, there were 315,601 people residing in Catania, of whom 47.2% were male and 52.8% were female. Minors (people under age 18) totalled 20.50 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 18.87 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners).\nThe average age of Catania residents is 41 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Catania declined by 3.35 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85 percent. The reason for this population decline in the comune di Catania is mainly due to a large segment of the population leaving the city centre to go to live in the uptown residential areas of the comuni of the Metropolitan area. As a result of this, while the population in the comune di Catania declines, the population of the hinterland comuni increases making the overall population of the Metropolitan area increase.The current birth rate of Catania is 10.07 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births. As of 2006, 98.03% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant groups come from Sub-Saharan Africa: 0.69%, South Asia: 0.46%, and from other European countries (particularly from Ukraine and Poland): 0.33%.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nAround 729 BC, the ancient village of Katane was occupied by Chalcidian Greek settlers from nearby Naxos along the coast. It became the Chalcidian colony of Kat\u00e1n\u0113 under a leader named Euarchos (Euarchus) and the native population was rapidly Hellenised.\nThucydides states that it came into existence slightly later than Leontini (modern Lentini), which he claims was five years after Syracuse, or 730 BC.The settlement's acropolis was on the hill of Monte Vergine, a defensible hill immediately west of the current city centre. The port of Catania appears to have been much frequented in ancient time and was the chief place of export for the corn of the rich neighbouring plains.\n\n\n=== Greek Catania ===\nIn ancient times Catania was associated with the legend of Amphinomos and Anapias, who, on occasion of a great eruption of Etna, abandoned all their property and carried off their aged parents on their shoulders. The stream of lava itself was said to have parted, and flowed aside so as not to harm them. Statues were erected to their honour, and the place of their burial was known as the Campus Piorum; the Catanaeans even introduced the figures of the youths on their coins, and the legend became a favorite subject of allusion and declamation among the Latin poets, of whom the younger Lucilius and Claudian have dwelt upon it at considerable length.Catania was the birthplace of the philosopher and legislator Charondas (late 6th c. BC) who introduced his celebrated laws there. His legislation was extended to the other Chalcidic cities, not only of Sicily, but of Magna Graecia also, as well as to his own country. It is evident that Catania had close relations with these other cities during this time.\nIt was residence of the poets Ibycus and Stesichorus (c. 630\u2013555 BC), who was buried in a magnificent sepulchre outside one of the gates, hence its name of Porta Stesichoreia. Xenophanes (c. 570-475 BC), one of the founders of the Eleatic school of philosophy, also spent the latter years of his life in the city so that it was evidently, at an early period, a place of cultivation and refinement.\nCatania appears to have retained its independence up to the reign of the despot Hieron of Syracuse, whereupon in 476 BC he expelled all the original inhabitants of Catania and replaced them with those he ruled over at Leontini \u2013 said to have numbered no less than 10,000, consisting partly of Syracusans and Peloponnesians. At the same time he changed the city's name to \u0391\u1f34\u03c4\u03bd\u03b7 (A\u00edtn\u0113, Aetna or \u00c6tna, after the nearby Mount Etna, and proclaimed himself the Oekist or founder of the new city. For this he was celebrated by Pindar, and after his death he received heroic honours from the citizens of his new colony.A few years after the death of Hieron and the expulsion of Thrasybulus, the Syracusans combined with Ducetius, king of the Sicels, to expel the newly settled inhabitants of Catania, who went on to settle in the fortress of Inessa (to which they gave the name Aetna). The old Chalcidic citizens were reinstated to the city in 461 BC.The period that followed appears to have been one of great prosperity for Catania, as well as for the Sicilian cities in general.\nIn the Peloponnesian War during the great Athenian expedition to Sicily  in 415 BC, the Catanaeans at first refused to allow the Athenians into their city, but after the latter had forced an entrance, they found themselves compelled to honour the alliance of their invaders after a famous speech that Alcibiades would have made in front of the assembly. Catania became the headquarters of the Athenian army throughout the first year of the expedition, and the base of their subsequent operations against Syracuse. After the defeat of the Athenians it was open to attack by Syracuse but was saved by the Carthaginian invasion of Sicily in 409 BC.\nBut in 403 BC it fell into the power of Dionysius I of Syracuse, who plundered the city and sold its citizens as slaves, after which he populated it with Campanian mercenaries. These, however, quit in 396 BC and retired to Aetna, on the approach of the great Carthaginian armament under Himilco and Mago. After the great naval Battle of Catana (397 BC) which was fought off Catania and in which the latter defeated Leptines of Syracuse, the city fell into the hands of the Carthaginians.Calippus, the assassin of Dion of Syracuse, held Catania for a time (Plut. Dion. 58); and when Timoleon landed in Sicily in 344 BC Catania was subject to the despot Mamercus who at first joined the Corinthian leader, but afterwards abandoned this allegiance for that of the Carthaginians. As a consequence he was attacked and expelled by Timoleon in 338 BC.Catania was now restored to liberty, and appears to have continued to retain its independence; during the wars of Agathocles of Syracuse from 311 BC with the Carthaginians, it sided at one time with the former, at others with the latter; and when Pyrrhus landed in Sicily in 278 BC, Catania was the first to open its gates to him, and received him with the great splendour.The first introduction of dancing to accompany the flute was also ascribed to Andron, a citizen of Catania.\n\n\n=== Roman rule ===\nIn the First Punic War Catania was one of the first cities of Sicily to submit to the Roman Republic after their first successes in 263 BC when it was taken by Valerius Messalla. A sundial was part of the booty which was placed in the Comitium in Rome. Since then the city became a civitas decumana i.e. was subject to the payment of a tenth of its agricultural income as a tax to Rome. The conqueror of Syracuse, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, built a gymnasium here.It appears to have continued afterwards to maintain its friendly relations with Rome and though it did not enjoy the advantages of a confederate city (foederata civitas), like its neighbours Tauromenium (modern Taormina) and Messana (modern Messina), it rose to a position of great prosperity under the Roman rule.\nAround 135 BC during the First Servile War, it was conquered by rebel slaves.One of the most serious eruptions of Mount Etna happened in 121 BC, when a great part of Catania was overwhelmed by streams of lava, and the hot ashes fell in such quantities in the city itself, as to break in the roofs of the houses. Catana was in consequence exempted, for 10 years, from its usual contributions to the Roman state. The greater part of the broad tract of plain to the southwest of Catana (now called the Piana di Catania, a district of great fertility), appears to have belonged, in ancient times, to Leontini or Centuripa (modern Centuripe), but that portion of it between Catana itself and the mouth of the Symaethus was annexed to Catana and must have furnished abundant supplies of grain.\nCicero repeatedly mentions it as, in his time, a wealthy and flourishing city; it retained its ancient municipal institutions, its chief magistrate bearing the title of Proagorus; and appears to have been one of the principal ports of Sicily for the export of corn.In the Sicilian revolt from 44 BC Sextus Pompeius selected Sicily as his base and Catania gave in to Sextus' revolt and joined his forces. Sextus amassed a formidable army and a large fleet of warships at his base at Messana, with many slaves joining from the villas of patricians. After the victory of Augustus in 36 BC much of the vast farmland in Sicily was either ruined or left empty, and much of this land was taken and distributed to members of the legions which had fought there. Catania suffered severely from the ravages but was afterwards one of the cities raised to the status of colony by Augustus which restored its prosperity through the settlement of veterans, so that in Strabo's time it was one of the few cities in the island that was flourishing.Another revolt led by the gladiator Selurus in 35 BC created mayhem for a while.The Roman aqueduct of Catania was the largest in Roman Sicily at 24 km length starting from the springs of Santa Maria di Licodia.\nIt retained its colonial rank, as well as its prosperity, throughout the period of the Roman Empire; so that in the 4th century Ausonius in his Ordo Nobilium Urbium, notices Catania and Syracuse alone among the cities of Sicily.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nCatania was sacked by the Vandals of Gaiseric in 440\u2013441. After a period under the Ostrogoths, it was reconquered in 535 by the Eastern Roman Empire, under which (aside from a short period in 550\u2013555) it remained until the 9th century. It was the seat of the Byzantine governor of the island.\nCatania was under the Islamic emirate of Sicily until 1072, when it fell to the Normans of Roger I of Sicily. Subsequently, the city was ruled by a bishop-count. In 1194\u20131197 the city was sacked by German soldiers during after the conquest of the island by emperor Henry VI. In 1232 it rebelled to the former's son, Frederick II, who later built a massive castle, Castello Ursino and also made Catania a royal city, ending the dominance of the bishops. Catania was one of the main centers of the Sicilian Vespers revolt (1282) against the House of Anjou, and was the seat of the incoronation of the new Aragonese king of Sicily, Peter I. In the 14th century it gained importance as it was chosen by the Aragonese as a Parliament and Royal seat. Here, in 1347, it was signed the treaty of peace that ended the long War of the Vesper between Aragonese and Angevines. Catania lost its capital role when, in the early 15th century, Sicily was turned into a member of the Crown of Aragon, and kept its autonomy and original privileges specially during the period from 1282 to 1410.\nIn 1434 King Alfonso V founded here the Siciliae Studium Generale, the oldest university in the island.\n\n\n=== Early Modern times ===\n\nWith the unification of Castile and Aragon (early 16th century), Sicily became part of the Spanish Empire. It rebelled against the foreign government in 1516 and 1647.In 1669 the city's surroundings suffered great material damage from the 1669 Etna eruption. The city itself was largely saved by its walls that diverted most of the lava into the port. Afterwards in 1693 the city was then completely destroyed by a heavy earthquake and its aftershocks. The city was then rebuilt in the Baroque architecture that nowadays characterizes it.\n\n\n=== Unified Italy ===\nCatania was one of the vanguards of the movement for the Sicilian autonomy in the early 19th century.\nIn 1860 Giuseppe Garibaldi's expedition of the Thousand conquered Sicily for Piedmont from the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Since the following year Catania was part of the newly unified Italy, whose history it shares since then.\n During World War II, Catania was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces, owing to the presence of two of the main Axis airfields in Sicily (Gerbini and Fontanarossa) and for its strategically important port and marshalling yard. Altogether, the city suffered eighty-seven air raids. The heaviest raids took place in the spring and summer of 1943, before and during the Allied invasion of Sicily; they caused heavy damage to che city (among others, twenty-eight churches and most historic palaces suffered damage), killed 750 inhabitants and prompted most of the population to flee to the countryside. After heavy fighting across eastern Sicily, Catania was eventually captured by the British 8th Army on 5 August 1943.After the conflict, and the constitution of the Italian Republic (1946), Catania attempted to catch up with the economic and social development of Italy's richer northern regions. The problems faced in Catania were emblematic of those faced by other towns in the Mezzogiorno, namely a heavy gap in industrial development and infrastructures, and the threat of the mafia. This notwithstanding, during the 1960s (and partly during the 1990s) Catania enjoyed development and a period of economic, social and cultural success. In the first decade of the 21st century, Catania's economic and social development somewhat faltered and the city is again facing economic and social stagnation. This was aggravated by the economical crisis left by the Forza Italia administration of mayor Scapagnini in 2008.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Metropolitan City ===\n\nThe Metropolitan City of Catania was established in 2015 and replaced the former Province of Catania. It includes the city proper and 57 comuni (municipalities). The population of the Metropolitan City is 1,107,702.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Metropolitan area of Catania includes the comune of Catania (311,584 inhabitants) and 26 surrounding comuni forming an urban belt (498,650 inhabitants). The total population of the Metropolitan area of Catania is therefore 810,234. The comuni of the Metropolitan area are:\n\nThese comuni form a system with the centre of Catania sharing its economical and social life and creating an organic urban texture.\n\n\n=== City proper ===\nThe city of Catania proper (comune di Catania) is divided in six administrative areas called circoscrizioni. The current administrative setup was established in 2013, modifying previous setups dating back to 1971, 1978 and 1995.\nThe six areas are:\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe symbol of the city is u Liotru, or the Fontana dell'Elefante, assembled in 1736 by Giovanni Battista Vaccarini. It portrays an ancient lavic stone elephant and is topped by an Egyptian obelisk from Syene. Legend has it that Vaccarini's original elephant was neuter, which the men of Catania took as an insult to their virility. To appease them, Vaccarini appropriately appended elephantine testicles to the original statue.\nThe Sicilian name u Liotru is a phonetic change of Heliodorus, a nobleman who, after trying without success to become bishop of the city, became a sorcerer and was therefore condemned to the stake. Legend has it that Heliodorus himself was the sculptor of the lava elephant and that he used to magically ride it in his fantastic travels from Catania to Constantinople. Another legend has it that Heliodorus was able to transform himself into an elephant.\nThe presence of an elephant in the millenary history of Catania is surely connected to both zooarcheology and popular creeds. In fact, the prehistoric fauna of Sicily from the Upper Paleolithic, included dwarf elephants. Paleontologist Othenio Abel suggested that the presence of dwarf elephants in Sicily may be the origin of the legend of the Cyclops. Ancient Greeks, after finding the skulls of dwarf elephants, about twice the size of a human skull, with a large central nasal cavity (mistaken for a large single eye-socket) supposed that they were skulls of giants with a single eye.\nThe Catanian Museum of Mineralogy, Paleontology and Vulcanology holds the integral unburied skeleton of an Elephas falconeri in an excellent state of conservation. The first inhabitants of Etna  molded such lavic artifact to idolize the mythical proboscidian.\n\n\n=== Classical buildings ===\nThe city has been buried by lava a total of seventeen times in recorded history, and in layers under the present day city are the Roman city that preceded it, and the Greek city before that. Many of the ancient monuments of the Roman city have been destroyed by the numerous seisms. Currently, different ancient remains can be seen and visited in the city-centre, as part of an archaeological park (Parco Archeologico Greco-Romano di Catania).\n\nAncient edifices include:\n\nGreek-Roman Theatre of Catania (2nd century)\nOdeon (3rd century). It could house up to 1500 spectators\nAmphitheatre\nGreek Acropolis of Montevergine\nRoman Aqueduct\nRoman Forum\nRoman broken arcades\nChristian basilicas, hypogea, burial monuments and Catacombs\nRoman Colonnade\n\n\n=== Roman thermal structures ===\nAchillean Baths\nTerme dell\u2019Indirizzo\nTerme di Santa Maria Odigitria\nTerme della Rotonda\nBaths of the Four Quoins\nTerme di Palazzo Asmundo\nTerme del Palazzo dell\u2019Universit\u00e0\nTerme di Casa Gagliano\nTerme della Chiesa di Sant'Antonio Abate\n\n\n=== Baroque and historical churches ===\n\nThe Baroque city centre of Catania is a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nThe Cathedral (1070\u20131093, rebuilt after the 1693 earthquake)\nSaint Agatha Abbey (1620)\nSaint Placidus (1769)\nChurch of San Giuseppe al Duomo\nChurch of Santissimo Sacramento al Duomo\nChurch of San Martino dei Bianchi\nChurch of Sant'Agata la Vetere (254)\nSaint Agatha by the Furnace or Saint Blaise (1098, rebuilt in 1700)\nChurch of the Saint Jail or Saint Agatha at the Jail (Santo Carcere or Sant'Agata al Carcere) (1760).

In its close vicinities there is a cylindric tower, known as Saint Mary's Tower (Torre Santa Maria), which was restructured in the 16th century to prevent the frequent plunders of the Saracen pirates. The church is the result of the gradual modification of the Greek Temple Athena Longatis or Parthenos Longatis that existed on the steep reef. This cult was imported from a Boeotian region of Greece called Longas from where the first Hellenic settlers of this borough probably came. After the earthquake of 1693 it was rebuilt on the same place but with a different orientation.\nOur Lady of Montserrat (1755)\nChurch of  Santa Maria della Salute\nSaint Mary of La Salette\nChurch of Santa Maria della Mercede\nChurch of Santa Caterina al Rinazzo\nOur Lady of Concordia\nChurch of Santa Maria della Guardia\nOur Lady of Consolation\nChurch of Santissimo Crocifisso Maiorana\nCrucifix of Miracles\nCrucifix of Good Death\nOur Lady of La Mecca\nSaint Cajetan at the Marina\nMost Holy Redeemer\nSaint Francis of Paola\nChurch of the Divina Maternit\u00e0\nChapel of Mary Auxiliatrix\nChapel of the Sacred Heart of Jesus\nChurch of the Sacro Cuore al Fortino (1898)\nSaints George and Denis\nChurch of the Sacred Heart of the Capuchins\nSaint Christopher\nSaints Cosmas and Damian\nChurch of Santa Maria del Soccorso or Santa Maria della Palma\nSaint Vitus\nChurch of the Santi Angeli Custodi\nChurch of the Santissimo Salvatore\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nUrsino Castle, built by emperor Frederick II in the 13th century.\nPalace of the Elephants, designed by Giovan Battista Vaccarini.

The city is famous for its mainly petrochemical industry, and the extraction of sulphur. In the year 2000, according to Census, Catania was the 14th richest city in Italy, with a GDP of US$6.6 billion (\u20ac6.304 billion), which was 0.54% of the Italian GDP, a GDP per capita of US$21,000 (\u20ac20,100) and an average GDP per employee of US$69,000 (\u20ac66,100).In the late-19th century and early-20th century, Catania began to be heavily industrialised, with its several factories and chimneys, often to the extant that it was referred to as Southern Italy's \"Manchester\". The economy of Catania suffered heavily from the bad effects of World War I, and was marked by an economic crisis and recession that culminated in the 1920s. Since then, the city lost its industrial and entrepreneurial importance. In the 1930s, Catania remained a small fishing town with derelict and disused industries. However, after the destruction of World War II, Catania's economy began to re-grow in the late-1950s and early-1960s. As a matter of fact, the city's economic growth was so rapid and dynamic that it was often nicknamed the \"Milan of the South\", or in Italian \"Milano del Sud\". This rapid economic growth prompted a great number of Sicilians living in the more rural areas, or smaller towns such as Enna, Ragusa and Caltanissetta, to move to the city to seek new jobs.\nToday, Catania, despite several problems, has one of the most dynamic economies in the whole of Southern Italy. It still has a strong industrial and agricultural sector, and a fast-growing tourist industry, with many international visitors coming to visit the city's main sights and the nearby Etna volcano. It contains the headquarters or important offices of companies such as STMicroelectronics, and also several chemical and pharmaceutical businesses. There have been several new business developments to further boost Catania's economy, including the construction of Etnapolis, a big shopping mall designed by Massimiliano Fuksas, the same architect who designed the FieraMilano industrial fair in Milan, or the Etna Valley, where several high-tech offices are located.\nTourism is a fast-growing industry in Catania. Lately the administration and private companies have made several investments in the hospitality industry in order to make tourism a competitive sector in the Metropolitan City. Etnaland, a big amusement and water park located in Belpasso, in the Metropolitan area of Catania, 12 kilometers (7 miles) from the city center, is the largest in Southern Italy and attracts thousands of tourists, not only from Sicily, but also from the rest of Italy: according to Tripadvisor (2018) it is the third water park in Europe.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Catania dates back to 1434 and it is the oldest university in Sicily. Its academic nicknames are: Siculorum Gymnasium and Siciliae Studium Generale. Nowadays it hosts 12 faculties and over 62,000 students, and it offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.\nCatania hosts the Scuola Superiore, an academic institution linked to the University of Catania, aimed at the excellence in education. The Scuola Superiore di Catania also offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.Apart from the University and the Scuola Superiore Catania is base of the prestigious Istituto Musicale Vincenzo Bellini an advanced institute of musical studies (Conservatory) and the Accademia di Belle Arti an advanced institute of artistic studies. Both institutions offer programs of university level for musical and artistic education.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe opera composer Vincenzo Bellini was born in Catania, and a museum exists at his birthplace.\nThe Teatro Massimo \"Vincenzo Bellini\", which opened in 1890, is named after the composer. The opera house presents a variety of operas through a season, which run from December to May, many of which are the work of Bellini.\nGiovanni Verga was born in Catania in 1840. He became the greatest writer of Verismo, an Italian literary movement akin to Naturalism. His novels portray life among the lower levels of Sicilian society, such as fishermen and stonemasons, and were written in a mixture of both literary language and local dialect. Francesco Longo Mancini was a painter known for paintings of nudes who was born in Catania in 1880.\n\nThe city's patron saint is Saint Agatha, who is celebrated with a religious pageantry, the Festival of Saint Agatha, on February 5 every year.\nThe city is base of the newspaper La Sicilia and of the TV-channel Antenna Sicilia also known as Sicilia Channel. Several others local television channels and free-press magazines have their headquarters in Catania.\nThe city is home to the Catania Jazz Festival, which typically runs for several winter months with concerts in different locations.\nIn the late 1980s and during the 1990s Catania had a sparkling and unique popular music scene. Indie pop and indie rock bands, local radio station and dynamic independent music record labels sprung. As a result, in those years the city experienced a vital and effervescent cultural period. Artists like Carmen Consoli and Mario Venuti and internationally known indie rock bands like Uzeda came out of this cultural milieu.\nThe city is the home of Amatori Catania rugby union team, Calcio Catania football team and Orizzonte Catania, the latter being a women's water polo club, winning eight European Champions Cup titles from 1994 to 2008. Noted Italian basketball coach Ettore Messina is a native of Catania. The city also hosted the first ever qualification tournament for the Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1992, and the associated Etna Cup, which was won by the host Sicily team. In addition, the Catania Elephants are currently members of the Italian Football League. Catania also hosted the 2011 FIE Fencing World Championships.\n\n\n== Food and cuisine ==\n\nFood is an important part of Catania's culture and way of life. Local cuisine emphasizes several traits of Sicilian one, whilst developing some of its own.\nStreet food is one of the best ways to experience traditional dishes. Arancini are perhaps the city's most iconic one: they are stuffed rice balls coated in bread-crumbs and deep fried; in Catania, they are shaped like a cone to remind of Mount Etna. Typical specialties from the city include cipollina (puff pastry with onion, tomato and prosciutto filling), bolognese (a small pizza topped with tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto and boiled egg and covered in puff pastry), crispelle (deep fried dough balls with ricotta or anchovies filling.)\nDuring street-fairs and religious festivals, street stalls sell calia e simenza (toasted chickpeas and pumpkin seeds). Typical from old street markets are sangeli (cooked pork blood), quarumi (pork tripe), zuzzu (pork jelly), mauru (edible seaweed), and raw seafood. Horse meat is very traditional and it is sold in shops called arrusti e mancia (\"roast it and eat it\"), which roast the meat in streetside barbecues.Apart from street food, typical dishes from Catania are: pasta alla Norma (pasta with fried eggplant, tomato sauce and ricotta salata cheese), named after the namesake opera by Vincenzo Bellini; pasta cco niuru (pasta in cuttlefish ink), maccu (fava beans pur\u00e9e), bastaddi affucati or brocculi affucati (stewed cauliflower or broccoli), caponata (saut\u00e9ed vegetables) and scacciata (a pie filled with tuma cheese) which is traditional during Christmastime.Catania is also famous for its pasticceria (pastries and cakes). Pastries vary according to season and to seasonal events: during the Festival of Saint Agatha, patron saint of the city, there are the cassatelle (small cassatas) and olivette (olive shaped almond paste). In Easter, there are aceddi ccu l\u2019ovu (boiled eggs covered in biscuit). In summer there is granita. During the Festa dei morti (traditional celebrations in All Souls' Day) there are biscuits called ossa di mortu, rame di Napoli and nsuddi.\nDrink kiosks are everywhere in town and serve soft drinks. Traditional soft drinks are made mixing fruit syrups with soda and other flavors such as anisette. They are thirst-killer and they are very popular with the locals and the tourists.\nLocal products include blood oranges, pistachios from Bronte, extra-virgin olive oil, cactus fruit, cherries, grapes from Mazzarrone, strawberries from Maletto, mushrooms, honey and wine.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nCatania has a commercial seaport (Catania seaport), an international airport (Catania Fontanarossa), a central railway station (Catania Centrale) and it is a main node of the Sicilian motorway system.\nThe motorways serving Catania are the A18 Messina-Catania and the A19 Palermo-Catania; extensions of the A18 going from Catania to Syracuse and to Gela are currently under construction.\nThe Circumetnea is a narrow-gauge railway that runs for 110 km (68 mi) from Catania round the base of Mount Etna. It attains the height of 976 m (3,202.10 ft) above sea level before descending to rejoin the coast at Giarre-Riposto to the North.\nIn the late 1990s the first line of an underground railway (Metropolitana di Catania) was built. The underground service started in 1999 and it is currently active on a route of 8.8 km (5.5 mi), from the station Nesima (West of town), passing through the stations of San Nullo, Cibali (still under construction), Milo, Borgo, Giuffrida, Italia, Galatea, Giovanni XXIII, to Stesicoro. These two stations, bringing Catania Underground in the city centre, have opened on 20 December 2016. First line is planned to extend from the satellite city of Patern\u00f2 to Fontanarossa Airport.\n\n\n=== Catania Public Transportation Statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Catania, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 56 min. 13% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 23 min, while 46% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.7 km, while 3% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nAaron ben Gershon abu al-Rabi, 15th century rabbi\nOriana Bandiera (1971\u2013), economist and academic\nPippo Baudo (1936-), TV presenter\nFranco Battiato (1945-), singer-songwriter, composer, filmmaker\nGianni Bella (1947-), singer-songwriter\nMarcella Bella (1952-), singer\nVincenzo Bellini (1801\u20131835), composer\nOrnella Bertorotta (1967-) politician\nGiuseppa Bolognara Calcagno (1826\u20131884), freedom fighter of the Risorgimento\nVitaliano Brancati (1907\u20131954), writer\nLuigi Capuana (1839\u20131915), writer\nCharondas (6th c.

In 1823, Light had fondly written of Catania: \"The two principal streets cross each other at right angles in the square in the direction of north and south and east and west. They are wide and spacious and about a mile [1.6 km] long\". This became the basis for his plan of Adelaide.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAmico, Vito Maria (1740).

          "This site is now a seat of the university, but it has layers and layers of history, above ground and below. The architecture above ground is a beautiful mix of styles, in the buildings and in the courtyards. Down a flight of stairs to what seems to be subterranean but is",

          "We visited it on our first day in the city and it was just amazing. There are guided visits in Italian every hour, the last one starting at 5pm. If you don't speak Italian, they give you a printed version of what is going to be explained in your mother tongue, which is quite",
          "I must admit, visiting this monastery was not in our original plans. We had an Underground Sicily tour that was dropped last minute, so we walked around in Catania to explore some of the sights that would have been included in that. First I didn't understand what this monastery",

          "Our guide studied here and so was very enthusiastic about it but even without his enthusiasm we would have been enamoured with the place. The church is huge, the sunline ( sundial) quite fascinating and the whole place is not as overladen as many baroque churches. Attached is",

          "Most of the interior was closed except for guided tours and the church was okay. We felt like we were in the way of the university students and didnt want to disturb them. Cute little courtyards in spring with pink blossoms. Not much to see. Go to a museum nearby instead.",
          "We went on the guided tour in English. Tours run every hour. The guide explained the history of the monastery and how the Etna eruption and earthquake affected it. The guide was very informative and the tour was extensive. An excellent tour, I recommend it!",

          "One of the first time ever i liked an excursion. We join a group for a tour in an info point on the territory of the monastery. Our guide was Nicola - perfect! It last more than one hour and we enjoyed every minute, even though i am not a fan of the guided tours. Price: 7 euros",

          "A place we\u2019d read we should visit. It took a while to find our way in and then you could wander around what is now part of the university. It was Saturday and there was a medical conference on. We found the church next door and part of the Monastery more interesting. If you want",
          "We decided not to pay and see inside as it's not a monastry anymore but part of the university. We were pleased to be able to amble outside and get a feel for the original place, their gardens and oive trees still there where you can jst imagine the monks wondering about and",
          "Due to the extremly good rating here on tripadvisor, I expected more. We participated in a tour, which was guided by a really nice and well informed woman. But I thought there were more impressive things to see. It was interesting to hear about the history and see the structure",

          "The monastery gets a good review on Tripadvisor, but what we saw left me a bit underwhelmed. It would have liked to see some of the things on the guided tour - like the roman road - but the only tour was in Italian. I think there is a tour in English in the afternoon, but most",
          "The place is AMAZING! Best choice is to have the tour with the guide (very prepared), it lasts more than one hour, but time flies because the place is huge with an interesting story! If you are in Catania, you cannot lost it",

          "Now here is a great quiet place in Catania... ling empty corridors... some nice views and a wonderful staircase to stare at. Its a monastery.... its quiet... and if you are lucky like my wife and I were you have the place merely to yourself.... I just loved it....",

          "If you arrive on a Sunday, as we did, you will find that you must take a tour to see the monastery: it is not open to wandering. That's a good idea anyway, because the tours are complete and add an extra dimension to what you see. The English tours are at 2. When we arrived at",
          "When you're in Catania, this is probably one of the things you should do. It's an interesting place. On the day we were there there were a lot of college students about but they don't seem to mind you walking around and looking around. Some of the parts are blocked off but you",

          "The guided tour is incredibly worth and highly recommended. The tour is in Italian but a written transcript is provided in English, French and Spanish. The buildings and their history were one of the most interesting parts of our trip to Sicily.",
          "Unfortunately , we did not have the time to wait for the guided tour of the monastary (currenly hosting the university of Catania) . So we only took a quick look inside the building , and got the impression that waiting for the tour is a must . Bring your cameras .",
          "Quite secret and not well sponsored today the monastery hosts the University and is available for touristic visits which are highly reccomended for the explanations. Book your visit online or do call the Number to know when the visits are available",

          "The guided tour comprises not only a description of the very complex building itself but also an insight into the history of Catania (volcanic eruption, earthquake, etc) and the history of Sicily and Italy (warring barons, unification, etc). The tour is not expensive and there",
          "I recommend guide only because of plenty information but if you want to go solo it is still ok. You can ask people around or students about history of this aristocratic monastery. You will surely have a pleasant time.",
          "No thrills, no major excitement, yet a very pleasing afternoon break. Like all of Catania's historic buildings, there's a wealth of history everywhere you choose to visit. I didn't take the guided tour, just quietly wandered around, discovering that there's much more than I saw",
          "We visited the monastery with a guide (having the ticket with the museum) and the tour of 1 hour was interesting especially for all the information the guide gave us.",
          "We spend an hour wandering around the monastery and its gardens. Very peaceful, away from the bustle of Catania - but that's about all there is to it. The architecture and decoration of the monastery is fairly nondescript. Woth up to an hour of your time but that's all.",
          "If you have time visit the monastery. We didn't take the tour but still enjoyed wandering around, finding inner courtyards where students were sitting. Some parts were closed. It was a relaxing and peaceful visit.",

          "It's beautiful place to visit. Entry is free, you get a map with some description about the place. Building is old and you still can feel the vibe of old even that is full with young students. I definitely recommend this place. Its max 2 hours.",
          "We were not planning to visit this monument in Catania but were ver pleased to change our minds. A guided visit costs some money but we did it on our own, which I personally prefer. The building now belongs to the University of Catania.",
          "Its history is one of the most interesteing I have heard. The colours of the paintings in the cathethdral are special:)",
          "Looking at it from outside, it does not seem that big or that beautiful. However, once you start the tour you realize this is some sort of a city within a city. Guided tours take place every hour (only in Italian), but we had the fortune to be part of a non Italian group, so the",
          "This is an imposing attraction in the area of the Roman theatre.I though about the inhabitants living a contemplative life. This is not a splashy or exciting exhibit, but good. I would imagine it would be more beautiful in Spring and summer but we enjoyed our Feb visit.",
          "A venue with a lot of spaces in a charming area. Wonderful Sicilian baroque style. In Catania, a town that everybody must see.",
          "If you visit the Monastero, I recommend to take a guided tour on a quite moment (sunday for example). The 1,5h guide is very informative and gives you an extended history of the monastory. The tour is in Italian but written english information is available. Especially with",
          "Great place to spend a couple of hours and it's free. We had written information to go around the monastery with, which was very interesting.

          "You can walk around the Monastero free of charge, but a \u20ac7 fee per person will get you the guided tour. On the hour in Italian, and once a day in English I believe, but best to call ahead/ email for the time of the English tour. The tour lasted around 1 hour and it was the only",

          "So many people encouraged us to visit this monastery that we squeezed it in at the end of our last day in Catania, taking a 5:00 tour in Italian, even though we don't speak Italian. The tour office noted we would have the printed guide in English so we thought it might suffice.",
          "A massive monastery which is difficult to navigate even with a map. There are guided tours but we were told they were only in Italian. Beautiful staircases and cloisters. Be sure to visit the church next door too which is also enormous with beautiful marble flooring depicting",
          "You can walk around the church, but if you want to see inside the monastery (which is now part of the university) you need to take the tour - but it's well worth it. We missed the English tour, and so went on an Italian one, but we were given comprehensive notes and the guide",

          "Tours on the hour, 7 euros pp. takes just over an hour and covers most of the building. Tour in Italian with short notes for non Italians. Tour is honest, didnt try to make it sensational or excuse the excesses of past occupants or owners just to appeal to tourism. Good stuff.",
          "Monastero dei Benedettini built 1558 and now a University is worth going out of your way for, to see one of the largest monasteries in Europe. As others have said, doing the tour helps to understand the history behind this wonderful building and also gives access to otherwise",
          "I went here for a conference, but found a historical gem as others have said. I was very taken with the stairs which are marble worn down by countless steps of monks over the years. Walking the halls gives one a feeling of deep history as if the walls and ceilings are talking",
          "You will have to climb to the highest point in Catania to visit this unexpected gem. The monastery is now home to the languages department of the university, but detailed guided tours are routinely given. As you descend through each level of the buildings. more and more history",
          "Not sure of the guided tour in English as we did ours in Italian, but the amount of information was phenomenal and the monastery is really beautiful, even just the free sections but all the access you get on the tour makes it worth it.",
          "The place is beautiful, but the best part to see is really the stairs leading from the main entrance up to the next floors. The place has a lot of beautiful art but also mixed in with some modern renovations.",
          "The beautiful monastery is well worth a visit. There are guided tours every hour and one in English at 2pm. As we were there at 11am we chose to go on the Italian speaking tour with a guide written in English. However the guide did not leave us out and pointed out the important",

          "Based on the reviews we expected a lot. It is a nice building, but in hindsight not worth going out of the way for it. It is free entrance for the large part, it is still in use, and without taking the paid tour you cannot get everywhere. When we were there there was no tour at",
          "Lots to see. Lots of history. Do the guided tour!!! This is a monetary converted into a university. Makes me want to apply for a job to teach there. If you're in Catania for only a couple of days, you must plan a visit there. It's incredible how the monastery has been",
          "The Monastery is a unique place that tells about the human and historic events of the city on the slope at the foot of Etna, from the ancient times until today. The monument is open everyday, for everybody. Find out how to visit, experience and live one of the largest Monastery",

          "I did not take a tour but just walked around a bit. It's a very beautiful place! I have to admit though that I was especially fascinated by the church next to it that was never finished. It's huge and it looks totally unreal. Loved it!",

          "The monastery which is now part of the university is quite fascinating . Check before you go as a guided tour is worth it. This also enables you to see much more than going around by yourself. Very beautiful architecture and an amazing library.",

          "Not as nice as in the pictures. Definitely needs a facelift. The fact that the building is in use as a university does not help either. Frankly we could have spent our time better than to come here.",
          "When I visited I got an almost private guided tour with only an Italian couple besides me. The complex has a very interesting history that began after the previous building was destroyed by lava in the 16th century. The lava sort of stopped half way the building then and in",
          "During this most interesting visit of approximately just over an hour's duration, a well informed guide took us through the past and present of this intriguing monastery in the heart of Catania, Questions were fielded capably. Currently put to use as a university, library etc.",
          "Very impressive place to visit. But check the tour language in advance! Otherwise it is very untouched and well kept.",
          "The Past: High above Catania stands the Benedictine Monastery of San Nicola that began construction in 1558. Through the years it has undergone numerous changes, additions and purposes. It was the second largest Monastery in the world. It had been almost completely destroyed by",
          "On recommendation I took a chance, so glad I did. The history of this monastery is long and interesting. Tour guides are accommodating and welcome questions. Well worth the admission and time",
          "I wasn't too excited about going to see a 17th Century monastery especially since it wasn't a monastery any more. And I was in two minds about the tour but I was totally wrong. The tour is fascinating and you get to see things that are not open to the public (like the Roman",
          "To best appreciate this immense former monastery, now a part of the University of Catania, take a guided tour, generally offered every hour. When you buy your ticket (6 euros), make sure you get the 5-page description if your tour isn't offered in English. If possible, read it",
          "The Monastero dei Benedettini is a working school and as such there are a number of areas you cannot access, which meant we were unable to get out in to the internal courtyard or on to the balconies, which was a disappointment.",
          "This immense monastery with its beautiful cloisters was the largest Benedictine monastery in Italy and second largest in the world. It is now being used as part of the University of Catania. In order to appreciate it you need a guide. We wandered in by chance and only later",
          "In a prominent position in Catania and I found the ruin-like feel from the outside fascinating. Wandered in and was transfixed by the faded beauty of the place. What an amazing place to be a student! Get a guide as I think you will have access to much more than what a casual",
          "This building was a monastery but is now being used at least in part by the university. It was very quiet and had beautiful frescos on the main staircase. Looking into the main courtyard from the balcony shows a big quad with quiet cloisters. Thought that the old de consecrated",
          "We had an excellent guide and it was well worth the visit. A very interesting building rich in history. It also functions as part of the University of Catania. Some of the original mosaic floors are still in evidence in the basement of the building.",
          "Fascinating history, very nice architecture. We had a tour with a very nice guide, who went out of her way to speak English (the tour was in Italian)",
          "Glad we went! Sandra was the guide and did an outstanding job. They give an English paper but Sandra spoke excellent English and made it a great tour.",
          "This Monastero is greet for a 90 minutes / 2 hour visit. Even without an English speaking host its great to visit because they have printed some information and the guides try to explain a little in English. the only thing we noticed is that it could get some refurbishment,",
          "Though did not pay for a guided tour, it was possible to walk around as it serves as a university as well. It was nice, the way the old building has been made into a uni is pretty cool, must be fun to study there. Worth a visit, especially the garden, which is beautiful. If you",
          "Exactly this was the impression that I left when I visited \"Monastero dei Benedettini\": I want to be a university student again! A place simply beautiful, impressive and inspirational!",
          "I had the pleasure to join a guided tour in Monastero dei Benedettini and I can highly recommend it! A very nice guide walked is around buildings of the monastery showing us many interesting places and explaining the story of the place.",
          "As others have said, it is well worth taking the guided tour (starts on the hour) because without it you will miss some areas that are locked. The architecture is amazing and represents many different time periods, including the remains of a Roman house with a clear walkway over",
          "The place is free of charge to get in. It is a nice place to visit especially since it has a baroque architecture. Nowadays, the structure is being used as a university. It is a pity that like most of the beautiful things in Catania are not being taken care of.",
          "Excellent guided tour of this extraordinary Monastery now turned University.Unique not only for it's antiquity but how many Universites have been built of several level through regular distrction and rebuilding through Volcanic action from local and still active Etna..",
          "We arrived just as a guided tour was about to start and joined it(\u20ac6 pp _well worth it!) Although it is free to visit the monastery, access to all areas is restricted unless you are accompanied by a guide. Although we joined an Italian speaking group, we had English information",
          "The building is very well preserved and the parts you can get into are well worth the visit (and it's free). It's a pity that more of the building isn't open to the public but I can understand why it isn't, given that it's in use by the university.",
          "Wonderful place, it hosts the literature faculty of University of Catania. It's a sort of magic place where you can feel the history of the town. It was touched by the 1669 lava flow and beneath it you can see even more ancient remnants.",
          "An interesting place to visit even though I personally think that it could do with a clean up and restoration . Also good to visit the church which is in the same complex.",
          "We had arrived in Catania in the morning from Malta, explored the main square, had lunch at the fish market and checked into our hotel and like all good tourists were out wandering in the late afternoon heat - somewhat eased by a short sharp shower of rain. We had no particular",
          "Just off the Piazza Dante Alighieri, the former Benedictine monastery (now part of the University) is an architectural gem. A grandiose baroque entrance staircase takes you up to the cloisters and gardens, where you can wander at your own leisure or take part in a guided tour",
          "The monastery is very beautiful and I would have enjoyed the visit anyway, but the guide made it a perfect experience with so much passion and talent. I really think without the guide the experience wouldn't be nearly as interesting, so go there and follow the guide for an",
          "This Monastry has been converted into a university but it is still well worth a visit. It gives a pretty good idea of where the monks used to live. And the church right next to it is one of the most impressive of Catania.",
          "One of the must go and see place in Catania great architecture and history. Very close to Una palace hotel by walking distance.",
          "We take visit with the guide that just spoke in Italian, so all the foreign become bored immediately. we visit it at 23:00 in the night. Very Warm, just they show some part of it, the library and nothing else. ll the Catacombes are not open to the public, so very poor and not",
          "The Benedictine Monastery is a UNESCO World Heritage Site (according to their website: http://www.monasterodeibenedettini.it/benedictine-monastery-catania.htm) and is beautiful, the first inner courtyard has a beautifully tiled gazebo (Chiostro di Levante). The buildings are",
          "The old monestry now part of the university is large and on more than one level and is worth a look as there is no entrance fee, however guided tours are 6 euros.",
          "One of the biggest monastery in Europe, walk around his corridors is an unique experience.In the heart of Catania.",
          "For the most part it seemed closed off but we wandered around for a while and the architecture is beautiful. We stumbled upon it by chance while wandering around the city but it's relatively close to the city center.",
          ".. if not the biggest. In a quiet yet cosy square the huge and unfinished church stands up in isolation and desperate need for restauration. The entrance to the Monastery , now used a University , is on one of the sides. Check opening time since it is only possible to access",
          "Seen a library in the basement, corridors full of students, toi-toi toilests, too standing beside the building.",
          "Good insight into cloistered monastic life....impressive church, but one of many. You pay a few euros and get a good audio guide to help appreciate the details. I enjoyed the description of the nun meeting her father through the grille after many years...such emotion.",
          "We stopped in the monastery, not having read the TA reviews, and were delighted by what we found. the audio boxes we carried gave a great history lesson, and the artwork and ceiling paintings were terrific.",
          "we have not figured out if it was possible pay for guided tours but even just walking (free) in the monastery was a nice experience!",
          "The staff was great. The monastery is a must see. Take plenty of pictures. Huge historical significance.",
          "This building represents the perfect synthesis of the wonderful decadent baroque in Catania. Two wonderful courtyards in perfect shape despite the poor resources available. Imagine the students studying in these peaceful rooms, designed for the monks.",
          "The tour of the monastero was a pleasant surprise and gave us insights in the history of Catania. The guide, Nicola, was very nice, well prepared and spoke perfect English. This is a visit not to be missed in Catania!",
          "If you are in Catania this is a \"can't-miss\" site. You can get tours in Italian and English (maybe others), my tour guide switched to English (she just graduated from the U of Catania in foreign languages) to accommodate the tour, but usually the language of the tour is",
          "Was here with a large group. If you can get Nicolo as your tour guide, do it. He's entertaining, theatrical, and knows the place backwards and forwards. The Monastery is built upon the old monastery, which was besieged by the volcano but survived only to collapse in an",
          "I have to say, we got lost trying to find the monastery. Signs are confusing and entrances are set up for university students but when we did get in, we had a tour which was amazing! The building has been so affected by the lava flow, the remains of which you can still see and",
          "To visit the Monastero, i strongly suggest Saturdays, as during the week it's normally used by students. Late afternoon, wonderful lights and the very knowledgeble tour guide had no other guests but us!",
          "Wonderfully over the top architecture and frescoes - the ceiling of the nave is particularly fine.Good sound guide that provides almost too much information. Well worth a visit.",
          "The guided tour of the monastery is very nice: a lot of information about the history of this beautiful building and (of course) the Etna's eruptions. Especially the cellars of the old monastery were spectacular!",
          "The most horrible and disgusting city I have ever been ( and I have been to quite a few in many continents). Extremely dirty and run down - no charm and proletary. Even the monastery nothing really nice and interesting inside - waste of time unless you like to see a reconverted",
          "Everything about the Monasterio die Benedettini is on a grand scale. The monatery is huge, with corridors stretching off as far as the eye can see and the church is cavernous, which an extraordinary unfinished facade. Look out for the organ, which is a fine instrument. The",
          "You have to join the tour to see the insides and all the interesting bits of the monastery, so don't be deterred even if the tour is in Italian. They would give you a 4-page description of each point and you can read it while the guide is speaking in Italian. I found it most",
          "try to join a tour to visit old roman cuisine: you will love it. One of the few relics older than the Catania covering in late 1500",
          "What a wonderful tour. For 6 euras or 4 for senior it was an hour and half tour. To have it in English you should call ahead but we followed an Italian tour with everything written in English and we didn't miss anything our guide stopped and explained each stop for us. It",
          "Being professional photographer I can tell that this architecture jewel was fantastic late baroque monument to photograph, especially hundreds of best gargoyles I have ever seen. I could spend hours there. If you would like to see some of them go to",
          "This Monastery is worth a visit.You can have a guided tour on the hour every day from 9am for just 6 euro.",
          "I visited the Monastery/University twice, once on a guided tour and once without. The tour is a must, as it provides very interesting background on a fascinating university building (built on top of a monastery which was itself built on top of another monastery, which was built",
          "The monastary is now the University of Catania - and very active with students. When we visited an English tour was not available so we wandered around on our own (for free) with a map provided at the ticket office. It was interesting to be strolling through the halls with the",
          "Very interesting indeed, the place is packed with history and tales from those times, human beings who shared the same believe, so much commitment must have been needed to endure it all.. only their prayers would have being their salvation from the plain mind thoughts, lets",
          "Guided tours are available, but most are in Italian, so if you want an English tour be sure you check when these happen before you go. You can explore parts of the monastery for free, but the guided tours are much more informative. It's a beautiful place. Stop by for an hour",
          "This monastery has appeared under various guises throughout history and each one has completely overtaken the previous identity. However now belonging to the university, clever architects have designed it in such a way that you can see evidence of all the occupants through",
          "This was easiest my favorite tourist attraction in Catania, and for some reason not much is written about it in guide books. I really recommend paying for the guided tour (it is the only way to get into some of the more interesting areas of the monastery), even if the only one",
          "The Monastero is presently housing the University of Catania. The underground library is well worth a visit. Guides are abundant and informative. The gardens while not up to Tivoli standards are nonetheless interesting. The floors and stonework alone make the Monastero well",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my tour with Simona (I was the only one there so I had a personal tour). The building has an interesting history and gives an in-depth insight into the life lived by the Benedictine monks at the times they lived there. You can see the forces of nature - Etna",
          "Me and my brother we were travelling in Sicily this October. We stopped also in Catania for five days. We absolutely had to visit The Monastery San Nicolo. Incredible! We had great guided tour with Miss Maria Rachelle. We appreciate very much that it is in the same time also the",
          "It is possible to join a tour guide for this sight and I would highly recommend that. This is a place where one should really get to know it's history and be guided to view all the ancient ruins beneath the monastery. A lot of history here and good to be able to wander about.",
          "Great architecture and beautiful inner gardens in this former monastery, now part of the University of Catania. Don't miss the unfinished church right next to the Monastero, where you can see the biggest meridian clock in the world! Impressive.",
          "Take the guided tour-if you don't speak Italian, call ahead to arrange a tour in English. The architecture, the history of the monastery (cultural, religious and geologic) are fascinating.",
          "This was a most interesting tour of the monastery, giving access to places that would not be open to public access and which would not easily be found even if they were. the guide was knowledgeable and, together with the printed guide in English, was able to help us understand",
          "We had a great time when we visited and went on the tour we were the only English speakers but the guide was brilliant she would also explain in English. But it wasn't until we got back to the U.K that my partner kept wishing he'd bought one of the lava key rings from the shop.",
          "There were only the 2 of us so the guide spoke in fluent English. The size of this place and age of some of the areas is astounding and so interesting.",
          "Entry was 6 Euro and included a guided tour. There were only two of us, so it ended being a private tour. Most impressed with the guide's English as she normally only does the tour in Italian. Quite amazing the size of the monastery and the architectural styles from Roman houses",
          "The building is amazing! Enormous and very beautiful, mainly because it was built in 1550's. The entrance is wonderful. Some points I believe could be much better: - guided tour only in Italian... At least in English! - more details inside building - since it is a university",
          "Beautiful building, marmer and very spacial. It hosts a university now. Lovely if you can take classes there!",
          "Guided tour was really interesting. The guide took the two of us around unlocking al the doors to show us some really fasciniating areas of what is now the university but which had been a roman villa, then a monastery at the time of the volcano and then the earthquake. Get there",
          "There are guided tours but as it is open every day for everyone we just wondered around. Nice to see how they converted the building into uni keeping the original architecture. Really nice garden in the middle of the main building",
          "This was a great way to spend a few hours. There were no other visitors so I had a personal guided tour. It was fascinating to see the various areas of the monastery and see how it has been incorporated into the modern university. As in much of Sicily there were excavated Roman",
          "I suggest everybody to visit this beautiful building, where today is the base of Catania University. It is not easy to find, but I was very happy to have seen it, thanks to the advise of the guide...",
          "I visited it in May 2014, advised by a guy in the B&B. A part from the architectural aspect which is for sure nice but not the best example in Italy I think it was interesting to see the lava formation inside the building, you can see until where it arrived and what they did to",
          "This monastery is astonishing : when you enter you would say that it is just an ancient building, but when you visit it (I suggest you to take the guide, just a few euros more) you discover the university inside (the architect is a genius), the underground, the cloisters...it",
          "\"Take the guided tour\" he wrote, And I can only confirm what he said. It took about one hour but it was very interesting, seeing amongst others some roman ruins, and the wall of lava where the flooding stoped.",
          "We just happened to visit as a tour was about to start, so decided to go for the tour. Our tour was in Italian, but we were given a handout in English and our guide answered all of our questions. By taking the guided tour, we were able to see many areas closed off to the casual",
          "Impressive from the outside but disappointing since it was the 1 May holiday in Sicily, all the buildings were closed.",
          "An absolutely stunning building on the UNESCO world heritage list. There were lots of tourists in Catania but we were the only visitors at the time we were there. If you are in Catania this is a must see!",
          "We went to this attraction on our day in Catania, as it was ranked very highly on here. However when we actually had a look around, we really became genuinely confused... So this place was a benedictine monastary, and I agree that the architecture is impressive enough, but the",
          "This was the most highly recommended site to us in Catania but, when we got there, we felt like we were in the middle of frosh week at a university. Apparently the monastery is used as a university now so there were young adults everywhere, going to class, smoking, chatting,",
          "Although the tour was in Italian, the printed English text and the occasional comment from the guide helped us to appreciate this gem of a place. Well worth a visit",
          "This was a little gem just up the road from where we were staying - free to enter, map provided and we had a good wonder around - beautiful building - shame it's been given over to the University but at least that will keep it maintained.",
          "I must say I have been pleased about visiting this site I did not know about previously. The site itself is not of the most luxurious you can find in Italy but the way it has been restored and it is actually used is significant. I have been pleased to notice that some good money",
          "What a great place! The former monastery is now part of Catania University of Human Sciences. the guided tour takes you through the various parts of the once wealthy monastery. Private rooms, chapels, kitchens, refectory, underground supply system, Roman ruins etc. Well prepared",
          "This is a really beautiful monetary that they are currently using as a university. There is a lot to look at but the the place (like most of Catania) needs some work. The students have tagged all of the walls and it looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a while.",
          "We enjoyed the guided tour which lasted almost an hour as there was a lot to see. It was such a surprise to see how the university faculty had been successfully incorporated into this exceptional building.",
          "We had a guided tour organised by the University of Catania who now occupy this building. Such an interesting place and well worth a visit.",
          "We just wandered around the site with the free map. An incredible heritage site. Well worth your time and energy.",
          "Spectacular architecture with an interesting history. Unfortunately we didn't take a tour as we were short of time, but walked around with our guide book and admired what we were able to see, including the lava flow",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my tour around this monastery. The tour guide, a young female student kept us all captivated and was very friendly. It was definitely worth the look and the money.",
          "The surprising fact was that it is still in use - as a University. Full of students, of course. But none of the interesting rooms listed in the guide book were open for viewing. Perhaps we should have bought the guided tour.",
          "y husband and I visited here in September 2013. We went before the students started university so it was deserted apart from our small group being given a tour by our excellent guide. The whole experience was amazing, from the integration of a very old monastery into a",
          "The building is an example of Sicilian late baroque style, but other architectural styles were integrated. It is a part of UNESCO World Heritage List since 2002. The history of the building begins in 1558. I like the Church of San Nicolo L'Arena and the Chiostro di Ponente most.",
          "We went to the Monastery - which forms part of a university. There is a basic written guide in English but no English speaking guides which was a shame. We walked round the building which was rather beautiful - but it was milling with students - and we felt that we probably",
          "Took the tour In Italian but had the notes in English so it didn't matter, really an awesome place, very interesting. visited on a Sun. morning so the place was empty. (from students).",
          "for a conference it is the absolutely niciest place to stay. Only the surrounding is a bit chaotic. I liked the architecture and the way how it is used now.",
          "I was impressed with the organisation of the tour and the kind assistance at the entrance. Also enjoyed the extra visit to the contemporary arts museum.",
          "This monastero, destroyed and rebuilt after the 17th century earthquake, is a treasure to discover in Catania! It is now the University of Catania, so you can visit part of the monastero by yourself as public site. Of course, it is absolutely worthy to buy a guided visit, that",
          "The Monastero is now the University of Catania, so everything is closed in august since theuniversity is on vacation. We could not enter any of the nice rooms that are anounced on the map given in the reception. At least its free...",
          "We didn't go in, and regret it. We went passed it on the mini train and it isn't finished on the outside. When we researched it, we wish we had gone in",
          "An interesting place to visit; used to be a monastery, then left to decay but now almost largely rehabilitated. Contains pieces of history from different eras.",
          "This is a strange and interesting place, now used as a university. Fascinating to learn about the uses for the building over different periods and interesting to see the damage done by Etna and the different layers of history all in one place.",
          "Huge building with ornaments around all windows and doors, we couldn't go outside on the first floor of the monastery to look at the inner squares, so we observed through the glass. I especially liked the little garden on top of the old lava flow, where there are big cacti.",
          "Take the english language tour (if you don't speak italian) to see some of the lovely and interesting sites in this way underrated monastery. The second largest in Europe, one can get great views of the harbor, see how the monks saved the building from lava and what needed to be",
          "This was not the usual tour of a historical site. Because it is a working University there was a great atmosphere from the buzz of the students around. Seeing how the old building was now being valued and used was engaging and made it more than a tourist visit. The lava flow",
          "A very interesting place to visit. On Sundays, paying 6 EUR, you can have a guided tour that worths is weight in gold. The rest of the week is free, but you will do the tour among students, employes and professors as the building host the Humanities Faculty. I absolutely",
          "I loved what they are doing to keep the old place but incorporate the new University Library. Excellent.",
          "Such a shame they never use it. The marble patterned floors, paintings, crypt, huge vaulted, columned ceilings are mouth dropping!! Get there before noon.",
          "I'd recommend this place to all types of tourists, unless you bring children with you ( they might get bored, the place is nowadays a university). Make sure to take the tour and visit all of it, especially the cellar and the cloisters!",
          "Be sure to take the tour. Ours was in Italian, but since this was a field trip with the Federico II language school, our guide from the school did the interpreting for us. We went on a Friday afternoon and there were no classes, so we didn't see it functioning as a university.",
          "First, one must remember that this is a working university. The tour takes you through many working spaces. The monastery was built over time from the early 1700's (actually in 1667 but destroyed by the earthquake of 1693). So you ought to plan to go there outside school hours",
          "Info on the monastery indicated it was open on Sunday am, so we sent. Only available tour was in Italian, but there was some info in English available. Guide was ok and could answer some questions in English. Only disapptment was that we could not go into the church.",
          "This place had all the hallmarks of a fantastic visit...but maybe I went at the wrong time (Monday morning). This is actually an University, which I didn't realise, so the place was packed. A lot of the rooms were locked or out of bounds. The basement area couldn't be",
          "Worth visiting, one of the biggest Benedictin monastery in Europe hosting now the University of Catania",
          "I visited monastery at the beginning of September, later in the afternoon, so place was almost empty. When I first stop by in tour office, they told me that tours are offer in Italian only and suggested that I should grab map and just wondering by my own. I tried, but it did",
          "It's worth watching students following their courses in this magnificient building. You can wander around, inside and outside, and take the time to sit in the small court on the left side of the building looking at the facade and the balconies. Amazing work.",
          "It is worth a visit if you are visiting Catania and especially when helped by the friendly people of officine culturali",
          "The building is indeed impressive, and I wish now that we had availed ourselves of the tour, because we got a bit lost in the labyrinthine corridors. But it was interesting just wandering around and seeing the place alive with students. Also very impressive were the trees on the",
          "Didn't know there was a free tour but I got a free map from the reception and walked around. I love this nice building with the Univ. adaption. It's beautiful just to have a book and read at one of the student tables in front of the garden windows.",
          "The monastery was destroyed in the course of Italian unification. it is very grand. The buildings now constitute part of the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Catania and have been beautifully adapted. The complex is huge. On the intelligent guided tour, one sees",
          "Take a free guided tour around this beautiful historic building, now part of Catania University and visit the uncompleted church next door which has a beautiful atmosphere inside.",
          "After a magnificent restoration and refitting, the Monastery is now home to the humanities faculty of the University of Catania. Be sure to take the 60-90 tour (available in Italian and in English), which explores the entire beautiful building. The new parts are exemplars of",
          "Wonderful building with an interseting story. Cristina, our guide, was full of information.",
          "an amazing histroic library where many films have been filmed, in impeccable condition and well done guided tour",
          "I didn't expect a building on this scale as a monastery. Again the combinations of architectural styles is fascinating.",
          "Right in the center of Catania. An oasis. Very nice to visit the catacombs and the world class library",
          "Took the guided tour through this monastery, but the real treat is stepping down into the caves and catcombs below the university attached to the monastery. Ancient Roman baths, underground waterways, and earthquake ruins make this a great tour.",
          "Nothing special from inside. Great building. Go for a walk.",

        "wiki": "Catania (UK: , US: , Sicilian and Italian: [ka\u02c8ta\u02d0nja] (listen)) is the second largest city in Sicily, after Palermo, and among the ten largest cities in Italy. Located on Sicily\u2019s east coast, it faces the Ionian Sea. It is the capital of the 58-municipality region known as the Metropolitan City of Catania, which is the seventh-largest metropolitan city in Italy. The population of the city proper is 311,584, while the population of the Metropolitan City of Catania is 1,107,702.Catania was founded in the 8th century BC by Chalcidians Greeks. The city was almost completely destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake in 1169.However, by the 14th century, and into the Renaissance period, Catania was one of Italy's most important cultural, artistic and political centres. It was the site of Sicily\u2019s first university, founded in 1434. It has been the native or adopted home of some of Italy's most famous artists and writers, including the composers Vincenzo Bellini and Giovanni Pacini, and the writers Giovanni Verga, Luigi Capuana, Federico De Roberto and Nino Martoglio.\nThe city has been devastated several times by volcanic eruptions from nearby Mount Etna, the most violent of which was in 1669. And it suffered through another severely damaging earthquake in 1693.Catania today is the industrial, logistical, and commercial center of Sicily. Its airport, the Catania-Fontanarossa Airport, is the largest in Southern Italy. \nHowever, it is also noted for its history, culture, architecture, and gastronomy. The section of the city known as the \u201cold town\u201d features some of the most striking examples of baroque architecture in Italy, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe ancient indigenous population of the Sicels named their villages after geographical attributes of their location. The Sicilian word, katane, means \"grater, flaying knife, skinning place\" or a \"crude tool apt to pare\". Other translations of the name are \"harsh lands\", \"uneven ground\", \"sharp stones\", or \"rugged or rough soil\". The latter etymologies are easily justifiable since, for many centuries following an eruption, the city has always been rebuilt within its black-lava landscape.Around 263 BC, the city was variously known as Cat\u012dna (Latin: [\u02c8kat\u026ana]) and Cat\u0103na (Latin: [\u02c8katana]; Ancient Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 [kat\u00e1n\u025b\u02d0]). The former has been primarily used for its supposed assonance with catina, the Latin feminization of the name catinus. Catinus has two meanings: \"a gulf, a basin or a bay\" and \"a bowl, a vessel or a trough\",  thanks to the city's distinctive topography.\nAround 900, when Catania was part of the emirate of Sicily, it was known in Arabic as Balad al-f\u012bl (\u0628\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644) and Mad\u012bnat al-f\u012bl (\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644), respectively meaning \"the Village (or Country) of the Elephant\" and \"the City of the Elephant\". The Elephant is the lava sculpture over the fountain in Piazza Duomo: most likely a prehistoric sculpture that was reforged during the Byzantine Era, it appears to be a talisman that was reputedly powerful enough to protect the city from enemies and to keep away misfortune, plagues, or natural calamities. Another Arab toponym was Qa\u1e6d\u0101niyyah (\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629), allegedly from the Arabic word for the \"leguminous plants\". Pulses like lentils, beans, peas, broad beans, and lupins were chiefly cultivated in the plains around the city well before the arrival of Aghlabids. Afterwards, many Arabic agronomists  developed these crops and the citrus orchards in the area around the city.\nThe toponym W\u0101d\u012b M\u016bs\u00e1 (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0649), or \"the Valley of Moses\" (from the Arabic name of the Simeto River), was rarely used.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCatania is located on the east coast of the island of Sicily, at the foot of Mount Etna.\nAs observed by Strabo, the location of Catania at the foot of Mount Etna has been both a curse and a blessing. On the one hand, violent outbursts of the volcano throughout history have destroyed large parts of the city, whilst on the other hand the volcanic ashes yield fertile soil, especially suited for the growth of vines. (Strab. vi. p. 269)\nTwo subterranean rivers run under the city; the Amenano, which surfaces at one single point south of Piazza Duomo, and the Longane (or Lognina).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Csa\" (Mediterranean Climate). It has hot summers, one of the hottest in the whole country of Italy (a feature characterising nearly every month). Temperatures of 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are surpassed almost every year a couple of times,Winters are mild with chilly nights (not rare peaks around 20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F) . Most of precipitation is concentrated from October to March, leaving late spring and summer virtually dry (some years there is no rain for 3\u20134 months). The city receives around 500 millimetres (20 inches) of rain per year, although the amount can vary greatly from year to year (wettest over 1,200 millimetres or 47 inches, driest under 250 millimetres or 9.8 inches,).\nDuring winter nights lows can occasionally go under 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Highs under 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) can happen during winter. Snow, due to the presence of Etna that protects the city from the northern winds, is an uncommon occurrence, but occasional snow flurries have been seen over the recent years especially in the hilly districts, more substantial in the northern hinterland. More recently, light snowfalls occurred on 9 February 2015, 6 January 2017 and 5 January 2019, but the last heavy snowfall dates back to 17 December 1988.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn January 2015, there were 315,601 people residing in Catania, of whom 47.2% were male and 52.8% were female. Minors (people under age 18) totalled 20.50 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 18.87 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners).\nThe average age of Catania residents is 41 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Catania declined by 3.35 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85 percent. The reason for this population decline in the comune di Catania is mainly due to a large segment of the population leaving the city centre to go to live in the uptown residential areas of the comuni of the Metropolitan area. As a result of this, while the population in the comune di Catania declines, the population of the hinterland comuni increases making the overall population of the Metropolitan area increase.The current birth rate of Catania is 10.07 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births. As of 2006, 98.03% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant groups come from Sub-Saharan Africa: 0.69%, South Asia: 0.46%, and from other European countries (particularly from Ukraine and Poland): 0.33%.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nAround 729 BC, the ancient village of Katane was occupied by Chalcidian Greek settlers from nearby Naxos along the coast. It became the Chalcidian colony of Kat\u00e1n\u0113 under a leader named Euarchos (Euarchus) and the native population was rapidly Hellenised.\nThucydides states that it came into existence slightly later than Leontini (modern Lentini), which he claims was five years after Syracuse, or 730 BC.The settlement's acropolis was on the hill of Monte Vergine, a defensible hill immediately west of the current city centre. The port of Catania appears to have been much frequented in ancient time and was the chief place of export for the corn of the rich neighbouring plains.\n\n\n=== Greek Catania ===\nIn ancient times Catania was associated with the legend of Amphinomos and Anapias, who, on occasion of a great eruption of Etna, abandoned all their property and carried off their aged parents on their shoulders. The stream of lava itself was said to have parted, and flowed aside so as not to harm them. Statues were erected to their honour, and the place of their burial was known as the Campus Piorum; the Catanaeans even introduced the figures of the youths on their coins, and the legend became a favorite subject of allusion and declamation among the Latin poets, of whom the younger Lucilius and Claudian have dwelt upon it at considerable length.Catania was the birthplace of the philosopher and legislator Charondas (late 6th c. BC) who introduced his celebrated laws there. His legislation was extended to the other Chalcidic cities, not only of Sicily, but of Magna Graecia also, as well as to his own country. It is evident that Catania had close relations with these other cities during this time.\nIt was residence of the poets Ibycus and Stesichorus (c. 630\u2013555 BC), who was buried in a magnificent sepulchre outside one of the gates, hence its name of Porta Stesichoreia. Xenophanes (c. 570-475 BC), one of the founders of the Eleatic school of philosophy, also spent the latter years of his life in the city so that it was evidently, at an early period, a place of cultivation and refinement.\nCatania appears to have retained its independence up to the reign of the despot Hieron of Syracuse, whereupon in 476 BC he expelled all the original inhabitants of Catania and replaced them with those he ruled over at Leontini \u2013 said to have numbered no less than 10,000, consisting partly of Syracusans and Peloponnesians. At the same time he changed the city's name to \u0391\u1f34\u03c4\u03bd\u03b7 (A\u00edtn\u0113, Aetna or \u00c6tna, after the nearby Mount Etna, and proclaimed himself the Oekist or founder of the new city. For this he was celebrated by Pindar, and after his death he received heroic honours from the citizens of his new colony.A few years after the death of Hieron and the expulsion of Thrasybulus, the Syracusans combined with Ducetius, king of the Sicels, to expel the newly settled inhabitants of Catania, who went on to settle in the fortress of Inessa (to which they gave the name Aetna). The old Chalcidic citizens were reinstated to the city in 461 BC.The period that followed appears to have been one of great prosperity for Catania, as well as for the Sicilian cities in general.\nIn the Peloponnesian War during the great Athenian expedition to Sicily  in 415 BC, the Catanaeans at first refused to allow the Athenians into their city, but after the latter had forced an entrance, they found themselves compelled to honour the alliance of their invaders after a famous speech that Alcibiades would have made in front of the assembly. Catania became the headquarters of the Athenian army throughout the first year of the expedition, and the base of their subsequent operations against Syracuse. After the defeat of the Athenians it was open to attack by Syracuse but was saved by the Carthaginian invasion of Sicily in 409 BC.\nBut in 403 BC it fell into the power of Dionysius I of Syracuse, who plundered the city and sold its citizens as slaves, after which he populated it with Campanian mercenaries. These, however, quit in 396 BC and retired to Aetna, on the approach of the great Carthaginian armament under Himilco and Mago. After the great naval Battle of Catana (397 BC) which was fought off Catania and in which the latter defeated Leptines of Syracuse, the city fell into the hands of the Carthaginians.Calippus, the assassin of Dion of Syracuse, held Catania for a time (Plut. Dion. 58); and when Timoleon landed in Sicily in 344 BC Catania was subject to the despot Mamercus who at first joined the Corinthian leader, but afterwards abandoned this allegiance for that of the Carthaginians. As a consequence he was attacked and expelled by Timoleon in 338 BC.Catania was now restored to liberty, and appears to have continued to retain its independence; during the wars of Agathocles of Syracuse from 311 BC with the Carthaginians, it sided at one time with the former, at others with the latter; and when Pyrrhus landed in Sicily in 278 BC, Catania was the first to open its gates to him, and received him with the great splendour.The first introduction of dancing to accompany the flute was also ascribed to Andron, a citizen of Catania.\n\n\n=== Roman rule ===\nIn the First Punic War Catania was one of the first cities of Sicily to submit to the Roman Republic after their first successes in 263 BC when it was taken by Valerius Messalla. A sundial was part of the booty which was placed in the Comitium in Rome. Since then the city became a civitas decumana i.e. was subject to the payment of a tenth of its agricultural income as a tax to Rome. The conqueror of Syracuse, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, built a gymnasium here.It appears to have continued afterwards to maintain its friendly relations with Rome and though it did not enjoy the advantages of a confederate city (foederata civitas), like its neighbours Tauromenium (modern Taormina) and Messana (modern Messina), it rose to a position of great prosperity under the Roman rule.\nAround 135 BC during the First Servile War, it was conquered by rebel slaves.One of the most serious eruptions of Mount Etna happened in 121 BC, when a great part of Catania was overwhelmed by streams of lava, and the hot ashes fell in such quantities in the city itself, as to break in the roofs of the houses. Catana was in consequence exempted, for 10 years, from its usual contributions to the Roman state. The greater part of the broad tract of plain to the southwest of Catana (now called the Piana di Catania, a district of great fertility), appears to have belonged, in ancient times, to Leontini or Centuripa (modern Centuripe), but that portion of it between Catana itself and the mouth of the Symaethus was annexed to Catana and must have furnished abundant supplies of grain.\nCicero repeatedly mentions it as, in his time, a wealthy and flourishing city; it retained its ancient municipal institutions, its chief magistrate bearing the title of Proagorus; and appears to have been one of the principal ports of Sicily for the export of corn.In the Sicilian revolt from 44 BC Sextus Pompeius selected Sicily as his base and Catania gave in to Sextus' revolt and joined his forces. Sextus amassed a formidable army and a large fleet of warships at his base at Messana, with many slaves joining from the villas of patricians. After the victory of Augustus in 36 BC much of the vast farmland in Sicily was either ruined or left empty, and much of this land was taken and distributed to members of the legions which had fought there. Catania suffered severely from the ravages but was afterwards one of the cities raised to the status of colony by Augustus which restored its prosperity through the settlement of veterans, so that in Strabo's time it was one of the few cities in the island that was flourishing.Another revolt led by the gladiator Selurus in 35 BC created mayhem for a while.The Roman aqueduct of Catania was the largest in Roman Sicily at 24 km length starting from the springs of Santa Maria di Licodia.\nIt retained its colonial rank, as well as its prosperity, throughout the period of the Roman Empire; so that in the 4th century Ausonius in his Ordo Nobilium Urbium, notices Catania and Syracuse alone among the cities of Sicily.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nCatania was sacked by the Vandals of Gaiseric in 440\u2013441. After a period under the Ostrogoths, it was reconquered in 535 by the Eastern Roman Empire, under which (aside from a short period in 550\u2013555) it remained until the 9th century. It was the seat of the Byzantine governor of the island.\nCatania was under the Islamic emirate of Sicily until 1072, when it fell to the Normans of Roger I of Sicily. Subsequently, the city was ruled by a bishop-count. In 1194\u20131197 the city was sacked by German soldiers during after the conquest of the island by emperor Henry VI. In 1232 it rebelled to the former's son, Frederick II, who later built a massive castle, Castello Ursino and also made Catania a royal city, ending the dominance of the bishops. Catania was one of the main centers of the Sicilian Vespers revolt (1282) against the House of Anjou, and was the seat of the incoronation of the new Aragonese king of Sicily, Peter I. In the 14th century it gained importance as it was chosen by the Aragonese as a Parliament and Royal seat. Here, in 1347, it was signed the treaty of peace that ended the long War of the Vesper between Aragonese and Angevines. Catania lost its capital role when, in the early 15th century, Sicily was turned into a member of the Crown of Aragon, and kept its autonomy and original privileges specially during the period from 1282 to 1410.\nIn 1434 King Alfonso V founded here the Siciliae Studium Generale, the oldest university in the island.\n\n\n=== Early Modern times ===\n\nWith the unification of Castile and Aragon (early 16th century), Sicily became part of the Spanish Empire. It rebelled against the foreign government in 1516 and 1647.In 1669 the city's surroundings suffered great material damage from the 1669 Etna eruption. The city itself was largely saved by its walls that diverted most of the lava into the port. Afterwards in 1693 the city was then completely destroyed by a heavy earthquake and its aftershocks. The city was then rebuilt in the Baroque architecture that nowadays characterizes it.\n\n\n=== Unified Italy ===\nCatania was one of the vanguards of the movement for the Sicilian autonomy in the early 19th century.\nIn 1860 Giuseppe Garibaldi's expedition of the Thousand conquered Sicily for Piedmont from the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Since the following year Catania was part of the newly unified Italy, whose history it shares since then.\n During World War II, Catania was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces, owing to the presence of two of the main Axis airfields in Sicily (Gerbini and Fontanarossa) and for its strategically important port and marshalling yard. Altogether, the city suffered eighty-seven air raids. The heaviest raids took place in the spring and summer of 1943, before and during the Allied invasion of Sicily; they caused heavy damage to che city (among others, twenty-eight churches and most historic palaces suffered damage), killed 750 inhabitants and prompted most of the population to flee to the countryside. After heavy fighting across eastern Sicily, Catania was eventually captured by the British 8th Army on 5 August 1943.After the conflict, and the constitution of the Italian Republic (1946), Catania attempted to catch up with the economic and social development of Italy's richer northern regions. The problems faced in Catania were emblematic of those faced by other towns in the Mezzogiorno, namely a heavy gap in industrial development and infrastructures, and the threat of the mafia. This notwithstanding, during the 1960s (and partly during the 1990s) Catania enjoyed development and a period of economic, social and cultural success. In the first decade of the 21st century, Catania's economic and social development somewhat faltered and the city is again facing economic and social stagnation. This was aggravated by the economical crisis left by the Forza Italia administration of mayor Scapagnini in 2008.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Metropolitan City ===\n\nThe Metropolitan City of Catania was established in 2015 and replaced the former Province of Catania. It includes the city proper and 57 comuni (municipalities). The population of the Metropolitan City is 1,107,702.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Metropolitan area of Catania includes the comune of Catania (311,584 inhabitants) and 26 surrounding comuni forming an urban belt (498,650 inhabitants). The total population of the Metropolitan area of Catania is therefore 810,234. The comuni of the Metropolitan area are:\n\nThese comuni form a system with the centre of Catania sharing its economical and social life and creating an organic urban texture.\n\n\n=== City proper ===\nThe city of Catania proper (comune di Catania) is divided in six administrative areas called circoscrizioni. The current administrative setup was established in 2013, modifying previous setups dating back to 1971, 1978 and 1995.\nThe six areas are:\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe symbol of the city is u Liotru, or the Fontana dell'Elefante, assembled in 1736 by Giovanni Battista Vaccarini. It portrays an ancient lavic stone elephant and is topped by an Egyptian obelisk from Syene. Legend has it that Vaccarini's original elephant was neuter, which the men of Catania took as an insult to their virility. To appease them, Vaccarini appropriately appended elephantine testicles to the original statue.\nThe Sicilian name u Liotru is a phonetic change of Heliodorus, a nobleman who, after trying without success to become bishop of the city, became a sorcerer and was therefore condemned to the stake. Legend has it that Heliodorus himself was the sculptor of the lava elephant and that he used to magically ride it in his fantastic travels from Catania to Constantinople. Another legend has it that Heliodorus was able to transform himself into an elephant.\nThe presence of an elephant in the millenary history of Catania is surely connected to both zooarcheology and popular creeds. In fact, the prehistoric fauna of Sicily from the Upper Paleolithic, included dwarf elephants. Paleontologist Othenio Abel suggested that the presence of dwarf elephants in Sicily may be the origin of the legend of the Cyclops. Ancient Greeks, after finding the skulls of dwarf elephants, about twice the size of a human skull, with a large central nasal cavity (mistaken for a large single eye-socket) supposed that they were skulls of giants with a single eye.\nThe Catanian Museum of Mineralogy, Paleontology and Vulcanology holds the integral unburied skeleton of an Elephas falconeri in an excellent state of conservation. The first inhabitants of Etna  molded such lavic artifact to idolize the mythical proboscidian.\n\n\n=== Classical buildings ===\nThe city has been buried by lava a total of seventeen times in recorded history, and in layers under the present day city are the Roman city that preceded it, and the Greek city before that. Many of the ancient monuments of the Roman city have been destroyed by the numerous seisms. Currently, different ancient remains can be seen and visited in the city-centre, as part of an archaeological park (Parco Archeologico Greco-Romano di Catania).\n\nAncient edifices include:\n\nGreek-Roman Theatre of Catania (2nd century)\nOdeon (3rd century). It could house up to 1500 spectators\nAmphitheatre\nGreek Acropolis of Montevergine\nRoman Aqueduct\nRoman Forum\nRoman broken arcades\nChristian basilicas, hypogea, burial monuments and Catacombs\nRoman Colonnade\n\n\n=== Roman thermal structures ===\nAchillean Baths\nTerme dell\u2019Indirizzo\nTerme di Santa Maria Odigitria\nTerme della Rotonda\nBaths of the Four Quoins\nTerme di Palazzo Asmundo\nTerme del Palazzo dell\u2019Universit\u00e0\nTerme di Casa Gagliano\nTerme della Chiesa di Sant'Antonio Abate\n\n\n=== Baroque and historical churches ===\n\nThe Baroque city centre of Catania is a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nThe Cathedral (1070\u20131093, rebuilt after the 1693 earthquake)\nSaint Agatha Abbey (1620)\nSaint Placidus (1769)\nChurch of San Giuseppe al Duomo\nChurch of Santissimo Sacramento al Duomo\nChurch of San Martino dei Bianchi\nChurch of Sant'Agata la Vetere (254)\nSaint Agatha by the Furnace or Saint Blaise (1098, rebuilt in 1700)\nChurch of the Saint Jail or Saint Agatha at the Jail (Santo Carcere or Sant'Agata al Carcere) (1760).

Ognina is the maritime quarter and the main fishing pole of Catania. Many bareboats and umpteen smacks gather and crowd here all year round. In its close vicinities there is a cylindric tower, known as Saint Mary's Tower (Torre Santa Maria), which was restructured in the 16th century to prevent the frequent plunders of the Saracen pirates. The church is the result of the gradual modification of the Greek Temple Athena Longatis or Parthenos Longatis that existed on the steep reef. This cult was imported from a Boeotian region of Greece called Longas from where the first Hellenic settlers of this borough probably came. After the earthquake of 1693 it was rebuilt on the same place but with a different orientation.\nOur Lady of Montserrat (1755)\nChurch of  Santa Maria della Salute\nSaint Mary of La Salette\nChurch of Santa Maria della Mercede\nChurch of Santa Caterina al Rinazzo\nOur Lady of Concordia\nChurch of Santa Maria della Guardia\nOur Lady of Consolation\nChurch of Santissimo Crocifisso Maiorana\nCrucifix of Miracles\nCrucifix of Good Death\nOur Lady of La Mecca\nSaint Cajetan at the Marina\nMost Holy Redeemer\nSaint Francis of Paola\nChurch of the Divina Maternit\u00e0\nChapel of Mary Auxiliatrix\nChapel of the Sacred Heart of Jesus\nChurch of the Sacro Cuore al Fortino (1898)\nSaints George and Denis\nChurch of the Sacred Heart of the Capuchins\nSaint Christopher\nSaints Cosmas and Damian\nChurch of Santa Maria del Soccorso or Santa Maria della Palma\nSaint Vitus\nChurch of the Santi Angeli Custodi\nChurch of the Santissimo Salvatore\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nUrsino Castle, built by emperor Frederick II in the 13th century.\nPalace of the Elephants, designed by Giovan Battista Vaccarini.

The city is famous for its mainly petrochemical industry, and the extraction of sulphur. In the year 2000, according to Census, Catania was the 14th richest city in Italy, with a GDP of US$6.6 billion (\u20ac6.304 billion), which was 0.54% of the Italian GDP, a GDP per capita of US$21,000 (\u20ac20,100) and an average GDP per employee of US$69,000 (\u20ac66,100).In the late-19th century and early-20th century, Catania began to be heavily industrialised, with its several factories and chimneys, often to the extant that it was referred to as Southern Italy's \"Manchester\". The economy of Catania suffered heavily from the bad effects of World War I, and was marked by an economic crisis and recession that culminated in the 1920s. Since then, the city lost its industrial and entrepreneurial importance. In the 1930s, Catania remained a small fishing town with derelict and disused industries. However, after the destruction of World War II, Catania's economy began to re-grow in the late-1950s and early-1960s. As a matter of fact, the city's economic growth was so rapid and dynamic that it was often nicknamed the \"Milan of the South\", or in Italian \"Milano del Sud\". This rapid economic growth prompted a great number of Sicilians living in the more rural areas, or smaller towns such as Enna, Ragusa and Caltanissetta, to move to the city to seek new jobs.\nToday, Catania, despite several problems, has one of the most dynamic economies in the whole of Southern Italy. It still has a strong industrial and agricultural sector, and a fast-growing tourist industry, with many international visitors coming to visit the city's main sights and the nearby Etna volcano. It contains the headquarters or important offices of companies such as STMicroelectronics, and also several chemical and pharmaceutical businesses. There have been several new business developments to further boost Catania's economy, including the construction of Etnapolis, a big shopping mall designed by Massimiliano Fuksas, the same architect who designed the FieraMilano industrial fair in Milan, or the Etna Valley, where several high-tech offices are located.\nTourism is a fast-growing industry in Catania. Lately the administration and private companies have made several investments in the hospitality industry in order to make tourism a competitive sector in the Metropolitan City. Etnaland, a big amusement and water park located in Belpasso, in the Metropolitan area of Catania, 12 kilometers (7 miles) from the city center, is the largest in Southern Italy and attracts thousands of tourists, not only from Sicily, but also from the rest of Italy: according to Tripadvisor (2018) it is the third water park in Europe.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Catania dates back to 1434 and it is the oldest university in Sicily. Its academic nicknames are: Siculorum Gymnasium and Siciliae Studium Generale. Nowadays it hosts 12 faculties and over 62,000 students, and it offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.\nCatania hosts the Scuola Superiore, an academic institution linked to the University of Catania, aimed at the excellence in education. The Scuola Superiore di Catania also offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.Apart from the University and the Scuola Superiore Catania is base of the prestigious Istituto Musicale Vincenzo Bellini an advanced institute of musical studies (Conservatory) and the Accademia di Belle Arti an advanced institute of artistic studies. Both institutions offer programs of university level for musical and artistic education.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe opera composer Vincenzo Bellini was born in Catania, and a museum exists at his birthplace.\nThe Teatro Massimo \"Vincenzo Bellini\", which opened in 1890, is named after the composer. The opera house presents a variety of operas through a season, which run from December to May, many of which are the work of Bellini.\nGiovanni Verga was born in Catania in 1840. He became the greatest writer of Verismo, an Italian literary movement akin to Naturalism. His novels portray life among the lower levels of Sicilian society, such as fishermen and stonemasons, and were written in a mixture of both literary language and local dialect. Francesco Longo Mancini was a painter known for paintings of nudes who was born in Catania in 1880.\n\nThe city's patron saint is Saint Agatha, who is celebrated with a religious pageantry, the Festival of Saint Agatha, on February 5 every year.\nThe city is base of the newspaper La Sicilia and of the TV-channel Antenna Sicilia also known as Sicilia Channel. Several others local television channels and free-press magazines have their headquarters in Catania.\nThe city is home to the Catania Jazz Festival, which typically runs for several winter months with concerts in different locations.\nIn the late 1980s and during the 1990s Catania had a sparkling and unique popular music scene. Indie pop and indie rock bands, local radio station and dynamic independent music record labels sprung. As a result, in those years the city experienced a vital and effervescent cultural period. Artists like Carmen Consoli and Mario Venuti and internationally known indie rock bands like Uzeda came out of this cultural milieu.\nThe city is the home of Amatori Catania rugby union team, Calcio Catania football team and Orizzonte Catania, the latter being a women's water polo club, winning eight European Champions Cup titles from 1994 to 2008. Noted Italian basketball coach Ettore Messina is a native of Catania. The city also hosted the first ever qualification tournament for the Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1992, and the associated Etna Cup, which was won by the host Sicily team. In addition, the Catania Elephants are currently members of the Italian Football League. Catania also hosted the 2011 FIE Fencing World Championships.\n\n\n== Food and cuisine ==\n\nFood is an important part of Catania's culture and way of life. Local cuisine emphasizes several traits of Sicilian one, whilst developing some of its own.\nStreet food is one of the best ways to experience traditional dishes. Arancini are perhaps the city's most iconic one: they are stuffed rice balls coated in bread-crumbs and deep fried; in Catania, they are shaped like a cone to remind of Mount Etna. Typical specialties from the city include cipollina (puff pastry with onion, tomato and prosciutto filling), bolognese (a small pizza topped with tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto and boiled egg and covered in puff pastry), crispelle (deep fried dough balls with ricotta or anchovies filling.)\nDuring street-fairs and religious festivals, street stalls sell calia e simenza (toasted chickpeas and pumpkin seeds). Typical from old street markets are sangeli (cooked pork blood), quarumi (pork tripe), zuzzu (pork jelly), mauru (edible seaweed), and raw seafood. Horse meat is very traditional and it is sold in shops called arrusti e mancia (\"roast it and eat it\"), which roast the meat in streetside barbecues.Apart from street food, typical dishes from Catania are: pasta alla Norma (pasta with fried eggplant, tomato sauce and ricotta salata cheese), named after the namesake opera by Vincenzo Bellini; pasta cco niuru (pasta in cuttlefish ink), maccu (fava beans pur\u00e9e), bastaddi affucati or brocculi affucati (stewed cauliflower or broccoli), caponata (saut\u00e9ed vegetables) and scacciata (a pie filled with tuma cheese) which is traditional during Christmastime.Catania is also famous for its pasticceria (pastries and cakes). Pastries vary according to season and to seasonal events: during the Festival of Saint Agatha, patron saint of the city, there are the cassatelle (small cassatas) and olivette (olive shaped almond paste). In Easter, there are aceddi ccu l\u2019ovu (boiled eggs covered in biscuit). In summer there is granita. During the Festa dei morti (traditional celebrations in All Souls' Day) there are biscuits called ossa di mortu, rame di Napoli and nsuddi.\nDrink kiosks are everywhere in town and serve soft drinks. Traditional soft drinks are made mixing fruit syrups with soda and other flavors such as anisette. They are thirst-killer and they are very popular with the locals and the tourists.\nLocal products include blood oranges, pistachios from Bronte, extra-virgin olive oil, cactus fruit, cherries, grapes from Mazzarrone, strawberries from Maletto, mushrooms, honey and wine.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nCatania has a commercial seaport (Catania seaport), an international airport (Catania Fontanarossa), a central railway station (Catania Centrale) and it is a main node of the Sicilian motorway system.\nThe motorways serving Catania are the A18 Messina-Catania and the A19 Palermo-Catania; extensions of the A18 going from Catania to Syracuse and to Gela are currently under construction.\nThe Circumetnea is a narrow-gauge railway that runs for 110 km (68 mi) from Catania round the base of Mount Etna. It attains the height of 976 m (3,202.10 ft) above sea level before descending to rejoin the coast at Giarre-Riposto to the North.\nIn the late 1990s the first line of an underground railway (Metropolitana di Catania) was built. The underground service started in 1999 and it is currently active on a route of 8.8 km (5.5 mi), from the station Nesima (West of town), passing through the stations of San Nullo, Cibali (still under construction), Milo, Borgo, Giuffrida, Italia, Galatea, Giovanni XXIII, to Stesicoro. These two stations, bringing Catania Underground in the city centre, have opened on 20 December 2016. First line is planned to extend from the satellite city of Patern\u00f2 to Fontanarossa Airport.\n\n\n=== Catania Public Transportation Statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Catania, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 56 min. 13% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 23 min, while 46% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.7 km, while 3% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nAaron ben Gershon abu al-Rabi, 15th century rabbi\nOriana Bandiera (1971\u2013), economist and academic\nPippo Baudo (1936-), TV presenter\nFranco Battiato (1945-), singer-songwriter, composer, filmmaker\nGianni Bella (1947-), singer-songwriter\nMarcella Bella (1952-), singer\nVincenzo Bellini (1801\u20131835), composer\nOrnella Bertorotta (1967-) politician\nGiuseppa Bolognara Calcagno (1826\u20131884), freedom fighter of the Risorgimento\nVitaliano Brancati (1907\u20131954), writer\nLuigi Capuana (1839\u20131915), writer\nCharondas (6th c.

In 1823, Light had fondly written of Catania: \"The two principal streets cross each other at right angles in the square in the direction of north and south and east and west. They are wide and spacious and about a mile [1.6 km] long\". This became the basis for his plan of Adelaide.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAmico, Vito Maria (1740).

          "We are American tourists and lovers of history that thoroughly enjoyed this museum. Several of us had relatives that were WWII soldiers and one of us had an uncle that was part of the invasion in 1943. The admission price is a bargain!",
          "A small museum which really packs in a historical display and story of the Allied landings on Sicily. The photo exhibit was pretty incredible, too.",
          "It wasn\u2019t on top of our list of things to do in Catania but thought we would stop by after a visit to the port (not worthwhile btw). It was the best decision ever. The entire scene was surreal. An old factory enhanced with steal and concrete with no one around (mind you this was",
          "It was interesting to see the local view of WWI in Sicily. There is a simulated bomb shelter and a bunker. The amazing photos and displays are well explained in Italian and English.",
          "The theme of the Allied landings is very well explained and presented, not only from a military point of view but also the negative impact on the civilian population. I feel that better explanations in other languages would enhance the visitor experience.",
          "Several of us from a US tour group visited this well organized museum which highlighted Operation Husky (i.e.,the allied invasion of Sicily). There were well done models of the invasion and photographs of the devastation and poverty stricken population who suffered by the war. I",
          "The museum is incredibly well done and well worth a visit. It is structured really well and has plenty to see.",
          "It\u2019s a bit of a walk out of town and actually the entrance is quite hard to find but we thought it was well worth it A lot of the descriptions are in Italian only but we still found it very informative and thought provoking - over 14500 men killed in around 30 days The Phil",
          "We went to this highly-recommended museum at 3:30 to be greeted with a \"closed\" sign and nobody to explain why. The sign on the door says there are tours every 30 min, ending at 15:00. So it is highly misleading to say it is open to 17:00. Nowhere is their entrance policy",
          "Visited on the 17th of August, 2019. For those in Catania and who have a particular interest in history, this is an absolute must-visit. While many of the displays are in Italian (obviously), if you have a decent knowledge of Operation Husky then you can understand and",
          "Stumbled upon your museum after getting lost in 31C heat less than 10 minutes after 3:00 and we were turned away. We were hoping to learn about the Sicilian version of events of 1943 but even though we pleaded we were not admitted. The museum was still open. I'm sad,",
          "This was a very dated and poorly done museum It does have revisionist history slanted to the Italian point of view Skip this one",
          "I am shocked this museum gets such a high score on TripAdvisor. It is true that it is impressive when compared with the very-little one has to do in Catania, but it is also appalling to anyone who does not like Fascism or Nazis or who has a tiny understanding of history.",
          "The welcome could have been warmer and friendlier but it got better. Started with a short film about the history of Italy's part in the war then we were taken to the mock up Square followed by the air raid shelter, that was a true experience and I can now appreciate what my",

          "This museum was the first site we visited in Catania where we concluded our 2 week Rick Steves tour of the island which started in Palermo. Friends had visited it & highly recommended it. However, if our RS tour guide had not explained in detail the exhibits which we viewed on",
          "Yes, the museum is largely in Italian, but the descriptions on the first floor are all available in English as well. If you really want to read everything, get Google Translate on your phone and you'll be able to work it out. I could not understand the guide in the very first",

          "A must see in Catania. The thought and effort put in this museum was amazing. It was someone's labor of love. I had no idea what to expect but it exceeded everything. From the air raid shelter simulation to the reading on lost soldiers it was fabulous. It was one of the top 3",
          "Too bad that more people don't know about this fantastic experience. Even the locals are unaware. Every hotel in Catania and the surrounding area should have a brochure available for tourists.",
          "We had no expectations when we entered the museum, but we were more than surprised and impressed with the amount of careful thought and planning that went into the whole experience. It will take you a half day if you truly want to slow down and experience this slice of World",

          "This was a really interesting museum showing the Sicilian perspective of World War II, maybe the only such museum in the world. In addition to maps, videos, uniforms, weapons, there is a recreation of a sicilian town square before and after a bombing raid, life size wax figures",

          "This is an excellent war museum. It is very cheap to enter. The staff are engaging. I was very surprised that this attraction does not really rate a mention when googling things to do in Catania. You commence by watching an overview of WW2. You are then taken by staff to a",
          "I have seen some WW2 museums, but I was surprised with this one. It's quite big and rich in content. It's oriented mostly about operation Husky, allied landings in Sicilly in 1943. Many original uniforms and military gear, but also civilian themes. I was happy to see lot of",
          "The museum is off the beaten track, but worth the venture. It looked like it was closed when we arrived, but the staff welcomed us in and the cost was only 4 Euro each! And it just got better and better, one of the better war mueseum I have been to. The first section was",
          "This a very interesting museum if your are interested in miltary history, particularly WW2 history. The importance of the allied invasion of Sicily cannot be understated by historians and the people of Sicily alike. This is a great museum documenting the details of the allies",
          "Nicely presented. Yes, there are English explanations. You just have to look for them. THere is a new Pavillion - The Phil Stern Pavillion . Famous Hollywood photographer Phil Stern was a US Army photographer with Darby\u2019s Rangers and participated in the invasion n 1943.",
          "This museum has interesting strategies in exhibition making. The curatorial design was professional and absorbing for the viewer. There is a re-creation of a 1940s street and an immersive experience in a bomb shelter using lighting, sound and movement.",
          "It\u2019s a amazing and good museum to slowly visit.you will know about ww2 the history in Sicily. the Citizen to encounter the bomb,the house fall down by destroy and terrible experience.can see many things in there. It\u2019s good choice to go.",
          "This museum, which focuses exclusively on Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, is valuable to gain an Italian perspective on the invasion. Most of the lager panels are in Italian but there are English translations and subtitles in the films. The visit takes",
          "This museum is really off the beaten path. Luckily we were steered here by some locals who knew we were interested in WWII history. The battles in Sicily during the Allied invasion were covered exceedingly well so we came away with a much better understanding of what took",
          "Excellent overview if Allied invasion of Sicily. A long walk from cruise port so take a 15 euro taxi. Very well done exhibit that covers all aspects of the Sicilian campaign. The air raid shelter dramatization was unique-you hear the siren, listen to actual panicky residents",
          "A little hidden away in an old industrial building, but very close to train and bus stations in Catania. It concerns the landing of UK, US troops in Sicily in 1943 in their fight against the Italians and the Germans. The visit starts with a short film and even if you know about",
          "If you can read Italian it might be informative and worth a visit (as long as you don't need to use the restrooms), otherwise I'd skip it. We arrived during opening hours but the sign on the door said 'closed'. After a while someone came out and said they were open. What's",
          "A short walk from the centre this is well put together history of the allied landings in 1943. It\u2019s cheap to enter- 4 euros a person and offers a good mix of the history of war from the perspective of both civilians and soldiers- at the end there is a high quality photo montage",
          "This museum has it all. It is interactive, informative and around every corner there is something surprising and of interest. Such care and attention to detail is rare. We spent over three hours. We have been around the world many times and this stands out as a secret little",
          "Tickets for the museum are very cheap and it's really worth it. A short walking distance from the city centre and 5 minutes from the train station, the premises also host the Cinema museum (another recommended visit). Very well set up, the bomb shelter experience is quite",

          "a good choice to spend like 2h indoors on a rainy day. interesting collection of the war time of 1943 in Cicily",
          "This was an amazing museum that I don't think many people take advantage of. The tour of the Museum starts with a short film about the events leading up to the Allied Landing. The next part of the museum is a recreation of a street in Sicily and also a simulated bomb shelter",
          "We spent a very enjoyable two hours at this museum. The staff were friendly and helpful. We watched a film about the lead up to The Allied invasion of Sicily and experienced an air raid in a shelter in Catania . The following exhibits were well displayed , extensive and gave an",
          "A great museum. One first sees a short film about the events of the mid 1930s to 1942, for some background (if really needed) on the Allied invasion of Sicily. We then see and walk through a reconstructed town square in a typical Sicilian village before WWII. We then go into",
          "The day we visited the museum, the bulk of the staff were on strike in solidarity due to salary issues for the rest of the staff. Consequently, I'm not sure we had the entire experience. Having said that, this starts off as an intense experience. You are in a typical",
          "This well laid out World War II museum is worth a visit. It gives immediacy to the Sicilian experience during the war. The Allied invasion is well-described. It\u2019s treatment of both sides is relatively evenhanded.",
          "We toured this museum as part of a tour and found this museum to be a great gem in Sicily. This museum rivals ones in the states and is dedicated to the invasion of Sicily by the Allied forces who liberated Sicily from the Germans. We spent 4 hours and could have spent an entire",
          "We visited this museum while staying in Sicily and found it an amazing experience. On entry, there was an air raid shelter with very authentic \"air raid\", good depiction of the horrors of war for all involved, including my late father in law! Good displays of British, American,",
          "Tour guides talk only about how Italy did nothing wrong and didn\u2019t understand shooting parachutist in the air was wrong. They didn\u2019t understand the allies were there to help. Killing 600 Canadians also not there fault. A picture of an officer briefing troops prior to an airborne",
          "They really have a good collection of WW2 items and the air raid simulator part was very interesting as well. We spent quite a bit of time there. They give military discounts but the price was reasonable regardless. At the end they have a perpetual screen and reading of the",
          "wonderful experience, a walkthrough world war II history, a continuation of DLH War Museum in Malta, where the OPERATION HUSKY actually began. A must for everyone, especially for WWII memorabilia & history. cheap entrance fee. excellent!",

          "My wife and I visited the museum today around 2:30pm., at the end of a 2 week tour around the Island of Sicily. We qualified for the reduced admission as we were over 65 years of age and after 14 days of museums and archeology sites visited this was the best. We drove around the",

          "I had an hour to kill while waiting for the train, I ended up rushing around the Museum. Now I will have to come back to Catania. The Museum is very good it gives some impression of what life was like coming up to the Allied landings. If you are a military buff you will really",
          "Gem of a museum. Reconstructed village, maps, great collection of artifacts, including uniforms. Lots of vintage footage. Agree that this is well worth a couple hours of your time.",
          "We visited the museum at 10.30am l think we were lucky as we had a guide to ourselves who spoke passable English. We started with a film of documentary quality in Italian with English subtitles . We then were shown a reconstructed village square before and after the war. There",
          "The people at our B&B did not know about this museum, but kindly found the details for us - so it is not well advertised. I especially wanted to visit here as my father fought in Italy during WWII, but never spoke about it before he died at 59. To me it was a place where I could",
          "This museum is well worth a visit even if slightly out of the centre of town. You can walk there. The museum is very interactive and informative. It provides a novel journey through the 1943 allied capture of the island. Fantastic especially for children.",
          "Good museum dedicated to WWII on the Sicily and operation Husky. One of the highlights is perhaps simulation of the bomb raid in the shelter. Majority of the museum comprises of wartime items such as weapons, uniforms etc and several pieces of machinery e.g. Jumo 211 engine from",
          "This museum gives an extensive view on the Allied invasion of Sicily. It shows the war from both sides. They have photos, guns, diorama's, wax figures and other memorabilia. Entrance costs \u20ac4. The walk through the museum starts with a recreated Sicilian square, showing typical",
          "The four stars are for the missing English translations for most information boards. The documentation is very accurate and the bomb shelter simulation is impressive. For those who know the details of operation Husky or would like to know more this museum is a must. Opening",
          "A truely eye opening representation of how a few oppresive leaders can turn human ingenuity against itself and squander lives and technical advancement to cause individuals to destroy one another. In the end we're all human under the uniforms. Now walking freely around Catania",
          "Great museum that has a fine collection of uniforms and weapons from the period. Also has recreated the 'Feel' of the period with replica buildings with original contents. Glad I came here to see this important museum about the Allies invasion of Sicily.",
          "As others have noted, this museum is best experienced with a guide who speaks your native language. While it includes much of the typical World War II memorabilia, it also strives to illustrate the impact of the Allied invasion of Sicily on the average resident. Well worth a",
          "If you are an English speaker, this museum is best seen with a guide. It strives to portray what it meant and felt like to be in Sicily from the outbreak of WWII, through to the 1943 Allied invasion -- Operation Husky. The simulated bomb shelter experience is a visceral, though",
          "This museum tells the many World War II stories involving the people, politics and fighting in Sicily. There are many displays of the various uniforms worn and equipment used during WW II. Could have used a few more English translations on some of the displays, but still easy",
          "A must-see in Catania - best with a local guide. Highlights are the realistic bomb-shelter and the final Memorial to the Fallen - of all countries.",
          "This was an interesting side trip about the ravages of war on the island of Sicily. Everything was in Italian so I couldn't understand any of the commentaries but it was easy to figure out, war is disastrous on local communities.",
          "Well displayed story of Italy during WWII with touch of American, German and Canadian history. People who work there do not speak English, but they were very helpful and did try to explain the displayed items. Sutable for kids older then 10. Tickets are cheap, around 1-2 Euros.",
          "Extensive. Does a good job, with elaborate displays, of portraying what it was like to live through this time. Very very little English. In my view, you need a guide to understand the museum. We had a guide for 2 hours which made a huge difference. You need to hire a local",
          "I took my students to this museum after we had studied WWII in Italy. It has interesting, interactive exhibits and my students enjoyed it (particularly the simulation of a bomb shelter). It is good at giving an Italian perspective on WWII and detailing how Allied troops landed",
          "Well done and moving review of what the citizenry lived through in Sicily when in the crosshairs of the Axis countries and the Allied countries. As real as you can get, with a bomb shelter, maps, pictures and a wax museum of the noted leaders of the period. I do not want to",
          "Great place to visit if you are interested in WW2 period. It is amazing the memorabilia inside the museum and you spend easily 1 hour living the last war in Europe in the deep south.",
          "This museum is very well done. Every aspect of WWII in Sicily is covered: arms, battles, uniforms, key figures, intelligence ruses, et al. You can even experience what it was like to hide in a bomb shelter during an air raid. It also brought home how the Sicilian people were",
          "At first you think that perhaps you have gone to an amusement park. You walk through a typical Sicilian square at the time of the invasion and then enter a bomb shelter and sit down while sound and motion effects recreate some of the feeling of the bombing. Our guide narrated",
          "Friendly and informative. Good displays to inform about the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943. We went at the end of a 4 day battlefield tour - it would probably have been better at the start for context setting. I would have liked a small shop to buy further books etc for",
          "We really enjoyed this museum. It was very well laid out in a way that brought the invasion to life with a lot of original footage and genuine artefacts. My daughter (8) particularly liked the air raid simulation- very effective and shocking. There was quite a lot of written",
          "Sicily took one of the first blows when the Allied Forces invaded Italy to overpower Mussolini and the Axis powers. Visitors start out in a bomb shelter to make it the war real. I'm not a detail person on war history but I thought the museum made it quite clear on what",
          "If you are looking at Sicily from the perspective of a Battlefield Tour than should be where you start. Excellent maps and information in general. However, the MUST have translations of the story boards in English for the Anglo Saxons that visit. We did have an English speaking",
          "It was one of the less interesting museums I've been into, but nevertheless learned a bit from it. As highlights, they have a short simulation of an anti-bomb shelter, and a nice depiction of the buildings and indoors of the era. If you understand no Italian, it will probably be",
          "Loved it. Great display and very good state of conservation. It would have been great to have more english translation but my boys seems to know more about guns and ware far than me!",
          "This museum is a little difficult to find, but is well worth the search. The displays show the course of the Allied Landings in Sicily, from several aspects: the lives of the local population; the experiences of the troops taking part and the aftermath of the invasion. There is",
          "Located in an industrial building this museum is one of best I have visited dealing with World War II. The exhibits and wax statues are all realistic and very well done. This museum has a very realistic feel. Upon entering you are in an actual Sicilian village square with",
          "I'd just read an historical novel describing Operation Husky in WW2. The museum provided tremendous and complementary contextual information for me- especially visually as the photos and physical exhibits were great. More English interpretation would be highly valuable-",
          "Lively interactive museum & displays explaining what happened in those 4 crucial months of 1943 when the Allies landed in Sicily in WWII. You don't have to be a history buff to enjoy this interesting & educational museum. Highly recommended.",
          "Very moving display dedicated to the allied landings in 1943, the precursor of teh landings in Normandy and the start of the liberation of Europe. The museum is in Italian and English and does an excellent job of explaining the history. Well worth a visit.",
          "This is a must-see. Everything well explained and displayed. Very sad to see how much of Siclly was destroyed.",
          "This extremely interesting take on WWII as seen thru the eyes of the Sicilian people is fascinating. Very creatively portrayed with displays, recreated buildings of how a small town square looked before the Allied bombings and how it looked after the bombings is amazing as you",
          "We took the metro one stop and visited the Sicily 1943 Museum in its interesting industrial building. First there is an excellent film about the Second World War and Italy e then you are guided through a reconstruction of a Sicilian village- into a bomb sj helter where the",
          "I had mixed feelings about this museum. It vividly conveys the suffering of the Sicilian people during the 1943 invasion. In addition to a simulated bomb shelter experience, newsreel footage, and photographs, the museum has many items from daily life (newspapers, fascist",
          "Housed in a redeveloped factory, this great value museum gives the Italian perspective on the invasion of Sicily in 1943. It is cleverly laid out with many aspects explored and a good range of artefacts. Not everything has English translations but I found one could pick up most",
          "the museum is very well done.its a \"peace\" museum but for my taste its too much on war and uniforms.I could not stay for long. my husband loved it, maybe its a boys thing.it its interesting.",
          "This museum tells the story of the Allied invasion of Sicily in the summer of 1943. I am already a history buff, but this museum tells the story well and in a slightly different format as well as having some interesting experiences. The start is a video of Italy and its version",
          "A very good summary of the campaign in Sicily in 1943. A particularly good start with a lovely evocation of a square in Catania of that time. The museum then flows nicely with maps, uniforms and weapons all well displayed. A moving and appropriate conclusion. Well worth a visit.",
          "The Museum was very quiet but contained alot of authentic artefacts. It is very well planned out and would require 2/3 hours to visit. There is even a simulated wartime shelter. Negatives: It shuts at 1600 so make sure taht if you plan to visit in the afternoon, do so before",
          "This museum gave a well rounded interesting history of the events leading up to the landing in Sicily. The introductory film and most of the exhibit labels had subtitles in English. The interactive portions really hit home. My 9 year was a little surprised but not scared by",
          "Once I had found the museum I was glad I persevered. After a very good welcome I was taken on a tour by a guide with very good English who took me into the first set and the very realistic air raid. The rest of the museum was well worth the visit and I would add it to any",
          "This is a hidden gem. I have spent about 2hrs in the exhibition. Very modern, well designed and truly capturing the story of the Sicily invasion of 1943. English explanations are few though. But luckily we have Google Translate nowadays. The museum is located within an old",
          "This is an excellent way to get an understanding of the battle fro Sicily in WW2. The opening part of the museum brings to life through an interactive display what it would have been like to have been in a bomb-shelter during an Allied raid. The museum has a large number of",
          "This new Museum in the new Cultural Quarter,is quite amazing. I thought that I knew a lot about this historical period,but this museum opened my eyes to some rather uncomfortable truths about the meaning of the word \"Liberation\"",
          "We went to Catania specifically to visit this museum. It was terrific. Fascinating. Not to be missed. Give yourself a couple of hours at least. So interesting to see how Sicily partook in the Ally landings in WW11.",
          "Very interactive, lively and interesting museum. Raises your empathy and shows Sicily's position during the war. Mostly Italian, but also enough English descriptions available.",
          "The other reviewers are not exagerating. This place is impossible to find and if you do find it, chances are it will be closed. I spent an hour trying to find it. I also found that not even Catanian's know where it is. Google maps will take you to the wrong location. HERE IS",
          "A little tricky to find but thanks to other posters we found it. The signs are quite clear. A lot of thought went into this exhibit. It is well laid out and a must for history and WW2 buffs. Allow about 1.5 hours. I won't post pictures so as not not to spoil the surprise. There",
          "Others have said that it's very difficult to find. That is because no one knows where it is. I asked 4 bus drivers ( I am fluent in Italian) Actually, it was within sight of the main bus and Train terminals. (See my pic. # 5, Location) With the Central Train station at your",
          "If you have an interest in WWII and its effect on the people of Sicily, this museum is excellent. Not everything is translated into English, but even if you don't speak Italian, you will understand the majority of the well-thought-out and presented displays. I came away with a",
          "This museum is dedicated to peace. It does a good job of showing the effects of the Allied invasion of Sicily in the summer of 1943 on the lives of the Sicilians. The simulated air raid in a bomb shelter is very moving. A good history lesson for young and old.",
          "Make sure you have exact details on how to get here as the signage is almost non-existent - spent a while trying to find the place. The time wasted however was well worth it. Besides the usual displays one would expect there are 'experiential' exhibitions such as the air raid",

          "One of the best 'interactive' museums I've been to. The air raid shelter experience was particularly realistic. Sicily has a difficult history from 1943. It was ruled by Mussolini's Fascists; bombed to smithereens in places by the American's; made Hitler angry by not stopping",
          "A splendid and moving exhibition,, we sought this out having read about it and being interested in the history of Sicily.. we walked from old Catania and found it after a few wrong turns... the museum is a wonderful place.. with a representaton of a pre war typical Sicilian",
          "Just ten minutes walk from Catania centre you can experience feelings of those in bomb shelter during air raid. The tour starts with guide in an ordinary Sicilian square of 1940s. In few minutes you find yourself in bomb shelter. Just sit down, lean on wall (!) and enjoy engine",

          "The bomb shelter experience is something which will remain in our memories as it was very moving and realistic. This was a small taste of what our ancestors must have been through during WW2. The rest of the museum is very well planned and the highlights for me were the numerous",
          "Deserted but surprisingly interesting museum Lots of really perfect wax dummies of war leaders a really good bombing 'experience' where the earth really does move for you. Also a novel moving Italian machine gunner in a bunker. All in all well worth a visit if you are in the",
          "It's so good, a bit of a walk from the town centre (20 minutes) but well worth it. The bunker is the best bit and it's interesting even more as it has English notes on the side of the attractions too. The staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and try to help in",
          "A very well presented museum so far as in there was quite a bit there. The first area that you went in to was a bomb shelter which was really quite good however did feel a bit silly when the woman guide stood up and clapped her hands afterwards before disappearing off. We did",

          "This is an informative museum to visit with the added attraction of having a bomb simulation and being in a bomb shelter. The museum is within the \"Le Ciminiere\" complex, where there is also a cinema museum.",
          "We read this was the top attraction in Catania so had to visit it. Directions were a bit misleading, but if you use the railway station as a compass point & head north towards the brick chimneys you will find a conference centre where the museum is situated, along with a museum",
          "To echo previous reviews, this is a fascinating museum with some great exhibits but it's a shame that it doesn't provide more to cater for English speaking guests. The introduction was done through mime but the simulated air raid was really well staged and very engaging. The",
          "Nothing to dislike. The best military museum for WWII I have visited in Europe and the United States.",

          "Really good. I reccomend it! The guide was very helpfull and they speak english if you need it. It needs at least 2 hours if you want to see a bit of everything.",
          "Just one of the best museums I have visited. The first few minutes take you by surprise, and then the details contained in the museum give a fascinating insight into this part of WW2. My only slight criticism is that the English translations seemed to tail off the further",
          "A must-see for anyone interested in WWII. This excellent museum covers the Allied invasion of Sicily with huge sensitivity and thoughtfulness. The tour begins with a walk through a reconstructed Sicilian piazza and a simulated air raid complete with vibrating floor and howling",
          "If your are interested in the WW2 this museum is a must! It is well laid out with lots of exhibits. It starts off passing through re-constructed shop fronts in Catania, then you hear an air raid siren and you are directed into a shelter, you then go through a simulated air raid",
          "If you are visiting Catania, this museum and the cinema museum in the same complex are very worthwhile. Great value at 4 euros each. And the bar across the road is an excellent spot for lunch afterwards.",
          "The museum gives a very good impression of the landing of the allied forces in Sicily. The scene of the little town square you are walking through before and after the bombing and the bomb shelter experience are really well done.",
          "This museum is very well thought out. I really liked it. I am not giving 5 stars as there was a smell of smoke. It is very often visited by schoolchildren and I think they should take care of it.",
          "Museo dello Sbarco or Allied Landings in Sicily Museum. The museum is on Viale Africa, Catania. Turn right and it\u2019s about a 5 min walk up from the central railway station. I have to say that the museum is excellent and very well organised, its exhibits and excellent annotation",
          "Worth a visit! The village scene and the air raid shelter very impressive. After exiting there is a great restaurant at the other side of the road opposite le ciminiere.",
          "The move from imagined town, to bomb shelter, to bombed out town was very moving. There is a good variety of interesting information, uniforms, weapons, etc. My boys were engaged with what they saw and thought it worth it. There is a little bit of revisionist history on the part",
          "This is an interesting place which gives you some idea of what happened during the second world war. They have recreated Catanea during the war years quite well and if you are into uniforms you will be in heaven. The periodic translations helped but why didn't they get someone",
          "One of the better museums we have visited. Initially you are introduced to a village scene, both before and after an 'interactive' bombing raid. Lots of good dioramas from both sides of the conflict. Mostly Italian signs so have an e-translator handy.",
          "While the technology used in this museum is a bit dated, it contains a lot of interesting information about the allies invasion and liberation of Sicily. The initial exhibit allows visitors to experience live as a resident of a Sicilian villiage before, during, and after a",
          "Great setting, great start, and then once inside it is so much more than I ever expected it to be. Very clean, nicely organized, plenty of English along the way (which is helpful but not a requirement... it is not an English speaking country after all). Great displays.",
          "What place could be better to present the hell of war than in an old sulphur plant? This has been highly successful in Catania. In the old industrial building on three floors they have accomplished \u2013 not just an informative knowledge base \u2013 but also an instructive and learning",
          "We went to visit this museum in Catania on the advice of a friend. The museum telling the story of the second world war, and the landing of the Americani forces, from a local perspective. Interesting and very moving, and my young boys were kept entertained by the bombing",
          "Only found this place by chance. I bought a guide book in the railway station and it was mentioned in it. Not the easiest found but walk past the railway station towards the 3 chimneys and it is located there. It was a very revelant visit for us as we were in Cantania to see",
          "Located in a very interesting building (a renovated sulfur refinery), this museum is a detailed look at the allied invasion of Sicily in1943. There is a pamphlet in English to help non-Italians understand the initial space...a Sicilian piazza in 1943, then an air raid",
          "We decided to stop in Catania to visit this museum. It turned out to be a very interesting museum with great displays and artifacts. We started out in a replica of a village then sat in a bomb shelter and experienced a virtual bombing. we were happy to have stopped here and",

          "It's so important for us to never forget about the soldiers and the sacrifices they make. This museum is done very well, with a bunker that you sit in and listen to how frightening it must have been. Lots of video footage and photographs as well as uniforms worn by all sides. I",

          "As many of the other reviewers have mentioned, this museum can be difficult to find ... but well worth the effort. Looks small from the outside, but filled with many mementos from WW2. The entry film reviews the events up to the entry of Sicily into the war and then the",
          "The museum is a little hard to find as it is set back from the road in the middle of a larger complex - which is not as vibrant as tour guides suggest. It would be worth calling first to get the tour times, since they group folk together and start you together with a film",
          "Very informative, great photographs, enjoyed the interactive bit. Found the wax figures a bit creepy, but I guess that's the point. Helps appreciate what people go through during war. History lovers will enjoy it.",
          "This Museum looks like an old warehouse that has been fixed up, and it very well might be. Once inside, you will learn alot of history on the Hilter/Mussolini and American/British liaisons. I particularly liked the map that shows Hitler/mussolini being beat back by the",
          "At the ciminiere expo centre a short walk from central station, this museum has timed entrances on the half hour to allow for a bomb shelter simulation. If you have to wait a little there is a free exhibition of lovely old radios a couple of doors down. Also a film museum next",
          "Firstly to find it , get to the chimineas, the chimneys down by the port. The museum is hidden behind the glass building next to the Italian cinema museum. The museum is very informative, starting with a 15 minute film in Italian with subtitles. The bomb shelter experience",
          "Like many of the other reviews, i loved this museum, but it is a little hard to find. I walked out the front of Catania Central train station, straight ahead, then sort of veer right. There are a lot of chimneys, but it is the group of chimneys off to the right. The museum is in",

          "Great museum about WWII. Nice to do with children and situated in a large renovated building. Only 4\u20ac and lot of reductions. It will take you more than 2 hours but it's really worth the visit",

          "This spot has a history that goes back to a pre-history sacred spring. Phoenicians, Greeks and Romans, and finally modern Sicilians built on top of it. They seem to have run out of money for repairing it but it is worth a visit.",
          "This historical site was a complete surprise. Although a little old fashioned in some ways, it is also quite unique. Not only do you see the Roman theatre and lots of history about it, but you clearly see where the ruins have been intruded into by more recent, in the scheme",
          "So worth the walk around * the cost is minor... Wear walking shoes, and dress comfortable- there is a lot more walking then shown in this photo!",
          "A very interesting Roman site, it is also well maintained and contains enough to see for a while. Allow one hour to visit.",
          "This is an extremely impressive site to see within the city of Catania. While you expect to see these types of theaters outdoors, it is totally surprising to enter through a door and then you find the theater. It is surrounded by other buildings in the area which does not fail",
          "Very impressive ruins but ...closed in december, when we visit ... So we looked through the bars and only read explanations from the book about Catania.",
          "Beautiful museum and amphitheater. The beauty and charm is the fact that (not like many others ) is located very downtown in the middle of everything and very much surrounded by normal buildings. Very well maintained and pretty organized.",
          "Accessed from the busy Via Vittoria Emanuele II, this is a surprisingly large site which provides a peaceful spot to learn about and to reflect upon the city's fascinating history.",
          "Only a small part of the actual Roman amphitheater is visible, the rest is under the surrounding buildings. However, it's enough to understand the impressive scale of the antique people of Catania accomplishment. The entrance is free and the amphitheater is located in the city",
          "Middle of the city an excavated Greco Romano theatre. Remarkable. Just waiting for the rest of the surrounding buildings to fall apart so the rest can be dug up.",
          "We found this place fascinating - to be happy best we like roman and Grecian archeology so we were always going to like it We just find it amazing ho these places get built upon over time and then rediscovered Would recommend an hour there for sure",
          "I stumbled across this gem while roaming around in Catania. And I must say, this is perhaps the most surprising thing I found (also look for the Rotunda Bath). Highly recommended.",
          "We found the street called Roman Theatre street and you can see the back of the Odeon - we thought to start with that, that was all there was to see. There were no signs saying the entrance was on the other side but on the third time we walked past we saw someone inside and",
          "I visited here with my family on the 8th October. I\u2019ve always loved the history of Italy and especially the architecture so this was definitely a must do on my trip. It didn\u2019t disappoint either, be aware you could miss it when you walk by as it just looks like a regular",
          "You could easily miss the entrance unless you were looking for it. It is 6 euro per person to enter but it is well worth the money. You can walk around the back of the theatre and see how local buildings have been built onto this ancient structure, see the damage the last big",
          "I was surprised with how large this site is, there is actually a lot to explore. I was a little disappointed to see a 6 euro entrance fee, but in the end it really wasn't too bad of value. A non-descript entrance makes it a little difficult to find.",
          "This is a fantastic roman theatre complex with excavations that show how the city has been built in layers, one on top of the other, over the centuries It\u2019s oarticularly interesting to see how relatively modern houses have been built on the ruins and the displays explain this",
          "I agree with others, in that there could have been more information in English, as there is so much history here. But then again, any other city would have included a lot more details and better promoted the site, and also charged a lot more entrance fee!",
          "nice place to visit although the information was not good, no english and really didn't have any historic information so you couldn't understand what you are seeing",
          "This little treasure in the middle of Catania is very easy to miss. It\u2019s entrance is between two shop fronts. Once inside it is an enormous amphitheatre with lots of little side buildings to explore. It isn\u2019t wheelchair friendly and it is quite steep to navigate. However it\u2019s",
          "This site is worth visiting, it is such a surprise in the centre of Catania. However, it would have been better with a little more information on hand. It would have been even more helpful if there had been guided tours to bring it to life. Still, it is worth visiting when in",
          "This place is huge, lots of little side bits, and the main amphitheater is incredible - sit on one of the stone seats and think yourself back 2000 years. Well worth a visit.",
          "In the middle of Catania, surrounded by houses that were built right on top of it is this huge Greek amphitheater. Looks like a storefront from the street, so keep an eye out. They had no English guide brochures, so you might need your guidebook. It is well worth a stop to",
          "With an entrance you would almost walk past on Via Vittorio Emmanuel you can explore the old amphitheatre. Entrance fee is 12 euros and the leaflet guide is only in Italian. It is a nicely half preserved amphitheatre and you are free to walk around. At the end a small museum",
          "We literally walked all the way around the outside of this amphitheatre before we found the way in on Via Vittorio Emanuele - duh! Some parts have been rebuilt but there\u2019s still lots of the original structure to visit and they even use it for modern shows so it\u2019s good to know",
          "Found this by chance as it was only 200yds from my hotel on the Duomo Square on Via Emanuele I think. You wouldn't know its here as it just looks like a standard Catania building or house front. It was approx \u00a35 to enter and worth it. It's a Roman style amphitheatre and just",
          "Stumbled upon this while exploring Catania. We found this site so cool because it\u2019s literally tucked in the walls of the surrounding buildings. It\u2019s very old with some new renovations. While we were there they were setting up sounds systems so they must have shows there too!",

          "Impressive. Way more to see than at the Taormina theatre. The Taormina one has that incredible location/view, but this one in Catania has all the rest like the corridors. You can also visit the house that was built on top, luckily they kept it to show how things evolved with",

          "Not something you expect in the middle of a street, but this theatre is definitely worth visiting, if just for its location. Also the water adds an extra element, and it is not too crowded (at least not when we were there), which made it a great place to stop and sit and relax.",
          "It's not easy to find this Greek/Roman theatre - the entrance is well hidden in a building. You cannot see the theatre itself from the street, therefore the view is more striking when you enter.",
          "Catania is an odd place in a way - largely rebuilt during the baroque period in the 17th-18th centuries, but with remnants of its ancient history dotted around amd this is one such. A very good example of a Greco Roman theatre and very interesting to stroll around. Well worth",
          "First of all it was quite funny( or irritating, depending on the mood) to find the entry. I knew about this place from TripAdvisor and I wanted to visit it. A had a long way around the place to find the entry but it worth it. It's quite a nicely preserved greek theatre",
          "In good condition, makes you realise how much was going on behind the scenes to make this happen in ancient times.",
          "This is clearly an ongoing project. There are lots of boards up in Italian and English giving lots of facts and photographs but you can see spaces where more work and information will be added. I found it so inspiring to just sit in the theatre, close my eyes and try and",
          "Was suitably impressed with this attraction. There was a great a great deal to see including the Theater and the Odeion..The bonus attraction for me was the Liberti House, a typical sicilian house with a fascinating original kitchen as well as some beautiful painted ceilings",
          "The theater is fantastic and also all the layers that have been added during the time are interesting. It should not be missed from everyone that is visiting Catania.",

          "I agree with one recent reviewer who felt the initial impact of this museo/parco wasn't strong, but page by page, it unfolds it self and wins over an audience, especially in terms of its variety. It's a very good introduction to what my Sicilian father meant when he spoke of his",

          "Very difficult to find but well worth the hunt. I passed the entrance twice, but easy to find from across the street. A very well preserved area of antiquity, you can imagine people of that era walking the darkened corridors or sitting in the stands of the theater. The river",

She is one of seven women, who, along with the Blessed Virgin Mary, are commemorated by name in the Canon of the Mass.She is the patron saint of Catania, Molise, Malta, San Marino, Gallipoli in Apulia, and Zamarramala, a municipality of the Province of Segovia in Spain. She is also the patron saint of breast cancer patients, martyrs, wet nurses, bell-founders, bakers, and invoked against fire, earthquakes, and eruptions of Mount Etna.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nAgatha is buried at the Badia di Sant'Agata, Catania.  She is listed in the late 6th-century Martyrologium Hieronymianum associated with Jerome, and the Synaxarion, the calendar of the church of Carthage, ca. 530. Agatha also appears in one of the carmina of Venantius Fortunatus.Two early churches were dedicated to her in Rome, notably the Church of Sant'Agata dei Goti in Via Mazzarino, a titular church with apse mosaics of ca. 460 and traces of a fresco cycle, overpainted by Gismondo Cerrini in 1630. In the 6th century AD, the church was adapted to Arianism, hence its name \"Saint Agatha of Goths\", and later reconsecrated by Gregory the Great, who confirmed her traditional sainthood.\nAgatha is also depicted in the mosaics of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna, where she appears, richly dressed, in the procession of female martyrs along the north wall. Her image forms an initial I in the Sacramentary of Gellone, which dates from the end of the 8th century.\n\n\n== Life ==\nOne of the most highly venerated virgin martyrs of Christian antiquity, Agatha was put to death during the persecution of Decius (250\u2013253) in Catania, Sicily, for her determined profession of faith.Her written legend comprises \"straightforward accounts of interrogation, torture, resistance, and triumph which constitute some of the earliest hagiographic literature\", and are reflected in later recensions, the earliest surviving one being an illustrated late 10th-century passio bound into a composite volume in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, originating probably in Autun, Burgundy; in its margin illustrations Magdalena Carrasco detected Carolingian or Late Antique iconographic traditions.\n\nAccording to the 13th-century Golden Legend (III.15) by Jacobus de Voragine,  fifteen-year-old Agatha, from a rich and noble family, made a vow of virginity and rejected the amorous advances of the Roman prefect Quintianus, who thought he could force her to turn away from her vow and marry him. His persistent proposals were consistently spurned by Agatha. This was during the persecutions of Decius, so Quintianus, knowing she was a Christian. reported her to the authorities. Quintianus himself was governor of the district.He expected her to give in to his demands when she was faced with torture and possible death, but she simply reaffirmed her belief in God by praying: \"Jesus Christ, Lord of all, you see my heart, you know my desires. Possess all that I am. I am your sheep: make me worthy to overcome the devil.\" With tears falling from her eyes, she prayed for courage. To force her to change her mind, Quintianus sent Agatha to Aphrodisia, the keeper of a brothel, and had her imprisoned there. Agatha never lost her confidence in God.Quintianus sent for her again, argued, threatened, and finally had her imprisoned and tortured. She was stretched on a rack to be torn with iron hooks, burned with torches, and whipped. Amongst the tortures she underwent was the cutting off of her breasts with pincers. After further dramatic confrontations with Quintianus, represented in a sequence of dialogues in her passio that document her fortitude and steadfast devotion, Agatha was then sentenced to be burnt at the stake, but an earthquake saved her from that fate; instead, she was sent to prison where St. Peter the Apostle appeared to her and healed her wounds.Agatha died in prison, probably in the year 251 according to the Legenda Aurea. Although the martyrdom of Agatha is authenticated, and her veneration as a saint had spread beyond her native place even in antiquity, there is no reliable information concerning the details of her death.Osbern Bokenham, A Legend of Holy Women, written in the 1440s, offers some further detail.\n\n\n== Veneration ==\nAccording to Maltese tradition, during the persecution of Roman Emperor Decius (AD 249\u2013251), Agatha, together with some of her friends, fled from Sicily and took refuge in Malta. Some historians believe that her stay on the island was rather short, and she spent her days in a rock-hewn crypt at Rabat, praying and teaching the Christian Faith to children. After some time, Agatha returned to Sicily, where she faced martyrdom. Agatha was arrested and brought before Quintanus, praetor of Catania, who condemned her to torture and imprisonment. The crypt of St. Agatha is an underground basilica, which from early ages was venerated by the Maltese. At the time of St. Agatha's stay, the crypt was a small natural cave which later on, during the 4th or 5th century, was enlarged and embellished.After the Reformation era, Agatha was retained in the calendar of the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer with her feast on 5 February. Several Church of England parish churches are dedicated to her.\n\n\n=== Festival of Saint Agatha in Catania ===\n\nThe Festival of Saint Agatha in Catania is a major festival in the region, it takes place in the first five days of February. The Catania Cathedral (also known as Cattedrale di Sant'Agata) is dedicated to the saint.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Patronage ==\n\nSaint Agatha is the patron saint of rape victims, breast cancer patients, wet nurses, and bellfounders (due to the shape of her severed breasts). She is also considered to be a powerful intercessor when people suffer from fires. Her feast day is celebrated on February 5. \nShe is also a patron saint of Malta, where in 1551 her intercession through a reported apparition to a Benedictine nun is said to have saved Malta from Turkish invasion.She became the patron saint of the Republic of San Marino after Pope Clement XII restored the independence of the state on her feast day of February 5, 1740.She is also the patron saint of Catania, Sorihuela del Guadalimar (Spain), Molise, San Marino and Kalsa, a historical quarter of Palermo.\nShe is claimed as the patroness of Palermo. The year after her death, the stilling of an eruption of Mount Etna was attributed to her intercession. As a result, apparently, people continued to ask her prayers for protection against fire.In Switzerland Agatha is considered the patron saint of fire services.\n\n\n== Iconography ==\n\nSaint Agatha is often depicted iconographically carrying her excised breasts on a platter, as in Bernardino Luini's Saint Agatha (1510\u20131515) in the Galleria Borghese, Rome, in which Agatha contemplates the breasts on a standing salver held in her hand.\nThe tradition of Agatha Buns, Agatha bread, or so-called St Agatha's Breasts or Minne di Sant'Agata (Italian/Sicilian for Breasts of St. Agatha) or Minni di Virgini (Italian/Sicilian for Breasts of (a) virgin), served or blessed on her feast day, is found in many countries.\nThe small round fruit buns are iced and topped with a cherry, intended to represent breasts.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nBasques have a tradition of gathering on Saint Agatha's Eve (Basque: Santa Ageda bezpera) and going round the village. Homeowners can choose to hear a song about her life, accompanied by the beats of their walking sticks on the floor or a prayer for the household's deceased. After that, the homeowner donates food to the chorus. This song has varying lyrics according to the local tradition and the Basque language. An exceptional case was that of 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, when a version appeared that in the Spanish language praised the Soviet ship Komsomol, which had sunk while carrying Soviet weapons to the Second Spanish Republic.\nAn annual festival to commemorate the life of Saint Agatha takes place in Catania, Sicily, from February 3 to 5. The festival culminates in an all-night procession through the city.St. Agatha's Tower is a former Knight's stronghold located in the north west of Malta. The seventeenth-century tower served as a military base during both World Wars and was used as a radar station by the Maltese army.\n\n\n=== Saint Agatha in art ===\n\nAgatha is a featured figure on Judy Chicago's 1979 installation piece The Dinner Party, being represented as one of the 999 names on the Heritage Floor.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nIncorruptibility\nList of Catholic saints\nSaint Agatha of Sicily, patron saint archive\nSanta Gadea, a church of historical importance devoted to Agatha, located in Burgos\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"St Agatha - St Peter's Square Colonnades\"\n\"Here Followeth the Life of St. Agatha,\" from Jacobus Voragine, The Golden Legend, tr.

      "name": "Teatro Massimo Bellini",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Teatro Massimo Bellini is an opera house in Catania, Sicily, southern Italy. Named after the local-born composer Vincenzo Bellini, it was inaugurated on 31 May 1890 with a performance of the composer's masterwork, Norma. It seats 1,200.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe creation of what was to finally become the Teatro Massimo Bellini took almost two hundred years, beginning with discussions following the disastrous 1693 earthquake which completely destroyed Catania.  The construction of a public theatre was discussed, and a foundation stone was finally laid in 1812.\nArchitect Salvatore Zahra Buda began to prepare a plan for a theatre in the Piazza Nuovaluce, in front of the Santa Maria di Nuovaluce monastery, the location of the present-day theatre.  It was decided that a \"Great Municipal Theatre\" worthy of an expanding city should be created; the plan of the \"Teatro Nuovaluce\" (New Light Theatre) was a grandiose one in all respects, and was conceived to create one of the most innovative works in Italy.\nDue to funding problems, work had to stop for some years.  Meanwhile, a smaller theatre - the \"Provisional Municipal Theatre\" \u2013 was built instead, and it opened in 1822 (but was destroyed during the Second World War). Meanwhile, the Teatro Nuovaluce, after being partially completed and converted into a multi-purpose hall, was devoted mainly to summer use until 1865 when it was sold privately to finance the construction of a new theatre.\nIn 1870, the theatre architect Carlo Sada was appointed to find a suitable site for the new theatre. Many location options were considered for the long desired \"Massimo\" theatre.  One location was chosen only to be turned down with the original site being brought back into the picture.  This time it was to be the location for a large, multi-purpose hall.  Again, funding problems arose, and the plan was taken over by the Municipality. A Municipal committee then decided that the structure should be made into a single-purpose opera house.  Finally, work proceeded well, and the theatre was completed in seven years, opening in May 1890.\nThe exterior of the house matches the distinctive Sicilian Baroque style of the neighboring buildings of the late 17th Century.  Its marble foyer, the \u201cRidotto\u201d, is ornate and stuccoed, and a statue of Bellini is located between the central arches.  The beautiful red-plush interior includes the main floor seating and four tiers of boxes.  Surrounding them, on the upper level, are unusual arched arcades.  The painted ceiling by Ernesto Bellandi depicts scenes from four of Bellini's most well-known operas.\n\n\n== Opera ==\n\nThroughout its history, the opera house has performed almost all of Bellini's work.  From its beginnings, a wide variety of operas have been performed by some highly renowned singers.  In 1951, to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of Bellini, Maria Callas sang Norma, repeating her success in 1952 and 1953.\nIn recent years, there has been an infusion of about $2 million, leading to the celebration of the Bellini bicentennial during the 2001 season and to a major renovation of the house.\n\n\n== References ==\nGiraldi, Juliet, \u201cPostcard From Catania\u201d, Opera Now, September/October 2001.

        "wiki": "Catania (UK: , US: , Sicilian and Italian: [ka\u02c8ta\u02d0nja] (listen)) is the second largest city in Sicily, after Palermo, and among the ten largest cities in Italy. Located on Sicily\u2019s east coast, it faces the Ionian Sea. It is the capital of the 58-municipality region known as the Metropolitan City of Catania, which is the seventh-largest metropolitan city in Italy. The population of the city proper is 311,584, while the population of the Metropolitan City of Catania is 1,107,702.Catania was founded in the 8th century BC by Chalcidians Greeks. The city was almost completely destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake in 1169.However, by the 14th century, and into the Renaissance period, Catania was one of Italy's most important cultural, artistic and political centres. It was the site of Sicily\u2019s first university, founded in 1434. It has been the native or adopted home of some of Italy's most famous artists and writers, including the composers Vincenzo Bellini and Giovanni Pacini, and the writers Giovanni Verga, Luigi Capuana, Federico De Roberto and Nino Martoglio.\nThe city has been devastated several times by volcanic eruptions from nearby Mount Etna, the most violent of which was in 1669. And it suffered through another severely damaging earthquake in 1693.Catania today is the industrial, logistical, and commercial center of Sicily. Its airport, the Catania-Fontanarossa Airport, is the largest in Southern Italy. \nHowever, it is also noted for its history, culture, architecture, and gastronomy. The section of the city known as the \u201cold town\u201d features some of the most striking examples of baroque architecture in Italy, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe ancient indigenous population of the Sicels named their villages after geographical attributes of their location. The Sicilian word, katane, means \"grater, flaying knife, skinning place\" or a \"crude tool apt to pare\". Other translations of the name are \"harsh lands\", \"uneven ground\", \"sharp stones\", or \"rugged or rough soil\". The latter etymologies are easily justifiable since, for many centuries following an eruption, the city has always been rebuilt within its black-lava landscape.Around 263 BC, the city was variously known as Cat\u012dna (Latin: [\u02c8kat\u026ana]) and Cat\u0103na (Latin: [\u02c8katana]; Ancient Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 [kat\u00e1n\u025b\u02d0]). The former has been primarily used for its supposed assonance with catina, the Latin feminization of the name catinus. Catinus has two meanings: \"a gulf, a basin or a bay\" and \"a bowl, a vessel or a trough\",  thanks to the city's distinctive topography.\nAround 900, when Catania was part of the emirate of Sicily, it was known in Arabic as Balad al-f\u012bl (\u0628\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644) and Mad\u012bnat al-f\u012bl (\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644), respectively meaning \"the Village (or Country) of the Elephant\" and \"the City of the Elephant\". The Elephant is the lava sculpture over the fountain in Piazza Duomo: most likely a prehistoric sculpture that was reforged during the Byzantine Era, it appears to be a talisman that was reputedly powerful enough to protect the city from enemies and to keep away misfortune, plagues, or natural calamities. Another Arab toponym was Qa\u1e6d\u0101niyyah (\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629), allegedly from the Arabic word for the \"leguminous plants\". Pulses like lentils, beans, peas, broad beans, and lupins were chiefly cultivated in the plains around the city well before the arrival of Aghlabids. Afterwards, many Arabic agronomists  developed these crops and the citrus orchards in the area around the city.\nThe toponym W\u0101d\u012b M\u016bs\u00e1 (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0649), or \"the Valley of Moses\" (from the Arabic name of the Simeto River), was rarely used.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCatania is located on the east coast of the island of Sicily, at the foot of Mount Etna.\nAs observed by Strabo, the location of Catania at the foot of Mount Etna has been both a curse and a blessing. On the one hand, violent outbursts of the volcano throughout history have destroyed large parts of the city, whilst on the other hand the volcanic ashes yield fertile soil, especially suited for the growth of vines. (Strab. vi. p. 269)\nTwo subterranean rivers run under the city; the Amenano, which surfaces at one single point south of Piazza Duomo, and the Longane (or Lognina).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Csa\" (Mediterranean Climate). It has hot summers, one of the hottest in the whole country of Italy (a feature characterising nearly every month). Temperatures of 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are surpassed almost every year a couple of times,Winters are mild with chilly nights (not rare peaks around 20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F) . Most of precipitation is concentrated from October to March, leaving late spring and summer virtually dry (some years there is no rain for 3\u20134 months). The city receives around 500 millimetres (20 inches) of rain per year, although the amount can vary greatly from year to year (wettest over 1,200 millimetres or 47 inches, driest under 250 millimetres or 9.8 inches,).\nDuring winter nights lows can occasionally go under 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Highs under 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) can happen during winter. Snow, due to the presence of Etna that protects the city from the northern winds, is an uncommon occurrence, but occasional snow flurries have been seen over the recent years especially in the hilly districts, more substantial in the northern hinterland. More recently, light snowfalls occurred on 9 February 2015, 6 January 2017 and 5 January 2019, but the last heavy snowfall dates back to 17 December 1988.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn January 2015, there were 315,601 people residing in Catania, of whom 47.2% were male and 52.8% were female. Minors (people under age 18) totalled 20.50 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 18.87 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners).\nThe average age of Catania residents is 41 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Catania declined by 3.35 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85 percent. The reason for this population decline in the comune di Catania is mainly due to a large segment of the population leaving the city centre to go to live in the uptown residential areas of the comuni of the Metropolitan area. As a result of this, while the population in the comune di Catania declines, the population of the hinterland comuni increases making the overall population of the Metropolitan area increase.The current birth rate of Catania is 10.07 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births. As of 2006, 98.03% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant groups come from Sub-Saharan Africa: 0.69%, South Asia: 0.46%, and from other European countries (particularly from Ukraine and Poland): 0.33%.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nAround 729 BC, the ancient village of Katane was occupied by Chalcidian Greek settlers from nearby Naxos along the coast. It became the Chalcidian colony of Kat\u00e1n\u0113 under a leader named Euarchos (Euarchus) and the native population was rapidly Hellenised.\nThucydides states that it came into existence slightly later than Leontini (modern Lentini), which he claims was five years after Syracuse, or 730 BC.The settlement's acropolis was on the hill of Monte Vergine, a defensible hill immediately west of the current city centre. The port of Catania appears to have been much frequented in ancient time and was the chief place of export for the corn of the rich neighbouring plains.\n\n\n=== Greek Catania ===\nIn ancient times Catania was associated with the legend of Amphinomos and Anapias, who, on occasion of a great eruption of Etna, abandoned all their property and carried off their aged parents on their shoulders. The stream of lava itself was said to have parted, and flowed aside so as not to harm them. Statues were erected to their honour, and the place of their burial was known as the Campus Piorum; the Catanaeans even introduced the figures of the youths on their coins, and the legend became a favorite subject of allusion and declamation among the Latin poets, of whom the younger Lucilius and Claudian have dwelt upon it at considerable length.Catania was the birthplace of the philosopher and legislator Charondas (late 6th c. BC) who introduced his celebrated laws there. His legislation was extended to the other Chalcidic cities, not only of Sicily, but of Magna Graecia also, as well as to his own country. It is evident that Catania had close relations with these other cities during this time.\nIt was residence of the poets Ibycus and Stesichorus (c. 630\u2013555 BC), who was buried in a magnificent sepulchre outside one of the gates, hence its name of Porta Stesichoreia. Xenophanes (c. 570-475 BC), one of the founders of the Eleatic school of philosophy, also spent the latter years of his life in the city so that it was evidently, at an early period, a place of cultivation and refinement.\nCatania appears to have retained its independence up to the reign of the despot Hieron of Syracuse, whereupon in 476 BC he expelled all the original inhabitants of Catania and replaced them with those he ruled over at Leontini \u2013 said to have numbered no less than 10,000, consisting partly of Syracusans and Peloponnesians. At the same time he changed the city's name to \u0391\u1f34\u03c4\u03bd\u03b7 (A\u00edtn\u0113, Aetna or \u00c6tna, after the nearby Mount Etna, and proclaimed himself the Oekist or founder of the new city. For this he was celebrated by Pindar, and after his death he received heroic honours from the citizens of his new colony.A few years after the death of Hieron and the expulsion of Thrasybulus, the Syracusans combined with Ducetius, king of the Sicels, to expel the newly settled inhabitants of Catania, who went on to settle in the fortress of Inessa (to which they gave the name Aetna). The old Chalcidic citizens were reinstated to the city in 461 BC.The period that followed appears to have been one of great prosperity for Catania, as well as for the Sicilian cities in general.\nIn the Peloponnesian War during the great Athenian expedition to Sicily  in 415 BC, the Catanaeans at first refused to allow the Athenians into their city, but after the latter had forced an entrance, they found themselves compelled to honour the alliance of their invaders after a famous speech that Alcibiades would have made in front of the assembly. Catania became the headquarters of the Athenian army throughout the first year of the expedition, and the base of their subsequent operations against Syracuse. After the defeat of the Athenians it was open to attack by Syracuse but was saved by the Carthaginian invasion of Sicily in 409 BC.\nBut in 403 BC it fell into the power of Dionysius I of Syracuse, who plundered the city and sold its citizens as slaves, after which he populated it with Campanian mercenaries. These, however, quit in 396 BC and retired to Aetna, on the approach of the great Carthaginian armament under Himilco and Mago. After the great naval Battle of Catana (397 BC) which was fought off Catania and in which the latter defeated Leptines of Syracuse, the city fell into the hands of the Carthaginians.Calippus, the assassin of Dion of Syracuse, held Catania for a time (Plut. Dion. 58); and when Timoleon landed in Sicily in 344 BC Catania was subject to the despot Mamercus who at first joined the Corinthian leader, but afterwards abandoned this allegiance for that of the Carthaginians. As a consequence he was attacked and expelled by Timoleon in 338 BC.Catania was now restored to liberty, and appears to have continued to retain its independence; during the wars of Agathocles of Syracuse from 311 BC with the Carthaginians, it sided at one time with the former, at others with the latter; and when Pyrrhus landed in Sicily in 278 BC, Catania was the first to open its gates to him, and received him with the great splendour.The first introduction of dancing to accompany the flute was also ascribed to Andron, a citizen of Catania.\n\n\n=== Roman rule ===\nIn the First Punic War Catania was one of the first cities of Sicily to submit to the Roman Republic after their first successes in 263 BC when it was taken by Valerius Messalla. A sundial was part of the booty which was placed in the Comitium in Rome. Since then the city became a civitas decumana i.e. was subject to the payment of a tenth of its agricultural income as a tax to Rome. The conqueror of Syracuse, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, built a gymnasium here.It appears to have continued afterwards to maintain its friendly relations with Rome and though it did not enjoy the advantages of a confederate city (foederata civitas), like its neighbours Tauromenium (modern Taormina) and Messana (modern Messina), it rose to a position of great prosperity under the Roman rule.\nAround 135 BC during the First Servile War, it was conquered by rebel slaves.One of the most serious eruptions of Mount Etna happened in 121 BC, when a great part of Catania was overwhelmed by streams of lava, and the hot ashes fell in such quantities in the city itself, as to break in the roofs of the houses. Catana was in consequence exempted, for 10 years, from its usual contributions to the Roman state. The greater part of the broad tract of plain to the southwest of Catana (now called the Piana di Catania, a district of great fertility), appears to have belonged, in ancient times, to Leontini or Centuripa (modern Centuripe), but that portion of it between Catana itself and the mouth of the Symaethus was annexed to Catana and must have furnished abundant supplies of grain.\nCicero repeatedly mentions it as, in his time, a wealthy and flourishing city; it retained its ancient municipal institutions, its chief magistrate bearing the title of Proagorus; and appears to have been one of the principal ports of Sicily for the export of corn.In the Sicilian revolt from 44 BC Sextus Pompeius selected Sicily as his base and Catania gave in to Sextus' revolt and joined his forces. Sextus amassed a formidable army and a large fleet of warships at his base at Messana, with many slaves joining from the villas of patricians. After the victory of Augustus in 36 BC much of the vast farmland in Sicily was either ruined or left empty, and much of this land was taken and distributed to members of the legions which had fought there. Catania suffered severely from the ravages but was afterwards one of the cities raised to the status of colony by Augustus which restored its prosperity through the settlement of veterans, so that in Strabo's time it was one of the few cities in the island that was flourishing.Another revolt led by the gladiator Selurus in 35 BC created mayhem for a while.The Roman aqueduct of Catania was the largest in Roman Sicily at 24 km length starting from the springs of Santa Maria di Licodia.\nIt retained its colonial rank, as well as its prosperity, throughout the period of the Roman Empire; so that in the 4th century Ausonius in his Ordo Nobilium Urbium, notices Catania and Syracuse alone among the cities of Sicily.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nCatania was sacked by the Vandals of Gaiseric in 440\u2013441. After a period under the Ostrogoths, it was reconquered in 535 by the Eastern Roman Empire, under which (aside from a short period in 550\u2013555) it remained until the 9th century. It was the seat of the Byzantine governor of the island.\nCatania was under the Islamic emirate of Sicily until 1072, when it fell to the Normans of Roger I of Sicily. Subsequently, the city was ruled by a bishop-count. In 1194\u20131197 the city was sacked by German soldiers during after the conquest of the island by emperor Henry VI. In 1232 it rebelled to the former's son, Frederick II, who later built a massive castle, Castello Ursino and also made Catania a royal city, ending the dominance of the bishops. Catania was one of the main centers of the Sicilian Vespers revolt (1282) against the House of Anjou, and was the seat of the incoronation of the new Aragonese king of Sicily, Peter I. In the 14th century it gained importance as it was chosen by the Aragonese as a Parliament and Royal seat. Here, in 1347, it was signed the treaty of peace that ended the long War of the Vesper between Aragonese and Angevines. Catania lost its capital role when, in the early 15th century, Sicily was turned into a member of the Crown of Aragon, and kept its autonomy and original privileges specially during the period from 1282 to 1410.\nIn 1434 King Alfonso V founded here the Siciliae Studium Generale, the oldest university in the island.\n\n\n=== Early Modern times ===\n\nWith the unification of Castile and Aragon (early 16th century), Sicily became part of the Spanish Empire. It rebelled against the foreign government in 1516 and 1647.In 1669 the city's surroundings suffered great material damage from the 1669 Etna eruption. The city itself was largely saved by its walls that diverted most of the lava into the port. Afterwards in 1693 the city was then completely destroyed by a heavy earthquake and its aftershocks. The city was then rebuilt in the Baroque architecture that nowadays characterizes it.\n\n\n=== Unified Italy ===\nCatania was one of the vanguards of the movement for the Sicilian autonomy in the early 19th century.\nIn 1860 Giuseppe Garibaldi's expedition of the Thousand conquered Sicily for Piedmont from the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Since the following year Catania was part of the newly unified Italy, whose history it shares since then.\n During World War II, Catania was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces, owing to the presence of two of the main Axis airfields in Sicily (Gerbini and Fontanarossa) and for its strategically important port and marshalling yard. Altogether, the city suffered eighty-seven air raids. The heaviest raids took place in the spring and summer of 1943, before and during the Allied invasion of Sicily; they caused heavy damage to che city (among others, twenty-eight churches and most historic palaces suffered damage), killed 750 inhabitants and prompted most of the population to flee to the countryside. After heavy fighting across eastern Sicily, Catania was eventually captured by the British 8th Army on 5 August 1943.After the conflict, and the constitution of the Italian Republic (1946), Catania attempted to catch up with the economic and social development of Italy's richer northern regions. The problems faced in Catania were emblematic of those faced by other towns in the Mezzogiorno, namely a heavy gap in industrial development and infrastructures, and the threat of the mafia. This notwithstanding, during the 1960s (and partly during the 1990s) Catania enjoyed development and a period of economic, social and cultural success. In the first decade of the 21st century, Catania's economic and social development somewhat faltered and the city is again facing economic and social stagnation. This was aggravated by the economical crisis left by the Forza Italia administration of mayor Scapagnini in 2008.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Metropolitan City ===\n\nThe Metropolitan City of Catania was established in 2015 and replaced the former Province of Catania. It includes the city proper and 57 comuni (municipalities). The population of the Metropolitan City is 1,107,702.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Metropolitan area of Catania includes the comune of Catania (311,584 inhabitants) and 26 surrounding comuni forming an urban belt (498,650 inhabitants). The total population of the Metropolitan area of Catania is therefore 810,234. The comuni of the Metropolitan area are:\n\nThese comuni form a system with the centre of Catania sharing its economical and social life and creating an organic urban texture.\n\n\n=== City proper ===\nThe city of Catania proper (comune di Catania) is divided in six administrative areas called circoscrizioni. The current administrative setup was established in 2013, modifying previous setups dating back to 1971, 1978 and 1995.\nThe six areas are:\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe symbol of the city is u Liotru, or the Fontana dell'Elefante, assembled in 1736 by Giovanni Battista Vaccarini. It portrays an ancient lavic stone elephant and is topped by an Egyptian obelisk from Syene. Legend has it that Vaccarini's original elephant was neuter, which the men of Catania took as an insult to their virility. To appease them, Vaccarini appropriately appended elephantine testicles to the original statue.\nThe Sicilian name u Liotru is a phonetic change of Heliodorus, a nobleman who, after trying without success to become bishop of the city, became a sorcerer and was therefore condemned to the stake. Legend has it that Heliodorus himself was the sculptor of the lava elephant and that he used to magically ride it in his fantastic travels from Catania to Constantinople. Another legend has it that Heliodorus was able to transform himself into an elephant.\nThe presence of an elephant in the millenary history of Catania is surely connected to both zooarcheology and popular creeds. In fact, the prehistoric fauna of Sicily from the Upper Paleolithic, included dwarf elephants. Paleontologist Othenio Abel suggested that the presence of dwarf elephants in Sicily may be the origin of the legend of the Cyclops. Ancient Greeks, after finding the skulls of dwarf elephants, about twice the size of a human skull, with a large central nasal cavity (mistaken for a large single eye-socket) supposed that they were skulls of giants with a single eye.\nThe Catanian Museum of Mineralogy, Paleontology and Vulcanology holds the integral unburied skeleton of an Elephas falconeri in an excellent state of conservation. The first inhabitants of Etna  molded such lavic artifact to idolize the mythical proboscidian.\n\n\n=== Classical buildings ===\nThe city has been buried by lava a total of seventeen times in recorded history, and in layers under the present day city are the Roman city that preceded it, and the Greek city before that. Many of the ancient monuments of the Roman city have been destroyed by the numerous seisms. Currently, different ancient remains can be seen and visited in the city-centre, as part of an archaeological park (Parco Archeologico Greco-Romano di Catania).\n\nAncient edifices include:\n\nGreek-Roman Theatre of Catania (2nd century)\nOdeon (3rd century). It could house up to 1500 spectators\nAmphitheatre\nGreek Acropolis of Montevergine\nRoman Aqueduct\nRoman Forum\nRoman broken arcades\nChristian basilicas, hypogea, burial monuments and Catacombs\nRoman Colonnade\n\n\n=== Roman thermal structures ===\nAchillean Baths\nTerme dell\u2019Indirizzo\nTerme di Santa Maria Odigitria\nTerme della Rotonda\nBaths of the Four Quoins\nTerme di Palazzo Asmundo\nTerme del Palazzo dell\u2019Universit\u00e0\nTerme di Casa Gagliano\nTerme della Chiesa di Sant'Antonio Abate\n\n\n=== Baroque and historical churches ===\n\nThe Baroque city centre of Catania is a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nThe Cathedral (1070\u20131093, rebuilt after the 1693 earthquake)\nSaint Agatha Abbey (1620)\nSaint Placidus (1769)\nChurch of San Giuseppe al Duomo\nChurch of Santissimo Sacramento al Duomo\nChurch of San Martino dei Bianchi\nChurch of Sant'Agata la Vetere (254)\nSaint Agatha by the Furnace or Saint Blaise (1098, rebuilt in 1700)\nChurch of the Saint Jail or Saint Agatha at the Jail (Santo Carcere or Sant'Agata al Carcere) (1760). This temple includes the ancient jail where Saint Agatha was allegedly imprisoned during her martyrdom.\nSaint Francis of Assisi at the Immaculate (1329).

Ognina is the maritime quarter and the main fishing pole of Catania. Many bareboats and umpteen smacks gather and crowd here all year round. In its close vicinities there is a cylindric tower, known as Saint Mary's Tower (Torre Santa Maria), which was restructured in the 16th century to prevent the frequent plunders of the Saracen pirates. The church is the result of the gradual modification of the Greek Temple Athena Longatis or Parthenos Longatis that existed on the steep reef. This cult was imported from a Boeotian region of Greece called Longas from where the first Hellenic settlers of this borough probably came. After the earthquake of 1693 it was rebuilt on the same place but with a different orientation.\nOur Lady of Montserrat (1755)\nChurch of  Santa Maria della Salute\nSaint Mary of La Salette\nChurch of Santa Maria della Mercede\nChurch of Santa Caterina al Rinazzo\nOur Lady of Concordia\nChurch of Santa Maria della Guardia\nOur Lady of Consolation\nChurch of Santissimo Crocifisso Maiorana\nCrucifix of Miracles\nCrucifix of Good Death\nOur Lady of La Mecca\nSaint Cajetan at the Marina\nMost Holy Redeemer\nSaint Francis of Paola\nChurch of the Divina Maternit\u00e0\nChapel of Mary Auxiliatrix\nChapel of the Sacred Heart of Jesus\nChurch of the Sacro Cuore al Fortino (1898)\nSaints George and Denis\nChurch of the Sacred Heart of the Capuchins\nSaint Christopher\nSaints Cosmas and Damian\nChurch of Santa Maria del Soccorso or Santa Maria della Palma\nSaint Vitus\nChurch of the Santi Angeli Custodi\nChurch of the Santissimo Salvatore\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nUrsino Castle, built by emperor Frederick II in the 13th century.\nPalace of the Elephants, designed by Giovan Battista Vaccarini.

The city is famous for its mainly petrochemical industry, and the extraction of sulphur. In the year 2000, according to Census, Catania was the 14th richest city in Italy, with a GDP of US$6.6 billion (\u20ac6.304 billion), which was 0.54% of the Italian GDP, a GDP per capita of US$21,000 (\u20ac20,100) and an average GDP per employee of US$69,000 (\u20ac66,100).In the late-19th century and early-20th century, Catania began to be heavily industrialised, with its several factories and chimneys, often to the extant that it was referred to as Southern Italy's \"Manchester\". The economy of Catania suffered heavily from the bad effects of World War I, and was marked by an economic crisis and recession that culminated in the 1920s. Since then, the city lost its industrial and entrepreneurial importance. In the 1930s, Catania remained a small fishing town with derelict and disused industries. However, after the destruction of World War II, Catania's economy began to re-grow in the late-1950s and early-1960s. As a matter of fact, the city's economic growth was so rapid and dynamic that it was often nicknamed the \"Milan of the South\", or in Italian \"Milano del Sud\". This rapid economic growth prompted a great number of Sicilians living in the more rural areas, or smaller towns such as Enna, Ragusa and Caltanissetta, to move to the city to seek new jobs.\nToday, Catania, despite several problems, has one of the most dynamic economies in the whole of Southern Italy. It still has a strong industrial and agricultural sector, and a fast-growing tourist industry, with many international visitors coming to visit the city's main sights and the nearby Etna volcano. It contains the headquarters or important offices of companies such as STMicroelectronics, and also several chemical and pharmaceutical businesses. There have been several new business developments to further boost Catania's economy, including the construction of Etnapolis, a big shopping mall designed by Massimiliano Fuksas, the same architect who designed the FieraMilano industrial fair in Milan, or the Etna Valley, where several high-tech offices are located.\nTourism is a fast-growing industry in Catania. Lately the administration and private companies have made several investments in the hospitality industry in order to make tourism a competitive sector in the Metropolitan City. Etnaland, a big amusement and water park located in Belpasso, in the Metropolitan area of Catania, 12 kilometers (7 miles) from the city center, is the largest in Southern Italy and attracts thousands of tourists, not only from Sicily, but also from the rest of Italy: according to Tripadvisor (2018) it is the third water park in Europe.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Catania dates back to 1434 and it is the oldest university in Sicily. Its academic nicknames are: Siculorum Gymnasium and Siciliae Studium Generale. Nowadays it hosts 12 faculties and over 62,000 students, and it offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.\nCatania hosts the Scuola Superiore, an academic institution linked to the University of Catania, aimed at the excellence in education. The Scuola Superiore di Catania also offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.Apart from the University and the Scuola Superiore Catania is base of the prestigious Istituto Musicale Vincenzo Bellini an advanced institute of musical studies (Conservatory) and the Accademia di Belle Arti an advanced institute of artistic studies. Both institutions offer programs of university level for musical and artistic education.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe opera composer Vincenzo Bellini was born in Catania, and a museum exists at his birthplace.\nThe Teatro Massimo \"Vincenzo Bellini\", which opened in 1890, is named after the composer. The opera house presents a variety of operas through a season, which run from December to May, many of which are the work of Bellini.\nGiovanni Verga was born in Catania in 1840. He became the greatest writer of Verismo, an Italian literary movement akin to Naturalism. His novels portray life among the lower levels of Sicilian society, such as fishermen and stonemasons, and were written in a mixture of both literary language and local dialect. Francesco Longo Mancini was a painter known for paintings of nudes who was born in Catania in 1880.\n\nThe city's patron saint is Saint Agatha, who is celebrated with a religious pageantry, the Festival of Saint Agatha, on February 5 every year.\nThe city is base of the newspaper La Sicilia and of the TV-channel Antenna Sicilia also known as Sicilia Channel. Several others local television channels and free-press magazines have their headquarters in Catania.\nThe city is home to the Catania Jazz Festival, which typically runs for several winter months with concerts in different locations.\nIn the late 1980s and during the 1990s Catania had a sparkling and unique popular music scene. Indie pop and indie rock bands, local radio station and dynamic independent music record labels sprung. As a result, in those years the city experienced a vital and effervescent cultural period. Artists like Carmen Consoli and Mario Venuti and internationally known indie rock bands like Uzeda came out of this cultural milieu.\nThe city is the home of Amatori Catania rugby union team, Calcio Catania football team and Orizzonte Catania, the latter being a women's water polo club, winning eight European Champions Cup titles from 1994 to 2008. Noted Italian basketball coach Ettore Messina is a native of Catania. The city also hosted the first ever qualification tournament for the Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1992, and the associated Etna Cup, which was won by the host Sicily team. In addition, the Catania Elephants are currently members of the Italian Football League. Catania also hosted the 2011 FIE Fencing World Championships.\n\n\n== Food and cuisine ==\n\nFood is an important part of Catania's culture and way of life. Local cuisine emphasizes several traits of Sicilian one, whilst developing some of its own.\nStreet food is one of the best ways to experience traditional dishes. Arancini are perhaps the city's most iconic one: they are stuffed rice balls coated in bread-crumbs and deep fried; in Catania, they are shaped like a cone to remind of Mount Etna. Typical specialties from the city include cipollina (puff pastry with onion, tomato and prosciutto filling), bolognese (a small pizza topped with tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto and boiled egg and covered in puff pastry), crispelle (deep fried dough balls with ricotta or anchovies filling.)\nDuring street-fairs and religious festivals, street stalls sell calia e simenza (toasted chickpeas and pumpkin seeds). Typical from old street markets are sangeli (cooked pork blood), quarumi (pork tripe), zuzzu (pork jelly), mauru (edible seaweed), and raw seafood. Horse meat is very traditional and it is sold in shops called arrusti e mancia (\"roast it and eat it\"), which roast the meat in streetside barbecues.Apart from street food, typical dishes from Catania are: pasta alla Norma (pasta with fried eggplant, tomato sauce and ricotta salata cheese), named after the namesake opera by Vincenzo Bellini; pasta cco niuru (pasta in cuttlefish ink), maccu (fava beans pur\u00e9e), bastaddi affucati or brocculi affucati (stewed cauliflower or broccoli), caponata (saut\u00e9ed vegetables) and scacciata (a pie filled with tuma cheese) which is traditional during Christmastime.Catania is also famous for its pasticceria (pastries and cakes). Pastries vary according to season and to seasonal events: during the Festival of Saint Agatha, patron saint of the city, there are the cassatelle (small cassatas) and olivette (olive shaped almond paste). In Easter, there are aceddi ccu l\u2019ovu (boiled eggs covered in biscuit). In summer there is granita. During the Festa dei morti (traditional celebrations in All Souls' Day) there are biscuits called ossa di mortu, rame di Napoli and nsuddi.\nDrink kiosks are everywhere in town and serve soft drinks. Traditional soft drinks are made mixing fruit syrups with soda and other flavors such as anisette. They are thirst-killer and they are very popular with the locals and the tourists.\nLocal products include blood oranges, pistachios from Bronte, extra-virgin olive oil, cactus fruit, cherries, grapes from Mazzarrone, strawberries from Maletto, mushrooms, honey and wine.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nCatania has a commercial seaport (Catania seaport), an international airport (Catania Fontanarossa), a central railway station (Catania Centrale) and it is a main node of the Sicilian motorway system.\nThe motorways serving Catania are the A18 Messina-Catania and the A19 Palermo-Catania; extensions of the A18 going from Catania to Syracuse and to Gela are currently under construction.\nThe Circumetnea is a narrow-gauge railway that runs for 110 km (68 mi) from Catania round the base of Mount Etna. It attains the height of 976 m (3,202.10 ft) above sea level before descending to rejoin the coast at Giarre-Riposto to the North.\nIn the late 1990s the first line of an underground railway (Metropolitana di Catania) was built. The underground service started in 1999 and it is currently active on a route of 8.8 km (5.5 mi), from the station Nesima (West of town), passing through the stations of San Nullo, Cibali (still under construction), Milo, Borgo, Giuffrida, Italia, Galatea, Giovanni XXIII, to Stesicoro. These two stations, bringing Catania Underground in the city centre, have opened on 20 December 2016. First line is planned to extend from the satellite city of Patern\u00f2 to Fontanarossa Airport.\n\n\n=== Catania Public Transportation Statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Catania, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 56 min. 13% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

In 1823, Light had fondly written of Catania: \"The two principal streets cross each other at right angles in the square in the direction of north and south and east and west. They are wide and spacious and about a mile [1.6 km] long\". This became the basis for his plan of Adelaide.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAmico, Vito Maria (1740).

          "Sorry for the late review! I visited last year, and found the staff of the centre incredibly helpful. I'd heard that Julian was a mystic with a very forward-thinking religious attitude, and went to get a better understanding of who she was as a person. By talking to some of the",
          "Peaceful, small important church. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Norwich. Only takes about an hour to see. It's about a 10 - 15 minute walk from the centre of town. Better to time the visit to coinside when the Julian centre is also open. The volunteers manning the",
          "A peaceful place to visit. Both the church and cell are well worth exploring. St Julian\u2019s Centre is next door with information on the saint.",

          "A quiet oasis in a busy city. Lovely welcome. I had studied Julian of Norwich many years ago. So it was good to visit the shrine even though of course it has been changed and rebuilt.",
          "There is a visitor's centre and Mother Julian's cell is a short walk to the church. The volunteers at the visitor's centre were very welcoming and informative. This is an important place for religious and historical reasons.",
          "If you think 'I don't believe in God , I'm a scientist' Julian's radical thoughts may affect you. She lived in a tiny cell and contemplated some vivid experiences for many years. Her views on a loving God without anger or judgement are refreshing. The staff at the center are",
          "St Julian's church is a must for visitors to Norwich. Here we see the change in Julian as she had an illness and was close to death. We see the room where she spent a lot of time and a chapel which has been restored after bomb damage. One highlight is the Stations of the",
          "St. Julian's Shrine was an important place for me to visit if I ever got to England. I had read about Mother Julian, and a group of us held her in very high esteem for her scholarship and sacrifice. The church is a refuge in the city and her cell - which is open to the pubic- is",
          "I felt so privileged to visit St. Julian's Church and see where Revelations of Divine Love was written. I sat and drank a cup of tea with a hazelnut and perused through the numerous books and gifts. This is a hidden gem! I highly recommend making the journey.",
          "A few constructive criticisms: 1. There isn't much information available about the history of how and why the church and cell were rebuilt, and this is fascinating in its own right. I admit to being disappointed that it wasn't the actual church or cell, but at least it's the",
          "Excellent retreat day learning about Juluan of Norwich. Will definitely come agaun! Well organised and well run.",
          "We walked along the river and crossed over to get to St Julians church. It is one of the oldest in Norwich. The anchoress or female hermit lived there in the 14th century, and although the cell has been rebuilt it is a very peaceful and restful place.",
          "Today I came to St Julian's Shrine and the Julian Centre with a good friend visiting from Australia on a quick tour of Norwich. It was my second visit to the Shrine, and again found it an extraordinarily peaceful place to sit a while in the church and Mother Julian's cell, and",
          "Interesting example of Norwich's numerous small churches, and more so if you know about Julian of Norwich. I probably ought to mention that the church was rebuilt after WW2 bombing and there's a chapel on the site of Mother Julian's hermit cell, but please don't expect to see",
          "Had a wonderful few hours there, wonderful welcome at the centre. Shrine peaceful and inspiring. Why is it not advertised more? Loved it.",
          "Mother Julian was an anchoress who wrote down the visions she received following a life threatening illness. There is nothing flaky in her words, I am not religious and yet find they have common sense and meaning. Sitting in this lovely little church is calming and allows you to",

          "The small hermit's cell of Mother Julian of Norwich in St. Julian's Church is one of the most important things I have been fortunate to experience. To just sit quietly in it, and to communicate with her spirit, still there, has been a lasting memory my wife and I will always",
          "This is a lovely little place to visit for some peace tranquility and contemplation. The shrine was the home and cell of Dame Julian a who wrote of God's love as an anchoress removed from the world. Staffed by very friendly enthusiastic volunteers. Highly recommended when in",
          "Mywife and I love being able to visit St Julian's Shrine. It is a small place dedicated to the legacy of a woman who eloquently wrote of deep, abiding love during a time when women were not normally respected, when writing about God in English was suspect, and when normal people",
          "I had wanted to go to the Julian Shrine for some time. I finally managed to go. I was not disappointed. I am very fond of Julian, she was an amazing wise woman. The place is peaceful, the centre next door was helpful, the staff pleasant and cheerful. In all well worth a visit",
          "You should go to the St Julian Centre next door. We were made so welcome getting lots of help and advice on which were the best books to buy along with free coffee and biscuits. Thank you to all the volunteers you are very appreciated.",
          "We happened to visit this shrine by following the finger post signs in the city after finding a leaflet in the Cathedral.What a peaceful, spiritual place to be away from the traffic. St.Julian stayed in this church in a cell and was the first woman to write a book in English.",

          "This church was originally built around 1070 and is older than the Cathedral. It was almost completely destroyed in 1942 when it took a direct hit from a German bomb and what you see today contains some items rescued from the old church but the building had to be restored. This",
          "Mother Julian was inspirational, in the 1380's she was inspired from her cell in the church to preach the love for God, rather than the then-fashionable 'Fear God'. Sit in her cell and meditate. Lovely ladies in Julian Centre nearby for a tea and words. Very moving experience.",

          "It was very beautiful. There were many things to read or contemplate as well as buy, and they offered us free tea and biscuits. There was lovely artwork hanging around the room. The people that we met there were more than willing to help us, and had an answer to every question",
          "The only reason I give this attraction four stars instead of five, is the church has basically been rebuilt so most of what you see is a reconstruction. There was one place where we could see the original foundations. Not knowing anything about St. Julian, it was interesting to",
          "I went in the morning to the Shrine and stayed for a while by myself. The Shrine is lovely inside and sitting alone and lighting candles was what I wanted to do. I ran out of time and had to visit the bookshop on another day. The Shrine is rebuilt on the same site as the St.",

          "Church and visitor centre well worth a visit with a friendly and informative member of staff in the visitor centre.",

          "St. Julian's is a lovely quiet claming place. The story of St. Julian is both interesting and inspiring. Although we didn't get to see inside the cell, the small church is very easy to lose time in if you sit down. The surrounds invite you to let your mind wonder.",
          "Not immediately striking from the outside, but a wonderful atmosphere of peace inside, especially in the reconstructed 'anchorhold' cell , whilst the little walled garden is a lovely place to relax on a sunny day. Those staffing the adjacent Julian Centre are incredibly helpful",
          "Julian Centre staff are warmly welcoming, with lovely tea tray. Free wi-if so you can watch the YouTube documentary by Janina Ramirez Julian of Norwich on your tablet. Books for reference in and to purchase, Shirley provides an excellent tutorial and intro to Julian literature.",

          "This is my third or fourth visit to St Julian's, and the adjacent Julian Centre. Julian of Norwich was a most interesting woman and her writings are of great relevance to us today. To sit quietly in the shrine and feel the love of God around you is a marvellous experience and",
          "I travelled to Norwich by train from London to see this simple shrine to and experience the serenity I've felt in St Julian's writings and had a lovely, peaceful afternoon. The little chapel is very quaint and there is a feeling one gets just sitting quietly watching the light",
          "Reading about St Julian and others like her (yes, her) who became hermits (more or less) hundreds of years ago is a real eye-opener. We had the benefit of a lovely lady who came down the hill from the Visitor's Centre and talked to our little group for quite a while and answered",
          "We came across St Julian's Church by chance and how glad we were. Small but most welcoming with plenty of information and history, all in a great state of repair. The adjoining cell gives a sense of inner peace as we lit a candle. So glad to see holy water in the font.",
          "This had a calm atmosphere. There's not a lot to see but you can just sit in the rebuilt chapel and reflect on an extraordinary life. There's a religious bookshop attached.",

          "I have wanted to visit Julian's cell for many years. I t was very spiritual and all I had hoped. The people at the visitor centre near by , were welcoming and offered tea or coffee for a small donation .Many books about Julian's life and her showings for sale.",

          "If you know anything about Julian of Norwich, the shrine is very much worth a visit. I read her autobiography at uni and it was really interesting to see where she lived for the greater part of her life. It doesn't take very long to visit - 15-20 minutes is ideal - but is",
          "Julian of Norwich was the 14th/15th Century mystic who was the first woman to write a book in English ('Revelations of Divine Love'). The shrine provides a quiet space to reflect on her and her revelations in a peaceful space on the site where she lived as an anchorite in a",

          "This little church is beautiful. It is small and very compact, well cared for with a centre of information next door. She was a lady we admired for her objections to traditional man made church dogma. It's so good she is remembered with such a lovely place to visit. She needs",
          "A quiet contemplative place, reflecting its inspiration. It is what one hopes for when visiting a place of of spiritual resonance. This is where you can explore one of the more joyful sources of the tradition of mysticism in the West. We felt welcome by the person at the",
          "This is a truly spiritual and relaxing place to visit. It is steeped in history and has existed in Norwich for a long time as a special place for pilgrims. Julian's cell is so peaceful especially for troubled souls.",
          "Just a short walk, up St Julian's Lane from Dragon's Hall, is where you'll find the Church of St Julian, also known as St Julian's Shrine. The church looks as if it has stood since the Medieval times. A church has stood on the site since before the conquest (1066), however",

          "Chapel dedicated to Sf Julian who was a nun that lived in a small cell off the chapel, this has been repaired after war damage. St Julian recovered from serious illness and later became the first English woman to write a book. There is a visitor centre close to the chapel where",

          "A beautiful, peaceful respite in the modern hustle and bustle. Close to the Dragon Hall, this is the reconstructed building damaged in war time, of the mystic Julian of Norwich. Impressive in its simplicity and cared for with pride - I didn't venture into the shrine itself, but",
          "Nice little church situated on king st. One of around 130 churches in Norwich! This one had a Nun who lived in the little room at the back for most of her life. Church has beautiful windows and lovely carvings all around. Can you see the three dragons inside?",

          "This small church, with a post-war reconstruction of the cell of Dame Julian, is a wonderful place to learn about the life of that visionary woman of Christ. The attached gift- and book-shop has an excellent selection of books, with several different versions of Dame Julian's",
          "Quiet, contemplative - just what you'd expect. The adjacent shop has helpful staff with many resources about Julian.",

          "Julian's Shrine was rebuilt in the 20th century in tribute to the medieval anchoress and visionary who lived on this site over 600 years ago and wrote the earliest known book by a woman in English. Whatever your faith or background, it's a quiet and special place for",
          "This church was beautifully rebuilt after being bombed in World War II and contains the anchorite cell of St Julian. Now there is also an adjacent visitors centre which enhances the shrine and adds to its appeal. I found it to be an oasis of calm and sanity for which I would",
          "I like to follow my personal interests about mysticism and my daughter likes shopping and my husband likes are simple but include an easy route to destination. This past Thursaday we went to St Julian's Shrine in St Julians Church Norwich. amazingly all boxes were ticked,",

He began writing in his teens, producing the largely unpublished, but currently quite famous, historical novel Amore e Patria (Love and Country); then, although nominally studying law at the University of Catania, he used money his father had given him to publish his I carbonari della montagna (The Carbonari of the Mountain) in 1861 and 1862. This was followed by Sulle lagune (On the Lagoons) in 1863.\n\nMeanwhile, Verga had been serving in the Catania National Guard (1860\u201364), after which he travelled to Florence several times, settling there in 1869.\nHe moved to Milan in 1872, where he developed his new approach, characterized by the use of dialogue to develop character, which resulted in his most significant works. In 1880 his story collection Vita dei campi (Life in the Fields), including \"Fantasticheria\" (\"Daydreaming\"), \"La lupa\" (\"The She-wolf\"), \"Jeli il pastore\" (\"Jeli the Shepherd\"), \"Pentolaccia\" (\"The Plaything\"), and Rosso Malpelo, most of which were about rural Sicily, came out. It also included \"Cavalleria rusticana\" (\"Rustic Chivalry\"), which he adapted for the theatre and later formed the basis for several opera librettos including Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana and Gastaldon's Mala Pasqua!. Verga's short story, \"Malaria\", was one of the first literary depictions of the disease malaria.\nHe then embarked on a projected series of five novels, but only completed two, I Malavoglia and Mastro-don Gesualdo (1889), the second of which was the last major work of his literary career. Both are widely recognized as masterpieces.\nIn 1894 Verga moved back to Catania, to the house in which he had lived as a child.

        "wiki": "Catania (UK: , US: , Sicilian and Italian: [ka\u02c8ta\u02d0nja] (listen)) is the second largest city in Sicily, after Palermo, and among the ten largest cities in Italy. Located on Sicily\u2019s east coast, it faces the Ionian Sea. It is the capital of the 58-municipality region known as the Metropolitan City of Catania, which is the seventh-largest metropolitan city in Italy. The population of the city proper is 311,584, while the population of the Metropolitan City of Catania is 1,107,702.Catania was founded in the 8th century BC by Chalcidians Greeks. The city was almost completely destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake in 1169.However, by the 14th century, and into the Renaissance period, Catania was one of Italy's most important cultural, artistic and political centres. It was the site of Sicily\u2019s first university, founded in 1434. It has been the native or adopted home of some of Italy's most famous artists and writers, including the composers Vincenzo Bellini and Giovanni Pacini, and the writers Giovanni Verga, Luigi Capuana, Federico De Roberto and Nino Martoglio.\nThe city has been devastated several times by volcanic eruptions from nearby Mount Etna, the most violent of which was in 1669. And it suffered through another severely damaging earthquake in 1693.Catania today is the industrial, logistical, and commercial center of Sicily. Its airport, the Catania-Fontanarossa Airport, is the largest in Southern Italy. \nHowever, it is also noted for its history, culture, architecture, and gastronomy. The section of the city known as the \u201cold town\u201d features some of the most striking examples of baroque architecture in Italy, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe ancient indigenous population of the Sicels named their villages after geographical attributes of their location. The Sicilian word, katane, means \"grater, flaying knife, skinning place\" or a \"crude tool apt to pare\". Other translations of the name are \"harsh lands\", \"uneven ground\", \"sharp stones\", or \"rugged or rough soil\". The latter etymologies are easily justifiable since, for many centuries following an eruption, the city has always been rebuilt within its black-lava landscape.Around 263 BC, the city was variously known as Cat\u012dna (Latin: [\u02c8kat\u026ana]) and Cat\u0103na (Latin: [\u02c8katana]; Ancient Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7 [kat\u00e1n\u025b\u02d0]). The former has been primarily used for its supposed assonance with catina, the Latin feminization of the name catinus. Catinus has two meanings: \"a gulf, a basin or a bay\" and \"a bowl, a vessel or a trough\",  thanks to the city's distinctive topography.\nAround 900, when Catania was part of the emirate of Sicily, it was known in Arabic as Balad al-f\u012bl (\u0628\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644) and Mad\u012bnat al-f\u012bl (\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0644), respectively meaning \"the Village (or Country) of the Elephant\" and \"the City of the Elephant\". The Elephant is the lava sculpture over the fountain in Piazza Duomo: most likely a prehistoric sculpture that was reforged during the Byzantine Era, it appears to be a talisman that was reputedly powerful enough to protect the city from enemies and to keep away misfortune, plagues, or natural calamities. Another Arab toponym was Qa\u1e6d\u0101niyyah (\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629), allegedly from the Arabic word for the \"leguminous plants\". Pulses like lentils, beans, peas, broad beans, and lupins were chiefly cultivated in the plains around the city well before the arrival of Aghlabids. Afterwards, many Arabic agronomists  developed these crops and the citrus orchards in the area around the city.\nThe toponym W\u0101d\u012b M\u016bs\u00e1 (\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0649), or \"the Valley of Moses\" (from the Arabic name of the Simeto River), was rarely used.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCatania is located on the east coast of the island of Sicily, at the foot of Mount Etna.\nAs observed by Strabo, the location of Catania at the foot of Mount Etna has been both a curse and a blessing. On the one hand, violent outbursts of the volcano throughout history have destroyed large parts of the city, whilst on the other hand the volcanic ashes yield fertile soil, especially suited for the growth of vines. (Strab. vi. p. 269)\nTwo subterranean rivers run under the city; the Amenano, which surfaces at one single point south of Piazza Duomo, and the Longane (or Lognina).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Csa\" (Mediterranean Climate). It has hot summers, one of the hottest in the whole country of Italy (a feature characterising nearly every month). Temperatures of 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) are surpassed almost every year a couple of times,Winters are mild with chilly nights (not rare peaks around 20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F) . Most of precipitation is concentrated from October to March, leaving late spring and summer virtually dry (some years there is no rain for 3\u20134 months). The city receives around 500 millimetres (20 inches) of rain per year, although the amount can vary greatly from year to year (wettest over 1,200 millimetres or 47 inches, driest under 250 millimetres or 9.8 inches,).\nDuring winter nights lows can occasionally go under 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Highs under 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) can happen during winter. Snow, due to the presence of Etna that protects the city from the northern winds, is an uncommon occurrence, but occasional snow flurries have been seen over the recent years especially in the hilly districts, more substantial in the northern hinterland. More recently, light snowfalls occurred on 9 February 2015, 6 January 2017 and 5 January 2019, but the last heavy snowfall dates back to 17 December 1988.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn January 2015, there were 315,601 people residing in Catania, of whom 47.2% were male and 52.8% were female. Minors (people under age 18) totalled 20.50 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 18.87 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners).\nThe average age of Catania residents is 41 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Catania declined by 3.35 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85 percent. The reason for this population decline in the comune di Catania is mainly due to a large segment of the population leaving the city centre to go to live in the uptown residential areas of the comuni of the Metropolitan area. As a result of this, while the population in the comune di Catania declines, the population of the hinterland comuni increases making the overall population of the Metropolitan area increase.The current birth rate of Catania is 10.07 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births. As of 2006, 98.03% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant groups come from Sub-Saharan Africa: 0.69%, South Asia: 0.46%, and from other European countries (particularly from Ukraine and Poland): 0.33%.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nAround 729 BC, the ancient village of Katane was occupied by Chalcidian Greek settlers from nearby Naxos along the coast. It became the Chalcidian colony of Kat\u00e1n\u0113 under a leader named Euarchos (Euarchus) and the native population was rapidly Hellenised.\nThucydides states that it came into existence slightly later than Leontini (modern Lentini), which he claims was five years after Syracuse, or 730 BC.The settlement's acropolis was on the hill of Monte Vergine, a defensible hill immediately west of the current city centre. The port of Catania appears to have been much frequented in ancient time and was the chief place of export for the corn of the rich neighbouring plains.\n\n\n=== Greek Catania ===\nIn ancient times Catania was associated with the legend of Amphinomos and Anapias, who, on occasion of a great eruption of Etna, abandoned all their property and carried off their aged parents on their shoulders. The stream of lava itself was said to have parted, and flowed aside so as not to harm them. Statues were erected to their honour, and the place of their burial was known as the Campus Piorum; the Catanaeans even introduced the figures of the youths on their coins, and the legend became a favorite subject of allusion and declamation among the Latin poets, of whom the younger Lucilius and Claudian have dwelt upon it at considerable length.Catania was the birthplace of the philosopher and legislator Charondas (late 6th c. BC) who introduced his celebrated laws there. His legislation was extended to the other Chalcidic cities, not only of Sicily, but of Magna Graecia also, as well as to his own country. It is evident that Catania had close relations with these other cities during this time.\nIt was residence of the poets Ibycus and Stesichorus (c. 630\u2013555 BC), who was buried in a magnificent sepulchre outside one of the gates, hence its name of Porta Stesichoreia. Xenophanes (c. 570-475 BC), one of the founders of the Eleatic school of philosophy, also spent the latter years of his life in the city so that it was evidently, at an early period, a place of cultivation and refinement.\nCatania appears to have retained its independence up to the reign of the despot Hieron of Syracuse, whereupon in 476 BC he expelled all the original inhabitants of Catania and replaced them with those he ruled over at Leontini \u2013 said to have numbered no less than 10,000, consisting partly of Syracusans and Peloponnesians. At the same time he changed the city's name to \u0391\u1f34\u03c4\u03bd\u03b7 (A\u00edtn\u0113, Aetna or \u00c6tna, after the nearby Mount Etna, and proclaimed himself the Oekist or founder of the new city. For this he was celebrated by Pindar, and after his death he received heroic honours from the citizens of his new colony.A few years after the death of Hieron and the expulsion of Thrasybulus, the Syracusans combined with Ducetius, king of the Sicels, to expel the newly settled inhabitants of Catania, who went on to settle in the fortress of Inessa (to which they gave the name Aetna). The old Chalcidic citizens were reinstated to the city in 461 BC.The period that followed appears to have been one of great prosperity for Catania, as well as for the Sicilian cities in general.\nIn the Peloponnesian War during the great Athenian expedition to Sicily  in 415 BC, the Catanaeans at first refused to allow the Athenians into their city, but after the latter had forced an entrance, they found themselves compelled to honour the alliance of their invaders after a famous speech that Alcibiades would have made in front of the assembly. Catania became the headquarters of the Athenian army throughout the first year of the expedition, and the base of their subsequent operations against Syracuse. After the defeat of the Athenians it was open to attack by Syracuse but was saved by the Carthaginian invasion of Sicily in 409 BC.\nBut in 403 BC it fell into the power of Dionysius I of Syracuse, who plundered the city and sold its citizens as slaves, after which he populated it with Campanian mercenaries. These, however, quit in 396 BC and retired to Aetna, on the approach of the great Carthaginian armament under Himilco and Mago. After the great naval Battle of Catana (397 BC) which was fought off Catania and in which the latter defeated Leptines of Syracuse, the city fell into the hands of the Carthaginians.Calippus, the assassin of Dion of Syracuse, held Catania for a time (Plut. Dion. 58); and when Timoleon landed in Sicily in 344 BC Catania was subject to the despot Mamercus who at first joined the Corinthian leader, but afterwards abandoned this allegiance for that of the Carthaginians. As a consequence he was attacked and expelled by Timoleon in 338 BC.Catania was now restored to liberty, and appears to have continued to retain its independence; during the wars of Agathocles of Syracuse from 311 BC with the Carthaginians, it sided at one time with the former, at others with the latter; and when Pyrrhus landed in Sicily in 278 BC, Catania was the first to open its gates to him, and received him with the great splendour.The first introduction of dancing to accompany the flute was also ascribed to Andron, a citizen of Catania.\n\n\n=== Roman rule ===\nIn the First Punic War Catania was one of the first cities of Sicily to submit to the Roman Republic after their first successes in 263 BC when it was taken by Valerius Messalla. A sundial was part of the booty which was placed in the Comitium in Rome. Since then the city became a civitas decumana i.e. was subject to the payment of a tenth of its agricultural income as a tax to Rome. The conqueror of Syracuse, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, built a gymnasium here.It appears to have continued afterwards to maintain its friendly relations with Rome and though it did not enjoy the advantages of a confederate city (foederata civitas), like its neighbours Tauromenium (modern Taormina) and Messana (modern Messina), it rose to a position of great prosperity under the Roman rule.\nAround 135 BC during the First Servile War, it was conquered by rebel slaves.One of the most serious eruptions of Mount Etna happened in 121 BC, when a great part of Catania was overwhelmed by streams of lava, and the hot ashes fell in such quantities in the city itself, as to break in the roofs of the houses. Catana was in consequence exempted, for 10 years, from its usual contributions to the Roman state. The greater part of the broad tract of plain to the southwest of Catana (now called the Piana di Catania, a district of great fertility), appears to have belonged, in ancient times, to Leontini or Centuripa (modern Centuripe), but that portion of it between Catana itself and the mouth of the Symaethus was annexed to Catana and must have furnished abundant supplies of grain.\nCicero repeatedly mentions it as, in his time, a wealthy and flourishing city; it retained its ancient municipal institutions, its chief magistrate bearing the title of Proagorus; and appears to have been one of the principal ports of Sicily for the export of corn.In the Sicilian revolt from 44 BC Sextus Pompeius selected Sicily as his base and Catania gave in to Sextus' revolt and joined his forces. Sextus amassed a formidable army and a large fleet of warships at his base at Messana, with many slaves joining from the villas of patricians. After the victory of Augustus in 36 BC much of the vast farmland in Sicily was either ruined or left empty, and much of this land was taken and distributed to members of the legions which had fought there. Catania suffered severely from the ravages but was afterwards one of the cities raised to the status of colony by Augustus which restored its prosperity through the settlement of veterans, so that in Strabo's time it was one of the few cities in the island that was flourishing.Another revolt led by the gladiator Selurus in 35 BC created mayhem for a while.The Roman aqueduct of Catania was the largest in Roman Sicily at 24 km length starting from the springs of Santa Maria di Licodia.\nIt retained its colonial rank, as well as its prosperity, throughout the period of the Roman Empire; so that in the 4th century Ausonius in his Ordo Nobilium Urbium, notices Catania and Syracuse alone among the cities of Sicily.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nCatania was sacked by the Vandals of Gaiseric in 440\u2013441. After a period under the Ostrogoths, it was reconquered in 535 by the Eastern Roman Empire, under which (aside from a short period in 550\u2013555) it remained until the 9th century. It was the seat of the Byzantine governor of the island.\nCatania was under the Islamic emirate of Sicily until 1072, when it fell to the Normans of Roger I of Sicily. Subsequently, the city was ruled by a bishop-count. In 1194\u20131197 the city was sacked by German soldiers during after the conquest of the island by emperor Henry VI. In 1232 it rebelled to the former's son, Frederick II, who later built a massive castle, Castello Ursino and also made Catania a royal city, ending the dominance of the bishops. Catania was one of the main centers of the Sicilian Vespers revolt (1282) against the House of Anjou, and was the seat of the incoronation of the new Aragonese king of Sicily, Peter I. In the 14th century it gained importance as it was chosen by the Aragonese as a Parliament and Royal seat. Here, in 1347, it was signed the treaty of peace that ended the long War of the Vesper between Aragonese and Angevines. Catania lost its capital role when, in the early 15th century, Sicily was turned into a member of the Crown of Aragon, and kept its autonomy and original privileges specially during the period from 1282 to 1410.\nIn 1434 King Alfonso V founded here the Siciliae Studium Generale, the oldest university in the island.\n\n\n=== Early Modern times ===\n\nWith the unification of Castile and Aragon (early 16th century), Sicily became part of the Spanish Empire. It rebelled against the foreign government in 1516 and 1647.In 1669 the city's surroundings suffered great material damage from the 1669 Etna eruption. The city itself was largely saved by its walls that diverted most of the lava into the port. Afterwards in 1693 the city was then completely destroyed by a heavy earthquake and its aftershocks. The city was then rebuilt in the Baroque architecture that nowadays characterizes it.\n\n\n=== Unified Italy ===\nCatania was one of the vanguards of the movement for the Sicilian autonomy in the early 19th century.\nIn 1860 Giuseppe Garibaldi's expedition of the Thousand conquered Sicily for Piedmont from the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Since the following year Catania was part of the newly unified Italy, whose history it shares since then.\n During World War II, Catania was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces, owing to the presence of two of the main Axis airfields in Sicily (Gerbini and Fontanarossa) and for its strategically important port and marshalling yard. Altogether, the city suffered eighty-seven air raids. The heaviest raids took place in the spring and summer of 1943, before and during the Allied invasion of Sicily; they caused heavy damage to che city (among others, twenty-eight churches and most historic palaces suffered damage), killed 750 inhabitants and prompted most of the population to flee to the countryside. After heavy fighting across eastern Sicily, Catania was eventually captured by the British 8th Army on 5 August 1943.After the conflict, and the constitution of the Italian Republic (1946), Catania attempted to catch up with the economic and social development of Italy's richer northern regions. The problems faced in Catania were emblematic of those faced by other towns in the Mezzogiorno, namely a heavy gap in industrial development and infrastructures, and the threat of the mafia. This notwithstanding, during the 1960s (and partly during the 1990s) Catania enjoyed development and a period of economic, social and cultural success. In the first decade of the 21st century, Catania's economic and social development somewhat faltered and the city is again facing economic and social stagnation. This was aggravated by the economical crisis left by the Forza Italia administration of mayor Scapagnini in 2008.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Metropolitan City ===\n\nThe Metropolitan City of Catania was established in 2015 and replaced the former Province of Catania. It includes the city proper and 57 comuni (municipalities). The population of the Metropolitan City is 1,107,702.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe Metropolitan area of Catania includes the comune of Catania (311,584 inhabitants) and 26 surrounding comuni forming an urban belt (498,650 inhabitants). The total population of the Metropolitan area of Catania is therefore 810,234. The comuni of the Metropolitan area are:\n\nThese comuni form a system with the centre of Catania sharing its economical and social life and creating an organic urban texture.\n\n\n=== City proper ===\nThe city of Catania proper (comune di Catania) is divided in six administrative areas called circoscrizioni. The current administrative setup was established in 2013, modifying previous setups dating back to 1971, 1978 and 1995.\nThe six areas are:\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nThe symbol of the city is u Liotru, or the Fontana dell'Elefante, assembled in 1736 by Giovanni Battista Vaccarini. It portrays an ancient lavic stone elephant and is topped by an Egyptian obelisk from Syene. Legend has it that Vaccarini's original elephant was neuter, which the men of Catania took as an insult to their virility. To appease them, Vaccarini appropriately appended elephantine testicles to the original statue.\nThe Sicilian name u Liotru is a phonetic change of Heliodorus, a nobleman who, after trying without success to become bishop of the city, became a sorcerer and was therefore condemned to the stake. Legend has it that Heliodorus himself was the sculptor of the lava elephant and that he used to magically ride it in his fantastic travels from Catania to Constantinople. Another legend has it that Heliodorus was able to transform himself into an elephant.\nThe presence of an elephant in the millenary history of Catania is surely connected to both zooarcheology and popular creeds. In fact, the prehistoric fauna of Sicily from the Upper Paleolithic, included dwarf elephants. Paleontologist Othenio Abel suggested that the presence of dwarf elephants in Sicily may be the origin of the legend of the Cyclops. Ancient Greeks, after finding the skulls of dwarf elephants, about twice the size of a human skull, with a large central nasal cavity (mistaken for a large single eye-socket) supposed that they were skulls of giants with a single eye.\nThe Catanian Museum of Mineralogy, Paleontology and Vulcanology holds the integral unburied skeleton of an Elephas falconeri in an excellent state of conservation. The first inhabitants of Etna  molded such lavic artifact to idolize the mythical proboscidian.\n\n\n=== Classical buildings ===\nThe city has been buried by lava a total of seventeen times in recorded history, and in layers under the present day city are the Roman city that preceded it, and the Greek city before that. Many of the ancient monuments of the Roman city have been destroyed by the numerous seisms. Currently, different ancient remains can be seen and visited in the city-centre, as part of an archaeological park (Parco Archeologico Greco-Romano di Catania).\n\nAncient edifices include:\n\nGreek-Roman Theatre of Catania (2nd century)\nOdeon (3rd century). It could house up to 1500 spectators\nAmphitheatre\nGreek Acropolis of Montevergine\nRoman Aqueduct\nRoman Forum\nRoman broken arcades\nChristian basilicas, hypogea, burial monuments and Catacombs\nRoman Colonnade\n\n\n=== Roman thermal structures ===\nAchillean Baths\nTerme dell\u2019Indirizzo\nTerme di Santa Maria Odigitria\nTerme della Rotonda\nBaths of the Four Quoins\nTerme di Palazzo Asmundo\nTerme del Palazzo dell\u2019Universit\u00e0\nTerme di Casa Gagliano\nTerme della Chiesa di Sant'Antonio Abate\n\n\n=== Baroque and historical churches ===\n\nThe Baroque city centre of Catania is a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nThe Cathedral (1070\u20131093, rebuilt after the 1693 earthquake)\nSaint Agatha Abbey (1620)\nSaint Placidus (1769)\nChurch of San Giuseppe al Duomo\nChurch of Santissimo Sacramento al Duomo\nChurch of San Martino dei Bianchi\nChurch of Sant'Agata la Vetere (254)\nSaint Agatha by the Furnace or Saint Blaise (1098, rebuilt in 1700)\nChurch of the Saint Jail or Saint Agatha at the Jail (Santo Carcere or Sant'Agata al Carcere) (1760).

In its close vicinities there is a cylindric tower, known as Saint Mary's Tower (Torre Santa Maria), which was restructured in the 16th century to prevent the frequent plunders of the Saracen pirates. The church is the result of the gradual modification of the Greek Temple Athena Longatis or Parthenos Longatis that existed on the steep reef. This cult was imported from a Boeotian region of Greece called Longas from where the first Hellenic settlers of this borough probably came. After the earthquake of 1693 it was rebuilt on the same place but with a different orientation.\nOur Lady of Montserrat (1755)\nChurch of  Santa Maria della Salute\nSaint Mary of La Salette\nChurch of Santa Maria della Mercede\nChurch of Santa Caterina al Rinazzo\nOur Lady of Concordia\nChurch of Santa Maria della Guardia\nOur Lady of Consolation\nChurch of Santissimo Crocifisso Maiorana\nCrucifix of Miracles\nCrucifix of Good Death\nOur Lady of La Mecca\nSaint Cajetan at the Marina\nMost Holy Redeemer\nSaint Francis of Paola\nChurch of the Divina Maternit\u00e0\nChapel of Mary Auxiliatrix\nChapel of the Sacred Heart of Jesus\nChurch of the Sacro Cuore al Fortino (1898)\nSaints George and Denis\nChurch of the Sacred Heart of the Capuchins\nSaint Christopher\nSaints Cosmas and Damian\nChurch of Santa Maria del Soccorso or Santa Maria della Palma\nSaint Vitus\nChurch of the Santi Angeli Custodi\nChurch of the Santissimo Salvatore\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nUrsino Castle, built by emperor Frederick II in the 13th century.\nPalace of the Elephants, designed by Giovan Battista Vaccarini.

The city is famous for its mainly petrochemical industry, and the extraction of sulphur. In the year 2000, according to Census, Catania was the 14th richest city in Italy, with a GDP of US$6.6 billion (\u20ac6.304 billion), which was 0.54% of the Italian GDP, a GDP per capita of US$21,000 (\u20ac20,100) and an average GDP per employee of US$69,000 (\u20ac66,100).In the late-19th century and early-20th century, Catania began to be heavily industrialised, with its several factories and chimneys, often to the extant that it was referred to as Southern Italy's \"Manchester\". The economy of Catania suffered heavily from the bad effects of World War I, and was marked by an economic crisis and recession that culminated in the 1920s. Since then, the city lost its industrial and entrepreneurial importance. In the 1930s, Catania remained a small fishing town with derelict and disused industries. However, after the destruction of World War II, Catania's economy began to re-grow in the late-1950s and early-1960s. As a matter of fact, the city's economic growth was so rapid and dynamic that it was often nicknamed the \"Milan of the South\", or in Italian \"Milano del Sud\". This rapid economic growth prompted a great number of Sicilians living in the more rural areas, or smaller towns such as Enna, Ragusa and Caltanissetta, to move to the city to seek new jobs.\nToday, Catania, despite several problems, has one of the most dynamic economies in the whole of Southern Italy. It still has a strong industrial and agricultural sector, and a fast-growing tourist industry, with many international visitors coming to visit the city's main sights and the nearby Etna volcano. It contains the headquarters or important offices of companies such as STMicroelectronics, and also several chemical and pharmaceutical businesses. There have been several new business developments to further boost Catania's economy, including the construction of Etnapolis, a big shopping mall designed by Massimiliano Fuksas, the same architect who designed the FieraMilano industrial fair in Milan, or the Etna Valley, where several high-tech offices are located.\nTourism is a fast-growing industry in Catania. Lately the administration and private companies have made several investments in the hospitality industry in order to make tourism a competitive sector in the Metropolitan City. Etnaland, a big amusement and water park located in Belpasso, in the Metropolitan area of Catania, 12 kilometers (7 miles) from the city center, is the largest in Southern Italy and attracts thousands of tourists, not only from Sicily, but also from the rest of Italy: according to Tripadvisor (2018) it is the third water park in Europe.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Catania dates back to 1434 and it is the oldest university in Sicily. Its academic nicknames are: Siculorum Gymnasium and Siciliae Studium Generale. Nowadays it hosts 12 faculties and over 62,000 students, and it offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.\nCatania hosts the Scuola Superiore, an academic institution linked to the University of Catania, aimed at the excellence in education. The Scuola Superiore di Catania also offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs.Apart from the University and the Scuola Superiore Catania is base of the prestigious Istituto Musicale Vincenzo Bellini an advanced institute of musical studies (Conservatory) and the Accademia di Belle Arti an advanced institute of artistic studies. Both institutions offer programs of university level for musical and artistic education.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe opera composer Vincenzo Bellini was born in Catania, and a museum exists at his birthplace.\nThe Teatro Massimo \"Vincenzo Bellini\", which opened in 1890, is named after the composer. The opera house presents a variety of operas through a season, which run from December to May, many of which are the work of Bellini.\nGiovanni Verga was born in Catania in 1840. He became the greatest writer of Verismo, an Italian literary movement akin to Naturalism. His novels portray life among the lower levels of Sicilian society, such as fishermen and stonemasons, and were written in a mixture of both literary language and local dialect. Francesco Longo Mancini was a painter known for paintings of nudes who was born in Catania in 1880.\n\nThe city's patron saint is Saint Agatha, who is celebrated with a religious pageantry, the Festival of Saint Agatha, on February 5 every year.\nThe city is base of the newspaper La Sicilia and of the TV-channel Antenna Sicilia also known as Sicilia Channel. Several others local television channels and free-press magazines have their headquarters in Catania.\nThe city is home to the Catania Jazz Festival, which typically runs for several winter months with concerts in different locations.\nIn the late 1980s and during the 1990s Catania had a sparkling and unique popular music scene. Indie pop and indie rock bands, local radio station and dynamic independent music record labels sprung. As a result, in those years the city experienced a vital and effervescent cultural period. Artists like Carmen Consoli and Mario Venuti and internationally known indie rock bands like Uzeda came out of this cultural milieu.\nThe city is the home of Amatori Catania rugby union team, Calcio Catania football team and Orizzonte Catania, the latter being a women's water polo club, winning eight European Champions Cup titles from 1994 to 2008. Noted Italian basketball coach Ettore Messina is a native of Catania. The city also hosted the first ever qualification tournament for the Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1992, and the associated Etna Cup, which was won by the host Sicily team. In addition, the Catania Elephants are currently members of the Italian Football League. Catania also hosted the 2011 FIE Fencing World Championships.\n\n\n== Food and cuisine ==\n\nFood is an important part of Catania's culture and way of life. Local cuisine emphasizes several traits of Sicilian one, whilst developing some of its own.\nStreet food is one of the best ways to experience traditional dishes. Arancini are perhaps the city's most iconic one: they are stuffed rice balls coated in bread-crumbs and deep fried; in Catania, they are shaped like a cone to remind of Mount Etna. Typical specialties from the city include cipollina (puff pastry with onion, tomato and prosciutto filling), bolognese (a small pizza topped with tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto and boiled egg and covered in puff pastry), crispelle (deep fried dough balls with ricotta or anchovies filling.)\nDuring street-fairs and religious festivals, street stalls sell calia e simenza (toasted chickpeas and pumpkin seeds). Typical from old street markets are sangeli (cooked pork blood), quarumi (pork tripe), zuzzu (pork jelly), mauru (edible seaweed), and raw seafood. Horse meat is very traditional and it is sold in shops called arrusti e mancia (\"roast it and eat it\"), which roast the meat in streetside barbecues.Apart from street food, typical dishes from Catania are: pasta alla Norma (pasta with fried eggplant, tomato sauce and ricotta salata cheese), named after the namesake opera by Vincenzo Bellini; pasta cco niuru (pasta in cuttlefish ink), maccu (fava beans pur\u00e9e), bastaddi affucati or brocculi affucati (stewed cauliflower or broccoli), caponata (saut\u00e9ed vegetables) and scacciata (a pie filled with tuma cheese) which is traditional during Christmastime.Catania is also famous for its pasticceria (pastries and cakes). Pastries vary according to season and to seasonal events: during the Festival of Saint Agatha, patron saint of the city, there are the cassatelle (small cassatas) and olivette (olive shaped almond paste). In Easter, there are aceddi ccu l\u2019ovu (boiled eggs covered in biscuit). In summer there is granita. During the Festa dei morti (traditional celebrations in All Souls' Day) there are biscuits called ossa di mortu, rame di Napoli and nsuddi.\nDrink kiosks are everywhere in town and serve soft drinks. Traditional soft drinks are made mixing fruit syrups with soda and other flavors such as anisette. They are thirst-killer and they are very popular with the locals and the tourists.\nLocal products include blood oranges, pistachios from Bronte, extra-virgin olive oil, cactus fruit, cherries, grapes from Mazzarrone, strawberries from Maletto, mushrooms, honey and wine.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nCatania has a commercial seaport (Catania seaport), an international airport (Catania Fontanarossa), a central railway station (Catania Centrale) and it is a main node of the Sicilian motorway system.\nThe motorways serving Catania are the A18 Messina-Catania and the A19 Palermo-Catania; extensions of the A18 going from Catania to Syracuse and to Gela are currently under construction.\nThe Circumetnea is a narrow-gauge railway that runs for 110 km (68 mi) from Catania round the base of Mount Etna. It attains the height of 976 m (3,202.10 ft) above sea level before descending to rejoin the coast at Giarre-Riposto to the North.\nIn the late 1990s the first line of an underground railway (Metropolitana di Catania) was built. The underground service started in 1999 and it is currently active on a route of 8.8 km (5.5 mi), from the station Nesima (West of town), passing through the stations of San Nullo, Cibali (still under construction), Milo, Borgo, Giuffrida, Italia, Galatea, Giovanni XXIII, to Stesicoro. These two stations, bringing Catania Underground in the city centre, have opened on 20 December 2016. First line is planned to extend from the satellite city of Patern\u00f2 to Fontanarossa Airport.\n\n\n=== Catania Public Transportation Statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Catania, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 56 min. 13% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 23 min, while 46% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.7 km, while 3% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nAaron ben Gershon abu al-Rabi, 15th century rabbi\nOriana Bandiera (1971\u2013), economist and academic\nPippo Baudo (1936-), TV presenter\nFranco Battiato (1945-), singer-songwriter, composer, filmmaker\nGianni Bella (1947-), singer-songwriter\nMarcella Bella (1952-), singer\nVincenzo Bellini (1801\u20131835), composer\nOrnella Bertorotta (1967-) politician\nGiuseppa Bolognara Calcagno (1826\u20131884), freedom fighter of the Risorgimento\nVitaliano Brancati (1907\u20131954), writer\nLuigi Capuana (1839\u20131915), writer\nCharondas (6th c.

In 1823, Light had fondly written of Catania: \"The two principal streets cross each other at right angles in the square in the direction of north and south and east and west. They are wide and spacious and about a mile [1.6 km] long\". This became the basis for his plan of Adelaide.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAmico, Vito Maria (1740).

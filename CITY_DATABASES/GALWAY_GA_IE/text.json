        "wiki": "The Spanish Arch (Irish: An P\u00f3irse) and the Cao\u010b Arch (Irish: An P\u00f3irse Cao\u010b, \"blind arch\") in Galway city, Ireland, are two remaining arches on the Ceann an Bhalla (\"Front Wall\"). The two arches were part of the extension of the city wall from Martin's Tower to the bank of the River Corrib, as a measure to protect the city's quays, which were in the area once known as the Fish Market (now Spanish Parade). It was constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin in 1584, being called ceann an bhalla (the head of the wall).\nIn the 18th century the Eyre family of Eyrecourt, County Galway, created an extension of the quays called The Long Walk and created the arches to allow access from the town to the new quays. The designation \"Spanish\" is not historical to this period and was likely known as the Eyre Arch when built. \n\nIn 1755, the arches were partially destroyed by the tsunami generated by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.\nUntil 2006, part of the Arch housed the Galway City Museum. At that time, the museum was moved to a new, dedicated building located just behind the Arch.\nThe Long Walk is a promenade to one side of the Arches.\n\n\n== Cultural depictions ==\nAs a historical landmark, the Spanish Arch appears in several media works set in Galway, including the 1957 film The Rising of the Moon.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"History of Galway\", James Hardiman, 1820\n\"Old Galway\", Maureen Donovan O'Sullivan, 1942\nThe Tribes of Galway 1124-1642\", Adrian Martyn, 2016\n\n\n== External links ==\nGalway.Net Guide - Spanish Arch",

          "The arch is located at the bottom on quay street on the banks of the river. Plenty of activity in the area by way of restaurants and bars. Id consider this more of a meeting point than an attraction so to speak.",
          "This a sample of 16th century Galway construction attached to some medieval wall. It is another reminder of earlier history.",
          "Down by the harbor, this is a stone wall that was built by the Romans. There is a museum nearby. The wall is amazing because of its age, and the whole area is beautiful. The museum is excellent, too.",
          "The Spanish Arch dates from medieval times, at least since the Norman Conquest, perhaps earlier. No-one seems to know for certain why it is called \"Spanish,\" It's near the river, the surrounding area is quite lively The Spanish Arch is a \"been there, done that\" sort of place.",
          "The Spanish arch - stone wall built to protect the city is still there after all these years Behind the wall a vibrant district Buskers, a market, shops, colourful buildings- a very pretty area Must see if your in Galway",
          "It is on the river and interesting for its location but that is about all. The nearby museum is worth a look.",
          "What you see in the picture above is all there is to see. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying not to see it, but schedule is at a destination to see between other destinations. You'll see it, take a picture and move on.",
          "You can't miss the Spanish Arch if you are strolling along the waterfront. It is a distinctive monument near Latin Quarter and heart of tourist section. We could even see it from our Jury's hotel room. The views from the area of Bay were nice. Definitely make a quick stop to",
          "Great place for scenic views, photos, and people watching. Part of the ancient city wall by the river and a short walk to some great pubs.",
          "The Spanish Arch from the 16th century is the remains and reminder of the medieval wall that protected the merchant ships docked in the harbor. A fine place to rest and watch the River Corrib and the fishing ships. Ard Bia at Nimmo is close by and well worth a meal.",
          "Fortunately, we do our homework before travelling, but the site could use better signage. BTW, you need to understand what the arch represents, not just what it looks like. The arch was built in the 16th century as an extension of the city walls to protect ships from looters,",
          "As ruins go, this isn't much. Certainly not enough to go out of your way to see. However, it does sit beside a wonderful riverbank that makes the perfect place to plant yourself and watch the world go by.",
          "Good for few cans with timo tbh always get sick on the arch though so would rate 14/19 ba bo bey bo do ba ba",
          "It is a cool piece or architechture. It is near the bay and inlet, so it is a nice area to walk around. I would definitely suggest a walk about around there.",
          "A lovely historical and scenic place in Galway. A cute hungry seal, lots of seagulls and rainbow - all painted a perfect picture of Galway in our memory. The fishermen gave us some leftover fish bones to feed the seal. It was entertaining. Very close to the city center.",
          "There isn\u2019t a lot to see at the Spanish Arch in Galway, but when you know of the history of the arch and how it related to Galway\u2019s trade history, the story becomes more interesting. It really would be cool to have been able to see the port in its heyday, with the arch and the",
          "We arrived from Dublin with expectations of a lovely apartment. This was very quickly forgotten. The owner made no contact with us for the take over of the accommodation. We had to call him. After finally gaining entry, the first thing we noticed found was the smell, Damp. One",
          "The Spanish Arch is an impressive remnant from medieval Galway. Sitting along the Quay, it may be easy to miss, but it's part of a beautiful waterfront walk, and I would definitely recommend visiting.",
          "Galway Museum sits behind this historical place. It is worth to go there and just walk underneath it.",
          "Maybe we were there at the wrong time of day, but there didn't seem to be much to see compared with the River Corrib, the rest of Galway and all the flowers. People were having picnics and looked like they were having fun.",
          "The Spanish Arch itself is nothing much to look at, but is an important historical structure. Ships used to dock there in medieval times, selling wine and spices. Christopher Columbus visited it in 1477. The Galway City Museum is right next to it, so you can visit both the",
          "If you are walking around Galway and are in the area it is worth a quick visit to see the arches since it is a piece of history but not worth going out of your way for other wise",
          "We went down and saw the arch, although there was really not much to it. There is the history, but really it was more interesting seeing the sights and other points in the walk we took through town to get there.",
          "Nice to watch the river racing by. The arches themselves are rugged however not much to define them. The area around them is bustling! You can get a taxi across the street at Jury\u2019s hotel.",
          "Worth going to see if your in the area, the arch is just an arch into the old city. Don't get your hopes up on the arch but the whole area around here is really lovely, just as is all of Galway I think..",
          "The Spanish Arch on the bank of the river Corrib. One of Galway\u2019s historical gems dating back to pre-medieval times. Built in 1584, an extension of the 12th century Norman built town wall. Previously called \u201cthe head of the wall\u201d but later became known as The Spanish Arch",
          "It literally is a tiny arch. Don't get your hopes up. There is nothing to see, besides just the area to walk around.",
          "The Spanish Arch is there but not a big draw. It will take a couple minutes to see it and then you move on.",
          "If you have time, it's a right off Latin Quarter and scenic along the river. Worth looking at when in the area.",
          "Certainly a quick visit. One to walk through and the other remaining arch is gated with a load of old \"rubble\" (stored?) within alongside the old fireplace. Signage for the parking was better than for the actual remaining arches. With all the ruins, Castles and marvelous",
          "Very nice to see, but wish I could have seen it when all 4 arches were still intact. Very old and picturesque. Conveniently located to the centre of Galway. Worth a quick look, but don\u2019t need to stay long.",
          "Very historic spot and worth visiting if you plan to walk the streets or settle near the harbor for rest. Not worth a special trip.",
          "The Spanish Arch is an almost 500 year old archway with historical significance. However, the main reason to visit, is because the overall area is beautiful along the river. Take a walk along the river or bring a picnic lunch and find a place on the grass to sit and enjoy the",
          "Very old archway firming part of the old city walls. Close to the museum and riverside walk. Small circus setting up next to it.",
          "Spent about 5 hours in the town center and was told it was a MUST SEE attraction. It was very old and overlooked the river",
          "Be careful of the stones at crossings. My friend ended upmin hospital after breaking her hand and had an operation.",
          "Little signage about the arch - but it\u2019s in a nice setting and can initiate lovely walks. Just at the end of quay street.",
          "In a country filled with ruins of Abbeys, Tower homes, Great estates, and neolithic remnants, an arched entry that used to be the gate that the Spaniards traded through is not terribly impressive. But it's right there, across the waterfront park, so why not say you saw it.....",
          "Seriously Galway Council? The area is shabby, the arch graffiti'd, drunks stumble about with beer bottles in their hands. And it wasn't even St Patrick's day.",
          "The Spanish arch is an old gateway into the fortified part of tow,. The gate remains along with a short stretch of wall. Down by the river a nice riverside setting. Worth 5 minutes of your time.",
          "So what can you really say about an arch. It\u2019s there and has bits of the ancient wall attached to it. Somehow I had expected a little more... oh well...",
          "The Spanish Arches were a part of the old city walls and a plaque on the Arches reflects the date. This section is not very extensive (take a look at the photos) so a quick trip is all that is needed to capture a few photos and imagine how the walls would have been used to help",
          "Afterall this is an archway (maybe a few) which were built in the 15th century, but the name suggests that there must have been a fair amount of contact with sailors and traders from Spain. The brickwork construction is the interesting part",
          "The Spanish Arch was touted as THE Architectural wonder to see in Galway, We were quite surprised to find it is really just a short tunnel on an overpass. Well we checked this off the list!",
          "The Spanish arch is not to be missed and borders on Galway Bay and the River Corib and has parts of the old town walls and is close to the monument to Christopher Columbus donated to the City of Galway by the City of Genoa in commemoration of Columbus\u2019s visit to Galway before",
          "The Spanish Arch is a busy centre of activities where students meet tourists. Great look on the Corrib and the Galway Bay. Close to Spanish Arch you will find numerous of Galway's finest restaurants and shops.",
          "Pretty architecture to visit. At the end of the Main Street in Galway. On the water. Learn the history by visiting the Galway museum. It\u2019s free to visit and a great museum. It\u2019s right behind the Spanish Arch.",
          "If in Galway, why wouldn\u2019t you walk to see it. Its near the main area. It\u2019s a free sightseeing trip! It\u2019s history of Galway, my kids loved going through the arch. My eldest was excited as it was in his book we read about Ireland. The walk along the path near the water was",
          "Another great location to walk around, view Ireland's beauty and take in some other sites in the area like the museum or Galway's shopping area.",
          "The arch is located on the quayside in Galway and is a well known local landmark. Medieval connections with Spanish traders. Good for a photo. Don't miss the city museum, which is adjacent, and has a Galway Hooker boat on display. There is a car park adjacent, but signage to it",
          "Seeing the Spanish Arch was nice, but it is a quick visit. The surrounding area is a calm place to relax on a nice day near the water.",
          "Locally known as the \"Sparch,\" its one of Galway's favorite spots for its residents on a warm summers day! There's no better place! The powerful flowing waters of the River Corrib, the sun laying down a blistering blanket of heat and an atmosphere that's all consuming!",
          "The Spanish arch is a couple minutes of your time to inspect. Not much here but the park on the river overlooking Salt Hill is a good place to reflect and enjoy the breeze and the view.",
          "Listen, if you're like me, you like to get some history and culture into your trips. This can be a quick stop along the way. I always think its worth investing time to see some history and gain some perspective. Its along the water, and there are some street musicians playing in",
          "If you have time in Galway, definitely walk around and try to visit the Spanish Arch. Great place along the Bay and something fun to do.",
          "Interesting to see some of the old wall preserved and the arch forming part of the river walk. It can be part of your visit to the museum.",
          "There is not much to see here. The park, dock and Museum which are all adjacent to the Arch had more interest for me. The dock is very scenic an often has musicians playing for tips. This a tourist area but not a great place for a variety of food and drink. I took some nice",
          "The Spanish Arch dates from the 16th century. The Arch is an extension of Galway's city walls, designed to protect the quays. You can walk through it, it's worth seeing. The Arch isn't really Spanish, it's just a name that stuck. The Arch is close to the Galway City Museum. The",
          "Title of the review says it all. You can walk through the arch. You can see and smell the bay. It\u2019s historic. If you skip it you will not have misssed anything. Ut is located near a well-regarded restaurant where we did not eat",
          "A small piece of history in Galway. Worth the few minutes it takes to seek this out ans see the arch built in the 1500s and interesting story as well.",
          "If you venture out, be sure and check this location as it will help you get your bearings. It is historical in nature with lovely surrounds.",
          "NOt sure but due to the buildings around etc. does not really stand out as an important historical monument. Also had teenagers smoking around or leaning to the arch etc.",
          "Sorry it does not really looks like in the picture. Because there was no rain the water are full of garbage and it looks very poor.",
          "The Spanish Arch is of historic significance. It is the end of the city walls which were extended all the way to the edge of the Quay in 1584. It was also damaged by a tsunami, of all things, generated from the famous 1755 Lisbon earthquake (which partially inspired Voltaire\u2019s",
          "Must see place in Galway specially during sunny days. Great place to take some fresh air and have a good time surrounded by cute swams and birds.",
          "... it\u2019s right between the harbour and the Latin Quarter so it\u2019s not out of the way and it points to the history of Galway being the last port for the Spanish ships sailing to the New World. The Latin Quarter itself is named after the same in Paris due to the Norman influence in",
          "While it's nice this leftover bit from the old city walls survived more than 400 years, in the scheme of things - a country full of old stone construction - it isn't very impressive. A few minutes is all you need to appreciate it as you walk by from the waterfront to the latin",
          "It\u2019s interesting specially due to its location next to the river and entrance to the city centre. So it\u2019s handy, and nice to look at for 5 minutes, and then you move on.",
          "The spanish arch was the 1st stop on our Itinerary . First off, it's free so that's always good. The arch is impressive and a great place to start you walk down Quay st.",
          "It\u2019s worth the 10 or so minutes it takes to walk down to the arch from Tourist Central in Quay St. But it only takes 30 seconds to appreciate it before you head back to one of the 50 pubs for another Guinness.",
          "We walked through the \"Latin quarter\" passing many super eating places to see the 400 year old Spanish Arches on the quayside.",
          "This is historical arch dating back to 16th century is a good starting point to begin your exploration of downtown. Nothing special but has a nice waterfront setting. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.",
          "Very historical and picturesque. Lots of happy people. Really a positive great place. Fun just to hang out here.",
          "The Spanish Arch is nice and popular historical place in Galway. There is very nice view and place for relax. It is good starting point for a walk to the city center.",
          "Another historical site. Watch out when you\u2019re waking within the city center, close to the harbour. Easy to miss.",
          "If you are in Galway you will see several signs pointing you towards the Spanish Arc. This monument is a reminder of older times where Spain had influence in the Galway Bay. They architecture is nothing special and the historical significance is not big enough to weigh up for",
          "The Spanish Arch was built in the 16th century. Although there has been some destruction, it is available to see in central Galway and is well worth a quick visit.",
          "While the Spanish Arch is of historical importance, there really wasn't too much to see. We saw them in the early evening and since they are located near the mouth of the river it was a lovely setting and the lighting was perfect for photos.",
          "I was just walking around when I stumbled upon this attraction. It was a neat little spot, and a cool place for pictures.",
          "It's proximity to the great little Galway Museum is worth pointing out, but the Arch's place in longstanding Irish-Spanish trade relations is worth knowing about.",
          "The arch is a nice picture spot and has historical significance to Ireland and Galway, but we used it as a meeting point for our group. Take your picture and move along",
          "While the arch itself is rather underwhelming, this area of Galway is great to hang out in the grass on a nice day. It is a shame Galway isn't more liberal with their open container laws, but regardless this is a good spot for some kind of picnic (weather permitting ;) )",
          "This is second heaven with the sun shining with a fantastic atmosphere but very busy which is to be expected",
          "We didn't find too much around it telling passersby what it was. Definitely needed a guide book for more information. We came, we saw, and won't stop there again.",
          "Having walked all around the city of Galway this area proved to be a very popular place to rest your feet and watch the local youth relaxing and swimming in the sea",
          "Are you looking for an eye awakening revival of your youthful banterful self? Well come on down to spanish arch, known to the trendy folk as sparch, it's a roller coaster ride of festivities! As soon as the sun's out you'll be sure to find me there, nips out and all, having",
          "the spanish gate and surrounding area is a nice place to hang out. there are stone benches on the grass area or you can just hang your legs over the wall while looking at the bay. bird life is abundant. the gate is in good condition and there is a museum and restaurants behind",
          "Walked to see the famous Spanish arch and whilst I was not disappointed, it really isn't a stand out sight. Great history behind it so take the time to read up. See this as a part of a longer walk through the streets of Galway and not a destination and you will enjoy it all.",
          "The Spanish Arch is located at the end of the \"Latin Quarter\". I really didn't think it was much to see, but it's location makes it an easy walk from several pubs and dining places, so walking to it is really easy",
          "There are many extremely beautiful things to see in Ireland and this is not one of them. We went down by the water so the Arches were not out of our way, but this is one item I would pass on unless you are in to archeology and very old architecture.",
          "Full of ducks and white and black swans. Caught a sunny day and it was a real pleasure !! Also nearby it's a free museum where worths to find out the history of city.",
          "There isn't much to see nor was it easy to find for us as we walked by it a couple of times (as we were expecting it to be more substantial). There isn't a lot of things to read about. I would have liked to have read more about the arches before seeing them. I was hoping to",
          "An unexpected piece of city architecture, through which one passes to get from the museum to the main streets. Vaguely picturesque.",
          "The Spanish Arch is located at the bottom of Quay Street, It is near the Galway Museum. It is worth a quick visit.",
          "OK, nothing that special. Think about it. Christopher Columbus may have passed under these when he was on his way to discover America. It is written he attended one of the churches here to pray. It was his last port for provisions. Bit of history. At least they still stand.",
          "Not much to see ... old arches from an earlier era ... along side the river that flows into Galway Bay. We only saw them as we had to pass under to get to the restrooms!",
          "In walking through the central area of Galway we saw several street signs pointing towards 'The Spanish Arch' so as we are keen on old architecture we thought that we would go and have a look. It was not the uplifting experience we were expecting, if anything we were a bit",
          "Not a whole lot to see, it's basically an old arch. The day we were there, musicians were busking nearby and the area was delightfully lively.",
          "Sadly rather underwelming. Walked through it and came across a restaurant which clearly has a great location as it was busy.",
          "Lovely architecture along the waterfront, terrific restaurants and shops nearby, beautiful at night.",
          "This unassuming structure i on the water near the museum. Numerous people pass through each day without much of a glance but it is a part of history.",
          "Originally built as part of the Galway City wall in the late 16th century, it was destroyed in 1755 by the tsunami that resulted from an earthquake in Lisbon. It was originally built to give access to what is now the Long Walk which was built as an extension to the quays. There",
          "Think of this as another interesting taste of Galway's history rather than a destination. Impressive old stone archway.",
          "Not a lot to see, however there is a lot of history to appreciate! Knowing the history of the Spanish Arches will help you understand the significance. It is an awesome sight to see while shopping or taking a stroll.",
          "I don\u2019t know what I was expecting, but I was very underwhelmed by the Spanish Arch. The historical aspect is interesting, but the arch itself simply isn\u2019t very impressive. HOWEVER going to the arch led us to walk along the water away from the city and towards a small park. This",
          "Basically there are two arches next to the river right adjacent to newer building. Walk under the arch and you are done! Not even much of a photo op!",
          "The workmen (and woman) were working on the Spanish Arch whilst we were there in March. But this didnt take away the need to see it (and touch it). Recommend a walk along the river..and see the Spanish Arch",
          "It is a stone arch but to be honest I walked past and was not even sure if I was looking at the right thing but it is just across the street from the main shopping area so it is worth the 2 min walk but don't stress if you don't have time.",
          "I would not go out of my way to make this stop but as it is very close to all the shops it is a good quick place to take in a little history.",
          "Like others have said...I would not go out of my way to go here. It was an arch...you stop and look up, admire said arch, and keep waking. We actually visited twice (once to purposely see it and a second time bc we needed shelter from the rain). So I guess it is both a landmark",
          "if you happen to be in Galway, and you happen to be in the area, and it happens not to be raining(which is rare for Galway), then take a quick look and go, otherwise i wouldnt go out of my way",
          "Reading the reviews, you would think that there isn't much to the Spanish Arch. And yeah, on its surface, they're right. It's a stone archway along the river. But what is *so cool* about this is its history. It was constructed in **1584** (and it still stands!) as an extension",
          "Not that interesting to be honest , best to walk under it so you can walk along the side of the harbour and look out across the water.",
          "Galway is super small and there\u2019s not a lot to see - just a lot of drinking or shopping, really. I\u2019m guessing they haven\u2019t torn this down to leave an \u201cattraction\u201d up that doesn\u2019t involve alcohol or spending money. The river next to the arch is more interesting.",
          "Not really a lot to see if I'm honest, was disappointed. Was nice to sit for a few minutes by the river though.",
          "lovely place, super setting, super on a good weather day. lovely views, nice sense of ancient history, close to pedestrian streets. close to nice shopping area. all signs need replacing, could do with some police presence, lots of young people drinking and shouting, no sign of",
          "Average attraction. Not worth going out of your way to see like for example the Cliffs of Moher. Good thing to do if you have spare time when visiting Galway Ireland.",
          "I find Galway much more relaxing to visit than Dublin there a loads of traditional bars with Irish music food is always good it\u2019s a must visit place",
          "So glad others have also given this an average review. The Spanish Arch is only spectacular in that it exists and it is old... I stared at it for a solid five minutes thinking \"surely this can't be it!\" Small and not overly interesting. I hear in the summer there are markets in",
          "This is the definitive landmark for Galway City. It is located where the Corrib River meets the sea, so the view is wide and worthwhile. Young people sit and canoodle on the banks near the Arch, while on the other side, or once through the arch, there is an array of",
          "I love these old features and got some great personal photos taken. MUST SEE IF IN GALWAY CITY. Lots of fello tourists about and a lot of building and development work going on.",
          "The Spanish arch is in the heart of Galway, next to the harbor. It was in easy walking distance of our hotel and we enjoyed seeing the Arch and local surrounding area. It is a busy place on the weekend, especially when the weather is good.",
          "Grab something warm to drink and stop by after you visit the city museum. It\u2019s interesting to see this much still standing from so long ago but much of it got destroyed from a storm a few years ago so don\u2019t plan on spending a TON of time here.",
          "It's an arch from the 1500's. but that's it. Not big deal. It is right by the Galway City Museum. Stand under it and take a photo. That is all.",
          "Interesting historical old city gate on the river. The next door city museum is closed on Mondays which was a disappointment. Galway is a greta town and well worth a stay for a few days.",
          "I was expecting something special here, as it's a popular tourist attraction. You have to cross a very busy road and then walk around the side of the Galway City Museum and then onto the Spanish Arch, which was built in 1584 on the banks of the river Corrib. (The Spanish Arch",
          "Not a great deal to see but if you are wondering around Eyre Square, do look for the arches. Easy to see as you walk to Quay Street, especially on a nice day.",
          "Going through the Arch you come to Ard Bia at Nimmos a wonderful place to have lunch and then continue to walk on the Long Walk. It's just around from the 'Latin Quarter', downtown Galway.",
          "As an American, to see such old historical landmarks is just amazing. This would appeal to your geeky side that appreciates history. Other than that, it is not much to report. I loved it; my husband wouldn't get of the car.",
          "If you're in Galway and taking in the sights, wander over to the Spanish Arch, but don't set your expectations too high.",
          "I was rather disappointed by this arch as I was expecting something very grand. It is in great condition for its age, positioned at the harbour, but not really worth going out of your way to visit.",
          "Really enjoyed being able to review and experience history studied at school in Nova Scotia, Canada many years ago!",
          "Not a lot to see there but the two arches are 500 years old and to see them and walk through is cool. Older than anything in the US. Not much exciting to see it but it is centrally located so easy to grab a coffee and walk over to it and also see the beautiful river and inner",
          "Interesting architecture. This is a historic sea port and this was key to that past. We saw it at night and should of done it earlier in the day.",
          "Came across by chance and they were fabulous fiddlers irish dancing sun shining folk having fun great hightly recommend...",
          "We were in the area when we stumbled on this site. The books try to convince you that it's a place to see, but don't go too far out of your way. The streets around and down from Arye Square are a must, and if you just want to check out the buskers on the weekend then this is the",
          "All within a short distance of Eyers square, ( everything is, I am a fat old guy and could do it , only a few blocks).",
          "It is an old arch, which when you consider how old it is, is cool, but the area around it struck me as dirty and there wasn't much to do other than look at the arch. Interesting to look at for about 5 minutes, but after that it is time to move on.",
          "We took walk in the morning along Lake Carrib and walked through the Spanish Arch. It was part of the original city wall, built in 1584. So a nice part of history to see if you are in Galway City Centre. It's near lots of hotels and restaurants, but not too busy in the morning",
          "Fantastic architecture in a very quiet pleasant area stop look and relax its amazing piece and fantastic location plenty of people about the area can be a busy area",
          "We took a Sunday afternoon stroll, along Lake Carrib and walked through the Spanish Arch. It was part of the original city wall, built in 1584. So a nice part of history to see if you are in Galway City Centre. It's near lots of hotels and restaurants, so it was really busy.",
          "Part of the original wall of the city built in 1584 the Spanish Arch sits on the banks of the River Carrib at the foot of Quay St. It is worth the stroll down to the river to enjoy the river & this impressive piece of history.",
          "Good history, but that's about it. Worth a walk by, but learn the history first. The good thing is that it is near many eating and drinking establishments:-).",
          "The Spanish arch was once part of Galway's city wall. It is located on a river and the walk is very enjoyable. There were several fishing boats docked across the river too.",
          "Lovely walk and historic visit in Athlone. Have your camera ready. Lovel to visit early in the day before too many people are in the area. Free and open to all.",
          "These arches are of great historical value and situated by a park where you can gaze and have a picnic, also by the river too, you can chill out and relax and look at the arches to your hearts content.",
          "We happened on the Spanish Arch while walking around Galway. It's not really a destination, but part of the experience. The nearby museum is definitely worth a visit.",
          "A significant part of Galway history. Worth a quick look as you stroll along the waterfront. Not far from good restaurants and pubs.",
          "This is a must because there is so much history associated here. Several restaurant here but good luck trying to get in. Doesn't take you long to go thru and appreciate the history.",
          "The Spanish arch is a very distinctive meeting spot. When we arrived in Galway we came across lots of people hanging around and dancing near the arch.",
          "If you're lucky with good weather conditions, sitting by the River Corrib on a sunny, warm day is a really enjoyable way to spend some time in Galway. I went on a Tuesday afternoon in early August after stopping by the nearby Dunnes grocery store and picking up some snacks",
          "Not much on the history of the arch is available but as far as arches go, it's cool. A lot of shops and restaurants are in the area and it sits right next to the river.",
          "It's an old rock arch from the late 1500's. What else can I say? Located at the edge of the Corrib River, across from the Galway City Museum (definitely worth visiting) and just up the main street to the McDonagh's fish and chips eatery (a great lunch spot also worth a visit).",
          "This is one of the historic arches through the old city wall at the entrance of the city, but not overly impressive. Worth seeing for its historic value.",
          "This is a remaining part of the old city wall and reflects the trade history of Galway. It is on the river so very scenic. Worth a short visit and a photo.",
          "In the 1500's, Spain was an active trading partner of the Irish, buying and selling wines, timber and hides. They moored their ships in the adjacent Bay. The arches were the terminal end of the city wall, and allowed merchants to enter the city via controlled access, so their",
          "It's pretty amazing that this arch, once a part of the city wall, still stands. It's right on the banks of the river where lots of people hang out if the weather is nice. Also very near to lots of shops, restaurants, and museum. Worth a visit!",
          "It was a great piece of history to see and learn about on the river, and there are plenty of restaurants and bars in the surrounding area to stop at overlook the arch as well",
          "If you're in Galway visit the Spanish Arch. Hard to believe something that old is still standing. The Bay is beautiful too.",
          "Somehow we were a little disappointed in the Spanish Arch. I don't know why, but after seeing it on the may, and the signs directing the way, we expected something a little more special. That said, I'm glad we went a little extra to see it and walk under it.",
          "but not much of a much. See it, go under it, reverse course, and go under it again. And you're done.",
          "The Spanish Arch is one of the most historic areas in the city, always full of tourists and locals very nice place to sit beside the river Corrib watch the world go by and sometimes enjoy street performers.",
          "Part of the Galway historical walls but a nice area with bars and restaurants overlooking the harbour area with the river. No real significance, ok to see as part of your Galway tour, apart from that no real interest.",
          "Very convenient to the museum. Easy access. Just across the way from Quay Street. Entire area is easy and fast to do.",
          "If you've made it to Galway, you should take a look at the Spanish Arch - One can appreciate the juxtaposition of the ancient arch sitting in the middle of a very modern city.",
          "Perhaps I missed something by not having a tour guide for this location. I should have read more about it. What I saw was worth a quick stop as a piece of history, but I didn't feel inclined to spend much time here.",
          "This is at the entrance to the busy Galway village. Many historical sites connected to this arch is within walking distance. On weekends, locals gather to have an arts festival selling their products.",
          "Great buzz in this spot on a sunny Saturday afternoon where the place is jointed with people relaxing in the sunshine",
          "There is not much to the Arch, but it is interesting and cool. Other than grabbing a picture and getting a view of it, there isn't anything more to do here. Set 5 minutes aside to see it, as it is very close to Quay Street, the Market, and St Nicholas Church.",
          "The last vestage of the long ago past of the walled city of Galway. Four arches remain and a sign are the only identification of this wonderful Irish wonder.",
          "This monument is a link to the Old City. There are many pieces of the City Wall remaining and this in a riverfront location to see it.",
          "Good picture spot with a lot happening around the area.Close to it all,stop by read and put a little history into your visit.Truthfully its not the end of the world if you missit.",
          "Very well-maintained site, steeped in history with plenty of seating on the grass and grounds to picnic and explore the area.",
          "Historical and peaceful place, lots of people relax here, visit the little church close by beside the water. Lemongrass restaurant very good place to eat. Easy access to all parts of the city from here",
          "OK, it is fair to say the Spanish Arch is probably but a shadow of its former self and is now not exactly a riveting must-see for tourists to Galway. But it does serve as a reminder than in Medieval times, Galway was a thriving trading port, especially with the Spanish. When you",
          "Nice place to visit to get a picture or two from both sides of the arch. Good to get some history of the Spanish influence in Ireland. Also close to the Galway Museum which is worth a quick visit. Right on the Galway docks which makes it a nice place for a picnic.",
          "It is a small arch that serves as passage from one are to another. Nothing there really , it's just there and it's part of history but nothing breathtaking !",
          "We made our way through the town to the Spanish Arch, it's from the 16th century and still looking good for its age! We love Galway!",
          "The Arch was on our list of things to see in Galway, but there isn't really much to it. It may be worth a quick photo but that's about it. You will see it easily while visiting Galway city center.",
          "This structure is an amazing work of architecture. To see how massive it was and built by hand. It appears from other reviews they would have appreciated it more with a tour guide.",
          "Just an old stone arch that was part of the wall protecting the city hundreds of years ago. Interesting only because of its age.",
          "I really wanted to see this as I enjoy historic architecture. Seeing the arches only takes 2 minutes though as it's simply 2 arches... we went onto the museum though right there (which is free) and turned it into a great outing!",
          "We walked past this several times without even recognizing it and had to ask directions as to where it was. It's not as it appears in many photos and is attached to another building off on the side. It seems it's hyped to be something it isn't. I would definitely not go out of",
          "I'm giving this a 'very good' rating for the simple fact that it is still standing after all these years. Granted, not a lot to see, but an important part of the history of this part of galway",
          "The Spanish Arch and its surrounding area is very much a focal point within the city of Galway. Walk around the port/harbour and along the river inlet, the Spanish arch is near the Galway museum and head down to the Cathedral. The river has some beautiful spots for photos, very",
          "Again, it's part of the history of trading history of Galway and the Spanish influence on the city. It's in a convenient location and doesn't require a large amount of time so why not?",
          "Brief visit, little activities. Views of old arch fascinating, built in 1400's adjacent to lovely water views, great bird life (swans, etc.) Very convenient to downtown soiling and restaurants.",
          "If you are in the area I would go see it but I wouldn't make a special trip. It was a little disappointing.",
          "This is an old arch and the area around it is not great. The city of Galway could make this area nicer and make this more of an attraction, but it is not worth visiting as it is now.",
          "It is kind of cool and neat to see, but really it is a fairly simple arch just outside the main downtown area. Nothing really special to say about it.",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was a bit underwhelmed by the Spanish arch. Definitely give it a look if you're already down by the river, but I would not recommend planning a trip around it.",
          "Sitting by the Galway City Museum near the mouth of the Carrib River, there is not much about the Spanish Arch that would catch your eye. However, it is worth taking the 10-15 minutes necessary to walk over and check it out, if you are in the area. Be sure to go through the",
          "Nothing to get excited about, it's a piece of local history of that reminds you what Galway once looked like. Galway museum is right next to it with great vies upstairs. The Latin Quarter is nearby so it's not out of the way and could be a nice place to go if you want somewhere",
          "This bit of Galway history is hidden in plain sight. The descriptive marker needs to be a little closer/more prominent. Otherwise, it becomes a nondescript, plain stone arch in a city of stone buildings in a country of stone buildings.....",
          "This is a place to see as you're walking to someplace else. It's near the City Museum, so you can see it on your way there. Nothing special.",
          "Likely would have been much more interesting if you were on a tour. The best thing about it, we found a great restaurant nearby.",
          "There's no marker that I could see. We walked right passed this arch across and into the market and only on our return for the car did we realize it was the Spanish Arch.",
          "These go back to the 1500's. There used to be four but two got destroyed in a tsunami or something similar,",
          "It`s only one Arch but give me the idea how was the old Galway with his wall. It is near the Galway city museum.",
          "You don't need to physically go there, but I'm sure it's great if you have the time - we saw if from over the water and it was lovely.",
          "For being a historical site it has been left to ruin. Almost missed it along with the 'Old City Wall'. No signage, lots of graffiti & garbage. Not real sure what the history of the Arches was.",
          "It's just there. A small sign just tells what it is called and when it was constructed. No other information provided.",
          "Heard about this spot and thought it would be more impressive. However, it's at an interesting part of town.",
          "The Arch dates back to 1587, which is cool. The arch itself is good for a quick peek, but really isn't much more than that. It is amazing what people figured out to do with rocks 500 years ago....and they did a good job as these are still standing.",
          "A little bit disappointed. Highly spoken about attraction but very little to see. Although the history behind the arch is very interesting.",
          "The Spanish Arch is far from being impressive. But the bank of the river Corrib in front of it is lovely and many times lively with youngsters - drinks and music even dancing.",
          "If you are in the area it is nice to look at, and does not take long. It is a piece of very simple history, not much to write home about.",
          "It only takes a few minutes. We walked around this area and got a few pictures. This is a nice area and doesn't require much planning",
          "We saw many signs referring to the Spanish Arch, but didn't realize until the day after my wife had taken several pictures of it, where it actually was. The TripAdvisor photo shown, is really all there is to see. There is a small plaque that give a breif history of th arch.",
          "This is an old gate to the city and although it may not be spectacular it does allow you to understand where the old city walls were and there is a pretty spot to sit and enjoy the sun, and being around other people for a bit. It is close to the Galway museum, and near shops",
          "Now it's a lovely area to sit pier-side to watch the swans and the sun go down in the evening, to take a relaxing break from the busy Latin Quarter just ahead.",
          "Stop at the arch as you venture out to explore the city. It's not a destination in and of itself, but something historic that will help you understand the city. A good place to people watch and enjoy being by the water's edge.",
          "It's not a big deal but supposedly an attraction. Guess the age and history make it important. The pedestrian walkway nearby is really fun and touristy.",
          "Too many medieval cities are completely erased by the passage of time, being built over or by being intentionally demolished to make way for progress. It's great to be able to see in person, to touch and to walk through such historic landmarks like Galway's Spanish Arch and a",
          "Went in on a Thursday evening around 8:30...musicians were just winding up their final set. Place was crowded. Our party of five was ushered through the busy bar to a remote corner of the rear dining room. Our booth was directly below the loudspeaker. The volume of the",
          "It's an arch, on a busy side street. If you walk too fast you will miss it. It's quaint, but don't go out of your way to find it.",
          "Perhaps the most unimpressive historical monument you can see. Supposedly a must-see in Galway, I don't know why. Maybe if you're really into history, and have a good guide, it's worth a visit.",
          "This ancient archway, consisting of two arches, was built in 1584. You can walk through one of the arches, the one known as the Spanish Arch, while the other one, with a plaque naming it the Blind Arch, is closed. Above the arch through which you can walk there is a plaque",
          "This is the perfect place to relax and read in Galway, with shopping, good food, and street musicians nearby, you're in for a good time",
          "All the irish in Galway ask if you've been to the Arch. Once you go, that really is all it is. An arch. A very historic one though. Once you walk under it you are headed down The Long Walk and then can continue on to the docks. It is a nice place for a liesurely stroll. And hey",
          "So ordinary looking, nothing special about it. Located in some corner where kids hang out while drinking so I was not really comfortable sitting there.",
          "Beautiful part of Galway, reminds me of Spanish Asturias. must be some Spanish influnce there:) The atmosphere on the sunny spring day was amasing, lots of young people around. musicians of the top quality street singing, such a pleasant surprise!",
          "Located by the bay. Good meeting point. Obviously it comes with history. Most people will just pass through on route as they explore that part of the city. A lovely little restaurant next to it.",
          "Went to Galway for the day to show a friend a different place and one thing we went to see was the Spanish Arch. It was pretty uneventful. It was January and it was VERY cold, so our interest levels were very low!!!",
          "The Spanish Arch is just a landmark people use to meet up in Galway - people don't really think of it as being especially nice as an architectural feature. The Spanish Arch is known by locals as the \"Sparch\", but on warm days (or just, any day, for students), people will be",
          "It's an arch. in stone. one of 5 that were built as part of the city defences. there's a park. There's the river. There's the harbor. Behind it is a museum. The arch itself is unimpressive (it looks like any other arch). It's the stuff around it that is interesting. It",
          "just relax, enjoy the sound of the water rushing by. Tended to get a bit busy in the sunshine, well worth finding a quiet spot",
          "The Spanish arch was once part of Galway City's walls. That's neat. However, there isn't much more to the Spanish Arch than that. Stop by if you want, but it is overhyped. And I know this is a total bad TripAdvisor review, but it really had no \"Spanish\"-ness to it. I was",
          "Nothing spectacular but worth a peek if you're right there just for the history of it. We were there at night and it seemed a little sketchy.",
          "the Spanish arch has its place, it is part of the river walk. you wouldnt make a special stop just for the arch as it is not particular large nor detailed. A piece of medieval history. a good starting point of your exploration of this city.",
          "It's a good historical thing to see, I guess, but I wouldn't go out of your way to see it. We actually walked by them twice before even realizing that they were the infamous Spanish Arches.",
          "We stopped by Spanish Arch on a damp, grey March morning. The Corrib, swollen by a night of heavy rain, thundered past, ancient stones dripped, gulls screeched overhead, the bay opening up before us, the morning mist shrouded the horizon. City traffic streamed past at my back.",
          "A lot of Galway's history is derived from this area but is continuously difficult to maintain and keep clean. This area could be so much more as other port cities are. The close by Museum, with lovely \"The Kitchen\" cafe is a great addition if not a little hidden away. Also close",
          "A 16th Century Spanish archway is a great introduction to those from the \"New World\" of the history that is dotted throughout this ancient land.",
          "If you are interested in ancient or medieval history this might give you a slight idea what Galway looked like at that times.",
          "I would always have considered this a landmark site in Galway. My visit this time underwhelmed me. There is possible evidence of construction work in progress but with no evidence of workmen actively engaged in completing it. The whole area had an unkept appearance with lots",
          "One of the historical and lasting areas of Galway city. Situated right beside the River Corrib, it is a place to enjoy and contemplate. Watch the swans and engage with the locals whose historical knowledge of the place and its surroundings will captivate.",
          "This is actually a pretty decent little piece of history, provided you know your history. It's fairly easy to miss if you're strolling along, but if you know what you're looking for and where to go, head there for a quick stop and photo.",
          "The arches themselves are pretty neat. It's amazing to read about the history of them. The setting is beautiful. The water, people, swans, and hum of the city add to the charm of the arches. May seem underwhelming to others, but all those reasons make it a worthwhile visit.",
          "Really cool little spot right by the river. Spent some time there and just hung out with local people. I didn't get into too much of the history but just loved sitting around and observing it's age through it's construction. It was a nice place to hang out and have a beer.",
          "Needs your added imagination to make it live. A neglected aspect of the city, it could do with a little TLC.",
          "If you are looking to kill time in Galway take a stroll down to the Spanish Arch. You can continue on and wander out to Salthill. It is well worth it.",
          "The Spanish Arch, and the Long Walk that passes through it and along the River Corrib, are underwhelming. The arch itself is mildly impressive, but the \"Long Walk\" is only about 250 meters, with no impressive vistas granted at the end. If you have nothing else to do it might be",
          "There are two arches here. The Spanish arch and the blind arch. They date from 1584. There was a lot of trade with Spain in those days. This is very noticeable in some of the local population with their black hair and Spanish appearance.",
          "Interesting to see - won't take much of your time, but gives a glimpse of times gone by. Right next to the Galway museum, which is not too loaded with artifacts etc, but gives one an understanding of the Irish 'Troubles'.",
          "Most people that visit the Spanish Arch, stop right at it. The best part is the walk, restaurant, and scenery past it.",
          "I love the Spanish Arch and always try to build in time to sit there awhile and chill when in Galway. Good place to go with a coffee and newspaper or just to relax or people watch. Usually a good vibe, especially in summer when locals sit in the sun overlooking the water and",
          "This is right in the center, so one can't miss it. I didn't find it to be extremely impressive but it is well worth a look",
          "I did not know that Spain had invaded Ireland, so after seeing this we began to look for more evidence of their presence. Quite interesting.",
          "I wouldn't out this on the top of things to do in Galway. Sure, walk through, and then you're done. I'd give this visit about 15 mins if you're interested in taking pics, etc.",
          "Had heard this was a must visit from friends. We were very disappointed when we saw the arch itself, really not a lot to it. You might as well walk under it on your way to the Galway museum as it's right beside it but not something to go out of your way for.",
          "We visited here on a rainy cold day so perhaps that colors things. The Arch and the area around it were pretty dead in the afternoon with very few people hanging around. Walking through it however was interesting, especially after reading and learning about the history",
          "This is a lively spot right in the heart of the City but two things are a disappointment and that is the roads are confusing and the Indian restaurants are expensive and a complete let down! There are three of them located in that area and all are very bad!",
          "We visited the Arch after completing the city bus tour. If you appreciate old architecture then it's certainly something worth visiting. We walked through the arch and around the quayside discovering some hidden shops and a restaurant, worth a little visit if you're nearby for",
          "Beautiful view of the bay where locals hangout by the grass and it is very close to all the restaurants and bars.",
          "If you plan on visiting the museum, you may as well check out the Spanish Arch as well. It's good for a couple of photos and there's a nearby waterway that was filled with swans as we visited.",
          "Got a couple photos and that was it.. Not sure what else you can actually do here. One side is closed with relics in there nearly all covered in bird pooh. Nice to see",
          "Interesting piece of history to see while walking around Galway. It is very old and is well worth stopping to take a look.",
          "Adjacent to the excellent Galway City Museum, the ceturies old Spanish Arch is a must for Irish history buffs.",
          "Galway had a long and rich history of Spain as the Protestant and Catholics vied for power and influence. This arch is named after the cultural influence and the fact that when the Spanish Armada crashed, some of the sailors washed up here.",
          "A great place to bring a bottle of wine, and sit by the waterfront, watching boats glide by during sunset.",
          "Located near the wonderful (and free) Galway Museum, The Spanish Arch is a relic of days past, when the city was decidedly Medieval. It is amazing to think that it has stood for so long on that spot. It will only take a few minutes to see, but is well worth the time spent",
          "As an attraction itself, the Spanish Arch is not much to write home about, but the history behind it is where the interest lies. It actually has nothing to do with Spain, but is an extension of the original city walls. Well worth a look if in Galway, but don't go out of your way.",
          "The Spanish Arch is beautiful to look at and its history is great to ponder. A gem among all the shops, pubs, and eateries.",
          "Stroll for the day or for that evening again after your meal this is fresh lively with loads happening at times.",
          "We went looking for this place after dinner, and found it well after dark. The area is hangout city for a large segment of teens and young collegians, and while they were well-behaved it was not the funky historic monument I had read about in the tourist guide, but more like a",
          "Pedestrianised, this area is full of trinket shops, bars,pubs and restaurants. Worth a one-off visit",
          "The Spanish Arch is what it is, an end section of leftover wall. The star here is the river and bay views.",
          "The Spanish Arch is interesting because of the history, but I would not go out of my way to see it. Not much to it overall, except the history itself.",
          "I noted that the Spanish Arch was marked on the map so we walked over toward it - walked back and forth before we realised what it was. Somewhat underwhelming considering the other wonderful attractions in Galway. However, the pier was nice as you passed through the arch.",
          "Look for a high tide coming running in! You could swim inside the Spanish Arch hall and that was the temporary end of the festival: the electricity generator almost swept away! Lol!",
          "It is an arch. You can walk through it. Close to the river. I am sure it has a history but it is not that interesting unless you are in to that sort of thing",
          "The Spanish Arch is best thought of as a meeting point around which there are interesting sights, bars, restaurants and a lively activity. Don't make it the reason you go there however.",
          "What can you say about an arch, other than it's history and you can walk though this one. It's next to the City Museum and it's a must see if you are in Galway. The area is lovely to walk around, window shop or have a pint in a pub.",
          "Very scenic and buzzing with visitors from all over the world. A place that is very good for tourism and the river is also an added attraction. Lovely cafes and bars.",
          "When you reach the Spanish Arch after visiting all the shops, it is small with little info around it. Lots of people just hang out near it, and there is nothing more to see.",
          "I visited here and to be honest not sure of what the actual tourist attraction here is. I was not impressed by the area and didnt feel it particularly warranted attention given to it in brochures etc",
          "The Spanish Arch is interesting for the historical aspects however you will be disappointed if you go to Galway just to see the Arch. It's outside of the main city center along the river. If you are in the area check it out, if not you won't really miss much.",
          "If you fancy a break from the shopping pick up a take away coffee and head down to the Spanish Arch. It is located right on the banks of the Corrib river and offer a great spot if you are looking to chill out for a while. Loads of restaurants close by if you fancy some thing",
          "If your visiting the lovely city of Galway visit the Spanish Arch.Don't go to Galway just to visit the Spanish Arch as you might be a bit disappointed. It's what's left of the city walls but is very small.If you walking around the quays you'll pass under it and that's about",
          "This is situated near the pedestrian area of Quay Street, so it's an easy walk over from there. It's not quite enough to make it a destination on its own, but it's just steps from the Galway Museum which is very interesting as well and the admission to the museum is free",
          "Right in front of Jury's inn Hotel you will experience this fantastic Spanish Arch and the Claddagh a few steps away.",
          "I don\u2019t know why , but I expected a lot more. The arch is very small, and you get there and just think oh. It\u2019s at the bottom of Quay Street/Latin Quarter, so at least you don\u2019t have to travel out of your way to visit it. There\u2019s not even anything interesting exactly around it,",
          "Initially couldn't find it but finally did while walking through the city. Interesting bit of history associated with this regarding trade with Spain.",
          "Part of the walled city. Interesting as a piece of architecture, and i understand that it was uder in the series Buffy the vampire slayer: something to do with Angel apparently. Ask a small person will know, probably tut , and you wont be any wiser. But it might get them in the",
          "This beautiful view was impressive made us curious abouto the history of Galway and the early trading here. Dave Yeates, Irish tour guide (DYIT Dave Yeates Ireland Tours) conducted a private tour. Strongly recommend him for any location in Ireland. He clearly and",
          "Part of an old wall to protect the city, its ok but do not loose sleep if you do not go to see it. There are better examples of city walls.",
          "The name sounds better than what the place is: a ruin. I'm sure people who love Irish history would enjoy this more, but for a casual traveler you can give this a pass.",
          "The park surrounding the arch is a great place to take a break from sight-seeing. You'll see folks sitting/laying on the grass, relaxing.",
          "walking thru the arch at night was beautiful. there were groups hanging out socializing and playing music. a very fun, safe and entertaining atmosphere.",
          "In fairness, I have only a passing interest in history, but I was not impressed by the arch. That said, it is so close to main points of interest in Galway, and river next to it is so nice to walk along, if you are there, you may as well wander over to the arch. A plaque gives",
          "A nice place to walk by when in the City. Right by the water this is a great historic piece of architecture.",
          "We spent quite a bit of time in this historic area of Galway. Beside the river Corrib, it is alive with activity - especially on a sunny evening - with young people in the majority. It is typical of all walled cities - many of which I have visited (including Londonderry, N.",
          "We walked down to one of the four arches that was closest to the Long Walk leading out to Galway Bay. This is a must see for those who enjoy historical places.",
          "Perfect place for a picnic looking out at the Claddagh and the river Corrib. This landmark is in the city near tourist shops, restaurants and the Galway city museum. Gorgeous area at any time of day. Markets are set up regularly as part of festivals also.",
          "Just outside the Latin Quarter, adjacent to the museum. You'll likely be passing by the Jurys Inn across the street and look over to see the Spanish Arch. The museum is adjacent to teh arch.",
          "I'm not quite sure why this is an attraction. What you see from the picture is all that is there. It is just an arch!",
          "My expectation of the Spanish Arch was far greater than the reality - an old stone arch on the bank of the Lough. I see no reason to put this on your \"must see\" list, although you'll see it if you go to the museum and it's just at the bottom of Quay Street.",
          "Not elaborate but unique for the area. Fun on a nice day to watch the geese and the occasional boat. Grab a bit to eat neaby and relax",
          "The arches are right on the bay. plaques tell you about the part they played in Galway history. Informative and good place for some pictures. Doesn't take much time.",
          "Interesting from a historical point of view but it really is quite unimpressive, I walked through it and then spent the rest of the time enjoying the river and views roundabout, would be a nice place to sit a while and soak up the sun;0)",
          "Apiece of history. Story of Columbus vessel being here very old architecture part of old city walls. Nice to see on a park still near water and colorful area.",
          "I do think it's a bit crazy that this is the must see attraction in Galway. Its not too impressive really. If its a nice day sure go take in some sun in a modest park like setting. But if its a nice day you may not find any room. Also its neat to see the canal in the winter when",
          "A historical spot on the River Corrib, where Christopher Colombus berthed his vessel, the Spanish Arch is part of the medievial wallssurrounding the old town. Not far off is St. Nicholas Church where he went to pray. Another part of the old wall is found at the lower level of",
          "Wonderful area great for relaxing and taking a walk and doing a bit of people watching, some nice eateries and generally a nice spot",
          "Great feeding the swans there so many of them with lots of boats particular down the end . Well kept with lots of places to sit and watch the world go by",
          "The Spanish Arch is interesting because it is old. It has seen a lot of history. However it is probably not worth going too far out you way to see it.",
          "Located just at the border of the city centre, it's so peculiar that it invites you to find more about its origin",
          "There are a few of these archways in the town, take the time to find them and visit the museum. Galway is full of history and coffee bars.",
          "Nothing special about the attraction really. You get your photograph, and you're off. Its easy to find.",
          "Good to see this important piece of history so well preserved. Surrounded by the buzzing life of a tourist populated Galway, it is a good reminder of the international links that have been enjoyed for centuries.",
          "Walking about and saw the arch in front on us -- recognized it from our research. Yes, it is an arch! But.... Ok, it is a nice arch. and it is part of the old wall. There is a well regarded museum next to it, unfortunately closed when we walked by. The area does seem to be",
          "The Spanish Arch is a major hit with both tourists, students and locals on a hot sunny day where it is full of people relaxing by the cool River Corrib and the Spanish Arch itself. On days like such, the atmosphere is electric! I would definitely advise everyone who visits",
          "Not an attract to visit more of a place you just walk through! The Arches predate a lot of Galway & are obviously of historic interest whilst walking around the City.",
          "The area around the arch minimal but it is located where the locals and tourist gather and there is tons of shopping, restaurants, markets, performers, etc... So it is a fun day!",
          "The Spanish Arch dates from 1584 and is one of the only remaining sections of the wall that protected the city from invaders. It is on the waterfront and makes for picturesque photos but it is just an arch. Wouldn't put it high in my list to visit but it is just outside the",
          "Not much to see but it is old from sometime in 1500's so kinda cool in that regard. But a short walk past it Leads to a few swans floating in the water. Fun if you are taking an evening stroll before heading back to Quay Street to hear great Irish music at the local pubs!",
          "It isn't exactly the most interesting site you will see in Ireland, but the history is there. You will see the hustle of people entering the Latin Quarter from that direction. A different perspective for sure. The best part of seeking it out, is ending up at the river. There is",
          "Everyone kept say go see the arch, go see the arch! We just thought it was going to be something amazing. Maybe if we looked up the history it would have meant more. but really it was kind of disappointing.",
          "Go there, sit on the ground, take a sunbath eating something and, of course,enjoy the beaultiful view",
          "The arch was just a small stone structure with a small sign indicating that it was in fact the Spanish Arch. My family and I took one picture under it and did not spend any more time there. This site is not necessary to visit in Galway.",
          "We did a tour of Galway City in the rain and was lovely. Finished of course at the King's Head Pub for so yummy capachino",
          "We came to the site by accident. We saw the sight of a lighthouse far away, so we walked towards that way. Surprised to see the arch. Lots of young folks around the area as well as couples. At a corner of the river, we saw a bunch of beautiful white swans. We liked the area, not",
          "This is one of those sites that is best experienced on a tour where a great guide can provide background information to make the history come alive. On its own, there isn't much to see here. If you must see it without a guide, read up a little before you go and enjoy it on a",
          "Part of the original part of the city of Galway along the bay, point of trading by visiting ships. Very important part of Galway history.",
          "Good location to take photographs, walk around and take in the scenery I think there was something about the Cladagh Ring around this area but not sure.",
          "There isn't much to see here but be sure to look into the fenced in area. Some interesting things in there.",
          "Knowing little of Galway's history it was enlightening to listen to the history,however I think folklore and embellishments for the tourist has a lot to answer for!",
          "This is located at the end of town and I guess I was expecting more. There were a few signs indicating what was there but it is just a stone arch.",
          "Once you find the Spanish Arch and you are with a group of people, it would be a great place to meet up again if you are off to various places in Galway. The parking lots are close by as well. If it is a nice day, sit along the canal and watch the world go by or walk up the",
          "I walked by the Spanish Arch a few times before I realized what it was. Although it was historic and there were a few signs, I wish there had been more information about the importantance of the Spanish Arch",
          "I had seen the arch advertised as a tourist destination, but hadn't gone out of my way to visit it. Instead, my wife and I visited the arch while walking around Galway. We found the arch a bit underwhelming in size and location, not something we would recommend going out of the",
          "We visited the arch during our walking tour of the city. Great historical wall from medieval time period, and it is right next to Museum which is a must see.",
          "Nice bit of history, but unless you go to the adjacent Galway city museum, not mucvh to see. they really need some more 'free' history.",
          "The Spanish Arch stands on the east bank of River Corrib, Galway City Ireland.earlier the area was called as fish market, now it is Spanish parade. It was an extension of the city wall, Martin's tower to river Corrib to protect the quays. Near by Galway City museum is also there.",
          "This is a lovely walk just down from Shop Street in Galway, its very historical as the Spanish came here its also the start of the Galway to Salthill Walk which is very interesting",
          "After reading about the arch in a number of books I wanted to see it in person. While it isn't much to look at it didn't disappoint. It also seems to be a very popular spot with the locals. I'm glad we stopped for it.",
          "There isn't much of this attraction to see but you can appreciate the history behind it. Located near the port and on the river it appears too be a meeting hub for the locals and the young set in particular.",
          "Not much to see about the arch. Its a bit of history and a good photo spot. Lovely spot when the weather is sunny.",
          "I think this was built in the 1500s. Amazing how some things were built to last. Not much to say. Its name says it all.",
          "Dined in one of the cafes outside. Lovely food and views. My son and his girlfriend enjoyed the experience.",
          "The day was sunny and people were obviously happy to celebrate the warmth and a great gathering place.",
          "The Arch is neat to see but should be included on an afternoon walk, it only takes a few minuets to look at.",
          "This is one of four original arches that are almost 500 years old! I love the history and I love the area it's in because it's very classic and iconic \"old Ireland.\"",
          "Part of ancient history of area Last of four original arches.Near to museum and some quaint eateries.",
          "The area around the Spanish arch is very nice to visit, many nice restaurants and beautiful scenery. There is also a lot of history around here too, I would recommend doing a little study before you visit so you can really appreciate the history behind the area.",
          "From our B&B, this was on the way. Beautiful architecture, nice location on the water. Swans are a common sight in Ireland along with a variety of water birds.",
          "This relic looks old but who would know? Do I need to pay for a tour to find out? Sure I could and did but really? How about a little something to whet the appetite.",
          "The Spanish Arches are at the end of the river walk on the ocean end. There is an open area where people congregate and close proximity to bus routes. I'm not sure how safe the area is at night as there were already a few rough-looking types about during the day. Make sure you",
          "we passed by this Arch with our tour guide, Liam Silke. we were impressed by how well built it was. it enhanced the beauty of Galway. must see.",
          "Can include this in on your walk in and around the river/bay. Just a nice old area wall, the last bit remaining of the old city wall. It is free to just walk around. Very near the museum.",
          "You will see many of these around Europe. Nice that it has been preserved, but not a very special attraction.",
          "some spot altogether bud. suns out, cans out. it's the place to be on a hot summers day. it's fair daycent as well on an ould occasion like paddy's day, the whole town and country sit on both sides of it with a can in their hand, devils bit, dutchy g, anything your heart",
          "Good area for a wee walk even on a rainy day. Nice view of the river, the docks and the surrounding areas.",
          "We walked down to the Spanish Arch in Galway and there is not much to it. Took a photo and left. It is an area for all the DRUNKS to hang out. We were there about 4pm and believe me there were several loud, falling down and can not get up drunks there. Not what you want your",
          "This attraction was right across from the hotel where we stayed. It is a beautiful, historic location right on the riverside walkway.",
          "Love this area of Galway comes alive when sunny but always beautiful good bats and restaurants on the bank of the Corrib",
          "The great thing about Galway is that everything is within walking distance so after a wander down Shop Street check out the Spanish Arch. Plenty of little shops, bars and restaurants etc to replenish the energy before treking back towards centre of town.",
          "The Spanish Arch implies the relationship built up over centuries of trade with Spain. It stands today and is adjacent to Comerford House now housing a museum...the town is only a few streets away and the site is easily accessed. A nice park in front makes it a great meeting",
          "Nothing much to write really. I wouldn't go out of my way but if you are in the area, check it out. We went on a Friday night and found it to be a hang out for lots of young people drinking,",
          "Great place to see and sit down and relax and watch the swans. The arches are cool but not a lot to see, no tour needed, great coffee shop around the corner! Live music is played sometimes in the summer and that is amazing to watch!",
          "You can see so much in Galway without looking too far. Everything is in look see distance. The Spanish Arch is one such traditional must see.",
          "Great during the summer to sit or grab an ice cream, fish and chips or have a drink. It's very popular place to sit and drink during the summer months for young people about the city. I had many a great day and night there \ud83d\ude04",
          "We saw this was one of the top places to see in Galway. Not exactly sure why but we didn't find it to be THAT spectacular. You might as well do it if you're there because it takes all of 2 minutes to see it but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it if I were you.",
          "Needs ALOT of work! We walked quite a ways to visit here and almost missed it! It looks like a dilapidated building, no explanation anywhere near here what it was for. Don't go out of your way",
          "Medieval arch. Thats about it. If you've never seen one before - this is it; part of the original walls of Galway",
          "Not much to see really. Is old and an arch, I don't know what else to say really, it's a 2 minute look, I wish I could say more. It has historic interest.",
          "It's a cool little architecture atmosphere but it's really just an old arch. Don't get me wrong I love Galway but this is more just a ruin of ancient times.",
          "Luckily I had looked up the history of the Arches (as there are 2 of them) and was a bit dissapointed that there were no information boards of any kind (apart from the sign on the arch) as they would have helped improve the experience. I guess most visitors to Galway would go",
          "Still can't figure out why the arrow on the street sign for The Spanish Arch points left even as you can see the historic site on your right...",
          "We were shown this by my partner's brother who lives in Galway and yeah it was cool but once you walk under it and take some pictures, there's not much else to it. If you're nearby, I'd go to admire it but don't be driving across the country to come and see it.",
          "So, this is a historical item but it is very 'dismissed' and unadorned with signage or the slightest hint of its importance.",
          "Very much a quick stop on the way through Galway. Not too much down here except for at Christmas where they now have set up a lovely Christmas market with excellent hot whiskeys!",
          "the spanish arch is a fantastic place on a summers day to sit and relax and watch the world go by, on certain days there does be water polo or something similiar going on and the swans are beautiful",
          "this is not a stop that one should go out of their way for. It is, however, right on the waterfront and near the museum so a few minutes on the way to another stop would be fine.",
          "These archs are located on the river bank. Built with an intention to protect the city from being looted during early centuries. Because of its location being so lovely it makes it a place where you would love to spend some time during evening hours or when the weather is",
          "Part of the old wall (not inside the shopping center) and a great frame for taking pictures of your sweetie.",
          "We took a walk along the riverfront after dinner, and started here. It's an imposing structure, with a vivid history. I enjoyed photographing it.",
          "Visited with friends, four of us had dinner in the Spanish arch. The good was ok, the music ok. The atmosphere was ok. Not sure I would go out of my way to visit again",
          "There was major construction going on through the arch, so it was harder to get a great view. The history of the name is as interesting as the arch.",
          "This solid harbour entrance is along the Galway river front. You walk through it to go to the Museum beside it, and to walk along the Long Walk street. Interesting history",
          "Spent many a day down here whilst in college in Galway. It's right at the end of shop street and usually has a good crowd there. There is lots of bars and restaurants near by but we would usually get a carry out and sit in the sun. God I miss those days!",
          "tracked it down. many youth sitting around, chatting. looks like a popular spot. glad the town kept some of their history.",
          "The Spanish Arch was built in 1584. It is located in the bustling Latin Quarter of the city on the bank of the river that runs through town. A worthwhile stop when in Galway.",
          "You don't find many intact ruins this old in a city. It may be part of your tour or you can take a tour that will include The Spanish Arch but do yourself a favor and at least stroll by. You can tell the age by looking at the stonework. Facinating.",
          "Our tour guide gave us the history of the arch before we left to see it. Without the history lesson its just an arch so make sure you know why you are seeing it before you go! There was construction going on there when we went so we couldn't get close, but it was still really",
          "The Spanish Arch area of Galway City is hugely interesting. Lots of stone structures build in a different era. Wonderful view across to Claddagh Village. Well worth a visit.",
          "But then it seemed to be under construction (maintenance) when we were there. We did read the plaque about it, so there is some history here. Worth a quick stop if you're checking out Galway.",
          "This landmark or whatever remains of it, is pertinent to Galway's history. That I give it a 5-star. Architecturally, there is not much to rave about so be careful not to bang your head on its hard stone wall after a few pints of beer.",
          "It was a nice arch, old etc. But not a whole lot to see. I realize it is something you want to see in Galway, but I wouldn't plan on spending a bunch of time there.",
          "If you're in the area, like staying at Jury's Hotel, it's an interesting site showing what the city walls used to be. But it's built up all around so not very photo worthy, just interesting. It's just not a site you'd want to travel any distance for a visit.",
          "The arches are an easy diversion to walk through and perhaps pause in, while exploring this section of Galway. While not much to look at, they are a good reminder of what the area once looked like, and a hint at what this area was once known for (importing Spanish wine).",
          "This is located near the waterfront, and next door to the Galway City Museum. It is something to put on your to do list when visiting, but you won't need to spend much time here. There's also a fish market nearby.",
          "Pretty scenic, nice part of Galway but at the end of the day it's just an Arch, albeit a very old one. If your visiting Galway this will be on you to do list.",
          "Perhaps with the tide being out, I wasn't seeing it at its best, but the waterfront beside the Spanish Arch was full of empty beer cans and other rubbish which really took away from the attraction. Galway City Council - clean it up and you'd have yourself a fantastic attraction",
          "Free, short walk from the main area of town/shopping. Beautiful coastal area with great shops and dining. Parking is plentiful but you have to pay. Walk everywhere on old cobblestone streets! Christmas decorations were up and nice!",
          "From how this was promoted among the \"things to do\" in the city, I had thought there might be something more substantial to it. But as the name entails, it is literally just an Arch by the water. On a nice day you can sit by it and listen to buskers and maybe take in the sun.",
          "A nice place to visit when in Galway. Not spectacular by any means but it is a small quiet spot, with some history attached, to spend a little time when strolling through the city.",
          "There isn't really much to see at the Spanish Arch. It is historic. Supposedly this where Columbus finally set sail after getting last provisions for his Atlantic journey and there is a monument to him nearby. Don't come down just to see the Arch. However, if you are on Quay",
          "This place has turned into a drinkers haven, not a safe place to be at night time as full of undesirables",
          "Beautiful preserved walls of the ancient history of Spanish Arch and right behind the walls is the Museum situated it is well loved by people who just want to sit and soak up the Sun right looking over at the Cladagh famous swans.",
          "Supposedly this where Columbus finally set sail after getting last provisions for his Atlantic journey. Lots of history here on a very scenic point. We took engagement photos under the arch and it's a great setting. Grab a sandwich and some beer or wine and have a seat in the",
          "Basically nothing more than 2 brick built arches in a run down looking area. Nothing much to see at all.",
          "You have to go, but don't expect much. The history is more interesting that the actual arch. It's quite small and parts of it were converted to stores. Park near by and walk there since there is no parking on site.",
          "Only came here because of its famous name but it really isn't anything special. I'm glad I saw it, just so I can say I did it, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.",
          "It was a rainy day, so there wasn't much of a view. But being in the surroundings of the arch gives you a great place to walk near the water, a great coffee shop just around the corner and it's right by the Museum, which gives you THE BEST view from the top floor.",
          "The arch is a passage in the old medieval city wall. It sits along the Cobb river and it's easy to imagine the merchants of old unloading Spanish goods.",
          "We walked around the arches but didn't visit the museum or do much else. If you are in the area then see it, but unless you are a history buff I personally wouldn't make a trip to see them.",
          "The only thing that's cool about this is that it's old. We almost missed it because it's just a little arch in the middle of the city. It's nice, but not worth going out of the way for.",
          "The Spanish Arch is one of the lasting historic monuments in Galway City. It's opens up to the museum and today we are still very fascinated with the Spanish arch.",
          "It's an easy stroll along the River Corrib to have a look at the Spanish Arch. It is worth taking a look at it just for the fact of its age, built in the 16th Century. You can't not be impressed by that kind of history.",
          "Don't worry if you don't like it. Just visit it anyway. It's part of Galway's history so go on and check it out. There's a nice museum next to it :)",
          "It is something particula to see in Galway. Personally, I prefer the river and the park of this typical Irish city.",
          "I have expected much more based on the tourist guide description, but it is not a special thing. It was raining and we wanted to see this part of the town regardsless of the weather, but to be honest it was not worth it.... There is a museum next to it and it was a little bit",
          "To tourists that have never visited Galway the Spanish Arch seems to be a time consuming attraction. I beg to differ. Although I do think that it is important to visit the Spanish Arch with some knowledge of the history of Galway it is not a particularly long excursion. The Arch",
          "An arch, that's it, not big or with any further explanation, an old construction in the middle of the way that can be easily missed while looking for it.",
          "I had the Bangers and Mash and Seafood Stew, the food was superb. This Pub had great atmosphere, unequaled to most places I have been! Live music was fantastic! i would definitely go back.",
          "I wouldn't spend loads of time there but it's interesting to see something so old still standing proud.",
          "I had studied the historical significance of the arch before my first trip. When I arrived in May 2009, the grounds were filled with students enjoying the warm sunny day. They added to the interest and the time we spent there. This time, on a cool September afternoon, nobody",
          "The Spanish Arch is mentioned in almost every piece of travel literature on Galway City. It is not necessarily something to write home about, but it is what you make of it. It is on the River Corib, and one could enjoy some take away on the steps and people watch if the weather",
          "it's difficult to imagine ships passed through the archs to unload goods. This old section of the city feels more like a pedestrian crossing and together with the lawns and riverside it is the right place to just walk by or sit and relax on a sunny day.",
          "We stumbled upon the Spanish Arch wandering around Galway. While I wouldn't go out of my way to see it, it is a beautiful area along the river. On a nice day it is a beautiful place to sit and relax.",
          "Visit here, just for the atmosphere alone! We brought two English friends and they loved just ambling up and down the street- we were very fortunate with the sunny day we had- people outside having lunch, tapas - other busking (excellent too!) - it was like we were abroad-",
          "Spanish Arch is located at the mouth of the Corrib river where it flows into Galway Bay, in the area known as the Claddagh. The arch itself is not big, of of particular architectural interest, although it dates back to the 1500's, and adjoins one of the only surviving portions",
          "Constructed by Spaniards in 1584\u2014four years before the Spanish Armada sank in a freak storm but which is attributed to Queen Elizabeth\u2019s navy\u2014as part of the City Wall, only two of the original four arches remain. In the immediate vicinity, there are City Wall remnants, a museum,",
          "It's not a big attraction actually, but it's a nice place to have a walk, feed birds and enjoy the surroundings. It's not far from the centre, so you can always get back to the area of shops and cafes.",
          "Interesting history, but not much to see. Area is great , though, lively and fun. We walked around and through the area a couple of timesand enjoyed the atmosphere and all the variety of people from families to hipsters.",
          "The Spanish Arch itself was only of minor interest. It was part of the city walls that had survived a tsunami many years ago but the area that it is in was very nice with good surrounding gardens, a small market and a lovely stroll along a river area. We certainly enjoyed our",
          "Two arches which aren't an attraction - scraping the barrel if this is a sight!! Some local art has stuck a big red inflatable ball in one of them which livens them up ten fold. Visit for a sit by the river Corrib or visit the Galway museum.",
          "Walking around Galway must include visiting this architectural gem. This was a part of the Galway City Wall - check it out then go to the Thai nearby after!",
          "If you're on Quay Street then it's worth a walk to the Spanish Arch for a photo, but with all of the other amazing architecture in Ireland don't make a special trip to see the arch.",
          "We walked through the arch on our way to eat, the architecture is quite impressive; it's been around since the 1500's",
          "Rock Band! Plenty of Seating and dancing space! Gorgeous People! Rugby on the telly! Good stout (even with a damn shamrock in it! Really let me know this is a tourist town!) Loved this place, Simply awesome",
          "Wonderful place to chill and relax and feel the weather and have some tunes or chst with friends for fun",
          "Really nice spot to visit and to take a walk down by the river on a sunny day. Interesting history within the city and within walking distance of Eyre Square. Worth a visit!",
          "I wasn't sure how to rate this.... The arch is cool, and the history behind is interesting, but its not really an attraction. The key is that the arch is right near Quay Street so just drive by, walk by the arch. Its not really out of the way so just stop by, spend 30 seconds",
          "Not too impressive at all. It's nice because of the other things in the city, and the pier near there. Some information about the history would be great.",
          "Not much to see and very little information. The insides were full of litter and clearly a forgotten about attraction as far as the authorities are concerned. The nearby environment very attractive however",
          "Nice to look at and a good photo op. The surroundings are beautiful... The water and the swans and the boats all make this stop breathtaking. An interesting piece of history in Galway.",
          "A lovely spot, I don't really care about the historic aspect, but from an aesthetic point of view it's fantastic, on a warm day, no matter where in the world I am I just wish I could be at spanish arch.",
          "Ok, it's famous, it's historical and it smells of pee! On a summer's day I can see it being a nice location beside the water. On a winter's afternoon, it has little to offer other than as a brief stop on the way to the museum.",
          "The Spanish Arch is perfect for those rare days when Galway gets warm, sunny weather. Sitting down here lazily with friends and an ice-cream is a good way to people watch and simply enjoy Galway. It is known by young Galwegians as a spot for having a few drinks in the evenings",
          "Galway is a wonderful city with a great vibe. Great place to wander about. On a walk on a lovely sunny afternoon we found our way to the Spanish Arches. It was a neat little area but I don't feel I would go out of my way to find it. I can appreciate the history but did",
          "It wasn't what I had expected. If you need to cut something out of your trip this should be it. It was very small",
          "I liked Galway, especially quay street but to boast the Spanish Arch as an attraction only to disappoint people, that's not okay. It's a blip on the radar. Tiny and dirty, I saw more beer cans then history. Maybe if it was kept up it would be better and the interior is a",

          "For those unfamiliar with it Galway City is the capital of Galway County and is the \"doorway\" to Connemara. The Spanish Arches have become one of Galway's best known landmarks and perhaps it's most popular attraction. Situated right downtown it is just a fascinating location to",
          "Galway doesn't have great sights, and that's ok. But parading the \"Spanish arch\", a narrow and ugly kinda-old arch under a decaying building, well... it means you're really out of options. Luckily you eventually stumble there for other reasons, so it's not a great detour.",
          "I have not found anything special about arch itself, but area around it is nice. It was sunny day so we sit on one of the big stone benches which became warm and I took a quick nap. :)",
          "This arch is symbolic in many ways and worth seeing. Walk under it and stroll along the water. It is very relaxing and beautiful. We are so happy we did not miss it.",
          "Many people are underwhelmed by the Spanish Arch but they're missing the point. This beautiful arch has been in place since the 16th century, built as an extension to the city wall that once surrounded all of Galway city. The name represents the relationship Galway has with",
          "This is really only a small attraction. Its basically the only part of the wall left from the original build as an extension back in the 15th century. There is some good information on wiki which is worth a read if you really want more info on this history of the arch. Spend",

          "If your in Galway take a walk down to the Spanish Arch area and bring the camera right on the waters edge and if the weather is kind you will get a few nice pics of the walls and arches. just another place to visit when in Galway. Also useful for eating houses good pubs and",
          "This should not be a tourist attraction since there are so many Spanish structures all around the world much bigger and larger than this. Considering however that this is a nice place to relax and rest after seeing the beautiful city of Galway then it is worth your time to relax",
          "There's this arch, you see. You know, stones go up and then down again in the shape of a - oh, did I say it was rounded? Really not worth the time on it's own. Drop by the museum and you'll see it going and coming.",
          "Not worth adding to your travel itinerary even if something else tales you to Galway. In area of overpriced and poor quality restaurants and pubs. The local authority also needs to increase its litter patrols.",
          "This restaurant next to the Spanish Arches (which take all of 2 seconds to take in) was so quaint and full of character. Book a table and take loads of cash as it's popular and expensive - but worth it - the kind of food you photograph before relishing! Not an extensive menu as",
          "We slipped (literally) in to the harbor, and sheltered under the bridge in a deluge. Nothing more than a quick spot to take in if you're near the area, but not worth going out of your way. The pubs and cafes were warm and friendly.",
          "I hesitate to call this an 'attraction'. It's a piece of architecture that you look at for a few moments. You can't really do anything with it, other than walk under it and imagine the history it has seen. If you are a history buff that's kind of cool. If you're not, so what.",
          "there was a tea shop right next to it for a break and it was a lovely place def worth a look next to the harbor as well so you could look to the sea",
          "A very old stone arch, sorely neglected, barely distinguishable. Easily forgotten. Not even photo worthy. A neighboring arch had junk discarded in it. If Galway doesn't care, should you or I? Pathetic.",
          "It's fun to imagine who passed beneath these arches and where they were going to or coming from. From the Spanish trading times.",
          "It was alright, but I walked past it the first time thinking that there is no way that this is what they were talking about. Loved Galway, but I. Thought that the river walk in town was much more interesting than this tiny arch.",
          "The Spanish arch is truly an amazing piece of history hard to believe its age and soundness of construction ... A quiet stroll down to the harbour and you can stroll through the arch ...",
          "Checked out this attraction during our stay. Its located away from the centre of town but there is some good scenery nearby. Also located close to lots of pubs and restaurants.",
          "Charming area right on the riverbank. We loved dining at Ard Bia at Nimmos, and loved seeing a Great Blue Heron sitting on the steps of another nearby restaurant, as if he was just waiting for opening time, so he could have his dinner.",
          "I planned two days for Galway however, you only need about 5-10 minutes for this attraction. Nice for a photo-op and to feed the swans. Book a day tour with Galway Tour Company to see the Cliffs of Moher!",

          "This is part of the old walls of the city. There are more of the old walls and buildings to be seen around the city. If is quite a small area so you could do it on your own but I think going on a walking tour might be a better idea so that you can learn the history without",
          "We saw this on our free walking tour around Galway (also recommend) and enjoyed hearing the story of the wall. Very picturesque setting as well. Took some of my best photos in Galway here (I'll post some later)- it's right near the harbor where the River Corrib is. Don't know",
          "Had a gorgeous lunch time meal here...beef and guiness pie with champ and veg .A Lovely friendly waitress thtat gave us lots of tips about where to go. Really cosy restaurant with a lovely open fire and great atmosphere. Would recommend this place to everyone but if youre going",

          "evryone mentions the Spanish arch when you are going to Galway, but really it is a short section of wall, with an archway you can walk through. Galway is pretty small so you may as well see it, and you will if you go to the museum or the promenade, just don't expect to be amazed.",
          "The Spanish arches are nice to look at. But the park surrounding the arch is much nicer. Read the inscription about Christopher Columbus on the other side of the park, then walk over the arches to get a closer look. Grab a coffee and sit on the grass among the locals - a great",
          "Nothing really special here, just an old Spanish Arch. That being said, it's worth seeing it and there's plenty to do around it: a nice cafe, the museum and the ocean.",
          "Nice, easy to find arch in Galway. Having seen a lot of historical architectural sites that are on a grander scale, I wouldn't go out of my way to drive here to see it, but if you're in town it's worth a stroll.",
          "Basically it's just two arches near the water. One you can walk through and the other is enclosed and locked up by an iron gate where you can see some old stones and stuff. It takes a second to see and it's free.",
          "As others have stated this is small but is so old you just have to go see it. There is so much history attached to this area alone and its a very important part of the history of Galway. You pass it on the way to the City Museum. There's a monument to Christopher Columbus and",

          "When we read about the Spanish Arch, we thought it would be grand or, at least, stand out a bit more than it does. It's basically a hole in a very old wall and it's tucked in a corner, so I guess that doesn't help make it stand out. If you turn from the Arch, though, you see the",
          "If you're expecting to be wowed by the \"Sparch\", lower those expectations. It's a small arch that's just there. It is more the history behind it, Galway's seafaring past, links with Spain, and its focal point in the city that is important. Apparently it was nearly destroyed by",

        "wiki": "Galway ( GAWL-way; Irish: Gaillimh, pronounced [\u02c8\u0261al\u0320\u02b2\u026av\u02b2]) is a city in County Galway in the West of Ireland, in the province of Connacht. It lies on the River Corrib between Lough Corrib and Galway Bay, and is the sixth most populous city in Ireland, with a population at the 2016 Census of 79,934.Galway is renowned for its vibrant lifestyle and for hosting numerous festivals, celebrations and events such as The Galway Arts Festival. In 2018, it was named the European Region of Gastronomy. The city is currently the European Capital of Culture for 2020, alongside Rijeka, Croatia.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe city's name comes from the Irish name Gaillimhe, which formed the western boundary of the earliest settlement, D\u00fan Gaillimhe \"Fort Gaillimh\". (Mythical and alternative derivations of the name are given in History of Galway). Historically, the name was Anglicised as Galliv or Gallive, closer to the Irish pronunciation. The city's name in Latin is Galvia. Residents of the city are referred to as Galwegians.\nThe city also bears the nickname \"City of the Tribes\" (Irish: Cathair na dTreabh) because of the fourteen merchant families called the \"tribes of Galway\" who led the city in its Hiberno-Norman period.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nD\u00fan Gaillimhe (\"Fort at the Mouth (bottom) of the Gaillimh\") was constructed in 1124, by the King of Connacht, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088\u20131156). A settlement grew around it. During the Norman invasion of Connacht in the 1230s, D\u00fan Gaillimhe was captured by Richard Mor de Burgh, who had led the invasion. As the de Burghs eventually became Gaelicised, the merchants of the town, the Tribes of Galway, pushed for greater control over the walled city.\nThis led to their gaining complete control over the city and to the granting of mayoral status by the English crown in December 1484. Galway endured difficult relations with its Irish neighbours. A notice over the west gate of the city, completed in 1562 by Mayor Thomas \u00d3ge Martyn, stated \"From the Ferocious O'Flahertys may God protect us\". A by-law forbade the native Irish (as opposed to Galway's Hiberno-Norman citizens) unrestricted access into Galway, saying \"neither O\u2019 nor Mac shall strutte nor swagger through the streets of Galway\" without permission.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Galway was ruled by an oligarchy of fourteen merchant families (twelve who claimed to be of Norman origin and two of Irish origin). These were the \"Tribes of Galway\". The city thrived on international trade, and in the Middle Ages, it was the principal Irish port for trade with Spain and France. The most famous reminder of those days is ceann an bhalla (\"the end of the wall\"), now known as the Spanish Arch, constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin (1519\u201320). In 1477 Christopher Columbus visited Galway, possibly stopping off on a voyage to Iceland or the Faroe Islands. Seven or eight years later, he noted in the margin of his copy of Imago Mundi:\n\nMen of Cathay have come from the west. [Of this] we have seen many signs. And especially in Galway in Ireland, a man and a woman, of extraordinary appearance, have come to land on two tree trunks [or timbers? or a boat made of such?]\nThe most likely explanation for these bodies is that they were Inuit swept eastward by the North Atlantic Current.During the 16th and 17th centuries Galway remained loyal to the English crown for the most part, even during the Gaelic resurgence, perhaps for reasons of survival. However, by 1642 the city had allied itself with the Catholic Confederation of Kilkenny during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. During the resulting Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Cromwellian forces captured the city after a nine-month siege. At the end of the 17th century the city supported the Jacobites in the Williamite war in Ireland and was captured by the Williamites after a very short siege not long after the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. The great families of Galway were ruined. The city suffered further under the potato famines of 1845\u20131852, and it did not fully recover until the period of strong economic growth of the late 20th century (see Celtic Tiger).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike most of Ireland, Galway has an oceanic climate (Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, being one of the world's mildest cities for latitude, partly because it is on an island. Galway has a year-round mild, moist, temperate and changeable climate, due to the prevailing winds of the North Atlantic Current together with the Gulf Stream (on the other side of the Atlantic temperatures can be 20 \u00b0C cooler or more.). The city does not experience temperature extremes, with temperatures below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) being rare. The city receives an average of 1,156 mm (45.51 in) of precipitation annually, which is evenly distributed throughout the year. The average January temperature in the city is 5.9 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F) and the average July temperature is 15.9 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). The highest temperature ever recorded in Galway was 31.7 \u00b0C (89.1 \u00b0F) in July 1921, whilst the lowest temperature recorded was \u221211.7 \u00b0C (10.9 \u00b0F) in January 1945.While extreme weather is rare, the city and county can experience severe windstorms that are the result of vigorous Atlantic depressions that occasionally pass along the north west coast of Ireland. Most of these storms occur between late autumn and early spring. Due to the city's northerly location, Galway has long summer days. Sunrise on summer solstice occurs at 05:07 WEST and sunset at 22:07. By contrast, on winter solstice, the sun rises at 08:49 WET, and sets at 16:19.\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\nLynch's Castle on Shop Street is a medieval town house built by the prosperous Lynch family in the 16th century and is now a branch of Allied Irish Banks.\nThe Church of Ireland St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church is the largest medieval church still in everyday use in Ireland. It was founded in 1320 and enlarged in the following two centuries.\nThe Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas was consecrated in 1965 and is a far larger building constructed from limestone. It has an eclectic style, with a Renaissance Revival dome, pillars and round arches, and a Romanesque Revival portico that dominates the main fa\u00e7ade \u2013 which is an unusual feature in modern Irish church building.\nThe original quadrangle building of NUI Galway which was erected in 1849 (during the Great Famine or An Gorta M\u00f3r) as one of the three colleges of the Queen's University of Ireland (along with Queen's University Belfast and University College Cork). The university holds the UNESCO archive of spoken material for the Celtic languages.\nThe Hardiman, (originally the Railway Hotel, then the Great Southern Hotel and then Hotel Meyrick) built by the Great Southern Railway Company in 1845. Sitting at the southern perimeter of Eyre Square, it is the city's oldest hotel still in operation.\nThe remains of Menlo Castle can be seen outside the city, on the eastern bank of the River Corrib. It was one of the ancestral homes of the Blake family, one of the Tribes of Galway from c. 1600\u20131910. The fa\u00e7ade of the family's townhouse (\"Blake's Castle\") is still extant next to Jury's Hotel at the bottom of Quay Street.\nEglinton Canal, named after a former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, joins the River Corrib to the sea, and flows for just more than a kilometre from the University to the Claddagh.\nThe Claddagh is the oldest part of Galway but little or nothing remains of its old thatched village. However, in a side altar of the parish church, St Mary's on the Hill, is the late medieval statue of Our Lady of Galway. The ancient ritual of the Blessing of the Bay takes place on the Sunday nearest the feast of the Assumption.\nThe Browne doorway, originally located on Lower Abbeygate Street but now standing at the north end of Eyre Square, was the doorway to the townhouse of the Browne family, one of the fourteen Tribes of Galway.\nThe Lynch Window, (on Market Street), at which is a plaque commemorating one of the city's legends. According to legend, in 1493, the then Mayor, James Lynch FitzStephen, hanged his own son for the murder of a young Spanish visitor who had the misfortune to befriend the girlfriend of the Mayor's son.\nThe Hall of the Red Earl (Halla an Iarla Rua) can be viewed through a protective glass wall off Flood Street. It is the earliest medieval settlement fragment surviving within the walls of the city. It was built by the de Burgo family in the 13th century and was a key municipal building for the collection of taxes, dispensation of justice and hosting banquets. It was the medieval equivalent of tax office, court house and town hall.\n\n\n==== The Claddagh ====\n\nOn the west bank of the River Corrib as it enters the sea is the ancient neighbourhood of The Claddagh. For centuries it was an Irish-speaking enclave outside the city walls. Claddagh residents were mainly fisher folk and were governed by an elected 'King'. The King of the Claddagh settled or arbitrated disputes among the locals and had the privilege of a white sail on his fishing boat. The last true king, Martin Oliver, died in 1972. The title is still used but in a purely honorary and ceremonial context. The current King is Michael Lynskey. The area is also famous for its association with the Claddagh Ring.\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nThe Galway City Museum has two main sections: one about the heritage of Galway and one about Irish artists from the second half of the 20th century. This museum also houses the statue of the poet, P\u00e1draic \u00d3 Conaire which was originally located in the Kennedy Park section of Eyre Square, prior to the Square's renovation.

It is sometimes referred to as the 'Bilingual Capital of Ireland', although like elsewhere in the Republic of Ireland, inhabitants converse mostly in English. The city is well known for its \"Irishness\", mainly because it has on its doorstep the Galway Gaeltacht. Irish theatre, television and radio production and Irish music form a component of Galway city life, with both An Taibhdhearc, the National Irish Language Theatre, in Galway city itself, while TG4 and RT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na Gaeltachta headquarters are in the Connemara Gaeltacht elsewhere in County Galway.

The Roman Catholic diocese of Galway was created in 1831 following the abolition by the Holy See of the Wardenship of Galway. It was united with the diocese of Kilmacduagh (est. 1152) and given the administratorship of the diocese of Kilfenora (est. 1152) in 1883. Its full name is the Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Apostolic Administratorship of Kilfenora (in Irish \u2013 Deoise na Gaillimhe, Chill Mac Duach agus Riarach\u00e1n Aspalda Cill Fhionn\u00farach, in Latin \u2013 Diocesis Galviensis, Duacensis ac Administratio Apostolica Finaborensis). The diocese is under the patronage Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas (Galway), Saint Fachanan (Kilmacduagh) and St Colman (Kilfenora). As the diocese of Kilfenora is in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Cashel the Bishop of Galway is its Apostolic Administrator rather than its bishop. The dioceses of Galway and Kilmacduagh are in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Tuam. The current bishop is Most Rev. Martin Drennan, installed 3 July 2005. Of the 38 parishes in the RC diocese 14 are situated in the city and are divided into two deaneries \u2013 the deanery of Galway City West and that of Galway City East. In each deanery a Vicar Forane exercises limited jurisdiction on behalf of the bishop.\nIn the Church of Ireland, Galway is a parish of the United Diocese of Tuam, Killala and Achonry. The principal church of the parish is the St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church (founded 1320). Russian, Romanian, Coptic, and Mar Thoma Syrian Orthodox Churches use the facilities of St Nicholas Collegiate Church for their services.

Pearse Stadium in Salthill is the home to Galway GAA, the county's Gaelic games body. The Galway hurlers compete annually in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship for the Liam MacCarthy Cup.  Despite having won the cup only five times in their history, Galway is considered as one of the top teams in the Championship. Galway reached the 2012 All-Ireland final only to draw with Kilkenny to force a replay, the first since 1959, which they eventually lost. In 2017 Galway lifted the Liam MacCarthy Cup for the first time in 29 years beating Waterford by 0-26 to 2-17.

The club was formed in 2013 and first competed in the 2014 season.\nThe previous tenants of Eamonn Deacy Park, also called Galway United, first competed in the League of Ireland since 1977, then known as Galway Rovers. Michael D. Higgins, later elected President of Ireland in 2011, served as a president of the club in a ceremonial capacity. Following struggles with debts, the club became defunct at the end of the 2011 season. The Galway United Supporters Trust (GUST) had been servicing many debts of the company and were able to keep the club afloat for the 2011 season, with it having been effectively abandoned by its directors. GUST withdrew their support for the team and applied to join the 2012 League of Ireland as a community enterprise, rather than as a private company, which the old club had been. This application was not successful, however.\nGalway F.C. was formed the following year from a merger of GUST with Mervue United and Salthill Devon, two other clubs in the city, who had competed in the First Division since 2009 and 2010 respectively.\n\n\n==== Rugby ====\n\n\n===== Professional =====\nThe professional team for the province, Connacht Rugby, is based in the city.

Most industry and manufacturing in Galway, like the rest of Ireland, is hi-tech (e.g. ICT, medical equipment, electronics, chemicals, etc.), due to the Celtic Tiger economic boom. Companies such as Boston Scientific, Medtronic, EA Games, Cisco and SAP AG have their regional offices or other offices in Galway City and environs. Tourism is also of major importance to the city, which had over 2.1 million visitors in 2000, and produced revenue of over \u20ac400 million.The head office of Smyths, a toy shop company, is in Galway.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\n\n==== Radio ====\nThere are two radio stations based in the city \u2013 Galway Bay FM (95.8 FM) broadcasts from the city to the whole county; Flirt FM (101.3 FM) is the student radio station for NUI Galway.\n\n\n==== Print ====\nOne of the main regional newspapers for the county is The Connacht Tribune which prints two titles every week, the Connacht Tribune on Thursday, and the Galway City Tribune on Friday.

Galway Hub is a free resource for both practitioners and the general public in which to engage with the arts and cultural events across the city and county.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Air ====\nGalway Airport, located 6 km (3.73 mi) east of the city at Carnmore, ceased to have scheduled passenger flights on 1 November 2011.  Because the runway is too short to take modern passenger jet aircraft, it it only capable of imited operations. Aerfort na Minna (22 km (13.67 mi) west of the city) operates regular flights to each of the Aran Islands (Oile\u00e1in \u00c1rann). Shannon Airport (90 km) and Ireland West Airport Knock (86 km) are the nearest international airports, both of which have flights around Ireland and to Britain, Continental Europe and North America (from Shannon).\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nBuses are the main form of public transport in the city and county. Routes operated by Bus \u00c9ireann include routes 401 (Salthill/Parkmore), 402 (Seacrest/Merlin Park), 404 (Newcastle/Oranmore), 405 (Rahoon/Ballybane), 407 (B\u00f3thar an Ch\u00f3iste) and 409 (Parkmore Industrial). Routes operated by City Direct include routes 410 (Salthill), 411 (Knocknacarra - Cappagh Rd), 412 (Knocknacarra Express), and 414 (Barna).Various bus companies also provide links throughout County Galway and nationwide.  These operate from a number of locations:\n\nThe main bus and rail station in the city is Ceannt Station.\nGalway Coach Station, located at Fairgreen, is also a coach transport hub. Scheduled direct and commuter services operate between the Coach Station, Dublin and Dublin Airport, as well as services to Limerick, Cork and Clifden. These are operated by Gobus and Citylink.\nOther regional bus operators use various bus stops around the city centre, and many serve the NUIG and GMIT campuses as well.\n\n\n==== Rail ====\n\nGalway's main railway station is Ceannt Station (St\u00e1isi\u00fan Cheannt), which opened in 1851, and was renamed in honour of \u00c9amonn Ceannt in 1966. A major redevelopment, including a completely new urban district, Ceannt Station Quarter, has been proposed for the station and adjoining land.\nThe Midland Great Western Railway reached Galway in 1851, giving the city a direct main line to its Broadstone Station terminus in Dublin. As the 19th century progressed the rail network in Connacht was expanded, making Galway an important railhead. The nearby town of Athenry became a railway junction, giving Galway links to Ennis, Limerick and the south in 1869 and Sligo and the north in 1894. In 1895 the MGW opened a branch line between Galway and Clifden.\nThe 20th century brought increasing road competition, and this led the Great Southern Railways to close the Clifden branch in 1935. In the 1970s the state railway authority C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann closed the Sligo-Athenry-Ennis line to passenger services. It later closed to freight as well.\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann, Ireland's national rail operator, currently runs six return passenger services each day between Galway and Dublin Heuston, also serving intermediate stations. Travel time is just under 3 hours. Services on the Galway\u2013Limerick line have now resumed, with around 5\u20136 trains each way per day.\nFrom Galway railway services along the Western Rail Corridor link the city with Ennis, and Limerick where trains run to Cork via Limerick Junction (for Tipperary, Clonmel and Waterford) and Mallow (for Killarney and Tralee).\n\n\n==== Road ====\nFour national primary roads serve the city: the M6 motorway running east\u2013west (Athlone, Dublin), the M17 motorway running north from the M6 to Tuam, the N63, formerly the N17, connecting Galway with the Northwest (Tuam, Sligo, Donegal Town, Letterkenny and Derry), and the M18 motorway linking Galway to southern towns and cities Gort, Ennis, Shannon Town, Limerick and Cork joining up with The Wild Atlantic Way. In addition, there are plans for a semi-ring road of the city, the Galway City Outer Bypass. There is also an Inner City Ring (Cuar Inmhe\u00e1nach) route that encircles the city centre, most of which is pedestrianised.\nGalway is considered the gateway to Connemara and the Gaeltacht, including M\u00e1m, An Teach D\u00f3ite, Cor na M\u00f3na, Ros Muc, Bearna and An Cheathr\u00fa Rua. The N59 along the western shore of Lough Corrib and the R337 along the northern shore of Galway Bay both lead to this largely rural and highly scenic region.\n\n\n==== Waterways ====\nThe River Corrib is by far the most important waterway in Galway and a number of canals and channels were built above and through the city. The purposes of these to divert and control the water from the river, to harness its power and to provide a navigable route to the sea.  Of these, there were two major schemes \u2013 one between 1848 and 1858 and the other during the 1950s. The canals provided a power source for Galway and were the location of the first industries in the mid-19th century. The Eglinton Canal provided a navigation from the sea (at the Claddagh Basin) to the navigable part of the river (above the Salmon Weir Bridge). Most of the mills are still used today for various purposes; for instance, NUI Galway still uses a water turbine for electricity generation for their building on Nun's Island.\nCurrently, there are four bridges across the Corrib. Following the southward flow of the river these are, from the north: the Quincentennial Bridge, the Salmon Weir Bridge, the William O'Brien Bridge and the Wolfe Tone Bridge. There are plans for a fifth bridge as part of the Galway City Outer Bypass project. The Clare River flows from the North of the County Galway, through Tuam, Claregalway into Lough Corrib.\n\n\n==== Harbour ====\n\nGalway is the most central port on the West Coast of Ireland in the sheltered eastern corner of Galway Bay. The harbour can be used by vessels up to 10,000 tonnes deadweight (DWT) and the inner dock can accommodate up to 9 vessels at any one time. Pending approval, Galway Harbour may see major changes, should the \u20ac1.5 billion development plan go ahead.\nRegular passenger ferry and freight services operate between Galway and the tourist destination of the Aran Islands which is home to World Heritage Site D\u00fan Aonghasa. The islands also have regular links with the towns of Rossaveal and Doolin, which are physically closer but far smaller.\nCommuter ferry services have been proposed to the tourism town of Kinvara, on the opposite side of Galway Bay.Major work in the harbour area was carried out in 2009 to accommodate the stopover of the Volvo Ocean Race. This was one of the biggest events ever to visit Galway. The event returned with the finale of the race in June 2012. This was unprecedented in Volvo Ocean Race history.\n\n\n==== Walking ====\nThe city is planned as the start of the E2 European long-distance path, running for 4,850 kilometres (3,010 mi) to Nice, though the Irish section is as yet incomplete.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nGalway Textile Printers, located on Sandy Road, was the first major industry to come to Galway and quickly became one of the biggest employers in the west of Ireland. Some of those who worked there were specialists who were brought in to help set the factory up, but most employees were local. The Mills eventually went out of business in the early 1980s and its former site now hosts various small business establishments.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAs of 2002, there were 27 primary schools and 11 secondary schools in Galway.\n\n\n=== University ===\nNUI Galway was founded in 1845 as Queen's College, Galway, and was more recently known as University College, Galway (U.C.G.). It is divided into several colleges including the College of Arts, Social Science and Celtic Studies, the College Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences,  the College of Business, Public Policy and Law, the College of Science and the College of Engineering and Informatics. The university had an enrollment of 16000 in 2010.\nThe Biomedical Research Building was opened in 2014. It houses the Regenerative Medicine Institute (REMEDI). Also opened in 2014 were the Hardiman Building and a School of Psychology. The Hardiman Building is home to the university's collection of more than 350 literary, theatrical, political and historical archives. The building houses also the Moore Institute for Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences and the Whitaker Institute for Innovation and Societal Change. The National Institute for Prevention and Cardiovascular Health (NIPC) is an affiliate of NUI Galway.The offices of the Central Applications Office (C.A.O.) are also located in the city, this being the clearing house for undergraduate college and university applications in the Republic of Ireland; a related organisation, the Postgraduate Applications Centre, processes some taught postgraduate courses.\n\n\n=== Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) ===\n\nGMIT, in addition to having two campuses in Galway City, also has campuses in Castlebar, Letterfrack and Mountbellew. GMIT's Galway campus is based on the Dublin Road in Galway city, overlooking Galway Bay. It is the administrative headquarters for the Institute and has four Schools of study; the School of Business, the School of Engineering, the School of Science & Computing, and the College of Tourism & Arts.\n\n\n== Health ==\nPublicly funded health care and social services are provided in Galway by the HSE (West) division of the Health Services Executive.\nThe main city hospital, University Hospital Galway, is located on two campuses \u2014 Galway University Hospital and Merlin Park University Hospital.Two private hospitals \u2013 The Galway Clinic and the Bon Secours Hospital, Galway \u2013 also operate in the city.\nGalway Hospice provides palliative care for the people of Galway City and County on a homecare, inpatient and daycare basis.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of twin towns and sister cities in the Republic of Ireland\nThe Galway Line\nTerryland Forest Park\nGalway Technology Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Galway travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGalway City Council (local authority)\nGalway City and County Cultural Website",

          "Galway Cathedral is a land mark in Galway and you can see the Cathedral from far. Looks old but was built in the 1970s. The outside is a kind of impressive and it's great location near the river Corrib but the inside is disappointing. So my advice take a look and some picture",

          "A beautiful edifice inside but I shudder to think the money that is spent on its upkeep. No doubt the parishioners of Galway are regularly asked to dig deep into their pockets for money that might better be spent on the homeless of the city. The shop offers a higher standard of",

          "The Galway Cathedral was really cool. While I was there; there were a lot of students coming and going. But the interior is worth the time to go in and look around.",
          "The layout of this cathedral is very interesting well worth dropping into. You will only spend a few minutes there. They have history boards telling the story of the Cathedral.",

          "Beautiful place. I am so happy that I made it there today. Love the translations of the map of the cathedral.",

          "Built in 20c this cathedral looks quite stark from the outside due to its granite exterior , also it\u2019s located in essential a traffic island! Inside there are some lovely stained glass windows and it\u2019s interesting to see a medieval design built in a modern way. Worth a look",
          "This cathedral is gigantic and much like the doctors tardis, it truly appears bigger on the inside. Take your time inside and really admire the art, sculptures, stained glass and architecture. It\u2019s stunning.",
          "One of the last cathedrals to be built in Europe. The colors, the ceilings, the whole church was amazing. Parking is tricky, so go early. I would highly recommend making this a must see.",

          "Visited the Cathedral today for the start of the annual Novena. Fabulous building and delightful to see it practically full. Beautiful sound from the organ and the congregation in full voice. Impeccably kept building and well worth a visit for anyone visiting Galway",
          "As a non practising Catholic the cathedral meant a lot to me. It is magnificent, easy access and beautifully laid out.",

          "The interior of the cathedral is richly decorated in striking colours complete with an impressive dome and stained glass windows. It is probably the most impressive place of worship in and around the Galway region and well worth a visit for a couple of hours. Access is quite",

          "Gorgeous cathedral. We were able to catch part of mass, which was so special the Sunday before Christmas. The inside of the church is stunning!",
          "I was offended when I went to the toilet and there was a .50\u20ac request. There are numerous money request throughout the cathedral. Although it is a splendid structure, these signs take away from the spiritual aspect in being a place of God.",
          "The Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas is more commonly known as Galway Cathedral. We were able to walk a comfortable distance to the Cathedral for Sunday Mass. The Cathedral is the largest Catholic Church in Galway. Although new it is quite beautiful",
          "We were surprised how new the cathedral is - it looks remarkable, I'd say even more inside than outside. :) Lovely gardens nearby as well.

          "No drink will be found on the premises, what a disappointment. At least there is a nice picture of a bearded man in the window.",
          "We were intrigued to see what was inside the dome, but the church is nothing really special. It is not super old, or super ornate. Nothing out of the ordinary.",
          "Beautiful cathedral but being a New Yorker St Patrick\u2019s on 5th Ave in Manhattan is still my favorite. But this cathedral is a must see while in Galway..",
          "Cathedral that's over 50 years old and have been refurbished , interesting old photos of the whole building process on the site of the old Galway Jail. Nice stained glass windows in the form of rose shapes",

          "Our tour director told us to make time to walk over to the Cathedral. Though it is a bit out of the way from the central square, it is worth the effort. It is a magnificent structure and beautiful church. We were so glad we were advised to go because it is out of the way",
          "The walk is worth the visit of the Galway cathedral. It is majestic and a quiet havre of peace and prayer. It is better to visit the cathedral in the off season as there are many bus loads of people that come to visit this house of prayer.",
          "This is a must go to place in Galway City! Even before you walk up to the cathedral the 'bridge' leading up to it looks spectacular- overlooking the river! Tourists were all over the place. Highly recommended.",
          "Went to do a bit of photography and wound up also attending Mass and shopping at the gift shop. A delightful stop while in Galway. The Stations of the Cross were made by an Irish artist and are beautifully crafted (photo posted).",
          "One of my favourite places to stop by in Galway. Built in 1965 with a strong Spanish architectural influence it's always worth a visit anytime of the year. At Christmas, the live crib will be on display outside the main entrance.",
          "We went to this beautiful Cathedral on a Saturday evening after a rather exhausting day of travel. The Cathedral itself is stunning, with it's central altar and stained glass windows. After mass, we roamed around a bit, and were greeted warmly by a local (who immediately pegged",
          "We went here this month for a quick visit before service started. Wished we had longer as it was stunning inside. If you have time - definitely visit.",

          "Parking very busy around the cathedral area. Well worth a visit though. A beautiful and really grand building in grey stone. Particularly liked the central dome and the unusual purple lighting. Just stunning. Built on the site of an old gaol and positioned right by the river.",
          "For the size of the city this is a huge church. Great to visit and worth the detour and about half an hour for the visit.",
          "Attended mass on the Sunday evening and difficult acoustics with the microphone on. Also disappointed that tour group priest from USA led the mass rather than the local priest with a lilting Irish voice.",
          "We were blown away by the rock work and the modern stained glass. It is hard to believe that this cathedral is only 50 years old.",
          "Amazing structure which such beautiful architecture. So many different stations to pray at and reflect.",
          "It was a Sunday and I just wanted a peek so I went in. A service was taking place and a hymn being sung so felt a bit guilty taking a couple of pictures but it was so beautiful I couldn't resist. It is quite grand with lots of parking inside the grounds.",
          "Not mush into seeing churches as seen a few, seen them all. But this one was about 1/2 mile from our hotel so we walked there for a few minutes late in the afternoon to sit inside, light soem candles, pray and see the refurb they did a few years ago. The place is really worth",

          "This cathedral is new. It has an odd vibe as new construction and modern-ish stained glass meet old architectural style made of modern building materials. It is grand - to be sure - but it feels oddly strained and artificial.",
          "The 1965 Galway Catholic Cathedral may look austere from the outside however the inside is most spacious and impressive with it's attractive stonework, windows and mosaics.",
          "This 1965 Renaissance styled 'Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas' is most impressive. Being interested in architecture I always like seeing such buildings however one could not help feeling that the emphasis here was on money from visitors. The cathedral",
          "In my travels I always enjoy looking at churchs and Galway was no exception. We hiked from Jurys Inn down the canal to Galway Cathedral. It is beautiful on the outside as well as the inside. The day we were there, a young lass was getting married. I have to say the tourists",
          "I always love to stop by and see churches. This was quite beautiful. I felt there was way too many donation plates. I really do not like \"donating\" money to use the bathroom.",
          "I only happened to stop at the Galway Cathedral because it was near the end of the river walk. This is a very impressive cathedral that I would highly recommend seeing.",
          "The Cathedral is probably the highlight of Galway which is just a small town. I enjoyed the music that they played inside.",
          "The Galway Cathedral looked a lot older than it is, but had many modern effects. The wooden ceiling was magnificent. It's well worth the stop.",
          "Love the windows in this church. Very peaceful. Nice place to sit down for a rest and just admire the surroundings.",

          "Very atmospheric with stunning stained glass windows, high painted dome and mosaics. Definitely with visiting.",
          "It looks like a huge concrete edifice to the Catholic Church but within it echoes wonderful warmth and welcome. Stone walls, polished wood, old and new this edifice is well worthy of a visit.",
          "I like visiting churches everywhere I travel and have seen some very beautiful and impressive churches. Galway Cathedral was so unexpected. It doesn't have the frescoes or sculpture but it was massive in size and the height was amazing. The architecture was different yet",
          "There are a lot of cathedrals in Ireland. The great thing about Galway Cathedral is it is a modern building that is as inspiring as an ancient one. The stained glass windows, the ceiling, and the craftsmanship is inspiring. This is a cathedral that is worth the visit.",
          "We were in town and came here to visit the cathedral. It is a relatively new church being built in the 1960's on the site of old prison. We were impressed with its architecture and windows.",
          "Just a short walk to the Cathedral from Eyre Square, the Galway Cathedral is definitely not to be missed. Built in a traditional style, with modern accents. Find the mosaic of JFK in a side chapel. Very Impressive.",
          "You can see it from far distance, good meeting point. Situated in a nice area, near river. Nice inside, very very large and free !",

          "A rainy break having a look at Galway Cathedral. Amazing glass work and detailed woodwork. A tranquil space.",
          "The tile work and stained glass is amazing in this artfully built cathedral. There is a mural that includes John F Kennedy - and the staff greet you at the door with an informative brochure. A donation is suggested at entry.",
          "The cathedral is really impressive; seen from the outside, with all its solid stones, gives the impression of something eternal, there for hundreds of years. Instead, it was built some sixty years ago. It has to be said, however, that it has been built very well, putting it",
          "The Galway Cathedral is an amazing place to visit regardless of your religious affiliation. The history associated with this building is amazing. Hop on/hop off bus is a great way to get to the Cathedral.",
          "The Cathedral is relatively modern of a questionable architectural design. It's on the tourist route and worth a visit. Parking is a major problem in the area so be prepared for a walk.",

          "It was nice to visit the city's present cathedral as opposed to all the ancient ruins for a change. One can obviously attend a service if there at the right time but we enjoyed the quiet and opportunity to look around in peace.",
          "What a beautiful Cathedral, from the altar in the center, with the Communion rails all around, to the organ, it was a sight to behold.",
          "Amazing Cathedral worth the visit, Mass daily, 1 service each week in Irish. Traveling with a Catholic, attended Mass, very short service. Beautiful Cathedral worth a trip or attending Mass.",
          "This is a great stop while visiting Galway. A truly impressive cathedral, that we just happened to walk by while touring the city. Very happy we stopped in.",

          "Beautiful and popular city tour attractions in Galway city. A lot of tourists come and visit the place and get to know more about its architecture and history. The cathedral can be seen from almost entire city as its bit huge in height then rest of the city. A very comfortable",
          "This building is very impressive with it's timber room and amazing stain glass windows. It was surprising to find a shop in the middle of the buiulding but then I guess the church must do every thing to get money to pay for its sins.",
          "I loved this Cathedral. We stayed at an Airbnb in Galway and decided to take a morning stroll. We ended up at the Cathedral about the time Mass was finishing. The views are spectacular and the building has a grand presence as something to be seen while in Galway!",

          "This is a newer Cathedral that looks old, but at the same time feels comfortable. The stained glass windows, The Stations of the Cross, and the mosaics are beautiful works of art. I love the window of Mary knitting and Jesus serving a cup of tea to Joseph.",
          "This is a lovely building from the outside, but the interior is among the most beautiful I have seen. Apart from the serenity, the combination of colours and lighting effects produces a very special aura. It is worth walking all the way around in order to experience its",
          "A beautiful cathedral with amazing mosaics and wooden ceilling. Surprising that it was built only in 1965...more used to older churches :-) in Europe. It's worth visiting ! (Free, 2\u20ac donation if wished)",
          "Opened in 1959, but still had nice atmosphere and lovely stained glass windows. The central dome is impressive, even for a modern building, and nice background music set a quiet ambiance.",
          "Very nice cathedral to visit and say a prayers or adoration......the cathedral is very large and ornate!",

          "This cathedral looks as though it has been there forever given its architecture and location. It hasn't. It is about fifty years old. I appreciated the exhibit about the construction and dedication of the building. It was quite impressive.",

          "Beautiful place to visit. Open all day and people around to welcome you and give advice. Only time you can't enter is when mass is being said, obviously. Nice shop inside with staff who are very helpful. In a very busy city this place is an oasis of tranquility",

          "Loved my walk around Galway! This cathedral is still an active part of the community. Hire a docent to f you have time as the history here is steeped in stories of sailors experiences and redemption! If you have a half day to walk, shop, lunch and enjoy Galway, make the effort",
          "A real surprise. A beautiful, peaceful experience. An oasis in a busy vibrant city. Avoid Mass times 11am and 6pm and promise yourself a few minutes visiting here.",

          "This modern church is anything but modern looking. The stain glass windows and lighting is incredible. on our visit we arrived shortly before 6PM on a Friday. We were unaware a Mass was scheduled for 6. Though we are not Catholic we enjoyed staying through the Mass and learning",

          "Galway has so much to offer that sometimes an absolute gem like the Cathedral might be overlooked. It is a wonderful place to visit, and so calm and serene on the edge of a bustling city. Beautiful stained glass and side altars.",
          "Had a walk around the church whilst on a day out in Galway . Its a lovely church with nice stained glass windows and all the usual things you would expect to find in a church",
          "Extremely well built cathedral. This is very young one by European standards - only about 50 years old. But it is as grand and beautiful as a centuries old churches. Very calming and serene atmosphere inside. Great place to visit or attend a mass.",
          "This Cathedral was built on the site of the former jail. In general, I think Irish Catholic churches are rather sober -- and this is no exception. Check out the mosaic of John Kennedy, commemorating his trip to Galway",
          "Only completed in 1965 so very young in Cathedral terms but built with traditional stone and style. Brilliant interior roof and the general interior for such a modern building is excellent. Not as grand as York Minster, no real history but well worth a visit as it is in central",
          "From its sumptuous Connemara marble floors, to the mahogany pews, this Cathedral merits a visit. The specifically adopted project of Cardinal Cushing, the Cathedral honors those committed to its construction, their faith, and the devoted team who made it come to life. Very",

          "Took a quick tour inside here and was impressed by the beautiful architecture inside. Eddie the church volunteer gave us some interesting facts about the place",
          "We thought this was a great take. Nice change from crowds in Latin quarter. Only short walk from there. Worth watching the 12 minute video of history of the building. Kind of cool to have a cathedral built so recently. Beautiful stained glass windows and some mosaics.",
          "Ireland is crowded with cathedrals and after a while they all seem a bit redundant. This one stood out as special. We visited one afternoon just as the sun came out. The interior was flooded with light and the stained glass windows glowed. It was breathtaking!",
          "We came here for mass on Sunday while visiting Galway, it's a beautiful church. It has been maintained beautifully. It's a short walk from city centre. It's worth taking a look. I'd recommend not visiting during church service hours of course",
          "Only a few minutes walk from the centre it was worth popping in as when inside it is beautiful. Donations requested to go in but not a condition of entry. There is also a small exhibition on the history of the cathedral inside.",
          "Galway's Cathedral is modern, being built in the 1960s. So - despite its size - it doesn't necessarily give you that sense of 'awe' you get in the more ancient cathedrals of Europe. Even so, it is beautiful and serene, and does give a nod to the great churches of the Renaissance",
          "After assuming every church looked the same I was very pleasantly surprised entering the cathedral. There is so much to see and so much history surrounding you as you enter. I would allow at least an hour for this visit . As you will want to take in every shrine and relic that",
          "This is truly a beautiful Cathedral with lots of Irish and Boston and New York history in it. Cardinal Cushing has a nice historical section currently on display and Cardinal Cooke plaed a major role in getting one of the paintings installed. Truly a must stop if you are",
          "This cathedral was built in early 1960's on the site of the former Galway city jail. ( A Jail is no longer necessary for Galwegians!!) It is a majestic building well worth a visit. Visitors are welcome when services are not in session. It is interesting with so many different",
          "The cathedral was beautiful and the organ playing while we were there was excellent. The cathedral itself was very pretty, but did not have any unique or special features compared to other large cathedrals in Europe. I would not make a special trip to see it, but if were in town",
          "Cathedral is built of the grey stone popular in Ireland and is very eye catching from the outside. Inside is even better. Above is a wonderful copula, stone archways and stained glass windows. There is also a shop and a toilet. A very quiet and restful place to relax for a",
          "Though not old, build in 1965, this is a beautiful place to visit. The architecture, and interior are stunning. Make sure to interact with the door greeter who will gladly tell stories of the old prison that used to reside on these grounds along with other stories and facts",
          "Beautiful and stunning inside and out. The altar is in the middle of the cathedral . There are stained glass windows and archways throughout . The ceiling is made from cedar imported from Canada ! Beautiful to behold and peaceful to say a little prayer .",
          "We had such a blessed visit at this beautiful and welcoming Cathedral! Mass was quick but bountiful in prayer. The lady in the gift store was friendly. The people welcoming us at the door were hospitable. Thank you for providing such a sweet experience!",
          "Large cathedral that was built relatively recently (it opened in 1965) with many features. I'm definitely less wowed by how new it was, so I wouldn't call it a must-see.",

          "We visited on a really grey and wet day so this probably influenced our view, but from the outside the building is pretty uninspiring and dull. What a change on the inside! Big, light and built of beautifully crafted granite with a marvellous (pretty sure) marble floor. The",

        "wiki": "Galway ( GAWL-way; Irish: Gaillimh, pronounced [\u02c8\u0261al\u0320\u02b2\u026av\u02b2]) is a city in County Galway in the West of Ireland, in the province of Connacht. It lies on the River Corrib between Lough Corrib and Galway Bay, and is the sixth most populous city in Ireland, with a population at the 2016 Census of 79,934.Galway is renowned for its vibrant lifestyle and for hosting numerous festivals, celebrations and events such as The Galway Arts Festival. In 2018, it was named the European Region of Gastronomy. The city is currently the European Capital of Culture for 2020, alongside Rijeka, Croatia.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe city's name comes from the Irish name Gaillimhe, which formed the western boundary of the earliest settlement, D\u00fan Gaillimhe \"Fort Gaillimh\". (Mythical and alternative derivations of the name are given in History of Galway). Historically, the name was Anglicised as Galliv or Gallive, closer to the Irish pronunciation. The city's name in Latin is Galvia. Residents of the city are referred to as Galwegians.\nThe city also bears the nickname \"City of the Tribes\" (Irish: Cathair na dTreabh) because of the fourteen merchant families called the \"tribes of Galway\" who led the city in its Hiberno-Norman period.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nD\u00fan Gaillimhe (\"Fort at the Mouth (bottom) of the Gaillimh\") was constructed in 1124, by the King of Connacht, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088\u20131156). A settlement grew around it. During the Norman invasion of Connacht in the 1230s, D\u00fan Gaillimhe was captured by Richard Mor de Burgh, who had led the invasion. As the de Burghs eventually became Gaelicised, the merchants of the town, the Tribes of Galway, pushed for greater control over the walled city.\nThis led to their gaining complete control over the city and to the granting of mayoral status by the English crown in December 1484. Galway endured difficult relations with its Irish neighbours. A notice over the west gate of the city, completed in 1562 by Mayor Thomas \u00d3ge Martyn, stated \"From the Ferocious O'Flahertys may God protect us\". A by-law forbade the native Irish (as opposed to Galway's Hiberno-Norman citizens) unrestricted access into Galway, saying \"neither O\u2019 nor Mac shall strutte nor swagger through the streets of Galway\" without permission.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Galway was ruled by an oligarchy of fourteen merchant families (twelve who claimed to be of Norman origin and two of Irish origin). These were the \"Tribes of Galway\". The city thrived on international trade, and in the Middle Ages, it was the principal Irish port for trade with Spain and France. The most famous reminder of those days is ceann an bhalla (\"the end of the wall\"), now known as the Spanish Arch, constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin (1519\u201320). In 1477 Christopher Columbus visited Galway, possibly stopping off on a voyage to Iceland or the Faroe Islands. Seven or eight years later, he noted in the margin of his copy of Imago Mundi:\n\nMen of Cathay have come from the west. [Of this] we have seen many signs. And especially in Galway in Ireland, a man and a woman, of extraordinary appearance, have come to land on two tree trunks [or timbers? or a boat made of such?]\nThe most likely explanation for these bodies is that they were Inuit swept eastward by the North Atlantic Current.During the 16th and 17th centuries Galway remained loyal to the English crown for the most part, even during the Gaelic resurgence, perhaps for reasons of survival. However, by 1642 the city had allied itself with the Catholic Confederation of Kilkenny during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. During the resulting Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Cromwellian forces captured the city after a nine-month siege. At the end of the 17th century the city supported the Jacobites in the Williamite war in Ireland and was captured by the Williamites after a very short siege not long after the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. The great families of Galway were ruined. The city suffered further under the potato famines of 1845\u20131852, and it did not fully recover until the period of strong economic growth of the late 20th century (see Celtic Tiger).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike most of Ireland, Galway has an oceanic climate (Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, being one of the world's mildest cities for latitude, partly because it is on an island. Galway has a year-round mild, moist, temperate and changeable climate, due to the prevailing winds of the North Atlantic Current together with the Gulf Stream (on the other side of the Atlantic temperatures can be 20 \u00b0C cooler or more.). The city does not experience temperature extremes, with temperatures below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) being rare. The city receives an average of 1,156 mm (45.51 in) of precipitation annually, which is evenly distributed throughout the year. The average January temperature in the city is 5.9 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F) and the average July temperature is 15.9 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). The highest temperature ever recorded in Galway was 31.7 \u00b0C (89.1 \u00b0F) in July 1921, whilst the lowest temperature recorded was \u221211.7 \u00b0C (10.9 \u00b0F) in January 1945.While extreme weather is rare, the city and county can experience severe windstorms that are the result of vigorous Atlantic depressions that occasionally pass along the north west coast of Ireland. Most of these storms occur between late autumn and early spring. Due to the city's northerly location, Galway has long summer days. Sunrise on summer solstice occurs at 05:07 WEST and sunset at 22:07. By contrast, on winter solstice, the sun rises at 08:49 WET, and sets at 16:19.\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\nLynch's Castle on Shop Street is a medieval town house built by the prosperous Lynch family in the 16th century and is now a branch of Allied Irish Banks.\nThe Church of Ireland St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church is the largest medieval church still in everyday use in Ireland. It was founded in 1320 and enlarged in the following two centuries.\nThe Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas was consecrated in 1965 and is a far larger building constructed from limestone. It has an eclectic style, with a Renaissance Revival dome, pillars and round arches, and a Romanesque Revival portico that dominates the main fa\u00e7ade \u2013 which is an unusual feature in modern Irish church building.\nThe original quadrangle building of NUI Galway which was erected in 1849 (during the Great Famine or An Gorta M\u00f3r) as one of the three colleges of the Queen's University of Ireland (along with Queen's University Belfast and University College Cork). The university holds the UNESCO archive of spoken material for the Celtic languages.\nThe Hardiman, (originally the Railway Hotel, then the Great Southern Hotel and then Hotel Meyrick) built by the Great Southern Railway Company in 1845. Sitting at the southern perimeter of Eyre Square, it is the city's oldest hotel still in operation.\nThe remains of Menlo Castle can be seen outside the city, on the eastern bank of the River Corrib. It was one of the ancestral homes of the Blake family, one of the Tribes of Galway from c. 1600\u20131910. The fa\u00e7ade of the family's townhouse (\"Blake's Castle\") is still extant next to Jury's Hotel at the bottom of Quay Street.\nEglinton Canal, named after a former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, joins the River Corrib to the sea, and flows for just more than a kilometre from the University to the Claddagh.\nThe Claddagh is the oldest part of Galway but little or nothing remains of its old thatched village. However, in a side altar of the parish church, St Mary's on the Hill, is the late medieval statue of Our Lady of Galway. The ancient ritual of the Blessing of the Bay takes place on the Sunday nearest the feast of the Assumption.\nThe Browne doorway, originally located on Lower Abbeygate Street but now standing at the north end of Eyre Square, was the doorway to the townhouse of the Browne family, one of the fourteen Tribes of Galway.\nThe Lynch Window, (on Market Street), at which is a plaque commemorating one of the city's legends. According to legend, in 1493, the then Mayor, James Lynch FitzStephen, hanged his own son for the murder of a young Spanish visitor who had the misfortune to befriend the girlfriend of the Mayor's son.\nThe Hall of the Red Earl (Halla an Iarla Rua) can be viewed through a protective glass wall off Flood Street. It is the earliest medieval settlement fragment surviving within the walls of the city. It was built by the de Burgo family in the 13th century and was a key municipal building for the collection of taxes, dispensation of justice and hosting banquets. It was the medieval equivalent of tax office, court house and town hall.\n\n\n==== The Claddagh ====\n\nOn the west bank of the River Corrib as it enters the sea is the ancient neighbourhood of The Claddagh. For centuries it was an Irish-speaking enclave outside the city walls. Claddagh residents were mainly fisher folk and were governed by an elected 'King'. The King of the Claddagh settled or arbitrated disputes among the locals and had the privilege of a white sail on his fishing boat. The last true king, Martin Oliver, died in 1972. The title is still used but in a purely honorary and ceremonial context. The current King is Michael Lynskey. The area is also famous for its association with the Claddagh Ring.\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nThe Galway City Museum has two main sections: one about the heritage of Galway and one about Irish artists from the second half of the 20th century. This museum also houses the statue of the poet, P\u00e1draic \u00d3 Conaire which was originally located in the Kennedy Park section of Eyre Square, prior to the Square's renovation. A replica of the statue was erected in Eyre Square in 2017. The museum is part of the Spanish Arch, the historical remnants of the 16th century wall.The city's University has numerous museums, including the James Mitchell Geology Museum and the Computing and Communications Museum of Ireland.\nThe Nora Barnacle House Museum in Bowling Green is the smallest museum in Ireland.

The Roman Catholic diocese of Galway was created in 1831 following the abolition by the Holy See of the Wardenship of Galway. It was united with the diocese of Kilmacduagh (est. 1152) and given the administratorship of the diocese of Kilfenora (est. 1152) in 1883. Its full name is the Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Apostolic Administratorship of Kilfenora (in Irish \u2013 Deoise na Gaillimhe, Chill Mac Duach agus Riarach\u00e1n Aspalda Cill Fhionn\u00farach, in Latin \u2013 Diocesis Galviensis, Duacensis ac Administratio Apostolica Finaborensis). The diocese is under the patronage Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas (Galway), Saint Fachanan (Kilmacduagh) and St Colman (Kilfenora). As the diocese of Kilfenora is in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Cashel the Bishop of Galway is its Apostolic Administrator rather than its bishop. The dioceses of Galway and Kilmacduagh are in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Tuam. The current bishop is Most Rev. Martin Drennan, installed 3 July 2005. Of the 38 parishes in the RC diocese 14 are situated in the city and are divided into two deaneries \u2013 the deanery of Galway City West and that of Galway City East. In each deanery a Vicar Forane exercises limited jurisdiction on behalf of the bishop.\nIn the Church of Ireland, Galway is a parish of the United Diocese of Tuam, Killala and Achonry. The principal church of the parish is the St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church (founded 1320).

Pearse Stadium in Salthill is the home to Galway GAA, the county's Gaelic games body. The Galway hurlers compete annually in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship for the Liam MacCarthy Cup.  Despite having won the cup only five times in their history, Galway is considered as one of the top teams in the Championship. Galway reached the 2012 All-Ireland final only to draw with Kilkenny to force a replay, the first since 1959, which they eventually lost. In 2017 Galway lifted the Liam MacCarthy Cup for the first time in 29 years beating Waterford by 0-26 to 2-17.

The club was formed in 2013 and first competed in the 2014 season.\nThe previous tenants of Eamonn Deacy Park, also called Galway United, first competed in the League of Ireland since 1977, then known as Galway Rovers. Michael D. Higgins, later elected President of Ireland in 2011, served as a president of the club in a ceremonial capacity. Following struggles with debts, the club became defunct at the end of the 2011 season. The Galway United Supporters Trust (GUST) had been servicing many debts of the company and were able to keep the club afloat for the 2011 season, with it having been effectively abandoned by its directors. GUST withdrew their support for the team and applied to join the 2012 League of Ireland as a community enterprise, rather than as a private company, which the old club had been. This application was not successful, however.\nGalway F.C. was formed the following year from a merger of GUST with Mervue United and Salthill Devon, two other clubs in the city, who had competed in the First Division since 2009 and 2010 respectively.\n\n\n==== Rugby ====\n\n\n===== Professional =====\nThe professional team for the province, Connacht Rugby, is based in the city.

Galway Hub is a free resource for both practitioners and the general public in which to engage with the arts and cultural events across the city and county.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Air ====\nGalway Airport, located 6 km (3.73 mi) east of the city at Carnmore, ceased to have scheduled passenger flights on 1 November 2011.  Because the runway is too short to take modern passenger jet aircraft, it it only capable of imited operations. Aerfort na Minna (22 km (13.67 mi) west of the city) operates regular flights to each of the Aran Islands (Oile\u00e1in \u00c1rann). Shannon Airport (90 km) and Ireland West Airport Knock (86 km) are the nearest international airports, both of which have flights around Ireland and to Britain, Continental Europe and North America (from Shannon).\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nBuses are the main form of public transport in the city and county.

Routes operated by City Direct include routes 410 (Salthill), 411 (Knocknacarra - Cappagh Rd), 412 (Knocknacarra Express), and 414 (Barna).Various bus companies also provide links throughout County Galway and nationwide.  These operate from a number of locations:\n\nThe main bus and rail station in the city is Ceannt Station.\nGalway Coach Station, located at Fairgreen, is also a coach transport hub. Scheduled direct and commuter services operate between the Coach Station, Dublin and Dublin Airport, as well as services to Limerick, Cork and Clifden. These are operated by Gobus and Citylink.\nOther regional bus operators use various bus stops around the city centre, and many serve the NUIG and GMIT campuses as well.\n\n\n==== Rail ====\n\nGalway's main railway station is Ceannt Station (St\u00e1isi\u00fan Cheannt), which opened in 1851, and was renamed in honour of \u00c9amonn Ceannt in 1966. A major redevelopment, including a completely new urban district, Ceannt Station Quarter, has been proposed for the station and adjoining land.\nThe Midland Great Western Railway reached Galway in 1851, giving the city a direct main line to its Broadstone Station terminus in Dublin. As the 19th century progressed the rail network in Connacht was expanded, making Galway an important railhead. The nearby town of Athenry became a railway junction, giving Galway links to Ennis, Limerick and the south in 1869 and Sligo and the north in 1894. In 1895 the MGW opened a branch line between Galway and Clifden.\nThe 20th century brought increasing road competition, and this led the Great Southern Railways to close the Clifden branch in 1935. In the 1970s the state railway authority C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann closed the Sligo-Athenry-Ennis line to passenger services. It later closed to freight as well.\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann, Ireland's national rail operator, currently runs six return passenger services each day between Galway and Dublin Heuston, also serving intermediate stations. Travel time is just under 3 hours. Services on the Galway\u2013Limerick line have now resumed, with around 5\u20136 trains each way per day.\nFrom Galway railway services along the Western Rail Corridor link the city with Ennis, and Limerick where trains run to Cork via Limerick Junction (for Tipperary, Clonmel and Waterford) and Mallow (for Killarney and Tralee).\n\n\n==== Road ====\nFour national primary roads serve the city: the M6 motorway running east\u2013west (Athlone, Dublin), the M17 motorway running north from the M6 to Tuam, the N63, formerly the N17, connecting Galway with the Northwest (Tuam, Sligo, Donegal Town, Letterkenny and Derry), and the M18 motorway linking Galway to southern towns and cities Gort, Ennis, Shannon Town, Limerick and Cork joining up with The Wild Atlantic Way. In addition, there are plans for a semi-ring road of the city, the Galway City Outer Bypass. There is also an Inner City Ring (Cuar Inmhe\u00e1nach) route that encircles the city centre, most of which is pedestrianised.\nGalway is considered the gateway to Connemara and the Gaeltacht, including M\u00e1m, An Teach D\u00f3ite, Cor na M\u00f3na, Ros Muc, Bearna and An Cheathr\u00fa Rua. The N59 along the western shore of Lough Corrib and the R337 along the northern shore of Galway Bay both lead to this largely rural and highly scenic region.\n\n\n==== Waterways ====\nThe River Corrib is by far the most important waterway in Galway and a number of canals and channels were built above and through the city. The purposes of these to divert and control the water from the river, to harness its power and to provide a navigable route to the sea.  Of these, there were two major schemes \u2013 one between 1848 and 1858 and the other during the 1950s. The canals provided a power source for Galway and were the location of the first industries in the mid-19th century. The Eglinton Canal provided a navigation from the sea (at the Claddagh Basin) to the navigable part of the river (above the Salmon Weir Bridge). Most of the mills are still used today for various purposes; for instance, NUI Galway still uses a water turbine for electricity generation for their building on Nun's Island.\nCurrently, there are four bridges across the Corrib. Following the southward flow of the river these are, from the north: the Quincentennial Bridge, the Salmon Weir Bridge, the William O'Brien Bridge and the Wolfe Tone Bridge. There are plans for a fifth bridge as part of the Galway City Outer Bypass project. The Clare River flows from the North of the County Galway, through Tuam, Claregalway into Lough Corrib.\n\n\n==== Harbour ====\n\nGalway is the most central port on the West Coast of Ireland in the sheltered eastern corner of Galway Bay. The harbour can be used by vessels up to 10,000 tonnes deadweight (DWT) and the inner dock can accommodate up to 9 vessels at any one time. Pending approval, Galway Harbour may see major changes, should the \u20ac1.5 billion development plan go ahead.\nRegular passenger ferry and freight services operate between Galway and the tourist destination of the Aran Islands which is home to World Heritage Site D\u00fan Aonghasa. The islands also have regular links with the towns of Rossaveal and Doolin, which are physically closer but far smaller.\nCommuter ferry services have been proposed to the tourism town of Kinvara, on the opposite side of Galway Bay.Major work in the harbour area was carried out in 2009 to accommodate the stopover of the Volvo Ocean Race. This was one of the biggest events ever to visit Galway. The event returned with the finale of the race in June 2012. This was unprecedented in Volvo Ocean Race history.\n\n\n==== Walking ====\nThe city is planned as the start of the E2 European long-distance path, running for 4,850 kilometres (3,010 mi) to Nice, though the Irish section is as yet incomplete.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nGalway Textile Printers, located on Sandy Road, was the first major industry to come to Galway and quickly became one of the biggest employers in the west of Ireland. Some of those who worked there were specialists who were brought in to help set the factory up, but most employees were local. The Mills eventually went out of business in the early 1980s and its former site now hosts various small business establishments.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAs of 2002, there were 27 primary schools and 11 secondary schools in Galway.\n\n\n=== University ===\nNUI Galway was founded in 1845 as Queen's College, Galway, and was more recently known as University College, Galway (U.C.G.). It is divided into several colleges including the College of Arts, Social Science and Celtic Studies, the College Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences,  the College of Business, Public Policy and Law, the College of Science and the College of Engineering and Informatics. The university had an enrollment of 16000 in 2010.\nThe Biomedical Research Building was opened in 2014. It houses the Regenerative Medicine Institute (REMEDI). Also opened in 2014 were the Hardiman Building and a School of Psychology. The Hardiman Building is home to the university's collection of more than 350 literary, theatrical, political and historical archives. The building houses also the Moore Institute for Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences and the Whitaker Institute for Innovation and Societal Change. The National Institute for Prevention and Cardiovascular Health (NIPC) is an affiliate of NUI Galway.The offices of the Central Applications Office (C.A.O.) are also located in the city, this being the clearing house for undergraduate college and university applications in the Republic of Ireland; a related organisation, the Postgraduate Applications Centre, processes some taught postgraduate courses.\n\n\n=== Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) ===\n\nGMIT, in addition to having two campuses in Galway City, also has campuses in Castlebar, Letterfrack and Mountbellew. GMIT's Galway campus is based on the Dublin Road in Galway city, overlooking Galway Bay. It is the administrative headquarters for the Institute and has four Schools of study; the School of Business, the School of Engineering, the School of Science & Computing, and the College of Tourism & Arts.\n\n\n== Health ==\nPublicly funded health care and social services are provided in Galway by the HSE (West) division of the Health Services Executive.\nThe main city hospital, University Hospital Galway, is located on two campuses \u2014 Galway University Hospital and Merlin Park University Hospital.Two private hospitals \u2013 The Galway Clinic and the Bon Secours Hospital, Galway \u2013 also operate in the city.\nGalway Hospice provides palliative care for the people of Galway City and County on a homecare, inpatient and daycare basis.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of twin towns and sister cities in the Republic of Ireland\nThe Galway Line\nTerryland Forest Park\nGalway Technology Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Galway travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGalway City Council (local authority)\nGalway City and County Cultural Website",

          "This relatively small museum gives a solid introduction to Galway, it's history, and it's unique place in the world. I don't know that I'd make a beeline here as soon as you arrive but, for what it is, it's pretty cool.",
          "We wondered in during a downpour while at the Spanish Arch and am so glad we did. We ended up spending several hours reading all the exhibits and know so much more about the city we spent a week visiting. The kids loved the interactive parts too. Well worth a visit!!",
          "Spent a good couple of hours here. Fascinating exhibition in the entrance hall about Tom Molyneux who boxed for his freedom from slavery in the USA and came to Galway, having boxed his way around Ireland. The galleries in the museum cover the Stone, Bronze and Iron ages and",

          "Pleasantly surprised by this free museum tucked behind some restaurants and the old city wall! The exhibits were informative, with subjects ranging from pre-historic Galway to the 1916 uprising. There was a little renovation going on, so there is probably even more to see",
          "We went in here with a bunch of kids of all ages. Everybody enjoyed it. There's nothing terribly exciting there (apart from the full size Galway hooker - that's a boat prudes - floating in the air. There was also a good 1916 rising exhibition if you are interested in that and",
          "Keep an eye out for the stone age axe head. Absolutely loved that. But there's a plenty more see there too. There's a terrific 3D program that lets you see how the city would have looked in the 17th century that I really enjoyed.",

          "The museum is free and fairly small. You get a bit of Galway City history and a bit of the local link to the 1916 rebellion. I wouldn't go to Galway just for the museum. As usual for Irish museums, there is a lot to read and less to look at.",

          "Wasn't too impressed with this, I'm afraid - too much reading of information printed on the walls. It did provide an hour's shelter on a wet day, so pop in if you're passing, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see it.",

          "Some of the early criticisms of the museum have dissolved and it is a much improved museum. The exhibits have improved a lot but there is still a way to go. I'm still not convinced the museum reflects the city or county well... and perhaps it will always be cursed by the limited",
          "Centrally located and very interesting on three different floors with three different stories well worth a visit.",

          "I went here with some friends as it was free admission and i have a keen interest in history. The layout is ultra modern with 3D imagining to place you at the heart of Galway in the middle ages. This is achieved with a vitual tour that shows you then and now comparisons.",

          "I would have rated this lower, but unlike most of the museums in Ireland, this one is free, so why not? Most interesting is the replica \"hooker\" ship that is of the design used for many years by fishermen in the Claddagh, actually a neighborhood of Galway, just across the river",

          "This was delightful and I enjoyed the displays about the uprising in 1916. Ireland has a complex history for a visitor to understand, but this was clearly described, making it relatively easy to grasp. I particularly like the women's contribution section on the ground floor.",

          "It's hard to rate anything as terrible. This comes close when the best thing in it is the cafe. I'm not being sarcastic it is really good. But the museum has an art gallery feel. Fairly typical in the Galway artsy style of under explained art pieces. Most of the exhibits will",
          "We passed a number of hours in the museum on a very rainy Saturday. Fascinated by the Sliotar exhibit, kids particularly loved the x-rays of the hurling balls. Kids also thrilled with the Science centre. History of Galway, the Claddagh fishermen & women exhibit and the World",

          "Nice museum to experience a piece of west Ireland history. A little bit on the small side, might take you an hour tops. Worth a visit if you're exploring Galway, Doesn't take up a lot of your time as it's so small. Free admission which is always nice.",
          "Nice place to pass time, free museum. Great exhibits on local history - especially loved the archeological discoveries from local bogs that were on loan from the national museum.",

          "The museum is great for learning some of the history of galway. The kids enjoyed the second floor sea science bits and pieces but unfortunately much of the stuff up there was not working. Maybe the museum should empty some of the donation boxes that you see dotted around",
          "This small museum is certainly worth a visit. It is free but benefits from donations from visitors. There is a very interesting selection of artefacts from the Galway area. The time periods range from ancient Galway through to the 1960s (encompassing the first/second world war",

          "If you're interested in local history, or are visiting from a smaller community, you may enjoy this museum. The exhibits and exhibit designs are modest. But the museum is free. If you have some free time to kill, this is not a bad choice. But I wouldn't describe this museum as",
          "A full-scale model of a Galway hooker (boat) is a highlight, but there is so much of historical interest in this place that you would be a fool to ignore it, particularly considering the price!! Lots of fascinating photos of yester-year . Absorbing",
          "What to visit in Galway? Try the City Museum in the downtown area. This museum was nice, free and had much to see for its relatively small size. Collections ranged from the City's fishing days, early music and film history to artifacts found in many excavation sites. There is a",

          "We entered the museum today and were just blown away by the artefacts, history, layout and multiple floors well kept. It's not overloaded but very spacious and this makes the visit fun as the museum itself is a very modern building. Definitely recommend visiting all floors.",
          "Entered here by pure chance. Had never heard of the place. It was really good quality. We had visited museums in New York and the quality of the exhibits here were very bit as good. Obviously not as many as NY. Especially liked the mock up of an old cinema. Brought back memories",

          "This FREE museum was interesting and tells you a lot about the history of Galway City. It also has a little bit for the kids (big and small). For a place with no price tag, we found it a good way to spend the first hour or two of our day in Galway. The Kitchen restaurant off",
          "walked around for about 30 minutes because the free walking tour of Galway never happened (the guides sadly never showed) so we figured we would try to make the most of the day. saw the \"spanish arch\" and this was right near it. Some interesting history installations but not a",

          "We popped into this museum as we couldn't find much else to do in Galway! It was free so not much to lose! Everything is exhibited very well and it has some fantastic views of the waterfront area. The kids enjoyed the interactive bit on the top floor. Never saw any staff",
          "Nearly missed this museum as the entrance is not easy to spot but it was well worth a visit. Takes you on a journey through the history of Galway and local areas and has special exhibitions on show. It has a lift for easy assess and a cafe in the same building. Very friendly",
          "Informative. Easy to navigate. Helpful staff. Special events. A visitor to Galway should definitely add this as a place to visit.",
          "This was a very nice little museum with a lot of history about Galway. The museum is free and has a great view of the river.",
          "We really enjoyed this the Galway hooker hanging from the ceiling and the interactive maps etc are good",
          "My wife and I toured the museum last week. It is very centrally located in a beautiful building. The contents were, in my opinion, minimal. I believe they were doing renovations (there was no sign indicating that, however.) While I enjoyed the tour, I would have appreciated more",
          "Enjoyed a February morning catching up on Galway history. A great dedication to the Galway three in a row All Irealand winners in the '60s was a highlight.",

          "The museum is a short walk from the centre of town and is a great place for losing a few hours. It tells the history of Galway and the surrounding area. There is also a great caf\u00e9 that in good weather has outdoor seating. The location is also a great people watching spot.",
          "interesting introduction to the city, giving one a sense of the past, such as historic photos of the 19th century. When we were there, there were free concerts in the lobby.",
          "We decided to stop here as we walked around the city, not far from our B&B. The friendly staff greeted us and we wandered around at a leisurely pace. The local history was shown in lots of pictures with information. There was also a nice art display with photos and a history",
          "We wound up getting to the museum about an hour before they were closing. However, it was just enough time to quickly move through it with four kids ( ages 8-12). The Galway Hooker ( type of boat) is suspended from the ceiling, but along the staircase, so you can get a good look",
          "We visited to pass some time and so glad we did, gives you a great story to Galway, very informative.",
          "This is a great experience with a vibrant mix of history, art and even interactive exhibits for the kids. It would have earned a higher rating but for the poorly informed member of reception staff who was giving out his personal views on the politics and situation in Ireland",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this museum, located right on the water. Some very interesting displays and well set out. Right next to the Spanish arch and with some beautiful views of the water from the upper floors. Well worth a visit.",
          "Indeed I am one of those people who tries to get to every museum . The Galway Museum is worth a short visit of an hour or so. It is free and they do have a rack to leave a wet coat upon which came in handy. Seeing a Galway Hooker (a boat) was the highlight of the museum and",
          "A charming little museum, well worth a visit, and best of all free admission. Lots of interesting exhibits on the history of Galway, a real Galway hooker (fishing vessel) hanging from the ceiling! Lots of hands on stuff for the kids too. GO, by all means !",
          "We visited this museum during one afternoon that we were in Galway. The museum is free, and right on the water next to the Spanish arch (just down the street from the hustle and bustle of the shops and bars). We enjoyed getting a history of Galway and the region, and the museum",
          "They have everything from local history to art. Definitely worth a stroll through. My favorite was the exhibit with old photographs of Galway",
          "If you have time this is a cute museum with neat stuff and it's all free. There are three levels to walk through and on the top floor they had some fun interactive exhibits. Learn about Galway from past to present.",
          "There really isn't a lot to see here but if you are caught in a rain shower it is worth a visit. You won't need more than a hour - and it is free.",
          "This is a great free museum located in an interesting part of Galway. There's no reason not to go, since it's free and you'll learn more about ancient and modern Galway history than you do from a guidebook. It's a good blend of interactive exhibits, artifacts and art.",
          "The museum is spread over three floors with some history. The exhibits felt a little lacking in substance, but it was a nice, free way to learn a little more about Galway. We didn't eat at the cafe, but heard many great things about the food. This is a nice way to get",
          "The Cafe at the Museum (beside Spanish Arch) is a wonderful little place that serves fine coffees and teas with scrumptious snacks and an ever changing but delightful menu of light meals and pasties. One of the best cafes in Galway, pity its daytime hours only !",
          "We visited the museum on a morning when it was raining and we were very happy that we did. Admission is free, which was a plus. The saff are friendly and offered to take my umbrella to allow it to dry off. The exhibits are extraordinarily impressive! Well presented and",

          "Was a small museum to give a quick peek about the city. I took 2 hours though as I like to take my time to read and look at things in depth. Nice cafe @Kitchen in the cafe downstairs.",

          "The Galway City Museum is well done museum. A mixture of information, artifacts and visuals this museum gives a great overview into the history and culture of the city of Galway. Even better, it's free. I spent most of my time on the first floor but will go back to spend more",
          "Creative museum that engaged you immediately. Clever to personalize the history of Galway through the stories of real people. We enjoyed it. Small place so doesn't take a lot of time.",
          "Thought this Museum would give me a real insight to Galway's, past but found it quite boring Very small not laid out well ,not made interesting",
          "Definitely worth a short visit to this free museum. Small and easy to navigate - nice insight into the history.",
          "Galway is already a historic city in Ireland. The museum is located right next to the Spanish Arch. It's not overwhelming large, but adds to the visit to this town.",
          "The museum although small enough is packed with many varied artefacts from Galway's past. There are all sorts in this mixed bag ranging from stone age right through to modern day life. Definitely worth a visit...Oh and it's FREE. Now that has to be a plus.",
          "The city museum holds a great representation of west of Ireland historic artefacts.....and hosts artistically relevant art showings",
          "A small museum, more about the life of the city than one stuffed with artifacts (although there are some there too). Worth a visit when you are down at Spanish Arch.",
          "varied exhibition all interesting, liked the show business side, saw a film about the local cinema also like the pictures of Gaza by Palestinians. Demonstrated the Irish sympathy for all suffering people",
          "Adjacent to the Spanish Arches and remnants of the City Wall, the modern must-see museum is essential to experience the multi-cultural aspects that influenced Ireland\u2019s development. As a coastal city at the mouth of River Corrib, Galway has a nautical theme in its parks, and",

          "Galway city museum is built near the Corrib River at Spanish Arch. Very hot & muggy the day I was in - I don't think there was any airconditioning which was disappointing. Some fantastic exhibitions - a lot smaller than I had thought, but still packed a lot in there on the",

          "Located at the Spanish Arch it features many unique objets that shed light on the long and glorious history of the city.",
          "We spent a couple of hours in Galway City Museum on our recent visit to Ireland. We thoroughly enjoyed the archaeological exhibits where we learned some history of this area. My husband was completely enthralled by the Galway Hooker boat on display along with the background",
          "This is a small museum in the centre of Galway. There are a number of displays of items found in the local area and the history of the area. The large boat takes up the whole height of the building.",

          "This is a very small museum but it's near the Spanish arch and the waterside, so you can spend an hour or so wandering around. They have an interesting display, a traditional timber boat and the history explaining the role this type of vessel played in the districts transport",

          "Loved the Music On The Water exhibitions on the top floor. Great caf\u00e9 too. Interesting history of Galway presented. Loved the silver mace on the ground floor !",
          "Probably the most famous part of this free museum (suggested donation pots available) is the Padraig O Conaire missing head statue. He is in all his glory on the ground floor, but the museum seems to peter out from here. Film section for the Quiet Man upstairs, but not much",
          "I was actually expecting something that was not as good, if that makes sense. Galway is a small town and therefore a museum here about Galway was never going to be jammed packed. What I liked the best about this is that on the 1st floor, there was contemporary art, some of which",
          "This was a great way to start our visit to Galway. It's a wonderful introduction to the city. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The first floor has a great exhibition about the founding of the city of Galway and the start of the city. There is also a fantastic display",
          "I really enjoyed the ground floor exhibition which told the story of Galway in ancient times and through the middle ages. I found the exhibitions upstairs less inspiring and was disappointed in the film and music exhibition.",
          "Happily stumbled upon this museum and really enjoyed the exhibits and will definitely be bringing my guests here in future! Asked a few questions and found the staff were friendly and professional. Great experience!",
          "The museum is free, which is great... but there is not a lot to see so it is good that it is free. If you are in galway and it is raining, then it would be great to pop in - you can spend a 1/2 hour or so looking around and learning a bit. My young kids enjoyed seeing a few",
          "The museum is smallish and has a surprisingly small number of items in it for a place and area with so much history. That said what they have is well displayed and explained. The special exhibitions, there were to art ones there when I visited, added to the interest and variety",
          "ok well don't expect too much ...it's a lovely space with a fine view over galway bay...you might be lucky to catch a visiting exhibition but again don't raise your hopes...lovely job done on the local history ..informative...so it's not the Prado or Louvre but you can kill an",

          "I am a small YouTube vlogger and I , with my wife and child visited Galway Atlantaquaria and Seapoint Promenade and did a Vlog too . It was so nice and could see the aquatic life in Atlantic ocean. Moreover, the view from Seapoint Promenade is extra ordinarily beautiful . But",
          "A great place to go if you are interested in Marine life and fish. Once you pay in, you can come and go during the day, don't miss feeding time.",
          "I would definately recommend this place. You can see a lot if interesting and beautiful animals. Personel is helpful.",
          "Spent about 90 minutes at the Aquarium looking and reading up about quite a number of sea animals such as the Sting ray, blowfish, flat fish, sharks etc. It is actually very educative knowing about sea life, how they feed and their attributes. The aquarium is on two levels",
          "Had a lovely time wit 2 year old,7 year old and their grandparents, all enjoyed, great especially on a wet day, u can cum and go all day , got to pet fish which was the weirdest thing, all loved it!!",
          "Myself and my partner found this aquarium great fun and lots to see. Staff were all lovely to deal with. Tour of the big fish feeding was very interesting. Only thing was the price as a bit steep at \u20ac13 each.",
          "I walked to Salthill from eyre square on a rainy November day. It\u2019s a nice walk, to be fair and the aquarium was my destination. I used my grad school ID so I didn\u2019t have to pay full price. It was a small but decent aquarium! As a solo traveller I\u2019m always looking for ways to",
          "Went close to opening and the tank glass was dirty for most displays, mostly local fish meaning that there are no colourful fish. Recommend making the drive to the aquarium in Dingle instead",
          "I brought my sister who has 7 at the time here a few months ago. She absolutely loved it and it was the best decision we made that day to go to the aquarium. A lovely man took children who were visiting the aquarium on a fish feeding tour, where he spoke about each of the fish",
          "We stumbled across the aquarium on our walk around Galway. It was a nice aquarium that also has student pricing (don\u2019t forget your student card). They have a different variety of salt and freshwater fish. They have large tanks so when it is busy it doesn\u2019t feel like all the",
          "Loved seeing the different types of sea life in the place, but \u20ac13 per person is a bit steep for the amount on show.",
          "this aquarium is superb and really worth seeing even if the price is a bit high. We enjoyed the visit and we can recommend it.",
          "Me and my wife love visiting aquariums and zoos so we had to try the Atlantaquaria. When i first arrived I thought this place looked a tad run down and catered too much for children, but by the time I was done I really enjoyed this more intimate experience. This is a small",
          "It is very small and and a bit grubby. we visited on a rainy day so was ok, but would not really recommend otherwise.",
          "Really excellent way to spend a couple of hours... staff knowledgeable and approachable and there's lots to see and do. It's not often you can get up close and personal with a fish, but there are touch pools that allow just that here. An extra interesting place for anyone with",
          "I loved the trip to the aquarium. Appropriate for any age group, kids can get guided tours. I recommend it.",
          "If you\u2019re thinking of coming here, don\u2019t bother. My kids had seen everything in about 5 minutes. It was overcrowded, dirty, tiny & very expensive. Spend your money somewhere else.",
          "Have visited other larger aquariums in other cities but really loved the Galway Atlantaquaria best. The exhibits of local marine life are well thought out, visually appealing and educational. We really enjoyed our visit. The location is wonderful for a walk before or after as",
          "Today I went to the aquarium and it was definitely worth it. The staff answered to all my questions and were very nice. And so was the receptionist. The tours were fun. And I over all had a great experience. I really recommend for anyone who is visiting Galway",
          "Awful place to visit. It's dirty and grubby, the building itself is very outdated and needs refurbishing. Inside the aquarium it's dark and dingy, the tanks are filthy too. No gate on top of stairs to keep younger children from tumbling down the steps. The staff member we met",
          "Outdated, Overpriced and absolutely filthy...they would be better off to release the animals back into nature, Staff (we encountered) very unaware of how to interact with customers, guy on reception was obviously very hung over from his night out! The manager could do with some",
          "Great place for kids and it\u2019s not overly expensive, staff are great!! really friendly and helpful, we had a lovely time there thank you",
          "Paid a visit today as the kids were mad to see the sharks. Lots to see over 2 floors with plenty of different kinds of fish on view. Plenty of space to see the sharks being fed. Loved the wave drop in the tank as you came in the door. Kids really enjoyed their visit.",
          "Fantastic spot and amazing views well worth a visit for all ages we got in at the right time and our daughter got to feed and touch the fish which she loved. Great set up and great variety of sea creatures to see",
          "We took 6 kids age range 2-8 they enjoyed it more than the adults The tank at the entrance when the wave dropped caught them unawares and was good fun! We were there for about an hour - unfortunately there was no feeding at that time but we were told we could come back later.",
          "For what you pay *\u20ac13 each* this is a very small aquarium. Some interesting and pretty marine animals, but the size was disappointing",
          "Went here after looking at pictures online but we were left very disappointed the place is in need of a big investment as its very old and outdated and hasn't had a proper clean in years. There were some interesting fish to look at but overall we were in and out in half an hour",
          "Went here with my 2 year old and 8 year old. We went around about 4 times. The kids couldn't get enough of it. Highlight was the splash as you first came in the door and also getting to feed the fish and holding a starfish. Keep up the great work!",
          "We spent about an hour here, cost us both 21.50 euro which is good value considering the overheads of keeping these tanks and fish healthy. As i said my daughter loved it especially the sea horses and piranha . It's a small operation and when we visited we had the time and space",
          "We were pleasantly surprised by the number of species and the information at this aquarium. It was fun and interesting and well worth the price of admission. I think all ages would enjoy.",
          "We went there because got recommendation from a tourist information agent, but this place is old, very small and have nothing good to offer. It is also expensive so I recommend NOT to spend time here",
          "When we went here he owner was very polite and second time we bump into him he stop and chatted to us telling us about all there hard work and the fish they save and set free. Very polite man",
          "I suppose if your 5 its great, as it\u2019s all on show to touch and get involved with feeding. It\u2019s only small and I understand it costs a fortune for the up keep but I think for what\u2019s there it\u2019s expensive. \u20ac13 an adult. It probably takes you half an hour. I suppose if you hang",
          "Enjoyed our trip to the aquarium. The feeding was a nice talk, and the exhibits are easy to view for both children and adults. It is very small though, and quite dirty. 35 euro felt like a rip off for a family.",
          "Visited aquarium in Salthill today. Family if 4 \u20ac35, expected the visit to last a couple of hours. We were in and out in 30 minutes and that was going round twice. Disappointed.",
          "This is a smaller aquarium but the exhibits are nicely set up and the staff are friendly. Well worth a visit, especially if you have kids.",
          "I travelled here with my son and we spent a good 90 mins going round the aquarium. I can understand previous reviews mentioning that they only spent 45 mins in the facility as it is not very big. But my son is a big fan of aquatic wildlife and we enjoyed taking our time as the",
          "Went there with our toddler, first time she saw fishes that close, she was delighted. It is not a big aquarium (from my point of view), but it is nicely presented. Some fishes seem a little lonely though. But our daughter was happy which was the whole point of the visit. I must",
          "I spent about 2.5 hrs here and really enjoyed my experience here. There is a big selection of different species of fish and sea creatures from around Ireland's coast and further afield with information boards beside the tanks about each creature. I was disappointed the gift shop",
          "The aquarium is open every day and there are feeding times throughout the day. The touchpool is a brilliant experience for the kids.....get to hold a starfish!! Remember you can leave the aquarium and come back later that day if you wish. Plenty to do in salthill!!!",
          "We had a great time, even though is not such a big aquarium, we really had so much fun and the aquariums were fun to watch and explore. We liked it!",
          "Visited here with 8 year old daughter. Very well laid out and informative with information at right level for all ages. Only comment would be that we attended one of the interactive presentations that staff members give. Understand that this particular one may be new (so",
          "We visited with our 2 kids, ages 9&10. We all really loved it. There was so much to see and read and learn, for all of us. Seeing fish, that comes from our own sea, was fascinating. We also stayed for the feeding of the fish, and Matthew, who fed the fish, was amazing. He was",
          "Previous reviews noted that 45 was the max needed. We agree ... if you sprinted through without looking at anything!. We were there nearly two hours and only had to leave because of closing time. Even then, the staff took the time to point out things that the average tourist",
          "We spent a few pleasant hours at this cute aquarium. It was fairly quiet during out visit, with a few small school groups to liven things up. We especially liked the splash tank that mimics the rhythm of the waves. I got a real kick out of being startled by the splash every 50",
          "Myself and my two girls (8 and 5) spent 3 hours here in August. It is a small aquarium but it packs a big punch. It is very hands on, we got to feed fish (a few times) handle starfish and a variety of crabs and the tours were very informative. It is small so you can't expect",
          "This attraction is perfect for all the family. From the moment we entered the building it was providing information on the animals and where they traditionally live. It is a bit pricey for the time spent there but a nice trip for a family to visit. Very educational and",
          "This is a place to mostly see local marine life. It feels a little pricey for what there is, but I'm hoping some of that fee goes toward the conservation efforts? The highlight of our trip was the feeding tour where we all got to feed some of the fish. They have various such",
          "Overall this is a nice aquarium, but could be much better. It\u2019s very outdated, I feel like it needs an upgrade. Entry a bit expensive for what you get, but the kids loved it! Staff friendly and it\u2019s in a lovely area.",
          "Good place, especially with children. Kids can hold some of the creatures (under supervision). While very young children are free, it cost us \u20ac30 for two adults and one paying child (other was free). I think this is too much for what you get. Nonetheless, it is a nice, clean",
          "The entrance was 9\u20ac. It is definitely not bad, but could be better. There are many interesting fish and other marine animals. If you are interested in you can see feeding of different species.",
          "The first impression is the low luminosity of the entrance and the whole exhibition. The building and the pools look like they are from the 80ies with no modification since. The exhibition itself is a nice overview of the sealife arround ireland and also of the creatures found",
          "Went here with our 2 young children. Our 3 year old LOVED it! It was quiet when we visited and one of the staff came over and took the time to explain lots of things about the various fish in a way he could understand. He also loved the submarine! We returned for the feeding of",
          "Ok, this aquarium is small, there is really not much in here. If you really take your time, you'll be through looking at these small tanks in less than an hour. For the very limited amount of creatures and features in this small aquarium the price should be less than half of",
          "If you have an hour or so to spare while in Galway and kids to entertain, then this excursion is a must do. Full of interesting Atlantic fish, and extremely friendly staff, galway Atlantaquaria is a must! Check it out!",
          "We visited the aquarium in August with our 2 children (7 & 9). To be honest I wasn't expecting much as most of these types of aquariums are not great. But I'm happy to report that it was much better than I expected, it was well maintained with very good exhibits and a lot of",
          "We recently visited the Atlantaquaria in Salthill and we were extremely surprised by the quality of the exhibits, great taught and effort had been put into the design of the building to accommodate such a variety of sea life. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about",
          "Cool aquarium and with your ticket and u can go back the same day to see them feeding the fishes. Lots of educational stands and notices as you walk around",
          "The Galway Atlantaquaria is great place to visit for families. The kids get interested in the sea fauna and learn a lot.",
          "We had a great time here. The kids loved it. Price was a bit on the high side. Parking spaces were is short supply the day we came. Well worth a visit",
          "Wonderful arranged bassins of both fresh and salt water show a lot of native species. Love the whale skeleton under the ceiling. Enterance fee is not really cheap but worth the money.",
          "Very good tank at the 2 floor nice the splash tank at the entrance is a good surprise just sfter you open the door the big tank with shark is just amazing many thing for kids like the tank where you can touch the fishes definrtly a place to visit if you are in Galway.",
          "A fun way to spend a few hours with the kids. They can dip their hands in the fish tank and touch baby stingray as baby sharks pass by and see the giant eels being fed. There is a wave simulator and sea horses.",
          "Good way to pass an hour on a rainy day in Salthill. Great presentation of fish and other marine species. My 2 boys loved this place.",
          "Our family consists of 2 adult and 2 children and a one year old. The price was outrageous for what you got. The whole tour took 45mins this included the touching of the fish. We were back to our car an hour later. I see people saying you could come back in again, there should",
          "Visited the atlantaqarium with a 5 and a 7 year old! Found it expensive for the short time we spent in it! A lot of the tanks had no fish in them! Won't be going back! Very expensive cafe as well!",
          "As it turns out, the largest aquarium in Ireland is incredibly tiny! 12 Euros for something you could do in 1 hour max is a bit much. They do have some nice displays, and some of the descriptions are pretty informative. They also do different kinds of tours every hour - I",
          "We visited the Atlantaquaria in July, 2 adults and two children (16 and 12 year old). It wasn\u2019t that expensive and there is a lot going on - don\u2019t miss the feeding of the rays and sharks. The displays were excellent and a lot of interactive displays. I would recommend a visit",
          "Our family of 4 (2 adults & 2 children between 6 & 10) enjoyed our visit here! It's not the fanciest aquarium we've ever been to, but the touch tanks were a lot of fun. The staff were very helpful, and our kids even got to tag along on a childrens' group that was touring",
          "My partner and I visited the aquarium on a visit to Galway 2 years ago and found it very good with lots to see, so naturally we wanted to return on a recent visit to Galway and this time we had our 3 year old son with us. While the staff were very helpful on arrival at reception",
          "My husband and I love fish. We keep them at home, and we love to visit aquariums. It was fun to get to check out the different fish native to Ireland. But the place was a bit dated, and there were several attractions that were under renovation. All and all, I am very happy we",
          "Great aquarium, interesting for both adults and kids with touch tanks. You can even buy fish from their pet shop",
          "Aquarium visit was something different from driving on a country side and watching natural sights. I didn't expect much from this place but it was positive experience. It was Friday noon in the sunny day and aquarium was quite empty. There was little fish feeding time 13:00 and",
          "While not very large, it is well done! Beautiful exhibits and educational. Watch out for the splash tank! The whale skeleton is massive and really gives you a scale on the size of whales.",
          "Enjoyed this, with 2 small children who also loved it and interacted well with all the displays, However the noise level with the pumps was crazy. I don't mind the wave pool, but upstairs it was very loud, and impossible to hear the guide, when it came to feeding time.. I felt",
          "Good but Very expensive . \u20ac30 for a family of 3. Don't think it's worth that much. Two levels . Bottom floor is good but not much on the top floor. A lot of exhibitions empty.",
          "This was a wonderful little aquarium! We happened to be there during a feeding time too. It was very neat to see the fish go crazy over dinner. But don't go into the aquarium expecting a wide variety of animals. It's totally unlike the large aquarium in Chicago that I'm most",
          "Excellent fun for kids who can dip hands into fish pool and touch the fish, and gaze into the two story high tank to catch site of sharks and many other species of sea creatures.",
          "I recently visited the galway aquarium. We were greeted my the friendly staff on arrival. We got a nice tour guide who showed us around and gave us some valuable information. It was facinating to see the beautiful sea life. I must say my kids really enjoyed holding the star fish",
          "I went here with my partner for a day out. It is a lovely place to visit with lots of interesting animals inside. It is perfect for couples and families, and it's near other local attractions.",
          "lovely aquarium,not very big,but worth visit. lots of big fishes! :) not far from city center,but if u on walk,better to take a bus from city center(about 10 minutes) from Eyre square.",
          "Heard about this attraction and saw the reviews, but this exceeded expections. Very well done and nice presentation of information.",
          "Good trip kids enjoyed the visit and the ray pool. Fish feeding was a little dull and the kids were not involved just watching a girl throw food into the fish",
          "i'm not an aquarium expert but it was pretty good, we had fun. the only problem was it was pretty small. fun experience though.",
          "While on holidays in galway we visited the aquarium. Have to say the staff are amazing. Took time out to bring our children over and hold star fish and feed bigger fish which was such a highlight for them",
          "This aquarium was ok. We went there since most everything else was shut down due to the snow. We spent no more than an hour there and were through the entire place. Pretty pricy for the amount of entertainment value",
          "We visited here during our holiday in Salthill, while it was pricey it was definitely worth it. The staff were lovely and my little boy had a great time looking at all the fish. The gift shop was expensive but I think you have to expect that in a tourist area, I really hope that",
          "They have hourly tours with a team member explaining about several species and sometimes feeding them, sometime allowing us to touch some species.",
          "Great experience. We have visited aquariums in Sydney, Australia and in Denmark. This was among the very best. Well worth a visit. Kids loved it. Super. Try to get on one of the fish-feeding tours; staff are great.",
          "It was a good trip especially for younger children. There amazement as they looked at each tank was nice to see. They really enjoyed the feeding times for the fish as well.",
          "Small Aquarium and very dated but overall there was an okay aray of Salt and Freshwater Fish. A lot of the tanks appeared to be completely empty, (We really really looked!) Ideal for very young kids. We seen everything the Aquarium had to offer in approx 40 mins. * \u20ac12 per",
          "Very average aquarium. All the fish seemed to be something you could order in a resteraunt. Only exciting thing was 'dory & nemo'. Kids might like it though. Not worth the money for two adults",
          "I went here with my mum, no kids. \u20ac12 entry. It was a nice way to spend an hour but nothing too spectacular there...rays, starfish, eels, finding Nemo in real life. A few of the tanks were empty like the octopus one. We enjoyed it though on a very wet day when we couldn\u2019t brave",
          "It was a wet day so we took our 2 children to this aquarium. We were disappointed with the limited variety of fish displayed. The floor is quite damp and our daughter slipped over twice while viewing. Much of the aquarium is tired with loose attachments to aquariums needing to",
          "If you are having a weekend away with the family, this is well worth a visit particularly if the weather has let you down. It's small but laid out well and the kids will love it. May seem expensive but amusements would probably cost you as much",
          "I was really surprised by this place! It has way more fish species than I expected, plenty for the kids to see and once you get a stamp you can come and go as often as you like on the same day. My kids didn't want to leave!",
          "This aquarium is very small, dirty and over priced. I\u2019ve seen better aquatic exhibits in pet stores. The only positive is that there are a few interactive \u201ctouch pools\u201d for the kids where they can feel star fish, crabs and sting rays. If you\u2019re looking for an aquarium",
          "Too small, not many different species. Don't know what the big fuss is about this place. Good for kids only.",
          "My two kids,5&2 enjoyed this place. Got to see some of the fish at feeding time and the guides were knowledgeable whilst able to cater to their young crowd.",
          "The Aquarium in Salthill. It's an oldie, but good to bring the kids. Hasn't changed in the past 20 years since I last came here. Entry was like \u20ac12 or something, but I managed to pay a Student price \u20ac9 because I'm on a Springboard. It sounds steep at first, but this isn't the",
          "Really great place for kids for spend an afternoon. The fact that you can come and good is great. Lots of interesting atractions.",
          "Visited here with 4 and 6 year old children. We found that we were able to see everything in less than an hour. There was not a whole lot of interactive things for the children to do. There was information on the walls around the tanks but it is hard to hold children's attention",
          "Not about aquarium quite small compare to ones I\u2019ve been to. But still plenty to see. Lots of nice staff on hand if you have any questions.",
          "Visited with my four year old son, we were there for the 4pm feeding and the really brilliant staff make this place. The girl that did the feeding / talk was fantastic, super friendly and good natured, she went out of her way to let the little kids hold starfish and feed bigger",
          "We had a couple of hours to kill before catching a train, and the Atlantaquaria was right across the street from our hotel. We didn't expect much, as we hadn't read anything about it, but were pleasantly surprised to find a very nice aquarium with great exhibits, interesting",
          "This was a good aquarium but quite small compared with the hype. The wave tanks were good, and the children liked the interactive sections",
          "Quite small exhibition. Pretty expensive for what it is. Would recommend for children but if you saw some aquarium before, it's nothing breathtaking.",
          "Couldn't recommend this place enough for young children. Brought my 2 year old here recently for the day and we had a great day! They give you a stamp on your hand on entry and you can leave the premises and come back at anytime which was great as we were able to go off and get",
          "Visited there with my daughter, who is six. She loved it. She got to hold star fish, hermit crab and a bigger crab( don't remember what kind). She enjoyed feeding the fish. I loved that your ticket was good all day so you could go have lunch and come back for another feeding",
          "The aquarium was okay but a bit steep in price. 12 euro was a bit too expensive in regards that we had seen everything in 1 hour. Maybe if you stay for the whole feeding it could be longer but it's just stretching out",
          "Much better than we anticipated. Not a massive aquarium but still took over an hour to see everything and the tanks had lots of different fish / species to see. Each exhibit was really well presented and one tank had a big wave simulator for the fish that was really cool to",
          "We had 4 happy individuals who reluctantlly left after 2.5 hours of looking around this small but informative facility in the heart of Salthill. Staff were very friendly and willing to share their knowledge. Priced under \u20ac50 for the family so within our budget for the days",
          "yes it cost 33 for a family ticket yes it's small but great way kill an hour on a wet rainy day good selection of fish and tanks",
          "We had great fun here, there are touch pools and feeding displays. They have a daily itinerary and you get a stamp when you walk in which allows you to leave and come back in later in the day. They have a huge tank also the kids were amazed at the variety.",
          "We visited the centre with three children-6,3 and 18 months old. We found it very expensive for the family tickets mainly because there was very little to see or do. We were there for the fish feeding and held the starfish and crab but still were not impressed. However staff",
          "I went there on a Sunday morning and arrived about 11:. The aquarium is not as sleek and refined as some others that I have visited, the tanks are a little more unrefined. However there was a guided tour to feed the small fish, which transformed the experience from looking at",
          "Although there are plenty of fish to look at, the aquarium is very, very small. It took us literally 30 minutes to walk around everything including upstairs and read the information provided. With kids I assume this would take longer but for the price it was ridiculous. Cost",
          "It is a small Aquarium but well worth a visit . Very informative and fun to see the kids feeding the fishes at feeding times .",
          "So if you need to go somewhere when it is raining this out is the perfect day out, it's well worth the visit",
          "Visited here on a wet day in Galway. It's reasonably priced for a family of 4 and a good way to spend an hour Quite a few species on display and some local facts etc",
          "I brought the family along and while the kids enjoyed the trip the facility is a bit small to keep you entertained. We were a little disappointing how quickly we managed to see everything.",
          "Enjoyed the variety of fish and easy viewing, the splash pool was a fun surprise. We even got to hold starfish - 4 year old loved that bit the most",
          "Yes it's not very big , but if you go at feed times the staff make it so interesting and have so much knowledge. They held are kids attention for the whole time . It's 2 floors , like I said not very big an hour and you'll be finished but worth a visit.",
          "Smaller than I'd expect for a national aquarium, but good variety of marine creatures. Fascinated by the mermaid purses - they're hidden in a corner on the second floor, so don't miss them! Was able to pet a ray during a feeding tour.",
          "Staying in nearby Tuam, we took a trip here one morning. It was ok. Rather expensive at 12 euro each and there wasn't much to see. I guess the good thing is your stamp lasts all day so you can go back for feeding times if you wish. There are pools you can touch but it's hard to",
          "Went to this attraction with two young children. It was very good due to all the tanks been glass to the floor so the two kids could see everything. There was a lift so children in push chairs could go to the second level. Worth a visit for all ages, lots of info on the",
          "We went to this on our visit to Galway so not worth the money 30 euro for a family of four and we were finished in over an half an hour going at a slow pace and looking at each tank. Don't bother spend your money on something else. Feeding times aren't till afternoon during the",
          "There were several nice displays, but the aquarium is small and was full of school children on trips. The guides had to shout to make themselves heard, which diminished our experience. The touch/feel aspect would be fabulous for kids.",
          "On our trip to Galway we brought the kids to visit the aquarium. It was a great choice, the kids loved every bit of it and it had a variety of different fish. Would recommend to anyone",
          "Like many of our days in Ireland, this day started out a little foggy, with intermittent rain showers and a need to look for some indoor activities to interest our little ones. Well, look no further - the Galway Atlantaquria provides all that you would need. Many terrific",
          "We visited Galway Atlantaquaria with the idea that it'd just be something to pass the time but we were pleasantly surprised at how fun and educational it was. From the start, we were facinated by the variety of different sea creatures the aquarium hosted. The rays were a",
          "Galway doesnt have a huge amount of sights to see that dont involve drinking but this is one. Small aquarium but with a decent variety of fish, well displayed with some interesting information. Its not that big (we were there for about half an hour) so 12 euro is maybe a bit",
          "I have visited here a number of times. The highlights for me are that many fish are found in Irish seas and also the pools upstairs where the children can get hands on and hold the starfish etc. They love it without noticing how informative it is!",
          "i went there a few years ago with my mam and and sister and brother i thought it was really interesting to learn so much about all the sharks, fish and all the different creatures in there the staff were so lovely",
          "Got there for the 1pm fish feeding was very fun to be involved in feeding the fish. Deffiantly the highlight. It's abit smaller then I thought it would be. Fun for an hour or two but you couldn't spend all day there due to seeing everything very quickly. Abit disappointed that",
          "We decided to go to the aquarium as it was very near our hotel and the beach, and we thought it would be nice. It was expensive enough for two students for the amount of time we spent in it. It was very dark, and it seemed a lot bigger from the outside than it actually was. It's",
          "Love this place! Always a must when in Galway!! Spectacular variety of fish and lots of information written about them! The place itself is quite dark and dull could do with some fun artwork to make it more attractive? Very nice staff obviously know exactly what they're talking",
          "Unlike aquaria that try to be all things to all people, this one focuses almost entirely on fish and habits in both fresh and salt water in and around Ireland. We counted only four tanks containing exotics -- one colorful Caribbean tropicals, two creatures from the Amazon Basin,",
          "We had great time there. We seen plenty of fishes but unfortunately we didn't find turtles ,my son love them. Overall nice place to but probably you won't come back as is quite costly.",
          "Ireland's largest connection indoors with the sea.... you will be able to see first hand and experience this is the most famous and near the Wild Atlantic beautiful Salthill native irish sharks, jellyfish and much much more... then enjoy the rest of the gift shop cafe and relax",
          "Not the largest Aquarium I have been to but very informative. Really enjoyed the interactions and we stayed for the feeding time. Got to hold a starfish and learned quite a bit. Gift shop had a good variety Noticed a sign showing birthday parties available there which would be",
          "Spent about 2 hours in here recently with an 8 and 3-year-old. To my surprise, they loved it.. as did I. Exhibits are mostly found in irish waters, so nothing awe-striking, but the hourly events they run are great, due to their interactive nature and the staff that deliver them.",
          "this was great for kids, you can spend as long as you like, its not huge but my 2 year old loved it and I will bring her back",
          "Galway atlantiquarium proved a very enjoyable experience for four kids and myself ages 3 to 9 .a spacious airy display of tanks and touch pools over 2 floors .all day ticket validity meant good value and overall we spent 3 .5 hours here .",
          "We loved it. People whinging about the cost need to realise that Aquariums and Zoos are expensive to run. If you want to see the animals, fish etc be prepared to contribute. Seeing local Atlantic sea 'animals' was great, including the tiniest seahorse! The feeding time was super",
          "Been looking forward to visiting the aquarium for some time, found it a little pricey at 8.70 for Seniors, proximity to the fish excellent but found the signage poor, seen it all after half an hour. Highlights were the unexpected splash pool and the main ground floor area.",
          "There was instantly something fishy when we went to test the waters in the aquarium, we expected to have a whale of a time and in fairness we were looking for a fishcount because we onlly had a few squid to rub together but that ship was just not going to sail.without a trout",
          "Recently went to Kinvara & needed an activity for our final day. Decided on the aquarium, & was severely disappointed. You could touch & feed some fish but that was the extent of the excitement. Upstairs was poorly manned, no people around & people sticking their hands in tanks",
          "This aquarium is a good place to visit the tanks are impressive for Ireland . there is plenty of room to walk around and enjoy the display. the tank setups are good trying to copy some of the Galway water ways landmarks.",
          "While we had been there before with our older children, this time we visited the aquarium with our youngest child. We all enjoyed the visit as as were there for two of the feeding times : big fish, small fish and we also had a chance of experiencing the Touch Pool tour. If you",
          "The aquarium is a lovely attraction for children.. older than 12 would be bored but the smallies loved it! We got there in time for the touch pool where the staff were supervising the 'petting of fish' - great, slimy fun! It's an interesting place but after a while the fish get",
          "In Galway for a weekend and the weather wasn't the greatest. We wondered into the aquarium. It was great. Very interactive. The staff were so friendly and only too happy to help. Loads of great detail and facts. Adults and kids would enjoy this.",
          "I took a 4, 5 and 6 year old at 4pm last Thursday afternoon. We got around in 30minute s and had time to double back again before 5pm. The 5 and 6 year old loved it but the 4 year old was very scared of the fish tank that had the gushing waves. We missed feeding time and all the",
          "My son and I visited the Aquarium in the afternoon the end of January during a weekend stay in Galway. We loved the Aquarium, the staff have so much information to share and I would strongly advise you to join one of the activities like 'Feeding time' etc. as you learn so much",
          "Went here unplanned with the family. From the outside it looks like a bit shabby and expectations were not high. But we had a fantastic time. Yes its not huge but plenty to see and the tour was great, kids got to touch and feed loads of fish. Thoroughly enjoyable. Went off peak",
          "Brought a group of 5 1st year students to the Aquarium and had a wonderful tour with Catherine - she was super friendly, enthusiastic and patient with our group. Really liked that the aquarium is focused on fish that can be found in Irish waters. Interactive tour had lots of",
          "I am a regular at the Ripley's Aquarium in Toronto, which is absolutely massive. First going here I was shocked at how small it was. It was only two floors. The downstairs kind of had a steampunk vibe to it as it was in an ominous room with large fish and an octopus, I believe.",
          "My wife always likes to visit aquariums when we travel, so we have visited some fabulous aquariums across the world. We spent a lovely couple of hours at the Galway Atlantaquaria, however it is not at, what I would describe as, an international standard. While it is interesting",
          "Visited with our 4 and 8 year old, they enjoyed it alot. Plenty of exhibits to catch their attention, lots of different species and plenty of lifelike effects. We were lucky enough to be present when the fresh water feeding was taking place, the staff member was very informative",
          "We visited the Aquarium yesterday and really enjoyed our visit. Our young lad was fascinated by the fish displays as I was .Some of the Rays even came up and said hello. There was conger eel and Cray fish and lots of mullet in very natural conditions. We were the only people to",
          "You would think somewhere like this is just for kids, but after myself and my husband spent an afternoon here we realized it was definitely not. The place is full of quirky features and great fun to watch and touch the fish. Great experience.",
          "If you have been to a large american aquarium like Baltimore then you may be a little disappointed. It has a few unique to the area displays and animals but it does not take long to view most of the collection. It is nice that its across from the salthill promenade so you get",
          "Visited the antiquarian yesterday Wonderful place and the young lad giving the tour was great Got to feed the fish and hold the star fish it was great. Well worth a visit",
          "I have been to the aqaurium in Dingle and Bray and enjoyed them a lot more. There seemed to be a shortage of staff here and those we saw seemed to be giving private tours only. Feeding times were poorly announced and as a result we missed them. Nothing about mackerel, a very",
          "We visited the aquarium this morning with our children, half and hour and it was finished. It cost \u20ac25 with a voucher from the hotel we are staying at. The audio room was closed off upstairs as it was reserved for a party - don't know if we missed anything here. Overall unless",
          "We had planned a visit to the Aquarium, so on a wet and windy Thursday morning we went. First impression, at \u20ac12.00 pp I thought it was a little over priced. Having said that, if I was eating the fish \u20ac12.00 wouldn't be a problem. We both enjoyed the experience of seeing these",
          "I just have to comment on the positive staff attitude . This is in regard to their treatment of visitors and the sheer positive dedication towards the creatures in their care. Value for money and very informative. Interactive feeding, touching and learning. Don't miss it! Just",
          "We have enjoyed aquariums all over the world and for its size this delivered a great experience. Showing the exhibits in as close as possible to their natural conditions was impressive. The tank signage was sometimes poorly located when trying to identify individual specimens-",
          "Good restaurant but disjointed service. The cream of squash and coconut soup was excellent. The dining room is attractive and has plenty of staff but they are disjointed in their service.",
          "I loved the Aquarium, interesting display of fish and organised information all around the Aquarium!",
          "We actually stopped in the little bakery and coffee shop, located in the same building as the Aquaium, but were soon aware that most folks were going into the Aquarium, so we joined the line. The entrance fee is very reasonable, expecially the senior discount fee- that was nice",
          "I recently visited with my niece (aged 3) and nephew (aged 2). We were lucky to arrive just as the tour commenced and they got a chance to feed the fish. Most of the tanks are at their eye level, which made it all the more enjoyable for them. Entry tickets are valid to come and",
          "...then it is an option. It's nothing spectacular, I must say. Nice. Mostly for kids. It is a small place, two levels, quite a bit of fish tanks, but it doesn't do the 'wow!' effect. It's alright. Nothing more, I'm afraid.",
          "Recently in the news but this is a great visit and a lot to learn each and every time. great ocean experience and expertise at hand to help in all ways.",
          "Let me first say, we have been to some of the biggest aquariums such as Tennessee in Chattanooga, Atlanta, GA and Aquarium of hte Pacific so buy those standards, the largest in Ireland is small. Having said that, we were glad we went. The rays come right up to you begging to be",
          "We decided to visit as the weather had turned very wet and we were pleasantly surprised. The fish on display were primarily sea water which was great to see. There was an opportunity to strike the fish in the Ray pool which also had friendly dog fish, common sharks and cod. All",
          "Kids loved it! Good selection of different enviroments , mainly Atlantic and native waters but the low walls on the tanks allowed the kids to touch some of the fish. of course Nemo fish was a hit!",
          "Very interesting displays. The live feeding of fish was good,cespecially watching the eels .Enjoyed it, but a little expensive for a small aquarium.",
          "On a whim and hours to burn we took a detour from Bunratty to Galway then on to Shannon. We wanted a sea side adventure. We found the National Aquarium of Ireland, what a sweet surprise easy walking for challenged walkers as well as children. Great exhibits with well written",
          "This was a nice, \"small\" aquarium right by our apt hotel. I put \"small\" in quotes because while its really not tiny, its smaller than many/most of the large city aquariums in the United States. The place is geared toward kids and makes for a very fun afternoon. We went there",
          "A lovely place but was a lot smaller than expecting.Might appeal more to younger kids.Brought my ten yr old and had the whole aquarium done in half an hr. Its very overpriced. The touch pools are not really touch pools as you cant go near anything in them without a member of",
          "I had never been to an aquarium before but I was pleasantly surprised. There were lots of things to see. They had a 3 legged turtle they had rescued and were waiting for the army to come in and relocate the turtle to warmer climes so she could be released back into the wild.",
          "Me and my boyfriend visited the aquarium while in Galway on 15/09/2016. To be honest we weren't expecting a whole lot as we are both big animal lovers and work in the animal keeping industry so have visited quite a few larger aquariums but were blown away by how incredible this",
          "Fab the kids loved it !! Very reasonable 38 euro for family of six , friendly staff , educational and hands on !!!",
          "We spent an enjoyable few hours wandering around the aquarium. When we first got there we made the second half of the fresh water fish talk and feeding which was very informative. The aquarium is well laid out and maintained. I love the way the tanks are themed to match the",
          "My daughter loves this place - its really well set up and a just a great way to spend an hour or so - well worth a visit!",
          "Brought my nephew and niece here during the summer and they loved in. There is a great slection of fish on show and you can also get to handle the star fish. An afternoon well spent.",
          "it's very small and with a minimal variety of fish. I think prices should be lower if compared to what you get for your money. Anyway, the staff was very friendly and willing to appease all of your doubts or to explain to you funny and interesting things about the specimens.",
          "well worth a visit, especially on a wet day ! lots of species of fish, recommend a tour for children, where they get a chance to hold starfish and guide was very good with plenty of patience's!",
          "We have visited here on quite a few occasions and always enjoy looking at the marine life on display. The feeding time talks by the staff are very informative and enjoyable. Its great that the ray pool is so low down and wide as these fish are fascinating and you could spend",
          "My boyfriend and I came here on a rainy day in Galway and had the best time ever. This aquarium was way better than we expected it to be and it had plenty of different types of fish in it. We even stuck around to watch the fish being fed which was fun and interesting. Great for",
          "Good activity for the kids on a rainy day in Salthill. The stingrays tank is low so the whole family can get close to them.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the Aquarium. It was a great way to keep a toddler amused on a rainy day and the adults loved it too. The staff are excellent, there was a fun activity upstairs in the morning where kids got to touch star fish and feed fish and we really learnt a",
          "Good interactive exhibits. Takes a couple of hours if you take your time. A few surprises on the way. Look for feeding times to make it more interesting. I have been 4 times.",
          "We visited the aquarium during a rainy visit to Galway and were impressed with how much they had in a relatively small aquarium. My son is autistic and struggled a bit with the noise due to the open plan layout of the aquarium but loved some of the exhibits, particularly the",
          "The place is smaller than I expected. But even that it's great fun for all family. The kids can actually see and touch underwater \"creature\". Every hour is the feeding time where you can get all the in from the professional staff. We delighted and recommend.",
          "Great activity for rainy day. The coffee shop outside is really nice & you can leave/ return to the aquarium",

          "We do a trip to the aquarium every two years and we always enjoy it, it's a great resource and the staff are lovely patient with the little and not so little ones. Eddie the wreck fish is everyone's favourite, but the turtle with a missing leg was interesting to my 7 year old",
          "we really enjoyed this as you can go in early and have a good look around leave and come back in later on if you want. it is a bit pricey but if the kids are happy then you are happy. we went in and saw everything left had lunch and came back in to hold starfish in the touch",

          "Brought the kids here during summer holidays they really enjoyed it, was definitely worth the trip great value for money",
          "Coffee was excellent as was the table service which was unusual for a coffee shop. The toilets were not great. The utensils were clean but the floor and walls need a serious cleaning with Bleach. They appear never to be cleaned thoroughly.",
          "Great experience for both adults, children or school trips. See what we possible are not able to spot in our Oceans...",
          "Although the cost was 30euros the ticked allowed you to go in all day as many times as you liked so my young children loved going twice. They loved seeing all the fish and the presentations given by the staff. Would definitely recommend it and would love to go back.",
          "Great facility for children. Good range of sea life to view. I particularly enjoyed the touching pools which enabled people a chance to touch the fish.",
          "I went here with my three children, aged 3,7 and 9 for the first time and we had a super day. Parking in this area is a problem so arrive early to make it easier. Admission prices were very reasonable. Try and go at a time when the feeding is happening, they have a timetable so",
          "The whole family enjoyed our visit here. Only small but its very interesting. The guide was great and very informative. It's really hands and interactive. Worth visiting if you're in Galway.",
          "Visited recently with my wife and young son. He loved, spent the time running from tankn to tank in awe of all the fish. I did think the price was a bit on the steep side however.",

          "The aquarium isn't huge, but it is interesting and nicely designed. The staff on the day I was there were friendly and helpful. I think your admission ticket allows you to come and go during the day, which is nice because it is a little expensive at \u20ac12for an adult. Howver the",
          "Stopped by the aquarium as we walked and visited the promenade in Salthill/Galway. Cute little family friendly place to spend about 2 hours of time. More appropriate for little children than big ones but nonetheless it was interesting for our family of 6 which includes 4 teenage",
          "I have brought my son (7) to this aquarium each summer for the last few years and he has loved each visit. Compared to a similar sized aquarium on the East coast I find this one to be much more interactive. There are plenty of staff avaliable to answer questions and there are",

          "As an adult taking a day trip to the aquarium in Salthill, I was very impressed with the utilization of space within the facility. Should I have been a child this place would have been a dream as it is completely child friendly and safe, there is little information stations",

          "First of all is important to say that the aquarium is small. The prices for tickets are different. They advantages especially groups and families. Inside it you will find a good variety of fishes and other marine creatures but no animals such as sharks, octopus or piranhas. The",

          "My niece wanted to go to this aquarium. I enjoyed it as well. We were there to see the staff feeding the fish and that was fun. There were a few of us listening to the guide and he seemed to enjoy talking to us. So, he extended the feeding and let us hold starfish and two",
          "I spotted the aquarium as we were driving to Salthill so we popped in. It was \u20ac12 per adult which seems a little dear as it takes less than an hour to see everything. The aquarium is packed full of really cool fish and lots of information on everything you see. The added bonus",
          "The Aquarium is open 7 days a week ...even on Bank Holidays! Ideal, if one is spending the day in Galway/Salthill...the ticket is valid for the day....so one can leave and come back at any time during the day. This is especially handy as there are set feeding times and touch",

          "Went there with my Daughter she loved it, to be fair she is two loves anything involving fish and water. For me it was out dated, I felt it was decorated by school kids and the national museums hand me downs. It could be so much better, I think they need a massive make over. And",
          "Small but excellent aquarium where you can get close to the indigenous fish of Ireland and its surrounding seas. Best feature is the interactive sessions held a few times a day where the kids get to pick up and hold some of the crabs and starfish.",
          "For anyone who hasn't been before, the aquarium is well worth a visit, especially if you can be there at feeding times. There are some fantastic looking fish and is designed to be fully accessible for children. Unfortunately the exhibits rarely change, making it a bit boring for",

          "Went this afternoon and was pleasantly surprised. Lots of interesting enclosures. Got to touch the Ray and to hold a star fish and a crab. Great interactive element. Great for kids as well. Overall positive day out.",
          "A great spot to visit with the family, a very good selection of fish on display and the host was very knowledgeable and even let the kids hold some of the fish. I've been to other bigger aquariums that haven't come close to this one. If your in the area definitely give a call in.",
          "I have not visited any place like this before. The guide told us many useful information, he even let us hold a starfish and a crab and feed the other fish! It was anything but boring or vague. Small but better than the majority of the big ones. Don't be snobbish and visit.",
          "We went here to escape the relentless Galway rain. It was quite small but there were lots of opportunity to take loads of interesting photos. On the day we were there it was packed as obviously everyone else had the same idea of escaping the rain.",
          "My two boys (aged 1 and 4) really enjoyed. Great facilities and very friendly and knowledgeable staff.",
          "The aquarium is quaint and has a fair selection of sea life on display. There is a family friendly cafe next door too. If you visit aquariums out of interest in marine science then this might not be for you, it is small and not a huge amount of variety or information. It's built",
          "It is a little aquarium, but its nice to be able to easily view the aquatic wildlife. It was cool to see the stages of development in the animals.",
          "The National Aquarium in Salthill is well worth a visit. We passed 2 hours there no problem on a wet and windy day. Price is a little steep but you can leave and re-visit on the same day, we couldn't as we were leaving Galway on the same day. Worth timing your visit for the",
          "Good value. We enjoyed looking around. Interesting to watch the fish at feeding times.. Friendly and knowledgeable staff.",
          "I'll start with the fact that we didn't get to see inside the place! We arrived late on just before 4.30. Signs on doors say they close at 5. We asked the person behind the counter and we were told they had closed. Now, if they normally close at that time, no prob BUT they",
          "Kids really enjoyed this aquarium,from the scary wave inside the door to the multiple species of fish. The highlight was holding the star fish and feeding the mullet. However for the price it cost us for entry I really couldn't recommend it to others as it's way over priced. Not",
          "a charming experience surely to do if you are passionate for the gorgeous ocean out there: two floors of absolutely fascinating pools and fish tanks, reproducing every environment available, from the shore, to the wave line, to the muddy swamps, with all the flora and fauna you",
          "Stopped by here while in Galway. Was nice to do something different, passed away a bit of the day. The layout is good, lots of fish! Would recommend a visit.",
          "We visited the aquarium on a cold day with our two daughters. It is quite samll. I think its price does not match with its size. My older daughter who is almost six got a bit bored, whereas the younger one who is two loved it. They both liked the touch tour though. I would",
          "The whole aquarium can easily be done in 45 minutes. This was a bit pricey for 33 Euros for a family of 4. The highlight was the brief feeding tour. The fish, rays and small sharks come right up to the surface for the food, and you can pet them. The large skate was very cool",
          "Instead of taking or grandchild to Santa we took him to visit the Galway Atlantaquaria n Salthill. It was a very windy day with the waves crashing over onto the promenade in Salthill but plenty of people were making their way to the Atlantaquaria. At the entrance to the",
          "I think this place is lacking a major attraction (i.e. Shark or something), what's the draw here? It was \u20ac33 for a family ticket (2 adults and 2 kids) to see pollack and brown trout. It was an alright experience but very expensive in my opinion.",
          "one of the best aquariums we have been in for seniors to children alike.you can make it a centerpieceon a walk from galway city to salthill and back",
          "visited on a wet sunday with 2 kids. a nice way to see out a sunday . kids loved it. would go again,",
          "Galway Atlantaquaria on the Promenade in Salthill is one of the most popular attractions in Galway. A vast array of sea creatures to view and learn about.",
          "It is a great fun for kids and adult, I've been in such a laces before but this one surprised me with the feeding and opened aquariums that allows you to see the fishes from the very close and touch them too.",
          "We stopped here to pass some time. It was small but interesting. All of the fish are Atlantic fish. Admission was cheaper than most of the attractions we went to. It would be a nice place for kids, as you can touch some of the fish with staff supervision. The restrooms were very",
          "Went in today with little expectations but was very surprised. We got there about 30 mins before the big fish feeding time so had a good look around and than went on the tour. Very informative and able to touch the ray fish. The small fish feeding was on about 20 mons after",
          "The place seems small, but there is a lot to see! We took the tour and were able to touch and hold starfish and a crab. It was very informative and enjoyed the interaction.",
          "Lovely place to bring children, educating to young and old. Last time I was here was a birthday party, and each kid loved it.",
          "Spent a couple of hours enjoying the facility. Very enjoyable and fascinating. Fun place to take the family. A must see when in Salthill.",
          "We went amazed at how many different species were on display and how well kept the pools of water are constantly freshened as needed.",
          "Been more than once great for a couple on wet day. Can waste a few hours walking around looking at the fish. Staff are very helpfully if you have any Inquires.",
          "A must see place, especially for children, great source of information about the sea, and the live exhibits are fantastic.",
          "This is a small but quite complete aquarium with many native species. The layout and explanations are conducive to learning for clients of all ages.",
          "There are several aquariums dotted throughout the country and this one doesn't really stand out from the herd, it's ok but a bit dark inside for some reason and i would say expensive for the amount of time you spend inside, ok for a wet day but otherwise i'd save my money and it",
          "Reasonable prices for family, love that we could spend time in there and then leave and return again in the same day with no extra charge. Loved the touch pools, the children got to hold starfish and spider crabs. Very informative and enjoyable.",
          "We visited the Aquarium today. It was a nice experience but it's quite small and the variety of fish etc limited. The feeding time was good and our son got to hold starfish and hermit crabs. The shop had limited stock which was quite disappointing. But all in all, happy to",
          "Good staff who are open to questions along with a wide variety of fish to see. It is in a great location and I recommend a walk on the prom when your done!",
          "Had an interesting and fun afternoon here today. Kids loved the fact you could touch and feel and loved the star fish. Highly recommended and great price.",
          "Its a decent aquarium, hovered we waited almost 45 minutes for the 4pm small fish feeding, and it never happened. No explanation from staff. Also alot of tanks were empty, again with no explanation or sign. What was available to see was very good, and informative, how ever I",
          "Was great and had a wide selection of fish but it is the smallest aquarium I've been to. Was a little too expensive for what you actually see.",
          "Quite a small aquarium with very few exotic fish. The place was quite dark and had only a few tanks to explore. We were there during one of the feeding times but the room was so large, you could not hear the commentary of the feeder and it was nothing more than throwing a few",
          "We were here last week, it was our second visit, kids aged 7 and 9, they preferred the first visit as the Aquarium is quiet small and there wasn't a lot added since we visited last, the guy giving the talk at the petting pools was really good and the boys were interested in what",
          "The staff here were very friendly, told us about all the talks and feeding times. Reasonable price \u20ac11.50 for an adult. Worth a visit",
          "I hadn't been interested in going but my husband and daughter (15) declared that we were. It turned out to be a really enjoyable attraction! What got my attention was that it wasn't an aquarium that I could see anywhere - the focus was on sea life in western Ireland, which was",
          "It is very expensive to visit here and its certainly not worth the amount of money you pay for what you see I would give it a miss in the future unless they drastically reduce their prices",
          "Rather dated and small. Not worth spending out 33euro for a family. We always try to get the most out of any trip or tour we go on but we had done and seen everything we could do in about an hour. In my opinion Exploris in Co. Down is a much better aquarium.",
          "The aquarium itself is a little dated and the tanks aren't always displayed in a way that best displays the fish inside, but the staff give talks, answer questions, and help visitors handle crabs and starfish. In my opinion this makes it better than any other aquarium I've been",
          "We visited with our two children in early July. The price of a family ticket was \u20ac33 (a bit on the steep side for all there is) and combined with the gift shop prices proved to be an expensive trip. The guide at the touch tank was very informative and engaged the kids well but",
          "Not worth the 35 that was paid but had a look around ,wouldn't go again.would wait for the feefing time to go.missed a guided tour that would have been good.",
          "Worth the visit, kids liked it. lovely tanks and fish. A little pricey with 2 adults and 3 kids. gift shop is expensive.",
          "this was our 4th visit in the last few years and we all still enjoy going. Your ticket is valid for the whole day so you can go in for a little visit in the morning and go to the beach for an hour or to and go back again. There are different feeding times during the day. the",

          "Our visit here was absolutely a hit with my 1.5 yr old and myself and my parent liked it as well. The displays are very cool. The touch pool and the small fish pool were interactive and fun. We spent nearly two hours in here watching the fish and learning about the different",
          "Lovely place and the boys liked it got to hold a starfish and a crab but not good value for money just over 30 euro and we didn't get the hour out of it",
          "Lots of fishes to see and place well maintained for a smaller aquarium. Liked the starfish pool best, also there are some gigantic black eels that are a must see!",
          "Visited the aquarium with my family 2 days ago, and I have 2 say was well worth the visit!! Nice atmosphere and amazing animals to check out! Will definitely be back really enjoyed it!",
          "Had to be persuaded to visit, but very glad I did as it is well worth seeing and very interesting. We were not there at feeding time, but if I was going again I would make sure it was during feeding time.",
          "We spent hours in the aquarium and will probably return, in spite of a somewhat expensive entry fee. We had a marvellous time. Visitors are allowed put their hands in to some tanks to stroke a variety of fish. There are rock pools with starfish, hermit crabs and anemones",
          "Sometimes, given the weather in western Ireland, you need a good indoor attraction. This aquarium, while not huge, was well done and provided a couple of hours worth of entertainment! A good value for the family.",
          "We managed to spend an hour roaming around the tanks and were there as a feeding tour took place. You could tell the guide enjoyed his job as he told us about the little fish. The jellyfish were out of season so weren't there to see. To make the most of the ticket go early and",
          "Good little aquarium. Lots to see and not too expensive. Big variety of fish and lots of feely tanks for the kids. Valentine the white skate was def worth seeing! Nice few hours and good to watch them being fed.",
          "This was our second visit to the aquarium in Galway. Our first was 12 years ago, and it is still just as we remembered. While not huge, it is the perfect size for small kids or for a short visit. We went on a weekday, and it was not crowded other than one school group. We",
          "I visited her with my 5 year old son and a baby in a buggy. The place is fully buggy accessible which made life easy. It cost \u20ac19 for entry which was a little high, however if you are hanging around salthill all day, you can enter multiple times with this ticket. In that case I",
          "I was very surprised on entering the aquatic goldmine behind those doors. We arrived in time for the daily feeding of the fish on first floor at 1pm. My son was given some of the food and allowed to feed the fish. He had a great time. We all did. Definitely a must visit",
          "Great aquarium, the young lady who help my girls hold the starfish was really excellent, we learned loads about the star fish and she spent lots of time answering their questions. Loved all of the information available about the fish and exhibits, and also the whale skeleton.",
          "The national aquarium in Galway was a great way to spend a rainy, cool afternoon in May. There are a large number of tanks, mostly with salt water species, but they also have some smaller tanks with fresh water fish. I felt I was up close and personal with the fish. They also",
          "This aquarium is very small, very dark and very low in the range of species you can see. It's location is good so it's nice to pop in for a walk around for an hour after a walk on the beach or along the prom. I wouldn't rate it as a good aquarium by any means but if you're in",
          "We travelled 2 hours to visit and while the exhibits were very good and the staff very helpful; it cost 33 Euro for 2 adults & 2 childrens and it is so small that we were finished in an hour. Children of course then want to visit the gift shop and the coffee shop and it all",
          "Been here this month. Initially thought this as one of the same boring aquariums, but this one is different and a must if you are in Galway with your kids. So much to see and learn of the sea life and the fishes. So interesting . The ticket lets you go in and out as many times u",
          "We stopped at Galway Atlantaquaria on a whim while we were just exploring Galway. It was a wonderful place and we really enjoyed the way it was set up. a few exhibits were closed due to the time of year but in all we felt we received our moneys worth.",
          "Took my little ones here for an afternoon and was not disappointed. They have a great selection of marine life and the staff is great. Make sure you attend one of the feedings. The guide let my daughter feed some enormous carp and even let her touch them. Such a treat for an",
          "Visited the Atlantaquaria for the third time. The kids enjoy the variety of fish on display and the very personal tours provided by the staff. Every visit is different due to these personal tours and very enjoyable at each occasion.",
          "As a couple in our 20's, we really enjoyed this attraction. The big fish feed was excellent, we found out a lot of information and was fun to see. Walking round the aquarium and watching the feed took about an hour in total. I'm sure I saw somewhere that it was advertised as",
          "The Aquarium exceeded expectations and whilst not on the size of somewhere like La Rochelle or with tanks as large as the Deep in Hull, it had variety with what was on show including worldwide aquatic life and also an ancient canoe that had been pulled from the seashore after a",
          "I visited this aquarium whilst in Galway on a day trip, and was surprisingly impressed by how well it was presented inside and how many types sea life they had. It was also quite reasonably priced and offered a choice of revisiting the aquarium numerous times throughout the day",
          "I checked out the reviews before I went.I always check the bad ones first. There was very few places we could go with a 5year old and a 7 month old so we went just for the spin.we went in the side door and the first place we seen was the pet shop and it all started there.the man",
          "I want so badly to write a great review for this local attraction, however the place is a bit lacklustre. We are a \"nature\" family and work hard in promoting a love for nature in our children. On a positive note, the touch tanks are by far the best part and the kids love to see",
          "Visited at the weekend with son and partner, really enjoyed coming here, staff knew lots of facts about fish, you can put hands in mostly all pools and there is regular fish feeding and handling session throughout the day.",
          "I visit Galway 3 to 4 times a year and I always make a point of coming here at least once. I can't get enough of it and neither can my kids aged 4 and 9 now but they both have been coming since they were born. The staff a very friendly and knowledgable and there is so much to",
          "Lovely place to visit with the kids, great exhibits, fabulous staff, very friendly, will return again.",
          "What a great place, lovely atmosphere, staff friendly and you are given a tour. Beautiful place to visit",
          "Loved every bit of it Kids had a ball! Don't miss the feeding times. Staff very friendly and informative.",
          "We visited here in August 2014 and while the exhibits were interesting and the information boards very well written, I did feel the whole place needs a bit of refurbishment and updating.",
          "Visited on a rainy summers day while visiting family in Galway, 2 adults and 5 boys aged between 6 and 12 and they all enjoyed it, having been to a few sealife attractions in the UK we didnt think this was going to be anything special but i was pleasantly surprised, the boys got",
          "Kids will enjoy this and something to do on rain day. You'll spend an hour here max - they even had Nemo playing in an upstairs cinema which was good.. Not a huge marine life variety but the exhibits are nice. Coffee shop is very nice though. Saw 2 of the chefs sitting on",
          "Visited here with our 14 month and he had a ball looking at all the fish, especially loved the splash pool on way in door. Also got to see the big fish feeding time which was good.",
          "It's good fun for the children and as an adult you can always learn something. That said It's unlikely that you'll spend more than 1 and 1/2 hours there and the ticket is expensive (1 adult ,2 children(5yo and 2yo cost \u20ac19)",
          "The Galway aquarium was a surprisingly good attraction. Lots of unique and local marine life to see, interactive displays, historical information and great staff. Not too expensive either which was a plus for a family visit.",
          "We paid \u20ac30.50 in order to spend half an hour in a small aquarium. My husband, my son (who is nine) and I do not consider it worth the money. My son was extremely disappointed.",
          "Nice small and a bit old aquarium. It could use a bit of renovations. Nothing too exciting to see, but its a nice trip to make for an afternoon if you want something different.",
          "Nice big tanks loved the freshwater tanks could do with some updating but on all a good afternoon trip .",
          "2 adults & 2 kids \u20ac33, very disappointed with the aquarium for this price. Looks very dated, fine for about half the price at the most, can't recommend",
          "I went with my OH and children aged 6 and 7. We found the place small, badly lit and overall a bit disappointing. Some of the features were good - the largest tank was impressive looking but the display of fish was limited. The deep sea diving pod was a great idea, but there",
          "I absaloutely love it here! The aquarium is big and has so many different types of fish, from octopus to lobster, turtles etc. It is perfect for a family trip as there is so many activities for children inside.",
          "We've seen a lot of Aquariums in the U.S. (Baltimore, Chicago, Monterey, Long Beach) and this is not at that scale. Knowing that, it was a nice visit. Plenty of hands on interaction with the sea animals, including hand feeding some fish.",
          "Myself, my husband and our three children visited the Galway Aquarium in July. I wish we hadn't, the aquarium was very, very dated with very few species of sea-life there. There appeared to be very few staff also, a sign encouraged the children to ask a member of staff so that",
          "Brought our two, 3 & 1 yrs old here for World Oceans Day and had a brilliant couple of hours here, especially as they had loads of exhibitors/face painting/art for the day that was in it. My 3 yr old loved getting to hold the starfish and the staff, young guys didn't seem to",
          "this is a nice aquarium by the sea with great exhibits and they have put a lot of effort into it. it has it's own little car park which is great because the surrounding car parks get very busy. there is a real nice coffee shop connected to the aquarium and it's nice to call in",
          "Nice spot to spend couple hours especially if the weather is poorly. I have to agree with previous reviewer it does need an update. It is quite expensive for what it is but you can go in and out on the same ticket. A little cafe would be nice. Enjoyed the touch tanks especially",
          "It took us a couple of hours to tour the whole place, taking our time and enjoying each exhibit. Great for small children and adults who are into it! It was a bit small and a tad over priced but it was a nice time on a rainy day in Galway.",
          "Our kids love exploris in. Portaferry so we had to sample this. We got complementary tickets from our hotel, otherwise would have been quite pricey. The aquarium was bright and had a sufficiently different range of tanks and different take on the settings to interest and",
          "Staff was good. Exhibitions were ok. My 4 year old wanted more. Could use some updating considering the price.",
          "i travelled there last monday down from the north and have mixed feelings about the place. firstly, the actual aquarium is far to small and cramped to be holding the crowds that it is taking in and secondly i was very underwhelmed by the range of fish on display. The admission",
          "Galway Atlantqquaria is a wonderful facility right on the promenade in Salthill. It is not very big and there aren't any sharks or large fish to see, but the kids love it and the staff are very nice and friendly and let you watch them feeding the various feeds at different",
          "This a great way to spend a few hours on a wet day in Salthill but a bit pricey for the amount of time to spend here. Would have to agree with other reviewers about the same fish on display and I have been to better aquariums like Dingle and Lahinch. Its very interesting for",
          "Dark, dingy, minimal amount of common fish. Ridiculously over priced. Don't waste your time or believe the ads. And, if you are not from Ireland don't waste time with the tours. Those not from Ireland were laughing at how fast the guide spoke; none of us understood half of what",
          "Kids liked it after a while bored. We were there not even an hour was quite expensive for what it was and not much to see really. Mostly the same fish like plaice salmon etc... It was raining and most other things closed but still disappointed unfortunately.The gift shop is",
          "Before I came across it I had not heard of the Galway Atlantaquaria, so it was a very pleasant surprise to explore its broad and fascinating collection of sea creatures in a well set up, stocked and cared for zoo of the sea. OK it may not be squeaky clean, cutting edge and",
          "I really enjoyed my visit. The aquarium specialises in fish that you would find in the ocean on their doorstep, so it is a great insight into the local wildlife. The talks were very informative, staff obviously knew what they are talking about and enjoyed it too! There is a",
          "We were visiting Salt Hill on a cold and rainy day. The Atlantaquarian provided a few hours of pleasant diversion. Though not on a par with other aquariums I visited, this still allowed for some interesting viewing. Not something to go out of your way for, but enjoyable none the",
          "We went there last week and were very disappointed. For my partner and I it cost \u20ac23. It was dark, dirty and contained mostly skate,bass and trout. The tanks looked dirty and outdated. I say we were there for roughly fifteen minutes. Don't waste your money here. You could have a",
          "I was a bit bored on our visit. There really wasn't that much to see, and the information boards were not in intuitive places and the digital info boards kept stopping. Perhaps as a guided tour for the kids who got to touch crabs and starfish, but not too great for adults &",
          "I would not recommend this outing unless you have a child in tow. The entry fee was rather steep for what is housed there. BUT the fish feeding at 1 (freshwater fish) was very informative and fun for the 3.5 yr old and the grown ups.",
          "so disappointed - my own home tank is more interesting than this place which is way too expensive!!!!",
          "Not in the same class as Monteray (nor as bad a tourist trap as Atlanta, GA), this is not a must-see tourist site, unless you are a kid or just like sea life. Some very nice exhibits of both fresh and saltwater life, with some very large tanks, touch tanks for kids, and a good",
          "We timed it just right for the 11 am fish feeding, and had a virtually private tour of several of the tanks with the handler. The aquarium was nice and educational, and small enough to be seen slowly within an hour. Nice escape from the wind and rain!",
          "This aquarium has a small yet extensive range of aquatic specimens. We loved seeing the rays and flatfish.",
          "Travelled out to Salthill for a day during our visit as my friend is fond of animals. Was expensive for the amount to do in it and very little variety to observe. Was borderline disappointed.",
          "Loves this place full of intetesting fish and little areas like the submarine which i couldnt get my son out of, he loved it. We were there for feeding time and watched the woman go round with good, we got to touch the starfish etc. Quit\u00e9 pricey for the while we were there but",
          "This aquarium is really hands on for little visitors, my 3 loved petting the ray, picking up hermit crabs, picking up star fish and feeding the fish, they had to go back around twice in case they missed anything. Probably not the most amazing aquarium for adults but children",
          "This attraction looks very dated and neglected although some of the displays must, when new, have looked quite attractive. The biggest disappointment was that many of the displays were very poorly signposted or not signposted at all ... it would have been nice to have an",
          "We arrived just as the small fish were being fed and the staff member told the children lots of interesting facts about the different fish and my eldest son got to hold a starfish, he was delighted. Great family activity.",
          "You can do the aquarium easily in an hour. It is small. The kids really liked petting the sting rays.",
          "Spend a pleasant few hours here on a cold and windy day in Galway in March. It's certainly worth a visit.",
          "Brilliant for the whole family and i liked all the fish and disliked nothing im not into fish but still had a good timee",
          "Very overpriced for families bringing a few children I think adults should be free. Nice restaurant there.",
          "Yes its costed 12 euro each.... but we totally loved it....we landed about 12.30am so got to feed the fish upstairs and get told loads of interesting facts but the well versed staff member..... then it came to holding all the star fish and that just blew me away.... We where",
          "Nice aquarium to visit. Not the largest aquarium I've been to but it was a nice walk around. Seemed to be a great place for kids to visit. Check out the giant skeleton on the ceiling upstairs!",
          "I found it a little over priced for the visit, at \u20ac12 per adult, and then having to pay for any children over 2 it was a costly visit. We walked around it once, and left. You can touch some of the fish, and there are some interesting species.",
          "Arrived here at 2.45 just in time for the 3pm \"feeding time.\" The staff member was very informative and led us from tank to tank giving brief talks about the fish before feeding them and then on to the touch pools where kids and adults alike got to hold starfish, hermit crabs",
          "A very interesting and unique aquarium and make sure you arrive early afternoon as they feed the fish and you get a nice tour as well as kids can feed fish and hold a starfish! I would return again as a very good mix of interesting fish and information on them.",
          "Visited last March. Great aquarium. Enjoyed watching school groups interact with staff. My daughter loved being able to touch the fish",
          "Went there with a family. Everyone was very impressed. There's loads to see, a good bit of information also. The starfish section upstairs is nice because they let you hold them if you ask a member of staff. Kids and parents will love this or even just a couple on a stroll",
          "We were disappointed with the size and selection of fish. I appreciate that the fish on display were in keeping with the ones found locally but I'm not really interested in seeing Trout, Pike and Bass in a tank. Lots of the tanks upstairs were empty and the \"audio and visual\"",
          "This small aquarium is a gem. I found the entrance where the waves crashed onto the shore showing the life of fish at the tidal line to be very impressive and I have only seen this at a couple of U.S. aquariums. This place is focused on the sea life surrounding Ireland. It",
          "We really enjoyed the aquarium - our 15 month son had a great time running around the tanks. We particularly enjoyed the amount of open tanks. The staff were fantastic - really friendly and informative. Make sure you stay for the feeding sessions.",
          "This aquarium is rather small and unimpressive. The price (\u20ac11) is a bit high in my opinion. There's not really much else to say.",
          "we are so dissapointed with this place, over two weeks ago we have been there with our kids , our younger girl had accident over there , she cot her finger in the toilet door , we had to called the ambulance and she had done operation to safe her little finger in Galway",
          "Professional organised service for secondary school groups as part of the Geography Leaving Certificate Syllabus and K-12. It was like entering an episode of the magic school bus. Thank you Kevin.",
          "It was great to see all the native Irish fish. Freshwater and saltwater. A recommended place to visit. I also liked the small tropical section.",
          "I have not been to other aquariums yet so I can't really compare. I guess it's ok and I found it quite interesting.",
          "The pools/tanks are set up at kid-level and adults have an overhead view. This makes the entire aquarium accessible to all. And the fish are so friendly.",
          "situated just off the prom the atlantaquarium has someting to offer for all ages. you can get a quided tour of the aquarium of wander round as you please. I recommend the tour. For the kids there is a change to hold star fish and feed the fish. there is a gift shop, a coffee",
          "My daughter is fascinated by the animal kingdom and this was one of the highlights of her trip. The staff were all very helpful and she was able to get a close-up look at sea life she would never get to see at the aquariums near home.",
          "The children loved feeding the fish, The tour was very good and we did enjoy it. how ever it is overpriced and doesnt give discounts for special needs children or carers. paid 30 in for 2 adults and 2 children. wont be back. prices are far too high for such a small attraction.",
          "We stopped by the aquariam on an afternoon when we were just walking by the beach. It's kind of small and I thought a little expensive. The tanks are all small and the selection of fish was not really that expansive. If it's a rainy day (you are in Gallway so there's a real good",
          "really worth the money for two adults and a child aged 8 we paid 29euros. One member of staff fed the fish at three o clock but afterwards he had loads of time for all the kids who were there and took out crabs and starfish for them to hold, kids all seemed to have fun, plenty",
          "Surprisingly entertaining visit to the aquarium, especially the exhibits from the locality. Staff are brilliant,and are prepared for questions about any of the fish or shellfish,taking great patience with visiting children . Lovely way to spend a wet afternoon !",
          "I'm a marine biologist and as such I like to go and visit public aquariums around the world. I have seen many good and bad and excellent, and rich and poor aquariums. But NEVER had I seen an aquarium with so many mistakes in the panels! I found mistakes in the scientific names,",
          "Prepare for a splash on the way in, you might even get wet! It's a feature of the entrance special effects, to get your mind set on the watery creatures you are about to see. It's quite humid / damp inside so dress properly. Very enjoyable array of fish, sharks, stingray etc.",
          "My family & I visited on the off chance during a really wet day in Galway. We were pleasantly surprised by just how good this facility is! Although not in the league of some of the larger aquariaum's around Europe and in America, it was very good with a wide range of exhibits.",
          "Excellent place to go for adults and kids.Entrance fee allows you to come and go all day so you could take in a tour in the morning and go out for lunch and visit a playground and come back in the evening to catch a different tour.Make sure you do the Touch and feel tour as well",
          "Really enjoyable trip with 2 boys aged 11 and 14. Lots of interesting things to see but also depending on your patience loads of really amazing facts about sea life. Handling the crabs, feeding the fish etc was good fun and it wasn't crowded so easy to get your turn. A good",
          "Galway Atlantaquaria is a very good place to visit and its beside the sea! This is a great place to bring the kids and everyone else too i highly recommend this place!! (visited years ago not in 2012 like it says below)",
          "Brought a group of children here on a rainy day. It was just ok. The place looks run down even though its opened only a couple years. Comparing it to the Aquarium in Chicago its on a completely different planet!!!!",
          "The aquarium is small and cramped, when it's busy it's hard to get around. My kids had a good time though, they held starfish and rock crabs. If the kids get a little squirrly there is a park right next door to he aquarium that you can let them run off some energy in. As",
          "This place is well worth a visit, there is lots to see and the staff are great, they do tours and allow you to feed and handle the star fish and some of the smaller fish , great for the kids but also good fun for the adults",
          "I took my two young kids (both under 6). We enjoyed it but it was like 1 hour worth of fun... and we did spend time at the \"exhibits.\" It is quite small - and perhaps over-priced... Again, we had a good time, but there were like 2 people working. They advertise the touch pools",
          "Funny one has to hide from sunshine in Ireland buy it was the case on our trip. It was very hot and the sun was extremely strong. So we (a family with 3 kids ages 6, 4, and 2) decided to spend the morning there. We really enjoyed it! Well organized and full of interesting fish.",
          "The tanks are the perfect height for my 2 year old and he loved the fact he could touch the rays. we really enjoyed it but i do think the price is a bit steep given the limited number of exhibits and other experiences at other aquariums. It would be nice if there was a colouring",
          "This aquarium was very small by most standards but it was really hands on; we got to touch sting rays, sharks, starfish, crabs, etc. We also got to see the fish being fed which really brought them to live. A very worthwhile stop",
          "We arrived just in time to see the staff feeding the big fish. Was very informative. Favorite parts were definitely the splash tank, the ray tank and the touch pools. Great family day out!",
          "This aquarium is worth a visit if you're in the area, cost \u20ac18 for 1 adult + 1 child and only took us about 40 minutes to go around it all so not great value for money. There was a tour going on at the time so they are knowledgeable and staff friendly.",
          "I've only visited the aquarium twice andI must say that it's a lovely place to visit for adults as well as kids. There's great variety is fish to see and the although it's not very exotic the local element of it is quite charming. I saw kids petting star fish and there's also a",
          "My son and I have driven from Dublin several times to enjoy the aquarium here. This time, we brought my parents. We all had an amazing time. The staff here are to be complemented on their incredible warmth and patience with children, as well as the passion they exude for their",
          "Great way to pass an afternoon, there is something here for all ages. If in Salthill or Galway it is well worth a visit. Before goin check the website to see feeding times and you can join the staff as they feed the different fish allowing you to feed them also and hold some of",
          "Informative yet friendly and staff very happy to talk to you about the exhibits. You could spend a great many hours here as the more you look the more you see. If in the area do not miss this experience.",
          "Great for a rainy afternoon if you are stuck for somewhere to go with small kids. Fabulous array of fish and just love their gift store. Reasonably priced too and even if its not raining the beach is also directly across the road",
          "The fishes were delicious but there was no fries! We won't even mention the Tartar sauce!! No sweet potato fries for us!!!!",
          "Nothing special in my opinion. We thought it was going to be really big by the description, but is's very small, nothing exciting.",
          "We have visited the aquarium with our kids (aged 8, 5, 3). We all loved it. Family ticket cost us \u20ac34. After reading previous reviews I was a bit unsure if the place is really worth visiting, but now I can say for sure: it is. And I will return. The kids loved it. Touching the",
          "This is a great place for kids on a wet day. Although it is quite small, you can easily spend a couple of hours in it.",
          "The environment was very laid back because it isnt usually very busy, but the workers were very helpful. It was nice to be able to take your time through an aquarium unlike America",
          "I took a group of 23 children here, and all bar none had a tremendous time. They had a wonderfully friendly and patient instructor who was very informative and also allowed them alot of interaction with the different species. They got to hold a starfish and to feed some other",
          "Helps children of all ages appreciate the natural resources of the sea life all around us. On the way in to Salt Hill where children can then climb down to the sea and continue the discovery on their own.",
          "the price is very unreasonable for what they provided. The aquarium is very small and it's not worth the amount of money they ask. Get a coupon if you go.",
          "I had been to the Atlantaquaria before a few years ago but went this time for my sons birthday party. It was a great day. The tour guide showed us around all the exhibits and made the tour both fun and informative. He was friendly and great with the kids. The children loved",
          "we wanted to take our 5 year old daughter out for the day over the Easter holidays and as the weather had been so cold wanted somewhere indoors to visit, I had never been to atlantaquaria before and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was my daughter really enjoyed it and",
          "Very interactive, lots to see and feeding of some kind every hour. Quite smelly but you forget after a few minutes",
          "Went to the aquarium with the 2 kids and they had a ball! Great value family day out. The touch pool was the highlight for the children. They got to to touch star fish & crabs. The staff were very friendly & I would recommend a visit. All in all it was a fun day out!",
          "This has to be one of the most cleverly designed and laid out public aquaria I've ever been to. From the moment you enter the doors and are taken by suprise by the crashing waves of the eye-level tide pool you are fully immersed in the world of the undersea. The tour leads you",
          "I brought my 5 year old nephew to see the aquarium and I don't know which of us enjoyed it most! Lots to see and even i enjoyed the touch pool which you get to hold crabs and star fish among other sea life. Deceiving from the outside much larger and entertaining on the inside.",
          "Enjoyable hour walking around the aquarium. The guide at the 3pm feeding time was very informative and great with the kids. Cheaper outing for a family of 4 than an hours bowling!",
          "Went here after walking past it and decided to give it a shot. We weren't expecting anything great but we were so surprised! We visited at 3pm which is feeding time and it was really interesting seeing the different ways the fish ate and even fought over bits of food. Our guide",
          "My 9 year is here with me writing the review. He loved the flat fish and feeding and holding the star fish and crab. Staff were great with interesting facts",
          "Very nice way of killing a few hours, kids loved it and got really excited bout the different types of fish etc... Would recommend on a wet day to kill a few hours!",
          "this is brilliant. We went as a couple and really enjoyed it. During the day we were there, there was a lot of kids and they all were really excited and enjoying it. It is so clean and there is loads to see. There is also guided tours who tell you all about the fish. Great",
          "Really enjoyed visit with my family which included two kids aged 10 and 7. Especially enjoyed the staff who gave information talk while feeding the fish on second level. The staff was so enthusiastic that he had all the children's attention as well as adults. Kids especially",
          "I got a year membership and visit every couple of weeks with my toddler. 1-1.5 hours are enough to visit all but is perfec time for kids with little patience.",
          "Not the cheapest way to spend and hour - \u20ac29 for a day pass but in reality you probably won't spend more than an hour and a half. The tanks themselves were interesting with a mix of small to medium sized fish. Kids loved the opportunity of being able to hold spider crabs and",
          "Lovely for all age groups...it's well worth a visit and ideal for families too ESP with the wet climate!",
          "lovely day here. stayed to see the fish beedings and got to hold a crab.Staff very informed on all the fish",

          "Sunday, 28th of October turned out to be another miserable wet and windy day here in the wild west and although a trip to the National Aquarium of Ireland, Galway Atlantaquaria, had been on our 'to do' list for some time, today was the day we finally got round to the having a",
          "We took a group of children here on 2 different occasions. THEY LOVED IT!!! Fantastic variety of fish etc and there are lots of opportunities to interact with them. The staff are professional and lovely.",
          "There's a great selection of sea-life, most of it related to the nearby Atlantic Ocean. The kids really enjoy getting to pet the fish, hold crabs and starfish. Each time we go it's a different experience, but always interesting and enjoyable",
          "We were walking along the promenade and decided to visit on a whim. It is small but lovely, the tours the staff do are excellent for younger kids. Worth a visit",
          "Great place to bring your kids and have a nice day out. The staff love there jobs and it shows when you visit. The cost is slightly high but still worth it and if you have any money left don't forget the lighthouse gift shop for your souvenirs :)",
          "Well, I had never been in an aquarium before and I have really enjoyed to went there. The best part of visiting there is the pictures you can take. Also you can see a lot of fishes and aquatic's animals. It was really nice to see very close all of them. The funniest was see the",
          "Nice to see so many varieties of fish under one roof. Good that your admission ticket lasts all day but felt a little expensive.",
          "Fine for kids - and especially children's birthdays - they really do an excellent tour and food and the children love it (when they're young), but for adults there's not really that much here - especially if you've seen some of the major aquariums internationally. That said it's",
          "I went there with my mum and daughter,(4 years old) I have to say it is a great place to visit, we spent a good hour walking around and it was full of great fish and attractions. There is a cafe so you can have a coffee afterwards.",
          "We really enjoyed this aquarium and were fascinated to learn what is to be found in our waters. Our kids loved it, especially the large pool where the various rays come up to the surface and can be 'stroked' The staff were friendly and knowledgable. The price was what I would",
          "We are from Cork and there is no Aquarium here so my smallies were fascinated with this place - would definitely put it on my to do list again if we were to return to Galway on a family weekend, also a good place to walk the seafront in Salthill from.",
          "The aquarium might not be nicest and not the one with the most colorful fishes. This aquarium stands for an authentic presentation of what\u2019s out in the sea and best of all \u2013 there is a huge tank where you are allowed to touch the fishes; big fun not only for children.",
          "Quite a small aquarium but, a nice way to spent your day. Found it to be slightly expensive, \u20ac7 for students, myself and my boyfriend went. The aquarium would be more suitable for young children accompanied by a parent.",
          "Was there today with my little boy . Little did we realise that he is terrified of fish :) However for the adults I found it quiet enjoyable. With a great variety of fish to see Could do with a closure for a week and the tanks etc being scrubbed, stones and underwater displays",
          "great, not like at home you are allowed to touch some of the fish, very informative, loved the tiny sharks still in the sacks!",

          "Nice aquatic exhibition with various sections of see and river life. For such a small place had some very interesting exhibits from Ireland but also other places too. It will take you about an hour to tour everything so it can be included easily in a short visit to Galway.",

          "It's pretty small but the fact that the tanks are hip level was so cool. Alot of people on our tour were jealous that we got to go to this instead of the going on the extra that were part of our tour. We just walked from the town of Galway up to this area. It was amazing walking the beach area to come to this aquarium!",

Kids absolutely loved it, got to get up close and personal with the creatures and get hands on. Would have happily stayed longer if the kids could hack it. Gift shop needs actual aquarium-based gifts instead of the usual generic tat.",
          "Very different comparing with the places I visited in another country's.. Not big selection bet well organised.  Would like to get more information about fishes in the  aquarium. Nice to visit if you are in Galway. Good attraction to kids..",

So you can leave for a coffee and come back again if you miss the fish :) Staff is very friendly, they also have times for feeding fish so you can watch it and ask questions if you're interested. I recommend for a couple, friend or a family visit!",
          "Really nice aquarium - really diverse tanks and exhibits, lovely interactive sessions (eg.  Letting us a hold a spider crab and some starfish, as well as letting us feed the koi). Place is a little dark and outdated however - don't think it \u2026",

        "wiki": "Eyre Square (; Irish: An Fhaiche Mh\u00f3r, also known as John F. Kennedy Memorial Park) is an inner-city public park in Galway, Ireland. The park is within the city centre, adjoining the nearby shopping area of William Street and Shop Street.  Galway railway station is adjacent to Eyre Square.\nThe park is rectangular, surrounded on three sides by streets that form the major traffic arteries into Galway city centre; the west side of the square was pedestrianised in 2006.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin of the square comes from medieval open space in front of a town gate, known as the Green. Markets mostly took place in the northern part of the space. The earliest endeavour to formally enclose it was recorded in 1631. Some ash-trees were planted and the park was enclosed by a wooden fence. The plot of land that became Eyre Square was officially presented to the city in 1710 by Mayor Edward Eyre, from whom it took its name. In 1801, General Meyrick erected a stone wall around the square, which was later known as Meyrick Square. In the middle of the 19th century, the whole park underwent a redevelopment in Georgian style. In the 1960s, a full-scale reconstruction started and iron railings were removed and raised around the backyard of St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church.\nIn 1965, the square was officially renamed \"John F. Kennedy Memorial Park\" in honour of U.S. President John F. Kennedy; despite the renaming, the square is still widely known as Eyre Square. Kennedy had visited Galway city and made a speech in the square on 29 June 1963, the first U.S. president to do so during his term of office.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nA controversial and massively over-budget redevelopment of the square began in 2004. There was considerable unease in the city when it was reported that the original building contractors, Samuel Kingston Construction Ltd, had left the site and were not returning. After many long delays the square finally reopened on 13 April 2006 having astonishingly cost over \u20ac20 million to redevelop. Despite an unpopular reception by Galway natives, the finished square received the Irish Landscape Institute Design Award in 2007.\n\n\n== Occupy Galway ==\n\nEyre Square hosted the third longest Occupy Camp in the world, that ran for 216 days consecutively. A small group of concerned Galwegians came together in October 2011, inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement that had very quickly spread out across hundreds of cities in the U.S. and the E.U. The main aim was for regular people to set-up a base in their local areas, utilising public spaces to facilitate general assemblies, workshops and debates to discuss and try find solutions to alarming social injustices and lack of accountability amongst states and banking institutions.\nA mixed group volunteered their time to highlight the perceived wealth divide between those (the 1%) that helped create and profited from the bubble that caused the 2009 banking crash and the 99% that were forced to pay for it.\nThe camp was finally dismantled on 16 May 2013 when a team of local Garda and City Council officials arrived in the early hours to remove the occupiers and reclaim the corner of the square for the impending return of The Ocean Race to Galway.\nThe following year the occupiers held a one-day re-occupy event to mark the removal of the camp that featured a successful local media/billboard campaign to promote and highlight the event.\nThere have been no more Occupy Galway events since.\n\n\n== Statues and attractions ==\n\nBefore the most recent, controversial re-landscaping, the park used to house two large cast-iron cannons which were presented in recognition of the service of the Connaught Rangers, an Irish Regiment in the British Army, in the Crimean War. A statue of Irish language writer P\u00e1draic \u00d3 Conaire was erected in his memory in 1935. There is a portrait bust of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in the park, and a statue of Liam Mellows (1892\u20131992), a hero of the War of Independence, in the car park to the east of the Browne doorway.\nThe Browne doorway is also another attraction in Eyre Square; it was originally the doorway of the Browne family's home on Lower Abbeygate Street, but was moved in 1905 from Abbeygate Street to Eyre Square. Recently it has had to be shored up, buttressed and encased in plexiglass due to neglect. The name of the Browne family is also featured on one of the fourteen flags near the Browne doorway and the Quincentennial Fountain. These flags represent the Tribes of Galway (Treibheanna na Gaillimhe), fourteen merchant families who dominated the political, commercial, and social life of the city of Galway in western Ireland between the mid-13th and late 19th centuries.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEyre Square Shopping Centre Website\nVirtual picture of Eyre Square",

          "Galway is my favourite Irish city, and the square is a really nice focal point. There is no comparison between other Irish cities -from the pedestrianised streets, the cute, petite buildings and of course the almost village-esq qualities of Ayre square. Very pretty during the",

          "Went here for the first night of the Christmas markets and couldn't get over the gorgeous displays and all the stalls, Eyre square is unrecognizable with the lights and decorations and really started our Christmas preparation on a great note! Lots of nice restaurants, pubs and",

          "The only thing that makes this place interesting is the fact that John F. Kennedy gave a speech here in 1963 (this is why it's also called JFK Memorial Park). Other than this, it is a rather unimpressive spot, with a sculpture and a not particularly pretty park. It's okay for a",
          "As the title suggests. Very laid back area, used to chill out and is a focal and meeting point in the city",

          "Big large park in Galway city next to everything eat drink and a few beggars worth a visit for 10 minutes",
          "Really beautiful park but not so many attractions. It could be more develop in this area. But still worth the visit.",
          "Very green square in the centre of town. Despite being October there was plenty of vegetation and flowers looking healthy. Liked the plaque to President Kennedy, good location.",

          "After reading about this park, I was expecting quite the expansive green space. Instead, it was a much smaller park than I was expected and I did not think there was anything special about it. It is very easy to walk to other attractions from here and does not take long to get",

          "What a great spot in the centre of downtown. It's lovely and green with a few statues and memorials. We had to look to find the JFK Memorial, and finally located it. Very nice place to use as a meeting spot, or to hang out. We didn't walk through at night, but certainly",

          "After a stroll in Galway's old city it is worth a stop. The shopping center is close by. There are sitting places.",
          "The square is hardly an attraction in it self. It is a but of open space after the narrow streets of the town. It offers a piece of grass where you could have your picnic- but to the Galway people they would not be seen eating a picnic here. all you have is young people eating",
          "This is a rather bland, unattractive city park/square. Compared to many other cities similar public areas it is a disappointment. The old trees are beautiful but other than that it is just ok. The only time it looks impressive is when the xmas market is there.",
          "This is just a typical square where you can sit and rest and just watch people. It is famous in Galway with the Hooker Sculpture which is an iron statue representing the sails of Galway's fishing ships which were called hookers. There is also a bust of JFK who made a speech",

          "The park is right in the middle of the city and a good spot to pause. It's full of people and had statues and nice layout, but not something we would go to for its own sake. However, it is surrounded by pubs and central, so worth resting in of the weather permits.",

          "A nice place to sit and look at pretty flowers. Also a special tribute to President Kennedy on one side of the square is worth stopping by. It rained a lot while I was there so I didn't get to enjoy taking photos. It would pay to bring a raincoat, poncho, or umbrella just in",

          "My family and I visited Eyre sq and had a little sit down here to people watch. Lots of people coming and going but feels nice and relaxed at the same time. Worth a visit if your in galway city.",
          "Well we were expecting a lot more from Eyre Square. Yes, the whole surrounding area is brilliant but the square itself doesn't have much going for it. Its a breakaway area to sit and relax but as it's soo busy you can't really relax as crime is a little higher here. There was",

          "I remember Eyre Square when it was really a lovely little park in the centre of Galway. The statue of Padraic O'Connaire has been removed (I know the yobs defaced it). There is a fountain supposedly depicting the Galway hookers (rusty bits of scrap) and the Browne doorway",
          "Following getting an ice cream at Gino's and a coffee from a random caf\u00e9, me and my friends headed here to chill out in the summer sun. With every sort of a personality floating by, you're guaranteed to enjoy people watching at its best. The beautiful red sculpture in the",
          "Doesn't take long to get there from Quay Street and it doesn't require a great deal of time to take it in if you don't want it to. Kind of cool that the flags flying represent the 14 original tribes of Galway... another part of their history! Also artifact of the Browne family",
          "This is located right downtown. A great spot for people watching. There are several points of interest in the square. Well worth seeing",
          "All roads lead here, and if they don't you don't need to be on them. This is a small town Times Square without all of the big store commercialism. Just walk and watch the show.",
          "Great atmosphere. Lovely friendly people. Plenty of shops restaurants and hotels . Very tidy and clean. Well looked after",
          "The active \u201ccentral park\u201d of Galway. A great place for a stroll, to lay on the grass, or to just sit and watch people. A small monument to John F. Kennedy is located midway along one side of the square, commemorating the speech he made while visiting Galway as president. If",
          "Nice square and well looked after. It's in the centre of Galway so it's easy to use to navigate yourself around the city. Only bad think is the odd professional Romanian beggars and alcoholic street drinks hanging about.",
          "Lovely midtown space with well-kept lawns & garden borders. Great place to chill and watch people and listen to some street musicians.",
          "This square is not worth seeing. There is not much there. If you go early in the morning, you will see trash everywhere and people sleeping there. Do no use the public restrooms which you have to pay t use. They are disgusting.",
          "Around the block from the tourist Office which is across the street from the Go Bus Terminal. It is surrounded by picturesque streets near the pedestrian only area of Galway.",
          "If you arrive by train or bus, you can enter the town through Eyre Square. It is a nice park space, with families and children about. Any riff raff are well behaved, and will stay to their canned pints. The park is green, clean, and well maintained. It's a nice, welcoming",
          "This would be a nice place to sit for a while if it were not for the homeless families that seem to be living there in their sleeping bags and waiting for handouts from tourists.",
          "This is a place where people gather when the weather is good and that is the way it was on my visit. It is very clean and surrounded by a multitude of shops, hotels and restuarants. The people of Galway are very friendly and this created a great atmosphere around the square.",
          "This is a nice park in the middle of the city. Has a sculpture to remember the old hooker ship and also has part of the old Browne house. There is a small monument to commerate JFK's speech there.",

          "Great place to walk around or sit and people watch. Lots of interesting groups of people as well lol.",
          "Once you get to Eyre Square, you are an easy walk from anything you would need. O'Connels Pub on the Square is fabulous.",

          "This was a great spot to watch the locals tramp around. Lots of activity and in the central part of the area. Nice carousel in the evening and lots of small entertainers doing their thing during the day. Easy access to lots of great restaurants around the square.",
          "If you arrive in Galway by train or by bus you'll be close to Eyre Square and it will be one of your first views of Galway. A park is, of course, very weather dependent. On my recent trip I was lucky and the sun was shining brightly although it was quite cold. Certainly the cold",
          "What A Lovely Place A Great Buss Lots Of Entertainment Have A Nice Pint A Coffee Mingle With The The Crows And Have A Freindley Chat",
          "We stopped through Gallway on a planned trip and the roads and shops were both packed and hectic. However, the Eyre Square was a very nice and relaxed place to spend some time. The weather was nice so it was very pleasant.",
          "The best city in Ireland and probably you could argue the best city in the world. Most certainly it's up there with the nicest places to visit. The night life is out of this world and when it's a hot summers day without question it's the place to be .",
          "Great central location in Galway! Lovely park, hub of activity, people watching! Any time, day or night!",
          "Not barn burner, sun out, so Lot's of sun worship going on, lots of shopping opportunities abound, few sculpture,statues, and bums around the many tourists awaiting their buses, watch out don't step in it",
          "A very lovely place to stroll around and take in the history and culture. My sister and I walked through here most every day and even 2 evenings. We always felt safe and saw no issues with petty theft/crime like you do in most major cities.",

          "Eyre square is right in the midst of everything that is going on in Galway. You can meet up with friends here while you relax.",
          "This is where all the people gather. There is a beautiful little park in the center of Eyre Square, surrounded by Shopping centre, pubs and places to eat. Lots of people walking through the park, some lying around sunbathing, others sitting down watching all the activity or",
          "Away from the bustling Latin quarter and Quay Street,but still only a few minutes walk away. Ideal location to meet up and plan your next adventure. From here you are ideally located. You are 10 minutes away from everything in Galways centre. Nice open space. Bus station. Taxi's.",
          "Lovely local historical place, interesting features. Will defo visit again ...really enjoyed it thanks",
          "This area is getting worse every summer. The guards never stop any antisocial behaviour or move them on. Ive never had many issues but if you are easily intimidated don't hang around here alone. I see new addicts begging all the time.",
          "If you are staying in Galway I highly recommend the hotels that are around Eyre Square. This was such a nice park and so convienient for us. It allowed us easy access to the tour bus stations, excellent food options, and handy Pharmacy and Grocery stores for quick fill ups.",
          "We stayed nearby in the Meyrick Hotel, so we had to walk through the park to get to the shops. The old reminent of the wall was there to see as was an interesting piece of artwork which might have represented sails. You could catch a ride in a horse-drawn cart.",
          "Lovely place, lots of pubs, shops and caf\u00e9s. Some street entertainment. All within walking distance!",
          "Eyre square is just as it says a square in the middle of a city where the buses seem to run from. It has a small park but nothing exciting.",
          "Eyre Square is best avoided. Nothing other than a square in town. Neglected - no sign of any effort to keep clean, make it a nice place to gather - half hearted effort at few flowers - very overrated - as is Galway City itself. Generally found it to be dirty and drab. Unless you",
          "The one way system runs round the Square. Some nice trees and planting. Refugees making a fire for the night. Some art to read and admire. Probably better when it's warmer.",
          "Wonderful walking square. Ideal for people watching. Ideal for respite care before tackling the next bout of drinking! 'So much to see and read' You cannot be serious. An installation that would shame a first year Fine Arts student. Still a great place on a sunny day!",
          "Eyre Square is a pretty great landmark if you need to meet someone, and there's a nice park around it - it's lovely to sit around on summery days.",
          "Really cool area to check out. Great vibe, lots of pubs, tons of options for eating, drinking shopping. Just know lots of shopping closes down early before 9pm and some cases 6. Pubs and restaurants are another thing. Parking is though, but there are car parks. Just be mindful",
          "Wonderful walking square. So much to see and read. These streets are so easy to walk and navigate. If you are close by give it a look",
          "Just a public space in the middle of Galway's busy shopping area. Nice for a break and breather before heading back into the busy streets.",
          "The shopping center is cleverly designed to blend in with the surrounding storefronts. The energy is lively and positive, and the selection of shops is impressive for such a small center.",
          "It was neat to see the old wall from the Norman's. We parked near here and walked around from this area. Daffidils were in bloom. Very pretty.",
          "Lots of shopping and dining options surround Eyre Square, though the square itself is pretty basic. A great spot to people watch with a takeaway coffee.",
          "every square is a lovely buzzy place full of vibrant people and colours it's a happy place full of music sutable for all ages my hole family love it",
          "I would rate this square as average compared to other city squares. It was neat and clean, with an abundance of cafes and shopping around the perimeter. There is a free walking tour that leaves from an adjacent hotel, Google \"Shamrock Walking Tour Galway\". This tour gives",
          "This is not a location where I felt relaxed as there is an abundance of \"vagabond\" types whose company I would wish to avoid. No shortage of litter to trip you up. I would recommend that you avoid.",
          "Eyre Square is a lovely stop as you're walking around Galway's center and the adjoining pedestrian zone (Shop Street). There are a number of interesting sculptures related to Galway's historical background and a visit from President John F. Kennedy in 1963. The landscaping is",
          "Located in the heart of Galway. Lots of shops to look in this historic part of town, very friendly pubs to choose from, warm coffee shops. There are a few hotels also located in the area. It's a great place to start in Galway, order a pint of Guiness, warm chips and watch the",
          "It was a wet day but people ignore it and still enjoy Galway. The streets off Eyre square are great for browsing. Lots of shops and browsing.",
          "We have been here before but we're here today to watch the St. Patrick's Day parade. It was a great time - rain and wind not withstanding. It is a wonderful place to walk about and kept very clean! Hope to visit it in sunshine before my holiday is over!",
          "This square is always very busy with cars and busses next to it. When the sun shines it is nice to sit down somewhere, but otherwise it is not worth visiting it. You will cross it anyway when you are going to town.",
          "It's a sad indictment of people's behaviour that the lovely historical architectural feature Brown Door is now surrounded by a dirty Perspex screen to prevent people damaging the structure - or themselves - by climbing on it or covering it in graffiti. Another sadness is the",
          "looking around the square all you could see was tourists every where. good directions in full view, very clean and easy to cross with the lights. A lot of shops close by",

          "i visited the Eyre square twice within a week and enjoyed the experience of shopping and walking around the square. The people are friendly and the little shops and pubs are worth watching.",
          "The Eyre Sq is possible your most spectacular and full of history, enjoy the walk to close by shops restaurants.",
          "We had our taxi drop us off in the square. Its artsy with lots of stores and pubs around. Looks like it would be a cool spot to chill and people watch on a nice day but it was raining and windy so we didn't hang around long.",
          "Eyre square is the centre of everything. It's beautiful throughout the seasons and in the summertime you will see young and old enjoying the park. They could be sunbathing walking sitting having a coffee and just watching the world go by. There are all the facilities you require",
          "Plenty of shopping and entertainment here in Eyre Square. Everything is easy to access. Nice for tourists or locals.",
          "Eyre square is a lovely place to sit and relax whilst being at the heart of Galway city.Hard to miss this place.",
          "Eyre Square is the crossroads of Galway city. The buses, locals, and tourists pass through and around it. It is great for people watching. It is also the place for political protest. By chance, we happened to be there when there was a large memorial for those killed in an",
          "Eyre Square is located a couple blocks past Quay Street, if you just keep walking straight, and it's a nice park that's worth the stop. It's lined with pubs, stores and hotels and is pretty central in the city. It's a good place to end a walk, to sit down on a bench and",
          "This area was buzzing with shoppers and others who were just enjoying a nice December evening in Galway. The decorations and surrounding shops, booths, and such were worth seeing.",
          "This is a fabulous place to visit any time of the year. Great atmosphere great people great places to go. The Christmas market is a must see not as good as Prague or Berlin but definitely still worth a visit . I can highly recommend eyre square .",
          "We had a wonderful time wandering the stalls of the Christmas Market last week. Shout out to the Man of Arn and Provencal stalls, as well as to the biergarten! Wonderful ride on the ferris wheel!",
          "The Galway Christmas Market has been going a few years and getting bigger and better every year. Until now 2016! Someone somewhere in their wisdom decided that the Christmas Market could no longer be situated on the grass of Eyre Sq where it has been on previous years. No",
          "Visited the Christmas market there this week, very pretty with a lot of variety in terms of food stalls.",
          "Lovely and vibrant. Great Christmas lights and would visit just to see the street entertainers alone. Right next to Christmas market and ferris wheel.",
          "Central hub in Galway City but not especially nice. Usually full of traffic by day and drunk revellers by night looking for taxis home after a night on the batter. All you get is fast food rubbish and sick. Galway is fantastic, Eyre Square is not.",
          "Its a really active and awesome place. Lots of fun things to do. Never bored. Always go there and the atmosphere is fun",
          "A little bit of everything all together in one high selection good atmosphere with a fabulous irish twist",
          "It's a good landmark for Galway. I'm not sure there's much of a draw there unless you're grabbing coffee, or lunch. Maybe sitting outside on a patio for a beer somewhere, it might orovide good people watching. I will say I was there during the Xmas Market time, and it was dumped",
          "A very lively place to visit anytime, but enjoyed the added attractions of the Christmas Markets with loads of food stalls, fair ground rides etc.",
          "This is a regular meeting place for tourists to see and spend time relaxing on a sunny day. The area has many shops bars and restaurants around it, you can have picnic or just sit outside at one of the pubs and enjoy the atmosphere day and night. The only eye sore is the piece",
          "It is basically a thoroughfare. Nothing much to see. The JFK monument is small, and takes about 30 seconds to see fully. Would prefer the walk by the bay, as opposed to this busy square.",
          "A walk through Eyre Square will show you within seconds how multi-cultured and diverse Galway and Ireland have become. It is always alive with a wonderful atmosphere. And, in fairness to Galway County Council, it's always kept prestine and looking it's best.",
          "Truly the center square of Galway - something always seemed to be happening. People hanging out, chatting, music performers, having a bite, watching the tour groups come through. Nice atmosphere.",
          "Really nice spot to have a break and chill out from touring the city. Lots of seating and a good buzz around.",
          "This is definitely the downtown area. It's surrounded by shops and local pubs. Everyone is so friendly!",
          "Popular meeting place. Short walk to major attractions like, the Spanish arch,the dock,s area,Galway cathedral,Salthill promenade. The side streets of Eyre square offer bars with great craic and great value cafes.",
          "Eyer square/Galway I fell in lovely with this place when I visited over the summer, from the moment I arrived I felt like I was home. The pace of life in Galway is so relaxed and the people are very welcoming. I love it. If my job wasn't in Tipperary I'd be gone and living the",
          "We stayed on the square, we walked through here the two days we were here and in the evening to get something to eat.",
          "We went to Ireland in September/October, 2016 and spent 4 days in Galway City. This was a large square on the advent of the shopping area which was truly neat. The square itself had benches and steps where people could congregate. It also appeared to be an area where there",
          "We walked past it many times over a two day period while exploring Galway city. We tried to like it but there just didn't seem to be anything there. At night it even seemed like a place to avoid.",

          "The park is directly across the street from our hotel and we walked past and through it on the way downtown. Its nice, well laid out, but as a site to see or visit, I wouldn't put it on my to visit list",

          "Galway is a fun little town for a day or two. After the busy Latin Quarter you might wanna relax a bit. The Eyre Square is an option for that with its green lawns. It is surrounded by streets with various shops and food options, if you need any of that. The square itself is",

          "This is just a small centrally located park that most people use for a short cut. Saw lots of skateboarders having fun. I guess if you want to sit on some green grass with a picnic or something it would be okay but be careful which way the wind is blowing since the pay toilets",

          "This is a lively and fun place to go if you want to be entertained. There are many pubs,cafes and restaurants in Eyre Square. It is lively during the day too with people shopping, site seeing, drinking and eating. The cafes and restaurants are warm and friendly and the people",
          "I visited Galway in February and I have to say this town was dead. I didn't see many people on the streets but maybe because it was very cold. The town itself is really cute and I am sad I only had a day trip and wished I could stay longer. Have to go back in Summer!",
          "now this was a surprise,you had street performers everywhere,so while my wife went shopping i sat and watched the performers we had fire acts,singers,magic tricks and mime acts.great day relaxing.",

          "After the drive into the city we parked near the Square and it a good place to stretch the legs, get orientated to the area and if inclined to pick up the hop on hop off tour. A good way to get a sense of the area. Hope off when you're ready to walk around the area.",
          "I loved the atmosphere of the place. People chatting, children playing around. It's a great part of the city. Nice and pleasant.",
          "This is where we found money machines, food, shopping, crowds and music on the street. It is the starting place for Galway's night life.",

          "This is a tranquil space to start your exploration of the rest of the city center. It is nothing outstanding, but the lovely roses being lovingly planted show the pride taken in upkeep. Best of all, it is a great place to stay oriented. It is busy because of the bus stop.",
          "Eyre Square has lost some of its charm from years ago - lots of construction and congestion with some panhandlers.",
          "Wasn't quite as square as I thought it would be, more rectangular if you ask me....but despite it's disappointing oblongness it's actually pretty nice. Four stars.",
          "Eyre Square is a lovely place to visit lovely shops and plenty of places to eat. Very friendly people and always seems to be busy.",
          "Our bus from the hotel dropped us off here. It is quite convenient for the town centre and there are benches to sit on, public art to enjoy and shops all around the edge of the square.",
          "Stayed Friday & Saturday night the noise was unreal asked the porter could they turn it down but told the manager has said to keep it up loud & until after 1am. We were on the second floor and had to be up at 5am. Hotel is dated ideal for maybe a stag or hen. Will never return",
          "Our grandkids were playing on the playground and one of the locals struck up a conversation with us. Beautiful surroundings to people watch! Great place to visit when in Galway!",

          "Juggelers, tipsy people, tourists make up the crowd and its a great place as a centre to go to and return to as taxis are nearby. The grasswas all fenced off, maybe they yhought we brought goats or sheep!",
          "A must see/visit when in Galway. The atmosphere and energy of the Square is contagious. You can't help to have craic and not want to leave. Street performers singing and playing music is fantastic. I hated to leave after two nights.",
          "I stayed in a hotel just off this square. Very convenient location. Lots of pubs and hostels and hotels and restaurants. Not far from the Latin Quarter and main shopping streets. One nice thing about lodging on or near the square is the proximity to both local and long distance",
          "We came here after dinner. Very nice area with lots of young people, shops, and restaurants/ bars. Noisy and fun. Go a little bit further to check out the river, which can be a nice place for a picnic or a date/romantic walk.",
          "Given it's location near the bus and train station and that several walking tours leave from here, you'll probably end up here sooner or later. It's nice enough and even pretty on a good day, but you probably won't linger unless there's a special event. Might be worth a quick",
          "Eyre Square is an area of green to walk through to get from one place to another, which we did many times during our stay in Galway. Often we noticed pot-smokers liked to hang here. All of the green is boarded off with moveable metal guardrails. I guess this spot is notable",
          "If there isn't a lot of activity in the Square just walk done the road and you will meet buskers, street entertainers. Assortment of stalls around the square. Sometimes like yesterday live entertainment in Eyre Square musicians and a Pipe Band entertained for a while. You",
          "No problem finding a souvenir here, lots of choices. There are also lots of restaurants and pubs too.",
          "Center of Galway green space. Some statuses and displays with a performance venue. All the grass is fenced off, not very attractive.",
          "Such a disappointment for the main square of Galway. The first space you see when you exit the bus or train station and it is just grass with pathways through to the main Shop street. It used to have railings surrounding and a statue with character- all gone now. The historical",
          "Was there on St. Patrick's day - nice and relaxed crowd, good music, lots of fun. I really hope to be back again! :)",
          "This is a small and crowd square we have been to many times during our week long stay. In my understanding, it was a an important historic site. You may stop or pass by it quite easily, when you visit other spots in downtown areas, or when you try to find one of interesting",
          "It was just a nice place to see. There are flags behind it and it represents all the different clans around Ireland. The clans would meet in Galway to discuss their course of action against the Vikings. The memorial is different but has a nice peaceful feel to it. The grass is",
          "There were some shops to look at and some restaurants to get something to eat but the grassy park area wasn't anything special. I did like all the flags lining the streets.",
          "The grass is ruined. There's a bunch of rubbish around the place. For a central place in Galway it's a dump.",
          "Nice to see. Great place to meet. Close to everything. Go to the information office and book a tour. The city tour is totally worth going on. The history very interesting.",
          "Eyre has a distinct lack of seats to sit and watch the world go by. There is not really much to see here as it is just a middle sized gardens where President Kennedy once gave a speech. There are many bus stops and the City Tour Bus stops at the top end.",
          "Nothing to see here but one of the doors from an original tribe, this is where Kennedy spoke, it's a park in the middle of town, nothing special, and not very pretty",
          "This square has lovely green space but it was all fenced off during my visit. Some benches are available to sit, but not many. There is a large piece of art in the square but not much else. The square is a thoroughfare from the train/bus station to the main shopping streets.",
          "It was OK nothing exceptional but I like that it was in fact shaped like a square I do appreciate that",
          "A busy, bustling square which is always worth walking through day or night. It's always full of travellers and quaint locals. And there's usually music or other attractions in it. There are lots of hotels, pubs and restaurants leading off the square. An interesting place",
          "I've always loved Galway.The city is brilliant for Couples,Family,Business and Lads weekends.Galway has a lot to offer,plenty of bars,hotels and sights to see.Eyre Square is the centre of it all.",
          "Galway by definition is a lovely chilled and laid back place, and no part is more chilled that eyre square. Just lay out and watch the world go by.",
          "The square as such is nothing to write home about, but in a nice day you will see all the locals gathering around, reading, playing music, juggling, skating. Best to stay away from it at night on the weekends though. It's not dangerous but you might find a lot of drunk people",
          "The place is sort of a leading square from the hotel and business area to the POIs. Nothing much to see about it just a small green plaza where you can relax and have a bite actually, nothing more",
          "This is a very nice center point to meet up, since it is center for the bus traffic to and from other locations",
          "Not much of a square....but it IS where all the transportation elements connect! Locals hang out and sun there, but frankly not worth the walk to \"see\" it",
          "I strongly suspect that, whatever else they may or may not know about Galway City, very many people will at least have heard about this centrally-located Landmark - surely, \"right in the heart of Galway\" ? For whatever reason, some things seem to last a long time : to-day's",
          "Visited square Monday 30 May Great weather but grass all sectioned off with metal dividers Must b missing something",
          "It is a lovely square but why every time you go to Galway they always seem to do it up on May 25th barriers were everywhere hard to go through it special in a wheelchair as my friend was",
          "This is a great central location in Galway. It has restaurants and hotels surrounding it. During different days there are events held in the square. You you walk all a lot of attractions form this central location. The bus stops just next to the square.",
          "During our stay in Galway we found 'all roads lead to Eyre Square' Some interesting landmarks here. Starting point for the Hop on Hop off bus. Tourist information also.",
          "A combination of unsavories and people just hanging out. Green space to enjoy downtime until the next adventure.",
          "Central to Galway. Grass, sculpture, historic store front, walls and steps for seating, and a stream of people walking by. In the spring sunshine, it is great.",
          "A lovely square that borders the Merrick Hotel/Bus-Train Stn, Shopping Center, JFK memorial, corner entrance to Latin Quarter, and street line restaurants and businesses. Also, many hotels and tour offices at nearby streets.",
          "Great central place to meet people. Close to train and bus stations. Lots of pubs, shops and restaurants.",
          "This park is always so busy, it's great to pick up a take away and eat in the park (weather permitting) and watch the world go by. It's just a very interesting place with the old city wall and the tribal flags, and the impressive meyrick hotel overlooking the park.",
          "It's a grassed area in galway that's is dire need of updating, It has had millions of euros thrown at it with what seems like no ideas at all. if you like underage drinking in the summer months this is the place for you. there are a couple of rundown statues about the place. not",
          "This once elegant high railing enclosed Eyre Square has been desecrated for decades since the visit of John F. Kennedy. The latest incarnation costs many millions and is still terrible.",
          "Eyre Square is in fact a postage stamp compared to other world city parks, yet it's pleasant with places to sit and watch the people go by. It's sorely lacking in shelter from the elements. A bandstand with perhaps free outdoor music occasionally would be an idea.",
          "It is an amazing spot your central, great during the summer if we get the weather to sit out and let time tick by, some fantastic art structures. Wouldn't be overly keen walking through at night alone.",
          "Nothing beats this place for sitting out in the sun,enjoying the view while having lunch,except maybe a pint in O'Connell's pub beer garden across the road!",
          "Except from a rich cultural history, for example parts of the original Galway wall within the eyre square centre, the square are a vibrant place full of live. Well worth a visit!",
          "Visited here with the family a bout a year ago. Unfortunately it wasa wet weekend abd didnt get much of a chance to view the square other than running throught it in the rain. If in galway then do visit.",
          "When the sun is shining, i like to go to Eyre square and sit on the grass and read a book, lovely atmosphere and many others do the same. Many shops close, and I also like to walk down shop street, its a lovely feeling",
          "Eyre square was just 50 meters from our hotel in Galway. It an open space surrounded on all sides by four busy and noises roads, there is a large metal sculpture in the centre. In the central area where it is paved youths were throwing balls about, also several youths were",
          "Once, Eyre Square was well worth a visit anytime you were in Galway, now you are greeted by a fountain that is rarely on, a rust covered sculpture, a green area that gets destroyed every year by the Christmas fair and water stained walls turning the white marble black and green.",
          "This is a lovely area in the city, combining the marriage stones, the flags of the tribes and JFK tribute show the rich and entwined history of Galway city",
          "It seems impossible in hindsight but after a two night stay in Galway I almost missed Shop Street which is very close to the Square.",
          "Eyre Square is a block or so from the train station and is the easiest way to figure out the lay of the land. There are hotels, shops and restaurants on the perimeter. We saw lots of teenagers making use of the park area in the spring sun.",
          "I really liked Eyre Square. Galway has a lovely pedestrian-only shopping quarter and the square is just on the edge - so park, wander around and do some shopping, and then settle down in the park for a few minutes to chill.",
          "we walked around the Eyre as part of our tour. it was a gathering place for tourists and locals. most vibrant part of this beautiful city. must visit.",
          "A great way to spend time in Galway's city center area. Lots of local color, people-watching, local musicians, etc. Lots of places to eat, have coffee and/or just relax.",
          "Nice lawn area for enjoying a sunny day. Plenty of benches and walls for sitting. Toilets and tourist information available.",
          "Galway is a fantastic small city - full of young people who seem to be artistic and musical. There is music in the streets; free concerts everywhere. Galway is a \"walking city\" with an international mixture of people, both visitors and residents. Eyre Square, where JFK",
          "This is a nice park that is centrally located in Galway. It is home to the JFK monument commemorating his visit to Ireland in 1963. There is a monument to the \"Hooker\" a small boat that is typical of the fishing boats used in Galway Bay. There are also other monuments such as",
          "Small piece of green relief in the city, nothing spectacular. My experience was marred by the guy who was begging for change, claiming to be homeless, adding 'have a heart'. Really???!!! Perhaps he should give up smoking!",
          "This is a central square in Galway. It's surrounded by pubs and shops. There is also a shopping center / mall entrance. The central bus station is very close by. The large tourist office (hard to find) is about 1 block from the square.",
          "Large square in central Galway not far from bus and rail station. Some pubs and cafes around it and a pedestrian area in the middle. Couple of statues and a large window that is all that's leftover from an old house they have preserved.",
          "I walked thru the park on the way to dinner. There is green grass, a few flower beds with some flowers, and 14 or so flags at one end of the park. It is just one block by one block big. It had just rained, so not many people were hanging around; most were walking thru.",
          "Relaxing park area to be in with a coffee if the weather isn't too cold. Many cute cafes surround and easy to get to from bus, train or anything as it is central.",
          "My second trip there this St Pats week and I love it more than ever! Plenty of sightseeing in and around here, plenty of FAB pubs and food, great shopping -- just a beautiful, fun place! Festivals galore! Irish music everywhere! You might even meet \"The Jockey\", an Irish",
          "Eyre has so many places to eat in. I do not drink at all but there are so many really nice little cafes to have a cup of tea and a sandwich in. When I was there the weather was not great but what the hell!",
          "I always make a visit to Eyre square when in Galway it's a great place just to sit on the grass and watch the world go by.there was a small number of buskers in and around which added to the atmosphere and a small children's park has been added since the last time I was there",
          "Eyre Square is an attractive area in the centre of Galway and is an ideal place to relax on a sunny afternoon",
          "Eyre Square looks very tired and untidy. I remember it from years ago where it was a nice place to sit and rest. This time lots of litter and the whole area looked miserable. Sort it out council, get it back to bring nice again",
          "Although I had been here before a few years back I made a point of jogging around and through Eyre Square during a recent visit. Its a standard town square if you will and a great spot to meet pals if your in town as it is so central.",
          "First came here in 2003 when Eyre Square was mostly grassed. Since then it's been pedestrianised and for me seems to have lost a bit of character. Ongoing works by the city to turn it into something special.",
          "For the heart and soul focus of a city such as Galway, this comes across as a big disappointment. The grass areas iare not maintained, the pathways are featureless, and there is nothing to focus on. You just pass through it. It is a big enough area to have a bustlying sense to",
          "If you happen to be walking past its a good place to sit, but it's nothing special. Large metal sculpture and the 12 tribal flags are interesting to look at, but I would not make a special trip to see it",
          "The best I can say about this square is that it needs a good hosing! It's dirty and looks unkept. I couldn't take a photo of the JFK monument as someone had urinated on it! Yuk.",
          "You will enjoy it. It's pretty center located. All the roads go there and most of the buses stop here. You can enjoy sitting and eating on the grass or walking around. All the must-see places are so near.",
          "Eyre Square was given a complete make over about five years ago. However, the square has all the same problems it had before the overhaul. The grass looks untidy. There does not appear to be any purpose to the square. it is not visually attractive. It is a place to walk over",
          "Unexpectedly found the shopping center by accidentally turning down an alleyway, and was amazed to see medieval city walls within the heart of the mall. Great little shops too!",
          "A park in the middle of town. Relaxing people watching and a good coffee shop to the east side of the park. Nice place to visit, but wouldn't want to live there. :-)",
          "Being here from Tuesday till Thursday. Found the area was dirty and with out any planning. The grass in square was mostly muck. Also the rusty centre piece is dull and boring. This place should be like if not better than St. Stephens green Dublin. It's meant to be a centre",
          "Thanks to Eyre Square I was less lost in beautiful Galway. Thank you, Eyre Square for all you did for me!",
          "Everything you'll need in this area and just a lovely area to walk . People are friendly and helpful. The Meyrick is a lovely hotel in this area. You can pop in for a lovely tea or bowl of soup served to you.",
          "This is the place to start many tours of the city, and central to most shopping/dining options in the area.",
          "Has lots to offer any tourist. Hotels, Bars and restaraunt surround the square with a large green grassed area to sit when the weather is good. Buses drop you off on one side of the square. All the shops are a short walk, as is the famous shop street.",
          "If you are looking for a place to rest your head, or have a coffee, do lunch or dinner and later have a few drinks with friends and enjoy some traditional music, you only have to be in and around Eyre square. ~All paths to shopping also lead off it. Brillant.",
          "This is probably quite an important landmark. But it's February and nothing much is here. I don't like the art and the old door is poorly displayed. There is no reason to come here. Perhaps it gets more interesting in the summer.",
          "Once you arrive in Eyre Square, it feels so relaxing, Galway may have the title of a city, but the peolpe and the facility to get from shop to shop is cultural, you feel as if you havent left your own town,but you will soon relaise you are in Eyre Square once the night life",
          "Eyre square is in the middle of everything in Galway. Great collection of music, people watching and shopping. This is a must see when in Galway",

On occasions it is translated as \"stranger\" or \"from across the sea\".  The name states that this family were \"importers\" and were the lords, and dominant sept of Clan Fergail.In the twelfth century the O'Hallorans were chiefs of twenty-four town lands of the t\u00faath of Clan Fergail. These lay east to the river of Galmith (or \"Galway\"). In the 13th century the O'Hallorans were dispossessed of their ancient inheritance of Clan Fergail by the \"De Burgos\" (Burke) invaders. The O'Hallorans and the O'Flahertys were obliged to emigrate to Iar (west) Connaught, where they built the castle of O'Hery.The motto of the Galway family is Clann Fearghaile Ab\u00fa, which comes from their dynastic name.\nName Variations include: O'Halleron, Halloran, Holloran, Haloran, and in Gaelic, \u00d3 hAllmhur\u00e1in or  \u00d3 hAllur\u00e1in)\n\n\n== People ==\nBarry O'Halloran, Irish journalist\nBrian O'Halloran, American actor\nDavid O'Halloran, Australian Rules footballer\nDustin O'Halloran, American pianist and composer\nGreg O'Halloran, Irish footballer\nHal O'Halloran, American radio announcer and singer\nJack O'Halloran, American boxer and actor\nJames O'Halloran, Canadian lawyer and politician\nJoseph O'Halloran, Major-General\nKay O'Halloran, Australian-born academic\nKeith O'Halloran, Irish footballer\nKevin O'Halloran (1937\u20131976), Australian swimmer\nKevin O'Halloran (footballer) (1915\u20131976), Australian Rules footballer\nMark O'Halloran, Australian Rugby League player\nMark O'Halloran, Irish actor and screenwriter\nMichael O'Halloran, English politician\nMichael O'Halloran, Scottish footballer\nMick O'Halloran, Australian politician\nSharyn O'Halloran, Professor of Political Economics at Columbia University\nStephen O'Halloran, footballer\nSylvester O'Halloran, doctor\nThomas O'Halloran, Australian rules footballer from New Zealand\nThomas Shuldham O'Halloran, first Police Commissioner and first Police Magistrate of South Australia\nThomas Shuldham O'Halloran KC, South Australian lawyer and Australian rules football administrator\nWilliam Littlejohn O'Halloran (1806\u20131885), British Army officer and public servant in South Australia\n\n\n== Places ==\nO'Halloran Hill, South Australia\nHalloran Springs, California, a US community in the Mojave Desert\nHalloran Summit, California, a location 5 miles (8.0 km) east of Halloran Springs, California\n\n\n== See also ==\nCrichaireacht cinedach nduchasa Muintiri Murchada\nHalloran (disambiguation)\n\n\n== References ==",

          "While not the most spectacular attraction, this is still impressive and worth the time if you are in Galway. Only takes minutes to soak up the history presented. It is the earliest surviving settlement structure within the medieval walls of Galway. It is also important to note",
          "It\u2019s an interesting place to stop by, but don\u2019t make a big deal about planning for it. You\u2019ll spend 5 minutes max here. It\u2019s a unique piece of history and the story behind discovering it is fun, but there isn\u2019t much else to it.",
          "I sought this out but even I with all my inrterest in archaeology thought this was amazingly well and expensively protected but is basically a set of foundations of a hall. Not terribly interesting - gave it 5 minutes.",
          "We woke up early on Monday, (before 10 AM). and not many things in the town were open...except for this! It's an interesting place, but very small. We saw the whole thing in 15 minutes.",
          "Congratulations to Galway City for this innovative way to explore their history. The glass panels let this site be seen 24/7. You can see the original Hal of the Red Earl illustrated on a City map of Galway printed in 1651. I wonder if the masonry work of today will last",
          "I stumbled upon these ruins whilst on a walking tour of the city of Galway. They are small and hidden away down a side street. Worth a couple of minutes.",
          "We stumbled about the Hall of the Red Earl while walking around the Latin Quarter in the evening. Alas, it was closed, and we never made it back during opening hours, but the glass walls which allow for viewing, along with descriptive plaques, make it a decent place to take a",
          "Maybe if I did a lot of research, I might have discovered the Hall of the Red Earl before arriving in Galway but instead we saw the interesting street sign Druid Lane and decided to turn left. Voila, we could easily see the site from outside an attractive glass wall and setup.",
          "Was closed when I arrived but no problem; you can see it all from the street: all windows. Interesting and a quick stop.",
          "While this is interesting it is more of interesting from the standpoint of what Galway is doing to preserve history. This is located off the beaten path slightly and was more of a curiosity item for me. One can see most of the dig site from the alleyway as it is not that",
          "Amazing to see these ruins of the oldest building in Galway and how the powers to be have incorporated it into their modern buildings. Easily accessed and worth stopping by for a few minutes as it is free",
          "When strolling through Galway\u2019s \u201cFrench Quarter\u201d you will find this interesting medieval archeological site in the middle of Galway\u2019s lively present. Worth seeing!",
          "Read about this sight in Rich Steve\u2019s guidebook and it was well worth the time and effort! The cost is right as it is free and the small sight gives you a glimpse into the past of The rulers of Galway! Recommended particularly for history buffs such as myself!",
          "This location shows the old remains of the city buildings from hundreds and hundreds of years ago. Interesting to see. Only takes a few minutes to visit. No tour. No cost. It\u2019s not really even a building. Just a preserved area to walk through. We just walked up to it and looked",
          "The Hall of the Red Earl is an archaeological excavation, clearly visible from Druid's Lane. It has an explanation about the site clearly visible through the glass. The Earl was a medieval lord, the site dates from the 13th century. We found it by accident when were looking for",
          "Found this only because we had the Rick Steve\u2019s guide book and were following the walking tour in it. It is a real archeological excavation made open to the public. Takes 5-10 minutes to walk through but is a fascinating glimpse of medieval Galway presrved beneath a modern",
          "Its great that there are places in the city that are free for tourists and I especially like this one. All the staff are Volunteers with a passion. Recommended.",
          "Just a little piece of history off the main street, doesn't take more than five minutes to see and read the billboards but it's free so nothing to moan about",
          "In the pedestrian quarter, on a little pedestrian side street off busy Quay Street, this glass-fronted archaeological excavation is exposed for you to walk around and into. The documentation posters and 1651 city map lay it out well. [Going to the Galway City Museum afterwards",
          "The Hall of the Red Earl is interesting if you happen to be nearby. We were right around the corner and, although it was closed when we were there, you can still look through the glass and see the remnants of this Medieval building. I wouldn\u2019t walk across town for it but if",
          "If you have ever dreamed of being Indiana Jones this is the place to see a real archaeological dig site. Kids will enjoy this one as well. While not as big as one would hope, this is a realistic site and very educational.",
          "We stopped here as we were exploring the city of Galway. The site is small and self guided but it gives you a good perspective on the history and development of the city. The displays help to bring to life the Hall of the Red Earl and a few relics recovered are also on display.",
          "This archaeological site has been significantly upgraded, with interesting sign boards describing the history, the architecture, and even the way the Government building was redesigned to allow this find to be displayed. We were fortunate to be met by a local guide who gave us a",
          "Interesting to see some of the old city and the artifacts found when digging. Nicely displayed and you can see some of it from the street as walls are glass from the outside - something different and we did not pay to go in.",
          "A quick activity just off the Main Street. Just a walk through piece of archaeology. Let's you see relics from the past.",
          "I was literally here for like five minutes. This place was kind of difficult to find and when I found it, it was a bit of a let down. It's cool that a medieval hall was found but it's small and no kind of history or information is listed.",
          "A very small but interesting museum and remains of a medieval hall. There is a viewing window if the museum is closed . Worth a look will only take 10mins to go around.",
          "The museum was closed but because it\u2019s surrounded in glass windows you can see in and view all the stones from the dig - I just wish there was a way to get the history on this place when the museum is closed.",
          "If it's closed, you can still see it through the glass. With such an imposing name, we expected something more significant. That said, it's free. It will take about 5 minutes to walk through and around. There are things you can read about, but you may be better off looking",
          "Though this excavation site you can learn about the history of the development of Galway. Very small. Won''t take that much time, but it is worth a stop to look in and see the history. It is right in the latin quarter.",
          "Unfortunately, this was most disappointing and will occupy 5 minutes of your time. the unearthed foundations/ruins of the Red Earls Hall were discovered in 1997 and are glass enclosed in a carpark. This family (de Burgo, now known as Burke/Bourke in Ireland today) were Fench",
          "We were walking by and happened upon this site. It was closed for the day, but from the outside you could see the site through the glass walls at street level. It wasn't very big, but the placards tell the story of the site.",
          "We stopped by this excavation site to take a look at what was discovered. There is no fee to enter the area which is protected from the elements on 3 sides and above. There is a sign to explain the history of the hall which goes back to the 13th century.",
          "Very small exhibit that can look closed when you walk by it. It's literally an excavation site under a municipal building. Don't need to budget much time at all but it was interesting and free.",
          "It is an archaeological site showing the foundations of Galway's oldest building from the 13th century. although it is in the center of town, it is down a small street so you have to know where to look. Fortunately, we were with a tour guide. It was just a fast stop and a photo",
          "A local told us about this excavated ruin. Walking toward the bay through the midieval quarter walk down the narrow Druid Lance to your left. You might easily walk past so look for the Coffeewerks yellow coffee shop on the right as a marker (great coffee by the way). The",
          "We stumbled upon this hall more than anything, but we were really glad we did - it's free, and one of the people who worked there came and gave us a tour of the site. It is a small site, but the tour guide was able to use it to open up a conversation about the history of Galway",
          "Not a massive site but probably worth a visit nonetheless. Like having a nosey at this type of thing trying to image what things were like for the people back in the day. No doubt it was grim but they didn't know anything else I suppose",
          "Interesting free exhibit in the center of Galway. If you are in the Latin Quarter, definitely worth a look. Entrance is free, and it only takes a few minutes to look around.",
          "Maybe in our haste I missed it, but we walked past with our tour group, stepped inside and saw some rock piles. I didn't see an exhibit or a docent or anything - just rocks",
          "This preserved archaeological site located under a modern building has some descriptive panels and maps so you can see what it is, but there was also a man who introduced himself as the guide to the site and gave us much more information. He was not dressed in anything other",
          "In the middle of the old city, down what looks like an alley, under a modern government building (the Customs House) there is an archeological site revealing the foundation of a Medieval building, the Hall of the Red Earl, one of Galway's aristocratic lords from the 13th",
          "Probably important historically, but there isn't that much to see. Yet it couldn't drop in here just before getting a pint on shop street.",
          "Right off the main tourist area, this is well worth the visit. It only takes a few minutes (maybe 10-15). On a small side street so not horribly obvious.",
          "A great place to stop off as you wander the mediaeval streets of Galway. A well presented, free archaeological site that gives a view of the original city layout.",
          "There aren't many places where you can see the original footprint the Norman invaders left! If you've got any sense of history or culture, this nicely preserved site is the perfect place to reflect on the invasion of Connaught and the establishment of a walled city on what was",
          "You only need spend 10 minutes here but it was nice that something so interesting was free to the public, we literally just wandered in off the street and took a couple of photos !",
          "Excavation area of the hall. Steps away from the main pedestrian strip. Interesting look into medieval Galway. Worth the few minutes it takes to check it out.",
          "We stopped in on our way to wander the town and I was delighted to engage in conversation with a gentleman who was the representative of the museum. He was very knowledgeable, answering questions about the site, the history of Galway and how and why so little of its early days",
          "Wonderful Medieval Hall of the Red Earl and of the famous Druid lane. The old walls of Galway and the could be the oldest but this is a great visit.",
          "You'd walk by the place and never know it was there. In prepping for a new building extension, workers found the remains of an old customs house. Instead of destroying it, they built over it, preserving the ruin beneath. It is small, but definitely take advantage of the OPW",
          "I rate this average because there is not much to it, but it is interesting and quick to see (5-10 minutes) while you are in the center of Galway. Mainly just foundations of the Hall is what you will see. it's FREE.",
          "Lots of interesting history in this small exhibit. Gave a good insight into early days in Galway City when it was a commercial center for sea traffic.",
          "lots of interesting artifacts on display, fortunate to meet a guide with brilliant knowledge of area and displays",
          "This little glass set of windows into the past is an interesting and thought provoking space. You actually can see how few feet are the difference between current day development and ancient history. The hall itself is also a window into how much smaller a large building was",
          "Not really worth going out of your way for, but if you're in the area, a quick 5 minute detour is totally worth it just to see what people dug up right in the middle of the city.",
          "The Hall of The Red Earl is absolutely fascinating for archaeologists like me, but also to anyone with a passion for history. I went on a very pouring rain/stormy day and i had the place to myself (apart from one very discreet staff member working in the adjacent office space),",
          "We turned the corner and there it was! An open excavation set up for viewing! We learned a little bit about what Galway was like in the 1600's.",
          "This was the best 'cheap' find of the trip...really cool history on a lot of levels and really accessible for thios on Quay st.",
          "Always worth a visit. See the foundations of Galway over 300 years ago. Very well preserved, great layout with very good inforrmation provided on posters. Good enen on a wed day as you are viewing from inside the building.",
          "We stumbled across this while walking around Galway and were fascinated by the discovery. While we were admiring and reading the plaques, a helpful and knowledgable lady came out to explain the ruins and answer our questions. We were very grateful for her coming out into the",
          "Kids interested and some very old exhibits here. The excavations of the old city are very cool - and the information boards are useful and well presented.",
          "Every trip to Ireland must involve a pub and a plate of Fish & Chips. I had a couple of these along the way, and I would rate Hall of the Red Earl's as very good. It was a typically super crowded holiday week day that we visited, but service was still very attentive. Enjoyed our",
          "We had seen the reviews for this place and so we decided to go looking for it. We really did stumble upon it, as it is on a quiet side street. There is a very nice guide who tells you about the find and then they let you walk right down by the ruins! We really enjoyed it!",
          "we went to Galway on saturday for a bit of culture and some fine dining all 18 of us went to see this old site and it was very interesting we were expertly told every thing about it by a very well informed young man so pleasant and his name was Don-nah it is well worth a",
          "Building ruins from the 1200's, medieval archaeology! Linked to one of the founding family's of Galway this is not to be missed. Admission is free.",
          "I really enjoyed walking around this exhibit. It was on a side street (off of Shop/Quay Street) and you could get up close to these ruins. It's amazing that something like this is surrounded by modern buildings. So glad it was preserved. Definitley worth a visit and should only",

          "We walked Druid lane every day, passing by this attraction, and finally stopped in. Nice little treat and historically interesting. There was an office next to it with a couple of ladies to explain the history and you could walk into the bottom of the exhibit to see it all.",
          "AS excavations go, I was very impressed with this. Some places you can't really see what you are looking at and the info is not great, but here it was clear and very interesting, with all the information you need clearly in view. Well worth a visit for those of you interested",
          "Worth a visit, but don't structure a visit round this. The ruins cover no more than a couple of rooms, and the exhibits are fine, but mostly replicas of household objects. I'm a nerd for history, but honestly it is scant. It's free, and you can (if you're a fast reader) be done",

          "Absolutely loved the presentation of these architectural remains, the explanations on the walls, items they have dug out, and just the really great way they built a modern building over it without disturbing the archeology. If you come to Galway, visit this place, it's worth it.",
          "Not far from shop street. Tucked in underneath new buildings, this ruin is great to see for a unique look at what was there once.",
          "Visited in July 2014. Our guide Kevin brought the whole place to life and, as it was quiet that morning, gave us an extended account of Galway history. Now I walk through the city and see things I'd never noticed before. Many thanks, belatedly, for a very interesting tour.",
          "Fabulous site but we were very disappointed that we could not look around it properly on the sunday. I suggest that it is open seven days a week or else information boards about the sight are placed oputside so people can read about the site.",

        "wiki": "The Aran Islands (Irish: Oile\u00e1in \u00c1rann\u2014pronunciation: [\u0259\u02c8l\u02b2\u0251\u02d0n\u02b2 \u02c8\u0251\u02d0\u027e\u0259n]) or The Arans (na h\u00c1rainneacha\u2014[n\u0259 \u02c8h\u0251\u02d0\u027e\u0259n\u02b2\u0259x\u0259]) are a group of three islands located at the mouth of Galway Bay, on the west coast of Ireland, with a total area of about 46 km2 (18 sq mi). They constitute the barony of Aran in County Galway, Ireland.\nFrom west to east the islands are: Inishmore (\u00c1rainn Mh\u00f3r/Inis M\u00f3r\u2014[\u02c8\u0251\u02d0\u027e\u0259n\u02b2 wo\u02d0\u027e] or [\u02c8\u026an\u02b2\u026a\u0283 mo\u02d0\u027e]), the largest; Inishmaan (Inis Me\u00e1in/Inis Meadh\u00f3in\u2014[\u02c8\u026an\u02b2\u026a\u0283 m\u02b2\u0251\u02d0n\u02b2]), the second-largest; and Inisheer (Inis Thiar/Inis O\u00edrr/Inis Oirthir\u2014[\u02c8\u026an\u02b2\u026a\u0283 hi\u0259\u027e / i\u02d0\u027e\u02b2 / \u02c8\u025b\u027e\u02b2h\u026a\u027e\u02b2]), the smallest.\nThe 1,200 inhabitants primarily speak Irish, the language used in local placenames. Most islanders are also fluent in English. The islands belong to the Gaeltacht.\n\n\n== Location and access ==\nThe approaches to the bay between the Aran Islands and the mainland are as follows:\n\nNorth Sound / An S\u00fanda \u00f3 Thuaidh (more accurately Bealach Locha Lurgan) lies between Inishmore and Lettermullen, County Galway.\nGregory's Sound / S\u00fanda Ghr\u00edogh\u00f3ra (formerly known as Bealach na h-\u00c1ite) lies between Inishmore and Inishmaan.\nFoul Sound / An S\u00fanda Salach (formerly known as Bealach na Fearbhaighe) lies between Inishmaan and Inisheer.\nSouth Sound / An S\u00fanda \u00f3 Dheas (formerly known as Bealach na F\u00ednnise) lies between Inisheer and County Clare.\nFerries operate to all three islands from Rossaveal in Co. Galway (year round) and Doolin in Co. Clare (seasonal). Flights operated by Aer Arann Islands also operate from Inverin.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLittle is known about the first inhabitants to cross over to the islands, but it is likely that they came across in search of a safe haven from attack. The Islands are made up of Carboniferous limestone and do not have naturally occurring topsoil. Early settlers augmented the soil with seaweed and sand from the shore. Drystone walls were built to protect the soil. There are seven prehistoric stone forts on the islands. D\u00fan Aonghasa on Inishmore, dates back to 1100 BC.Enda of Aran founded the Killeany monastery in Inishmore, AD 490. It became a center of learning, piety, and asceticism. Also on Inishmore is Tempull Breccain, the 5th century Church of Saint Brecan. A ringfort on Inisheer, called D\u00fan Formna became the site of a castle built by the O'Briens around the 14th century. Cromwell's soldiers destroyed the castle and all but two of the seven churches established by Brecan.\nThe typical settlement was a Clachan, a scattered cluster of small single-story cottages with a thatched roof. Typical clothing for an Aran man was homespun trousers and waistcoats made of grey or light brown tweed; for women, a calf-length woven skirt along with a knitted sweater. Aran knitters were highly skilled. In the 1820s, harvesting kelp was an important sideline to raise money for the land rents. Salvaging flotsam often produced wood for building and fuel.In 1898, John Millington Synge started spending his summers in the Aran Islands. His 1904 play, Riders to the Sea is set on Inishmaan. He published The Aran Islands in 1907, based on his journals. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe islands' geology is mainly karst limestone, related to the Burren in County Clare (to the east), not the granites of Connemara to the north. This is most obvious in the construction of the walls around the fields.\nThe limestones date from the Vis\u00e9an age of the Lower Carboniferous, formed as sediments in a tropical sea approximately 350 million years ago, and compressed into horizontal strata with fossil corals, crinoids, sea urchins, and ammonites. Glaciation following the Namurian facilitated greater denudation. The result is that the Aran Islands are one of the finest examples of a Glacio-Karst landscape in the world. The effects of the last glacial period (the Midlandian) are most in evidence, with the islands overrun by ice during this glaciation. The impact of earlier karstification (solutional erosion) has been eliminated by the last glacial period. Any karstification now seen dates from approximately 11,000 years ago and the island karst is thus recent.\nSolutional processes have widened and deepened the grykes of the limestone pavement. Pre-existing lines of weakness in the rock (vertical joints) contribute to the formation of extensive fissures separated by clints (flat pavement like slabs). The rock karstification facilitates the formation of subterranean drainage.\nHuge boulders up to 25 metres (80 ft) above the sea at parts of the west facing cliffs are in some cases an extreme form of storm beach, cast there by giant waves that occur on average once per century, though more are glacial erratics.\n\n\n== Climate and agriculture ==\nThe islands have an unusually temperate climate. Average air temperatures range from 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F) in July to 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F) in January. The soil temperature does not usually drop below 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F) (the winter of 2010 recorded a prolonged period of snow, the first in living memory). Since grass will grow once the temperature rises above 6 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F), this means that the island (like the neighbouring Burren) has one of the longest growing seasons in Ireland or Britain, and supports diverse and rich plant growth. Late May is the sunniest time and also likely the best time to view flowers, with the gentians and avens peaking (but orchid species blooming later).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nThe islands supports arctic, Mediterranean and alpine plants side-by-side, due to the unusual environment. Like the Burren, the Aran islands are renowned for their remarkable assemblage of plants and animals.The grikes (crevices) provide moist shelter, thus supporting a wide range of plants including dwarf shrubs. Where the surface of the pavement is shattered into gravel, many of the hardier Arctic or alpine plants can be found. But when the limestone pavement is covered by a thin layer of soil, patches of grass are seen, interspersed with plants like the gentian and orchids.\nNotable insects present include the butterfly the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), brown hairstreak (Thecla betulae), marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) and wood white (Leptidea sinapis); the moths, the burren green (Calamia tridens), Irish annulet (Odontognophos dumetata) and transparent burnet (Zygaena purpuralis); and the hoverfly Doros profuges.\n\n\n== Traditional life and Irish language ==\n\nOn the cliff tops, ancient forts such as D\u00fan Aonghasa (D\u00fan Aengus) on Inishm\u00f3r and D\u00fan Chonch\u00fair (Fort of Conchobar) on Inishmaan are some of the oldest archaeological remains in Ireland. A lacework of ancient stone walls across all three islands (1,600 km or 1,000 mi in all) encloses networks of small fields to contain local livestock. Also found are early cloch\u00e1ns (dry-stone beehive huts from the early-Christian period). Enda of Aran founded the first true Irish monastery near Killeany (Cill \u00c9inne or Church of Enda). In time there were a dozen monasteries on Inishm\u00f3r alone. Many Irish saints had some connection with Aran: St. Brendan was blessed for his voyage there; Jarlath of Tuam, Finnian of Clonard, and St. Columba called it the \"Sun of the West\". In total, there are 38 national monuments on the Aran Islands.\nThe islands were first populated in larger numbers probably at the time of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in the mid-17th century, when the Catholic population of Ireland had the choice of going \"to hell or to Connacht\".  Many fled to the numerous islands off the west coast of Ireland where they adapted themselves to the raw climatic conditions, developing a survival system of total self-sufficiency. Their methods included mixing layers of sand and seaweed on top of rocks to create fertile soil, a technique used to grow potatoes and other vegetables. The same seaweed method also provided grazing grass within stone-wall enclosures for cattle and sheep,  which in turn provided wool and yarn to make handwoven trousers, skirts and jackets, hand-knitted sweaters, shawls, caps, and hide shoes. The islanders also constructed unique boats for fishing, building their thatched cottages from the materials available or trading with the mainland.\nThe Aran Islands are an official Gaeltacht, which gives full official status to Irish as the medium of all official services including education. An unusually high rate of Irish-language monolingualism was found among senior natives until the end of the 20th century, in large part because of the isolating nature of the traditional trades practised and the natural isolation of the islands in general from mainland Ireland over the course of the Islands' history.  Young Islanders can take their leaving examination at 18 on the islands and then most leave for third level education. Many blame the decline of Irish-speaking among young members of the island community on English-language television, available since the 1960s; furthermore, many younger islanders leave for the mainland when they come of age.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nYear-round ferry passenger services exist. Aran Island Ferries operate a year-round service from Rossaveal in County Galway, connected by a bus service from Galway city. A heavy cargo service operates several times a week from Galway Harbour, and is operated by Lasta Mara.Aer Arann Islands operates an air service from Inverin to Inishmore Airport which has a connecting bus from Galway city. The airline announced that it would cease all flights in December 2018, but an agreement was reached to continue the service until 30 September 2019.Ferries are also available to the Aran Islands from Doolin in County Clare (Seasonal 1 April \u2013 31 October).\nA road network exists on each of the islands and a speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour (31 miles per hour) applies. Cars on the islands are exempt from road-worthiness testing. Most visitors to the island hire bikes as it is the most convenient way to see the islands.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n\n=== Visitors and attractions ===\n\nVisitors come in large numbers, particularly in the summer time. There are several Bronze Age and Iron Age forts and attractions on the islands:\n\nDun Aengus (D\u00fan Aonghasa, Aran Islands Dialect: d\u016bn a\u014bg\u0259s) is a Bronze Age and Iron Age fort on the edge of a 100 metres (330 ft) cliff overlooking the Atlantic Ocean on Inishmore. It consists of a series of concentric circular walls.  The innermost\u2014the citadel\u2014encloses an area approximately 50 metres (160 feet) in diameter with 4-metre (13-foot) thick walls of stone.\nBlack Fort (D\u00fan D\u00fachathair)\nO'Brien's Castle on Inis O\u00edrr in the Aran Islands was built in the 14th century. The castle was taken from the O'Briens by the O'Flaherty clan of Connemara in 1582.\nTeampull Bhean\u00e1in is considered the smallest church in the world and is notable for its orientation: north\u2013south instead of east\u2013west.\nTeampall an Cheathrair \u00c1lainn has a holy well which inspired J. M. Synge's play The Well of the Saints.\n\n\n== Arts ==\n\n\n=== Local artists ===\nOne of the major figures of the Irish Renaissance, Liam O'Flaherty, was born in Gort na gCapall, Inishmore, on 28 August 1896. M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 D\u00edre\u00e1in, one of the most eminent poets in the Irish language, was also from Inishmore. Since the year 2000, \u00c1ras \u00c9anna Arts Centre, Inisheer has been welcoming Artists in Residence both local and international to stay and work on the inspirational Aran Islands for periods of one month. Cl\u00edodhna Lyons, born on the islands, is an Irish cartoonist, animator and printmaker who has created several comics and zines and is now a director for Brown Bag Films.\n\n\n=== Visiting artists ===\n\nThe islands have had an influence on world literature and arts disproportionate to their size. From 1908, Harry Clarke spent a number of weeks each summer for six years on Inis O\u00edrr, accompanied by friends and his future wife, Margaret Clarke (artist). Sketches by and of Clarke exist from these trips, regarded as formative in his upbringing as they marked the first occasions in which it was necessary for the artist to convalesce off the mainland of Ireland.\nThe unusual cultural and physical history of the islands has made them the object of visits by a variety of writers and travellers who recorded their experiences. Beginning around the late 19th century, many Irish writers travelled to the Aran Islands; Lady Gregory, for example, came to Aran in the late nineteenth century to learn Irish. At the start of the 20th century and throughout his life one of Ireland's leading artists, Se\u00e1n Keating, spent time every year on the islands translating on to canvas all the qualities that make the inhabitants of these Atlantic Islands so unusual and in many respects remarkable. Elizabeth Rivers moved from London and lived in Aran where she created two books of art and was herself visited by artists such as Basil Rakoczi.\nMany wrote of their experiences in a personal vein, alternately casting them as narratives about finding, or failing to find, some essential aspect of Irish culture that had been lost to the more urban regions of Ireland. A second, related kind of visitor were those who attempted to collect and catalogue the stories and folklore of the island, treating it as a kind of societal \"time capsule\" of an earlier stage of Irish culture. Visitors of this kind differed in their desires to integrate with the island culture, and most were content to be considered observers. The culmination of this mode of interacting with the island might well be Robert J. Flaherty's 1934 classic documentary Man of Aran.\nOne might consider John Millington Synge's The Aran Islands as a work that straddles these first two modes, it being both a personal account and also an attempt at preserving information about the pre- (or a-) literate Aran culture in literary form. The motivations of these visitors are exemplified by W. B. Yeats' advice to Synge: \"Go to the Aran Islands, and find a life that has never been expressed in literature.\"In the second half of the twentieth century, up until perhaps the early 1970s, one sees a third kind of visitor to the islands. These visitors came not necessarily because of the uniquely \"Irish\" nature of the island community, but simply because the accidents of geography and history conspired to produce a society that some found intriguing or even beguiling and that they wished to participate in directly. At no time was there a single \"Aran\" culture: any description is necessarily incomplete and can be said to apply completely only to parts of the island at certain points in time. However, visitors that came and stayed were mainly attracted to aspects of Aran culture such as:\n\nIsolated from mainstream print and electronic media, and thus reliant primarily on local oral tradition for both entertainment and news.\nRarely visited or understood by outsiders.\nStrongly influenced in its traditions and attitudes by the unusually savage weather of Galway Bay.\nIn many parts characterised by subsistence, or near-subsistence, farming and fishing.\nAdapted to the absence of luxuries that many parts of the Western world had enjoyed for decades and in some cases, centuries.For these reasons, the Aran Islands were \"decoupled\" from cultural developments that were at the same time radically changing other parts of Ireland and Western Europe. Though visitors of this third kind understood that the culture they encountered was intimately connected to that of Ireland, they were not particularly inclined to interpret their experience as that of \"Irishness\". Instead, they looked directly towards ways in which their time on the islands put them in touch with more general truths about life and human relations, and they often took pains to live \"as an islander\", eschewing help from friends and family at home. Indeed, because of the difficult conditions they found\u2014dangerous weather, scarce food\u2014they sometimes had little time to investigate the culture in the more detached manner of earlier visitors. Their writings are often of a more personal nature, being concerned with understanding the author's self as much as the culture around him.\nThis third mode of being in Aran died out in the late 1970s due in part to the increased tourist traffic and in part to technological improvements made to the island, that relegated the above aspects to history. A literary product of this third kind of visitor is An Aran Keening, by Andrew McNeillie, who spent a year on Aran in 1968. Another, P\u00e1draig \u00d3 S\u00edoch\u00e1in, a Dublin author and lawyer, learning to speak Gaelic to the fluency of an islander became inextricably linked to the Aran handknitters and their Aran Sweaters, extensively promoting their popularity and sale around the world for nearly forty years.\nA fourth kind of visitor to the islands, still prominent today, comes for spiritual reasons often connected to an appreciation for Celtic Christianity or more modern New Age beliefs, the former of which finds sites and landscapes of importance on the islands. Finally, there are many thousands of visitors who come for broadly touristic reasons: to see the ruins, hear Irish spoken (and Irish music played) in the few pubs on the island, and to experience the often awe-inspiring geology of cliffs. Tourists today far outnumber visitors of the four kinds discussed above. Tourists and visitors of the fourth kind, however, are under-represented as creators of literature or art directly connected to the island; there are few ordinary \"travelogues\" of note, perhaps because of the small size of the islands, and there are no personal accounts written about Aran that are primarily concerned with spirituality. Tim Robinson's Stones of Aran: Pilgrimage (1986) and Stones of Aran: Labyrinth (1995), and his accompanying detailed map of the islands, are another resource on the Aran Islands. Robinson's work is an exhaustive, but not exhausting, survey of the Aran geography and its influence on Aran culture from the Iron Age up to recent times. Robinson also has written, and continues to write, about the Connemara region that faces the Aran Islands on the Galway mainland.\n\n\n== Island crafts ==\n\n\n=== Aran Island sweater ===\n\nThe islands are the home of the Aran sweater, which gained worldwide appeal during the course of the 20th century.Many of the sweaters sold in the islands are made elsewhere in Ireland.\n\n\n=== Aran currach ===\nThe (modern) Aran version of the lightweight boat called the currach (Aran Islands Dialect: k\u00f8r\u0259x, kor\u0259x) is made from canvas stretched over a sparse skeleton of thin laths, then covered in tar.  It is designed to withstand the very rough seas that are typical of islands that face the open Atlantic.  Indeed, it is said that the Aran fishermen would not learn to swim, since they would certainly not survive any sea that swamped a currach and so it would be better to drown quickly. Despite the undoubted strength of these boats, they are very vulnerable to puncture.\nThe islanders were always totally self-sufficient. In calmer weather the currachs would go out and spend the night fishing under the Cliffs of Moher, returning after dawn full with fish. Nowadays they are only used inshore, tending lobster-pots. More modern versions are still built for racing at the many local regattas, or \"Cruinnithe\" up and down the west coast of Ireland during the summer months.\nConventional shoes cannot be worn, so the fishermen wear soft calf-skin moccasins called pampooties, made of goatskin or cowskin.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSome of the limestone sea cliffs have attracted interest from rock-climbers.GAA sports such as Gaelic Football, hurling and Irish Handball are the islands' main sports.\nAs well as that the annual Red Bull cliff diving world championships are held on Inis m\u00f3r every year.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nJohn Millington Synge (J.M. Synge) wrote a book-length journal, The Aran Islands,  completed in 1901 and published in 1907.\nThe Aran Islands are mentioned in James Joyce's short story \"The Dead\" (1914) as a place where native Irish is spoken.\nThe 1934 documentary film Man of Aran.\nGilbert B\u00e9caud's 2-act opera L'Op\u00e9ra d'Aran (1962) features a plot taking place on the Aran Islands.\nSeamus Heaney's first book of poems, Death of a Naturalist (1966), contains a poem entitled \"Lovers on Aran\".\nThe 1984 hit song \"The Riddle\" by Nik Kershaw includes the line, \"Near a tree by a river there's a hole in the ground where an old man of Aran goes around and around.\" The writer, however, is on record as having said that he simply made this up; it does not actually refer to anything connected with the Aran Islands.\nThe Aran Islands featured in the television comedy Father Ted from 1995 to 1998, set on the fictional Craggy Island, with real local sights such as the shipwreck of the steam trawler Plassey in the opening sequence. The island of Inishmore hosted a Friends of Ted festival in 2007.\nThe 1996 play, The Cripple of Inishmaan by Martin McDonagh, is set on the Aran Islands. The play is the first in The Aran Islands Trilogy, followed in 2001 by The Lieutenant of Inishmore, and the unpublished The Banshees of Inisheer.\nThe 1997 romantic comedy The MatchMaker with Janeane Garofalo is partially set on the Aran Islands.\nThe 2000 song \"El pozo de Aran\" by Galician Celtic musician Carlos N\u00fa\u00f1ez, with lead vocals by Portuguese singer Anabela, is about a mother's pilgrimage to a holy well in the islands to heal her sickly child.\nThe songs from the album \"Man of Aran\" by the group British Sea Power all relate to the Aran Islands.\nIn Talking Tom and Friends pilot, Talking Hank mentions a show set in the Aran Islands.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInis Beag: a fictional name for Inis O\u00edrr\nTim Robinson (cartographer)Brewer's Odyssey, a novel by Michael Corrigan, features Inishmore's Worm Hole, a natural rectangular pool also known as the Serpent's Lair.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Aran Islands travel guide from Wikivoyage\nDiscover Aran Islands.

          "Raw, natural beauty of this wonderful island. We took an impromptu mini-coach tour around the island with a very knowledgeable local. Well worth it, and we now know so much more than if we had simply walked around, or hired a bike (though if we go back I would definitely hire a",
          "Please please can staff encourage mask wearing onboard. Yes masks are annoying. Nobody likes wearing them...but it\u2019s not a big ask especially when on a boat when I can\u2019t simply move away.",
          "My family travelled to Inis M\u00f3r in early August and I had booked this trip only because I was reassured with the company's COVID-19 safety charted on their website. Unfortunately apart from signage, hand sanitizers and use of face coverings by most (not all) passengers and",
          "I drove to Rossaveal from Barna and parking there is \u20ac7 per day - not too bad. You must pick up your tickets ordered online before going to the boat which is in the car park, it's not well sign posted though. I only knew from Facebook. The boat is dog friendly which was the",
          "Lovely female staff member in office who helped a lot on phone. The bus to Rossaveal at \u20ac9 is recommended. Ferry is lovely & spacious with helpful staff. Bus kindly collected us at our hotel as it passed by. However, I'm only giving 4/5 as the return bus driver was not very",
          "Very poor experience. Total lack of social distancing on this ferry. Free for all approach to seating. Many people not wearing masks despite it being mandatory. Ferry very full. Disembarking was chaotic with people literally on top of each other. Very worrying. I would avoid at",
          "Unfortunately the toilets were disgusting on the trip out to inishmore. Terrible especially in light of the pandemic. Cant see how they can be compliant with covid restrictions at all when the ferry was totally full on the return journey. No social distancing and no-one in",
          "I had seen online to book in advance as spaces were 'limited'. However, when we got to the boat, it was full with no efforts made to socially distance at all! I was really shocked by this.",
          "Bought a ticket online family of four stating boat leaving at 12am returning at 6pm for over 80 euros. Got there at 11.45 collected our tickets and told wait at terminal 2. The boat didn't leave until after 1.30 pm and then we were told last boat back was 5pm giving us little",
          "We booked online and collected our tickets in Galway the day before which made life a bit easier (it's not necessary to do this though). The way over was a bit choppy but a lovely day nonetheless.",
          "I love this Island had to go back I've been so many times now. As a child I stayed for a month in the gaelteacht and it was one of the best times I ever had.",
          "Quality boat and a good service - apparently it is always late leaving the island we were told - but still It is a great service",
          "I was offered a tour to the Aran Islands via the Aran Island Ferries as a supplement from my tour advisor. Since I have years of experience riding ferries ( former 40 year Seattle native) I was missing being out on the water. I had a terrific ride, found the constant reminders",
          "This company is so helpful. When our sailing didn\u2019t work out because of weather we were kept up to date and given options. This is so helpful when you are organizing a group and will always be appreciated! Special thanks to Caroline, Rosie and Jessica.",
          "Took a day trip to Inis M\u00f3r (Inishmore) and it was, by far, our best day in Ireland. Stayed at Forster Court Hotel across the street from the Aran Island Ferry Office, and wandered over to the office to see if a day trip was possible in December. It was, and the attendant, Orla,",
          "Beautiful trip to Inis Mor. So much history and beauty. Topped off the day with a cold cider in a warm pub. Would highly recommend taking the time to visit at least one of the Aran islands when in Galway.",
          "Ferry crew runs a tight ship. Staff were helpful, attentive, boats left and returned on time and the ride was great. Would highly recommend this company to get to Inis Mor",
          "My husband, and I and another couple we were travelling with visited Inishmore Island for a day trip in June 2019. The ferry left and returned when scheduled, was clean and the ferry terminal proved to be a safe place to leave our vehicle. As well, despite high winds the ferry",

          "These ferries take you out to the Aran Islands from Galway. They only run in fine weather but the trip is great to go on as you can still get a sight of the great scenery as you travel on the sea.",
          "Staff at Aran island ferries were rude and dismissive. Such a bad first impression. Luckily I\u2019ve been going to Aran all my life and love it. The bus and boat are great. But for any tourists dealing with staff in the ferry office it must be a disappointment and really bad first",
          "I've been on this ferry 4 times. It's quick and efficient but in rough seas it can be very rocky. Crew was nice enough to hand out barf bags and luckily the rough area wasn't during the whole ride.",
          "We opted not to take the bus service from Galway to their port in Rossaveal and drove there. It was a very pleasant and easy drive, with adequate spaces in their parking lots. The ferry to Inis Mor was great. Punctual, fast, clean, and affordable, the ferry drops passengers",
          "Took this ferry to Inisheer as part of a tour. Never expected water to be as rough as it was. The crew was very professional. They kept a close eye on everyone from safety on the stairs to looking out for anyone having a rough time with the trip. They kept us well informed",
          "I booked my tickets to the islands over the internet along with a bus ticket to the port (Rossveal). Picked up the actual ticket in Galway. The bus left promptly as did the ferry in both directions. A very pleasant experience.",
          "Took a morning ferry to Aran Islands for a day trip. Ferry was timely, clean and well run. Not sure about the cost because I didn't pay for the tickets -- don't think it was much",
          "My sailing experience to Innesmore was reasonably priced and was efficiently handled. I especially appreciated the snack bar.",
          "Drove to the ferry terminal at Ros A Mhil and parked for 7 Euro. There are three lots and they all charged 7 Euro for overnight parking. The on line ticket purchase was very simple and easy to follow. The boats were clean and the crew gave safety instructions over the speaker",
          "We were part of a tour group that went out to Inis Mor by the ferry. I am prone to getting sea sick so I was worried about the ride but it was a very smooth ride and I had no issues out and back. Thanks for the great trip!",
          "We weren't sure we wanted to get up early for the walk to the normal, Queen Street bus pick-up, so the office arranged a pick-up by Lally's at our hotel. In all dealings, the ladies at Aran Island Ferries were exceptionally helpful and pleasant. The pick-up went exactly as they",
          "The ferry boat was clean and comfortable. It was well maintained and the seats were plentiful. We originally had a 5 p.m. departure, but the agent was flexible and we caught the 4 p.m. ferry. I can't say the ferry was plush, but it was just fine. The speed was fine too because",
          "As said in the title, it is affordable, fast and offers enclosed seating. Be prepared for a bumpy ride!",
          "Travelled yet again with this company to Inishmore- ran like clockwork from boarding bus at Galway to take us to Rossaveal for the boat and onwards to Inishmore. Likewise on return journey. Note to irish travellers with free travel pass. Bus and boat are both FREE.",
          "We travelled out to the Inis M\u00f3r on the ferry. The staff were lovely. Outward crossing was rough and they handed out sickbags (luckily we didn't need them... But it was close.) Our return journey the next day was much smoother. Again everyone was very friendly and helpful. We",
          "Overall the trip was okay, but the driver wouldn't let me hop on the first bus even though there were 2 free seats, and I had a ticket and was a solo traveler. But then he let the next solo traveler on and I still had to wait in the freezing cold for the next bus about 30",
          "Great experience using the ferry, polite helpful staff, great day out for all the family young and old.",
          "When we arrived at the terminal we parked in the Ferry car park - can't miss it. It costs 7 euro for the day - we paid cash, not sure if they take card. I believe there may be limited free parking closer if you're willing to try. The ferry car park is only 200 metres to the",
          "Favorite part of our trip to Ireland. The ferries take you to the Aran Islands which are amazing and beautiful. We took the ferry to and from Inis Mor. The ferry has several departures each day. Affordable beer and snacks available on the ferry!",
          "Was on a bus tour in August 2019. Took the ferry to Kilronan on Inishmore....clean and well maintained. Most of the staff was excellent.....one had a \"don't care\" attitude and did not seem to care about much at all. Was very crowded .... some of the younger passengers chose",
          "Seeing the Cliffs of Moher from the ocean level was great! However, if you cannot deal with a rocking boat, don\u2019t do this ferry. The crew was great with helping those nauseated passengers, but they cannot change the tossing about of their boat.",
          "Pre-booked tickets online as was worried about queues due to Summer season, but upon arrival there was no queue at all. Had to change date of ticket due to plans but easily done through emails. Parking was easy at the location of ticket collection \u20ac7 per day. Couple minutes walk",
          "free for age old pensioners and worth every penny at normal price. parking cost 6 euros? they accept cards and run you to the port.",
          "We took the ferry to Inishmore, the most developed of the Aran Islands. The ride was bumpy, but that's what the seas offered. It left and arrived on schedule both ways. Would be nice to have had an additional washroom or two, and if they were better attended to (women were",
          "Took the Aran Island Ferry to inishmor for at our of the island. Ferry can carry 300 people and is very swift. It can be a bit choppy, so bring your sea legs!",
          "We booked our ferry tickets to Inishmaan with Aran Island Ferries. Although we booked online, we still had to go to their Galway office to collect our paper tickets.There is a bus that takes you to the ferry port (almost an hour long journey), from where you have to take the",
          "We enjoyed our ferry ride over to the Aran Island. the ferry was comfortable and ran on time.You can sit outside or in an enclosed area",
          "The staff could not be more helpful and are also very friendly. Very accommodating. Easy traveling with them with kids.",
          "This was a relaxing day! We took the ferry to the largest island, hired bikes and rode to a Neolithic fort overlooking the sea. Well worth the visit. Lovely beach and seal colony along the ride.",
          "Traveled with my family to Inis Mor last weekend and used Aran Island Ferries to get there. From the beginning everything was so well organized and the crossing was great. All the ferry staff were great, very friendly and efficient but I would like to say a special thank you",
          "Would highly recommended these wonderful crew a group of 30 of us travelled with aran ferries and nothing was a bit of hassle for them we have a load of cases and bags but the crew carried them on and off the ship for us and were so helpful looking forward to returning",
          "My family and I purchased tickets through Aran Island Ferries to visit Inishmor on our vacation to Galway in July. It was fantastic and the whole process was simple. I ordered the tickets on line - as recommended. Once in Galway, I stopped by their office to get the physical",
          "I went to see Aran Island with them, first they picked us by bus, than brought us to the ferry. I enjoyed very much Aran Island. Ferry people all very nice.",
          "The Aran island ferries is a really good service to get to and from the islands the boat trip is smooth and quick and it leaves right on time .The boat itself has good facilities the toilers were clean and the seats were kept in really good condition recommend travelling to the",
          "Me and my friends needed to get an earlier ferry back to Galway and a crew member called Cookie helped us get on and ensured we had a smooth journey over. Lovely man, thanks so much!",
          "Cookie was extremely helpful with getting us onboard an earlier ferry. Friendliest crew member on board. Lovely guy thanks for your help \ud83d\ude0a",
          "We traveled to the Aran Islands last week, boat was large, held about 300 people, It was a very rough ride to the Island, journey takes about 45 minutes but for me it seemed very long, Return trip was much smoother, which apparently is not unusual, I would not do it",
          "The ferry ride was enjoyable, fast and felt safe., The shuttle to the ferry was an old bus and it kept jerking. Something might have been wrong with the transmission. Cramped seats too. Alos bought ticket online but still was expected to wait on line to get ticket when got",
          "Using their website is very easy to order ferry tickets. We took the bus shuttle from Galway to the ferry and back. Everything ran like clockwork.",
          "The trip to Aran Island is a must for people visiting the West of Ireland and Galway. The best and easiest way for a day+ trip to the Aran Islands is to use the Aran Island Ferries. They are well organised and provide an excellent service. Nothing more to add.",
          "Got on the bus this morning only to be told to get off as they were waiting for another bus to come. After waiting for 40 minutes the other bus came and it was full of school kids who were exceptionally loud and played music very loud. The bus was very dirty and the bus driver",
          "Took the Ferry to Innis Mohr for the day. Easy to book tickets in Galway City Center, ample parking around the Ferry, departed on time. If you must sit by the window, you will need to arrive at least 30 minutes before they depart as these seats fill up fast.",
          "Excellent ride to the islands. I hardly even felt the movement. I dozed off since it was such a pleasant ride!",
          "Be it is the main way to travel to the Aran, I was grateful for the shuttle from Galway and the Aran Island Ferries. They were on time and easy to board. Finding a seat was not difficult. Great to see lots of people going to the islands. I didn't get to see everything in a day",
          "This is the perfect way to get out to the islands. We took the ferry to Inis Mor. The trip was on time and efficient. During tourist season the boats are full, so book in advance. You can buy online, but you still have to pick up paper tickets at one of the offices in Galway the",
          "me and the husband enjoyed are ride on the ferry going to the Aran islands, and you can grab a drink too",
          "Spent the day on Inis Oirr - beautiful and sunny - in Ireland , can you believe it? Took a horse cart for a quick look around and walked the rest of the day. Lovely relaxing area.",
          "Taking this Ferry Boat from Galway is the best way to get to the Islands. It is very economical and fair in my opinion at 25/pps. You can book online and get a discount....which we did. You can take a bus from Galway but if you have a car, I recommend just driving yourself.",
          "Very professional ship which takes 100+ [passengers to the Inishmor (biggest island). Mostly inside seating.",
          "Very was good but rough at times. Seating is sometimes hard to get. Ferries were on time, with extras added if needed. Definitely worth a trip to the Island.",
          "My granddaughter and I were on a tour that used the ferry to get us to the island We went to the little Ran island. The ferry was on time and had a great audio system. It was very easy to hear. Gave us information on the islands and Cliffs of Moher The abb",
          "I was so glad that I opted for this excursion to the Aran Island. Ferry boat was clean and prompt. Excellent staff. Approx 40 minutes I believe from the mainland. Once there we toured in a mini-bus, but lots of other options.",
          "We booked a trip through Lally Tours. They told us 45 min by bus and 45 min by boat. They did not tell us the boat first goes to the middle island and then takes another 15 min to the small island (Inis O\u00edr). We had a windy day and rough Atlantic ocean! The boat ride was quite",
          "We made the mistake of thinking that the ferry went from Galway and not Rossaveen and had to make our way there with very little time, everyone we spoke to was incredibly helpful and did everything they could for us!! We really appreciated how well they treated us. The ferry",
          "If you purchase your tickets on Line you save 10%. I thought I had done that but it didn\u2019t go through but the staff helped me deal with it. The Ferry was on time, comfortable (even with crappy weather) and there is a very basic drink cantina on board. We wanted to come back an",
          "We don\u2019t like group tours so this company fit our needs! Bus pickup in town, easy walk from our B and B. First bus had mechanical issues but 2nd bus arrived and we left only 7 minutes late, impressive. Ferry ride was smooth, comfortable. We then explored Inishmore at our",
          "I\u2019m a Canadian prairie girl, with little experience on boats, so this ferry ride was a little out of my comfort zone (but my new scarf worked as a blind fold). It didn\u2019t make anyone from our family sick to our stomach and we are thankful for that. I think the seas were rough",
          "We traveled to Inishmore on Saturday with Island Ferries on a crowded 1 pm ferry from Rosaveal. The sea was grey and the waves were wild and spectacular. You certainly needed your sea legs as it was a rough crossing. I saw a few people getting sea sick into plastic bags handed",
          "We took the ferry to the Aran Isles and the Cliffs of Moher. The Aran Isles ate very secluded and have miles and miles of rock fencing. There are some stores and pubs when you get off the ferry. The island your is very interesting and the bus driver seemed to enjoy pointing out",
          "I was really impressed with there excellent service, I made a mistake when booking but they helped me put it right. Friendly and personal service. I will definitely use again. Many Thanks",
          "Ferry was great way to visit the islands and was very affordable for family. Staff was great and ferry was easily accessible",
          "Bought tickets on line prior to our arrival in Ireland. Email voucher accepted at ticket counter. PLEASE NOTE Ferry departs from Ros a' Mh\u00edl not the Forster Street address! There is parking at the ferry dock, so you do not need to ride their bus from Galway to the ferry pier.",
          "Visiting the Aran Islands is one of the essentials if you visit the Galway area. We arrived at Inis M\u00f3r, the largest island, with Aran Island Ferries, a very pleasant 45 minute trip. The ferry is comfortable, clean and a very nice experience if it makes good weather to be on the",
          "Beautiful place cannot wait to go back. The ferry is simple and direct no issues. Got us to the island. I think we booked on line. Not really a place to wait around if it is cold out so get there on time.",
          "We took the bus from Galway to the ferry going out to the Aran Islands, and it's a day we will always remember. We sat in the front of the double-decker bus--great way to see Galway; and we took the ferry over to Inishmore (the wind made the boat ride really cold, so be prepared",
          "Ferries are fabulous getting you to and from the island. Easy trip and worth the fare. The trip is quick, but you must have cash on you to do anything from eating, biking or carriage rides on the island. Cash is a must necessity. ATM's on the island are not easy to find on",
          "Easy, close parking. Fast loading and unloading. Clean and comfortable. Lots of local tour guides conveniently waiting for you when you arrive.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the ferry ride to the Aran islands, incredible views and lovely people. One takes a bus from Gallway to the ferry terminal, all very convenient & should not be missed.",
          "My wife and I parked in their gravel car lot since we were planning on staying the night on Inishmore. We then proceeded to the little building and handed them our reservation number and got our tickets. I would absolutely suggest you book in advance as the boats are usually",
          "We took the ferry from Rossaveal Terminal to Inishmore. We parked in the gravel lot near the ferry terminal which was 5E/day and fairly large. Our car seemed to be safe there, at least we had no problem. It is about 100 yards from the lot to the terminal where you board the",
          "My husband and I did a two week driving tour of Ireland, and planned to take the ferry to Inis Mor and stay overnight. We were a little hesitant about leaving our car unattended for a day, but when we got to the ferry's car park and saw that it was protected, we were quite",
          "I highly recommend taking the shuttle, round trip, from the city center to the ferry. It is quite a distance. Everyone was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed seeing the island. We hired a guide who lived on the island and was very knowledgeable about its history. The shuttles",
          "We chose to take the shuttle bus from Galway out to the ferry, but think driving there might have been a little cheaper if one is comfortable with the driving and sure enough about directions and parking. I also noticed they were willing to drop people off at hotels along the",
          "We were to be taking this trip to the Aran Island,but we ere driving from Castelera and we were to be there at 9am for the bus to take us to the boat,but what we didn't know was the traffic every day of the week is bumper to bumper for over an hour,even though we left around",
          "We visited Aran island by ferry. We rented bikes and explored the island. I do recommend visiting D\u00fan Aonghasa it is definitely worth visiting. The ferry was good, but a little bit bumpy sometimes:)",
          "Last Saturday we went together with our classmates to the Aran Islands. Here there are some advices for you: DO: \u2022 ENJOY EVERY SINGLE MOMENT YOU SPEND THERE: The journey on the ferry, the Atlantic Ocean, the nature and his creatures etc.; \u2022 WEAR HEAVY CLOTHES: it\u2019s",
          "This is the best company to do business with. The weather was terrible and they gave a full refunds.",
          "Witnessing an entirely different way of life, and one that must take courage and dedication, was a joy. To see so many people who love their life is gratifying. Loved visiting the island.",
          "The ferry crossing was about 1 hour and 15 minutes and an enjoyable trip. We took the bus from from Galway (near Eyre Square) to the ferry terminal at Rosaveel. The return journey cost 25 euro with a savings of 2 euros savings by booking online in advance. It was quite windy on",
          "We had a beautiful day taking the ferry and bicyling around Inishmore. The quaint stillness of the hills and ocean. We were lucky to have a clear day. This is a must for anyone going to Galway",
          "We drove to the ferries not knowing the schedule... a good idea to check! We were lucky and arrived 45 min prior to the 1:00 departure time. (Allow at least a half hour.) 45 mins over, good enough day to stand outside and had a great conversation with a local sea captain",
          "We visited at the peak of tourist season but staff were unfazed and provided a punctual efficient service....with a smile",
          "Booked to visit Inishmor for August 18, 2018. Received a message from Fareharbor.com that \u201cYour booking has been cancelled. We have no confidence in the ability of our preferred operator on this route to deliver the level of service we require.\u201d While I appreciate the trip being",
          "1) GPSing to the location they tell you to park at doesn't get you the whole way there. 2) They don't tell you there is 3 different parking lots, all charging $5 to park, and 2 different ticket offices. Makes it confusing. 3) The \"worm hole\" isn't marked. Not the road to it,",
          "Bought on line for combined bus and bot srrvice from Galway to Inishmor. When you buy online you do not get tickets, but a voucher that you have to take to the ticket office and exchane for tickets. The process woukd be psinless if they had more thsn one person manning the desk.",
          "We took the ferry out to Inis Mor. What a magnificent day. Our granddaughter was able to see seals in the wild and the whole day was just amazing.",
          "Booked online to receive a discount. We drove our rental car and were able to park in a paid parking lot in front of the ferry office. Ferry was on time and nicely appointed. If you get motion sickness, definitely take some medicine, as the boat was rocking fairly well during",
          "Booked the Ferrie along with the bus to\\from Galway and the Doc. Everything smooth and on time. No issues at all. Note - picked up my tickets from their office in the Finlay Hostel (down stairs) everything great - the bus to the doc picks you up just a half a block from",
          "The Island and ferry crew were the best part of our week touring the west. Ferry Captain Joe Maloney was a proper gent and a scholar. Gave his a tour of the ferryman Made our trip extra special. Island bike hire 10e and was beautiful 4 hours cycling the island. Only wished We",
          "Our experience with the Aran Island ferries was positive for the most part. It arrives and leaves on time (so be there early), there was plenty of seating, and we had no difficulty parking at the Terminal (it cost \u20ac5 Euros, which is reasonable). You can make your reservations",
          "One thing you can count on is tourists love the Aran Islands, especially the big one - Inis M\u00f3r. Consequently, these ferries often become very crowded in season. Whether coming to the island or going back, it doesn't hurt to get in line a little early. Our group did not do this",
          "The ferry companies and the company who run the car park are making enough money to make sure parking is a smoother operation than the one currently being run. They should be running a shuttle bus from the village and coaches should only be allowed to drop off which would create",
          "As the main provider for the Aran Islands, there\u2019s no excuse for the chaos experienced over the bank holiday weekend. Thought I was being smart booking online and saving \u20ac5.00 in the process but that was added on again for the price of parking in their car park. No advantage to",
          "I must say that it was a great day. The weather was. Brilliant. It was a lovely day. The people are very friendly and helpful and that means a lot. It makes the day. Great. So yes I was very happy. Yes I will be going back again soon.",
          "Step back in time to the Aran islands. A 30 minute or so ferry ride from the mainland the Aran island and cliff tour takes you to the amazing Arun island. We had a very choppy crossing and never usually sea sick I did feel a little worse for wear but the crew on the ferry were",
          "The fellow that owns the business is a FUN guy!!! When our afternoon trip was cancelled due to high seas, he called the local cave people and had them hold up their tour until we arrived 15 minutes late. Without our knowing it until the next day, Donny had followed us to make",
          "We had a terrific time on this tour. The bus ride to the ferry was beautiful to begin with. But Inish Mor was just unbelievable. Well worth the money. TIP: We were staying at the Galway Bay Hotel and it was ONLY BY ACCIDENT that we discovered we could buy tickets just down the",
          "On the day we went the ferry was completely full but people were friendly and there was room to walk around and go outside to get a better view. Wasn't too long of a trip and everyone from young children to seniors seemed t have a good journey.",
          "As far as I know, the ferry is the only way to visit the island. There's nothing special about the ferry. They offer some basic snacks and drinks for purchase. The ride is about 40 minutes and you can walk around and enjoy the view. It's really about the destination. A lovely",
          "We got the ferrie to inish mor for a day trip with family. The island was buetiful. However I found the staff on the ferrie not all of them but 2 men in particular abrupt and bordering on rude. This experience from the crew did put a damper on our day and would put me off",
          "an interesting time as always on the Ferry i am always better coming back as the island is so relaxing - unfortunately i got a right bang on my right leg on the way over as i tripped coming out of the bath room.. still i was lucky i didnt bang my head!",

          "Whatever time you\u2019re due to leave it seems a good idea to get there an hour early. Our 5pm departure left at 4.20! Perhaps they just leave when all the booked passengers are on board which makes sense. Smiling staff and a bar make a pleasant journey with seats inside and,out.",
          "We were there in midsummer - so despite booking for 10:30 ferry, our ferry was full up so we sailed away early. They seem to just keep running ferries (there are at least 3) as they fill which is handy if you are a bit early and provides more options than the official sailing",
          "We l,oved the Aran Islands and getting there would be a challenge and we knew it. They were most kind and came back to pick us up when we missed our boat! The islands were fantastic and was the highlight of our trip to Ireland.",

          "We took the ferry to Inis Mor and then spent the day bicycling around the island. I will always remember the rides over and back as magical. The sun was shining brightly and the wind and salt water spray washed over us as we viewed the beautiful landscape of Ireland from the",
          "|It was the only day of bad weather. However despite the elements crossed over to the Aran Islands. There the passengers were welcomed by a dolphin swimming close inshore and around the ferry. There was a delay in the trip by pony and trap so adjourned to the Pub for some",
          "A nice day out was marred by the journey over with this organisation. There is a distinct lack of signage on the pierhead. So one does not know which gangway or which ferry boat will be the one that is going first. This means the queueing system is non existent. Never the less",
          "This service is excellent, we took the boat from Rossaveal to Inis Mor and it was very pleasant, the weather was great. We parked nearby which cost \u20ac5 which i think is a bit of a rip off. Parking for passengers should be free given the price of the tickets \u20ac25 each is steep!!!",

          "This day was the only day on our whole trip that it rained but the tour was still exceptional. Our driver was great and regaled us with stories and experiences that made for a true Irish experience. Island was fun, cliffs are huge and great for pictures. Go have a Guinness on",
          "Aran Island Ferrys, are a must do. We used the service to take us over to one of the islands for the day. The views of the Cliffs of Moher from the boats was unbelievable! Worth using the ferries to check out the islands",
          "The ferry ride was relatively mild. Visiting the Aran Islands was incredible. It's a small island, but very picturesque and the walking is easy.",
          "Booked the full day Inis Mor trip. We got there by bus which picked us up at our B&B (be sure and check as it was pretty convenient). However...the bus got there with literally minutes to spare before our boat left the dock (my wife was in line at the restroom and I had to wave",
          "Ferry ride was uneventful and peaceful. My husband saw dolphins/porpoises?? along side. Me, I fell asleep. If buying online in advance, you are sent a booking code, and then still have to wait in the same line as those buying day of, to get the actual tickets. Still recommend",
          "Nice ferry ride the Aran Islands (Inishmore). The only thing is that I wish there website would have been a little more informative- had to hunt for information in how to take the ferry over. We really did enjoy our day once we got there by biking around the island.",

          "The ferry was clean, ran on time and had great views. The only problem was a rough crossing. Some passengers were sea sick. Be prepared if this is a problem. We took the tour bus from Galway and that was also a great trip.",

          "We visited Inishmore via the Aran Island Ferry. Apparently the big ferry was full for the morning trip, so we were loaded onto a small ferry for the trip over. Guess this was the overflow ferry. Anyway, the day was bright and sunny, and the trip was uneventful. On the",

          "Its a great way to get too and from the island. However the outside decks really turn into nasty smoking rooms. I mean my eyes were itching every time I even took a step outside to take a look at the view. Also they moved offices after I booked the tickets and didn't post",

          "We booked through their webpage. At least you bag 10% discount but the information shown does not reflect reality in all circumstances. The ticket office is next to the parking place (5\u20ac cash on exit). Getting the boarding tickets was straight forward and no big deal. The",

          "Had a great experience in there's Aran Islands, however the boat trip left a lot to be desired... On top of being freezing cold, the boats seriously need to be replaced. For the amount of money spent on the trip, I'd have thought better ones would be provided. No life jackets",

        "wiki": "Dunguaire Castle (Irish: D\u00fan Guaire) is a 16th-century tower house on the southeastern shore of Galway Bay in County Galway, Ireland, near Kinvara (also spelled Kinvarra). The name derives from the Dun of King Guaire, the legendary king of Connacht. The castle's 75-foot (23 m) tower and its defensive wall have been restored, and the grounds are open to tourists during the summer.\nThe castle's slates are from an old school in Kinvara.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe 19th century Gaelic scholar John O'Donovan states in his Ordnance Survey letters for County Galway, and his book, The Genealogies, Tribes and Customs of the Hy-Fiachrach, that Dunguaire was built by the \u00d3 hEidhin clan, chiefs of Coill Ua bhFiachrach, the district around Kinvara, and also of U\u00ed Fiachrach Aidhne an area coextensive with the diocese of Kilmacduagh covering the part of County Galway between the Burren and Galway Bay to the west and Slieve Aughty to the east.\nDunguaire Castle was used in the 1969 Walt Disney movie Guns in the Heather, featuring Kurt Russell, in which the castle was featured as Boyne Castle. It was also the Scottish castle home of the main character in the 1979 film North Sea Hijack.\n\n\n== Legends ==\nAnother regionally well known legend is the \"Road of the Dishes\" (Bothar na Mias), involving King Guaire and St. Colman of Kilmacduagh.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Parking was easy to find within a few minutes walk to the castle. The castle itself is in good condition and is so very stereotypical of what we expected to see driving in Western Ireland. Well worth the stop and walk around the castle grounds.",
          "Enjoyed walking the grounds and visiting this beautiful place in Kinvara, Ireland. It\u2019s just so much fun to imagine the lives of the people who lived here hundreds of years ago. Just so magical!!!",
          "If you find yourself travelling the Wild Atlantic in Co.Galway, you are sure to come across Dungaire Castle, it's well worth stopping to visit, you can walk around the castle, go inside, and if you really like what you see, and have time, you can attend a medieval banquet.",
          "This is a really cool looking castle. We were there off-season so it wasn't open to go inside, but it was still neat to look at from the outside. I would love to return and see what it looks like from the inside.We had an easy time parking, but there were quite a few people",
          "Unless you\u2019re in desperate need of a castle visit, pass this by unless the parking lots are empty. Besides a quick walk around the perimeter there is nothing that you can\u2019t see from the road as you drive by. We visited off-season and still the sidewalks were jammed full.",
          "Spent about 60 minutes wandering the grounds and inside this castle. Visited midday and easy stair climb to top. This old broad even went the entire way around the top catwalk. Beautiful views, but a bit scary. On my way out, visited the artist in residence who was making",

          "The up side is the castle is still standing. The downside is I didn't learn/experience a whole lot by visiting this castle. The one thing I did learn is that different people built castles for different reasons. Castles aren't always noble keeps where the villagers come running",
          "It's nice to see an Irish castle in its original configuration. Let's get one thing out of the way - In Ireland, a castle, a manor house, and a tower house can be roughly synonymous. In fact, \"Dun\" means fort, so we have another synonym. This was a photo stop for us on our tour.",

          "Did not know about this castle or actually how many are in Ireland in general, so this one just appeared so we had to stop en-route from Galway. Found a small car park just past the Castle and walked back. It is a great little castle, apparently dating back to the 16th Century",

          "While this small tower house, isn\u2019t really a castle in the strictest sense, it is worth a visit. The fact that the last owner live there well into the 20th century and her story adds to its charm. The views over the bay and of the village of Kinvarra are beautiful.",

          "This was was an inexpensive castle to see. It has an interesting history and is still maintained. It was a one hour stop to go through this one. Recommend stopping even if it\u2019s to stretch the legs",
          "What a nice castle to visit, but we were really disappointed that personal tours guided by local Irishmen were no longer given, and we were left to self guided tours. The last time we visited a few years ago, we were given a small group tour hearing stories from a local",
          "I agree with some of the reviews. It\u2019s more impressive from the outside but worth a stop if you are in the area.",
          "Lovely views all around this area. The castle is a little underwhelming when you see it, but worth going for the views.",

          "Very informative and worth the visit. Beautiful surrounds and well restored and maintained. Not too accessible for those with mobility issues.",
          "I have seen this castle in so many photographs over the years. It was a pleasure to visit the location at last. Time did not permit a visit to the interior, but the short walk around the building and the views from the grounds are certainly worth checking out. I would look into",
          "Enjoyed our night at the medieval banquet here. Entertainment was entertaining! Castle itself is not much but setting on the bay is lovely. Dinner was a bit disappointing but was filling. The songs and stories made the evening and we were glad we had chosen to do this.",
          "Came here for a medieval banquet on a Friday night. Was welcomed with a mead honey drink and Irish music. There were some 50 guests sitting on benches. We shared juice, wine and water. The show was fine. The food was fine. The staff and performers are professionals. We",
          "Bought by the owner who lived in it for 20 years. The building and the living area are like the modern day town houses, each floor having loving, dining etc in its own. The banquet is something we are told us good for literary buffs which includes reading of poetry etc. didn\u2019t",

          "We thought it was a nice castle, although, I believe the literature said it was just a tower. Not a place a king would live. We didn't participate in the dinner/theater event. It's a nice stop requiring only a small amount of time.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Not a large castle but original with an interesting history. Most likely, there will be a doable amount of visitors at the castle when you visit. Not overly crowded like other tourist attractions. The location is very attractive. It's on the water on",
          "My family and I stopped here on the way back from the Burren. There is a parking lot (um, sorry, a \u201ccar park\u201d) across the road and a few hundred yards away, so it is easy to pull off and walk to the castle. They were preparing for a so-called Medieval banquet and we couldn\u2019t go",
          "I thought this was a pretty castle with some interesting history so i absolutely worth a stop if you are nearby. Some of the reviewers on here are really reviewing their banquet which should be the subject of a separate listing. Others have attended as part of a package tour",
          "This is not worth a visit by anyone. Nothing to see and over priced. Only trying to sell the banquet. Didn't go there and won't.",
          "I wasn't enthused about this tourist attraction since I visit this area a lot. When a friend purchased the tickets, I went along, figuring it was more of a gimmick. I was pleasantly surprised. This castle dinner has a literary twist and I appreciated the entertainment. The food",
          "Very interesting castle Loads of history Friendly hosts Stairs to climb but manageable for most visitors",
          "While we enjoyed the castle and found the history interesting, the price seemed steep for a short visit. If it\u2019s on your way and you like castles, go for it! Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere. (Same price at other attractions for things we found much more stimulating)",
          "This place is actually pretty nice and a fine example of a small but excellent old castle with great views. The issue is there are no facilities nearby,and they charge like 7 euros to get into the area where they do provide same. Sooo if you have to go, that's your choice. If I",
          "Very small castle grounds. They overlook the ocean which was a plus! I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to come back here, but since we were passing it it was worth the stop!",
          "Although the castle is quite striking and in a lovely location, the banquet is disappointing. The food is bland but quickly served. The cabaret is entertaining but not medieval. Accessibility is extremely difficult - up a set of winding stone steps.",
          "This is a good stop if you're on the way to the Cliffs of Mohar. The view here is quite beautiful. It's relatively small and won't take much time unless you're there for a dinner.",
          "If you are driving to the Cliffs of Moher from Galway this is right on the way and worth a quick stop. Well restored and a self guided tour that makes is easy to see the history of the castle. We got a lot out of it and found it quite interesting. It's a beautiful setting.",
          "My wife and I recently attended the medieval banquet at Dungaire. It was a very delightful evening. We met several other couples traveling through Ireland. Everything was well organized and the food and drink was very good. The entertainment was both fun and informative. There",
          "The castle was very interesting. As a photographer, I enjoyed photographing all of the great views outside. Inside there were some great examples of castle furniture. I wouldn't miss this in Ireland.",
          "Visited at low tide on a rainy spring day. Swans and mussels galore! The castle is in fairly close to original condition and has many interesting features, including a dining room that is apparently used for banquets (it's small) and other fun things. It also has one of the",
          "This village encapsulated all that Ireland is about. Friendly people. History and a real sense of community. I was taken back at the historical building and its surrounding beauty. I will definitely be back. Noel Johnston Running Through My Mind.",
          "Dunguaire is a small castle, well-restored. It has fabulous views but I don't know if I would go out of my way to go there. The banquet would be interesting (we didn't go), but some of the other castles (Bunratty and Kilkenny) have more to offer. Cute craft shop with handmade",
          "This very small castle sits on the edge of water and in a beautiful spot therefore. The sign outside says free entrance but that's only for the arts and craft shop inside. The \u20ac8 entrance fee seems large for a room and tower.",
          "Well at my yoga retreat in the burren, I went on a bike ride to see this castle, it is unreal, still full constructed from what I can tell with a beautiful view.",
          "We arrived just as they were closing, so we didn't get to go inside. That was fine, we were just stopping in on our drive back to Galway from the Cliffs of Moher. It was nice to walk around the grounds and get a quick look.",
          "Stopped here briefly whilst driving through the area. Didn\u2019t go inside, but we were free to have a little wander. Not much to see on the outside but nice to sit and watch the world go by. A perfect photo opportunity in the evening too with the last of the sun. Worth a look if",
          "Arrived In time for the tour but realized there was no way we could climb the steep stairs. We did manage to climb the stairs to the awesome craft shop, we both purchased gifts for ourselves and family. They were so kind to let two old ladies use the facilities before we left.",
          "My husband and I were on a day-long tour of this area with extremely knowledgable local guide, Paul O'Donnell, who took us to see this picturesque Irish castle. We walked around the interior that is used for medieval banquets. Paul told us that the previous owner was a somewhat",
          "We went to the castle at about 2pm, this was a perfect time as there was little to no bus's at this time. We had the kids with us so we used the green area inside the castle grounds for the kids to run around. Just inside the gates of the castle was a fantastic little coffee",
          "Don't even bother stopping if there are busses.. Its a great walk through castle but its tight! So cool though.. you can just pull in park and go!",
          "Castle used for banquets and was not open for tours when we passed through. It is quite scenic and right on the main road, worth a quick stop to stretch legs and check out. Parking is across the street",
          "We made a pit stop here while on the Wild Atlantic Way. Self-guided tour came with a short brochure, the entire thing probably took us 15-30 minutes. We felt a bit rushed as it was near closing time, and weren't able to see the entire place due to them setting up for that",
          "Right in Kinvara as you drive into town, you will see the castle. Have to park up the street then you can walk over. We love the old castles and buildings. Worth a stop and visit",
          "Not much to do or see here, but it makes for a beautiful photo. Anyone with a drone can get wonderful footage here. Almost entirely surrounded by water, it\u2019s beautiful.",
          "they are all somewhat the same except the food differs, and the storytelling and music. But it takes back into history and listening to the music take you way way back in time. the staff is all dressed in medieval dress, you sit at table with benches and you have a knife to eat",
          "It's more of a tower house than a castle but it does provide good views and is definitely in good shape.",
          "We were enroute to the Cliffs of Moher and decided to make a quick detour to check out this castle. It was earlier in the morning so the gate wasn't open but we had the chance to walk around and view it from the exterior. Smaller castle located on Galway Bay but a nice place for",
          "Dunguaire Castle is a restored 16th-century tower house on the southeastern shore of Galway Bay near Kinvara. Open daily for tours/visiting that give you a sense of castle life. They also have banquets in the evening.",
          "Our group enjoyed the medieval banquet here. Our dinner was on a dark and very stormy night and I was very impressed at how secure the castle was - easy to see how it has stood the test of time. On arrival, everyone gathered on the main floor and enjoyed some mead while waiting",
          "I took a picture at this castle, which we just happened to pull over at on our drive, and I captured a rainbow. It is the most beautiful picture that I took while in Ireland. I made it the screensaver on my computer. Small castle compared the many that we saw on this trip,",
          "This castle is on Galway Bay which is picturesque for photos. Parking is across the road and there's a small gift shop with some locally handmade items. Didn't feel compelled to tour the castle, but enjoyed the exterior.",
          "We stopped by to view this castle while traveling on the Wild Atlantic Way outside of Kinvara. Parking was nearby, with sidewalks to walk over to the castle. You could approach the castle, but the entrance was closed. Beautiful views of the water nearby the castle. A must see",
          "We stopped at Dunguaire Castle en route to Connemara National Park. Not much to see and would not recommend stopping unless it is on your way.",
          "When visiting Irish castles, you should not have a high expecation of a huge castle or elaborate settings. This castle was easy to reach, and in good condition. My daughter enjoyed the gift shop. Seemed liked an interesting place for a banquet.",
          "Stopped on the way. The castle itself wasn't open (closed Oct-Mar) But we were able to walk into the courtyard to take pictures and walk around the castle for some beautiful views over the bay. If you walk to Kinvara centre from here check out the ruins on the other islands,",
          "Beautiful spot for a quick wedding ceremony. Lovely castle on the water. Open to the public. Many wonderful photo opportunities.",
          "We stopped by to take some pictures of Dungaire Castle. It wasn't open for the day yet, so we took pictures from outside. It looks to be in really good shape in comparison to other castles we saw while in Ireland.",
          "Beautiful castle worth visiting. It is in good condition and you get some great views from the top of the tower. Sadly dogs are not allowed but their is a nice (but slippy) walk you can do round the outside of the castle.",
          "Considering most castles in Ireland were long ago let go to ruin thanks to the ever-present meddling of the English, this is one of the few where you can still climb to upper floors and get a sense of what life would have been like. They have taken a very interesting approach",
          "This is a great stop for pictures. I have been here twice. The first time I went into the castle to explore, the second time just a quick picture stop. In my opinion I it is not worth the tour, but the castle with the water in the background makes a great picture.",
          "Very well kept midieval castle in beautiful surroundings with view to the cosy village of Kinvarra. Go the stairs all the way to the top of the castle, and take a walk on the narrow passage all around the top of the tower. The view is beautiful!",
          "We came here to do a castle dinner and show. Sometimes these things are questionable but this one was great. The storytellers and singers performed between the dinner courses which they also served. The food wasn't gourmet but it was good. I'm glad we did it!",
          "Stumbled upon Dunguaire Castle on our drive from the Cliffs of Moher back to Dublin. Very beautiful and picturesque. Another place we could have spent more time exploring. Be sure you're not pressed for time when exploring the Irish countryside.",
          "We went at a time where we were not able to go inside the castle, but we took beautiful pictures. Very nice and on the way through a beautiful drive to the Cliffs of Moher. We stayed in Kinvara and loved the area and our Air BnB host!",
          "This castle is dressed and styled so you realy can see what life was like in different times and ages. On the ground Floor there is a shop from Ireland Heritage where the sell all kinds of stuff.. i found it a little out of place but the rest of this little beauty is very Nice",
          "This is a small castle really just an extended keep with a curtain wall. It survived the various wars and unpleasantness of the last several centuries reasonably intact. There is free parking about a block away. The castle is situated on a high spot surrounded on three sides by",
          "We were on a bus tour of the Burren and stopped here for photos. There is a parking lot a short distance from the castle entrance. Not much to see inside the walls. We just took a few minutes to take photos and admire the view from the castle grounds. No admission to the",
          "Gorgeous castle to stop and take pictures on a nice day. We didn't opt for a tour but the view of the castle was definitely worth a brief stop.",
          "We arrived, enquired politely about what the tour included, prices, and even about the banquet. The woman at the till rushed through the questions and hastily took our money. So we started our \"tour\" of the \"castle\"(which was an extreme disappointment and highly UNinformative)",
          "As we have now travelled from Dublin around the coast clockwise we have seen some spectacular castles, Cahir for example, this is not spectacular, but it is interesting in that all floors are able to be visited.",
          "I saw Dunguaire Castle for the second time as I was traveling up the west coast to the Connemara region. Even though it was only 9 a.m. or so, there were several people from tour buses visiting it, just like the first time I saw it. I haven't toured it myself, but it's a",
          "Dunguaire Castle is quite modest. The setting, however, is very pretty and the castle is relatively close to Galway. The castle is on the road to the Burren, so it allows for an easy, quick stop.",
          "Ireland castles in general are very underwhelming to someone who has seen some magnificent castles elsewhere in Europe. This is ok, but not alot to see. Roads up are scary as they are very narrow and have walls up one side with branches sticking out towards the road.",
          "My son was turning 15 mid-august so we took the family to this castle for a medieval dinner on his birthday night. While I was a little concerned that this might be a little hokey everybody had a good time (and that includes six children from the ages of 10 - 16). Terrific bread",
          "We pre-booked the medieval dinner. When we arrived, we were greeted by performers in period costume with a glass of mead. When all of the guests had arrived, we all toasted the evening. There was a harpist playing period music. Our hosts escorted us up the spiral stairs to the",
          "Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in the Galway area. This is not so much a castle as a tower, and it does not take long to look at, which is nice. about 1 hour is recommended, if that. There is a lovely gift shop and craft/jewelry shop as well. Beautiful on inside",
          "We visited this castle in early August 2017. The self guided tour round the castle is easy to understand and follow as the Castle is not huge. The top floor gives access to the roof which gives 360 degrees of views , although access is a little narrow ! The craft shop is",
          "Stopped to view this small castle. No tours, self guided, boring. I would have happily paid more to learn the history.",
          "As a well seasoned traveler, the cost is almost \u20ac7 euro for adults, and you get around 2 floors of stuff and a banquet hall. This is a way over priced location for what you get. You'll do well just seeing the outside of it and save your money for something that is more",
          "This is a very famous castle, since it is almost built on the sea and offers amazing views especially when reflected into the water. Be careful for the tides, when we were there unfortunately it was low and we could not get the same views that we saw in several pictures. Anyway",
          "Visited with our three kids, and were a bit disappointed--this is a tower house and not a full-on castle, there were essentially only three rooms to see. It was fine, but overpriced for what it is.",
          "This tower house is a quick explore if doing it during the day - would love to go back and see what it is like for one of their evening banquets/literary reads. With one spiral staircase up timing is everything to avoid those descending. The walk around the roof top outside is a",
          "this was closed when we drove by, but we stopped and walked around. it may have been more interesting if the gift shop was open, but it is not a very popular site. nice and quiet. no restrooms, not ADA accessible.",
          "The castle is pleasant enough, although we did not purchase a tour, just walked around. However, I did purchase a pair of earrings in the castle shop. I thought they were quite pretty but, as you can see in the photos below, they did not hold up well. Upon closer inspection,",
          "A tower with a large stone spiral staircase. No grounds to explore. Picturesque location. Really wouldn't recommend it with small children or if you are heavily pregnant.",
          "The evening dinner here stands out as one of the most special memories of our week in Ireland. Unlike many \"events\" this castle and evening have such genuine warmth and authenticity. Our group was welcomed by a harpist, playing enchanting Celtic music that set the stage for the",
          "This is a beautiful tower house that we were lucky enough to see on a nice day. In all, we toured the castle grounds for about twenty minutes. We were not allowed inside, but we could hear the chefs preparing a medieval feast for the evening that I would love to purchase",
          "A very pretty castle set on the waterside and still used for medieval banquets. This is a lovely photo opportunity. Unable to enter the castle due to a banquet taking place but still able to walk right around the castle and into the entry courtyard. Very picturesque. It is",
          "It's busy and very popular but you can see why. It's all you would expect an Irish castle to be. The setting is idyllic and the atmosphere it exudes reflects the weather. Dour and threatening one minute, stunningly beautiful with amazing reflections and colours when it's clear.",
          "Found this place by accident on a random drive. I was amazed to see such history right in your face. This castle was lived in less than 100 years ago. Very well taken care of and looking at the history gives a great impression of what the people were like at the time of",
          "A castle has various meanings, in Ireland it seems to be a smaller fortress but there is plenty of history to learn here at Dunguaire. 6.5 Euros to enter. Beautiful location at the end of the bay. The tower is quite well preserved and you get a feeling of what it might have been",
          "Arrived after hours but still a pleasant walk around the grounds and plenty of historical evidence. Since I wasn't able to go inside, unable to add more. Certainly worth the after dinner stroll!",
          "The castle is located at the tip of a long bay, so the scene there is quite picturesque- lots of boats and sea birds in the harbor.",
          "We parked across the street and walked about a block to the castle on a rainy day. Had the weather been better, it would have offered some very nice opportunities for pictures. The castle is small and not as inviting as some, but we did take a few minutes to go up to the",
          "What a lovely little castle. It has an interesting history to it, and it has a bucolic location. What a gem of a find. Climb to the top and get a wonderful panorama of the area.",
          "If you are not going to attend one of the banquets here, it's sort of a toss up if you should pay the 6.60 Euro to go into the castle. The view from the tower is great, but it is extremely tight up there and not appropriate for kids. The interior is decorated for the banquets",
          "We stopped here on our way by and although it was a lovely castle there is not much to see. There are 4 floors, each decorated in a different century, while interesting is not really worth the money. Definitely take pictures of the castle as it's a picturesque castle and the",
          "We really enjoyed exploring the rooms inside the castle walls and learning more history about this area.",
          "If you travel through Kinvara you have to visit Dunguaire castle and while you're at it do the banquet diner! We did the 8:30 banquet and we loved it. The entertainers are amazingly talented and the welcome inviting. Thank you to all for an amazing evening and most of all",
          "Dunguaire is in a very picturesque location. As can frequently happen to us when we plan road excursions... we rapidly start running out of time. The town of Kinvara, is quaint and we really wanted to walk around town, which then resulted in us just settling for pictures of",
          "This was Castle number 3 on our visit to Ireland and I am glad we came. We visitied on our way down from Galway to Doolin to visit the Cliffs. Glad we stopped. Fantastic History and wonderful information from our Guide, which helped us understand the time periods and Castle",
          "Just by chance my husband and I decided to join the dinner theater. We loved the small theater presentation, the mead, the wine, the song, the poetry! The history! How fun was this!!! The food was really good and fresh and a \"hero's portion!\" Highly recommend!",
          "Don\u2019t\u2019 think if you've seen one castle, you\u2019ve seen them all. This one was different, and our favorite one! Well preserved and you can wonder around on your own, which we did. We walked all the way to the top and roof (outside)of the castle. So much fun. Great views. We had the",
          "Unfortunately, we had no time to check it out any closer but our photos from near the road are quite nice. It's beautiful.",
          "Nice stop for a small castle. Good view from the tower. Gift shop with added art exhibition. They offer dinner with theater, seems nice.",
          "Went to visit the castle, the craft shop upstairs, then came back later for the Banquet. The Staff are so welcoming and helpful. The banquet was awesome, food just wonderful, the Mead very tasty. The show powerful, and fun.",
          "beautifull place to visit, laying on the shore, give you afeeling of ancient time. the walking inside the walls and climbing upstairs or just walking around, along the walls its agreat feeling..dont miss",
          "We may missed the banquet and the insides was closed because of it! But that didn't and shouldn't stop you from visiting! It's beautifully located on the water. A gorgeous castle with great views. Worth walking around!",
          "Was there on a sunny day, nice walk around, not too much to see but the harbour view from there is great. Small gift shop inside with another level upstairs. Access to the section where the medieval dinners are held wasn't allowed. We thought the cost of the dinner was a little",
          "The castle is a great photo opportunity. The inside is not much to see so book the dinner and entertainment. The food was quite good for such an event. The entertainment was charming and we loved it. Not the best wine served but they kept it flowing. Highly recommend.",
          "Quaint seaside castle, not far from Galway. Not as busy or elaborate as the more popular castles but still worth a look and a few snaps.",

          "Fun medieval dinner banquet. Good food and lots of mead and wine. Singing and entertainment fun. Castle is small and event has an intimate feel.",
          "Great for a photo op on a nice day. A nice walk from the town to stretch the legs after lunch. Careful - the traffic moves quickly on this part of the road",
          "Unless you are planning on going for their banquet meal and show, the tour inside isn't worth the \u20ac6 it costs to explore inside. It's essentially the top floor they people would care to see inside, which gives access to the narrow perimeter for which to walk around outside on",
          "Our visit to Dunguaire Castle was an optional excursion on our Trafalgar tour of Ireland. It was a wonderful evening! We were met at the entrance by folks dressed in period costumes and the event began. Dinner was excellent, with a set menu. There were options for anyone",
          "Ireland has lots to offer, especially when it comes to personal involvement, and whilst I would definitely recommend Dunguaire Castle for the views and the historical appeal, there isn't actually much to do there, which is something I tend to look for when visiting locations,",

          "The castle was a nice thing to do while we visited Kinvara but I didn't think it was worth the 6 euro entrance fee and we actually didn't take any photos from the top. Initially there's a guide who provides a brief introduction to the castle but the other floors are left to",
          "Considering the MANY castles in Ireland, this was pretty basic, small, and not that exciting. I stayed in Kinvara for a couple days so it was something nice to see, but you can go up into the gift shop for free if you want a glimps of the higher level of the castle. You can walk",
          "Better views from down below for free. Legend has it you walk around the castle counter clockwise for good luck, clockwise to restore your virginity. Can't do both. Enjoy.",
          "Walking distance from Kinvara, or you could take your car and park a short distance away at the castle carpark. It was closed when we were there but they hold banquets there in season.",
          "We were returning to our Ennis base when we stumbled upon. Free car park 2oo yards away, free to walk around I think. Impressive views, small turret, can walk around, village just along coast nice pub Pier Head, food looked good.",
          "Free parking about 300m down the road, between \u20ac4-6 entry to the castle, interesting displays, superb view from the roof, whole visit took about 45 mins and would recommend.",
          "Having lived in the area for many years, I finally visited this most photographed castle! Compact but with lots of interest and spectacular views, it is well worth a visit. Probably best avoided if a busload of tourists has just arrived and are all struggling up (and down) the",
          "Very nice example of an castle/tower house. Well worth the time to explore and take some pictures. Seeing these beautiful buildings never got old for me, and this is a fine example.",
          "Such a beautiful castle. Shame we couldn't go inside. Really popular with tourist. Buses and buses kept coming.! Worth visiting.",

          "This castle has a great little history to it and is a fun spot if you're driving between Galway and the Cliffs of Moher. The restrooms are great (which is a main reason we stopped) but I really loved the climb through the tower. On our way back from the Cliffs or Moher we",
          "Before we left for Ireland this was one little castle I wanted to see. We payed meager admission to roam the rooms and walk the Wall Walk and read about the history of this little castle from the 15th century. We were there during low tide and the boats in the harbor were on",
          "Giving this historic site 3 stars is probably a little mean. It was a stop off point on the way to a tour of the Cliffs of Moher so all we got to do was traipse around with lots of other tourists taking photos. I'm sure without the crowds and with with some more information, it",

          "As the title suggests, it is simply a beautiful little castle, but that's just about it. While the castle does not offer much to see, other than its beautiful architecture, it is full of history which may of be of interest to some. Also, it is situated in Kinvara village,",
          "This is again not worth a special trip to the place, but if you are visiting west coast, you can drop here and have a look. Most of the historic places in Ireland are in runis, some of them recreated. Worth spending sometime if you like to explore History.",
          "Dungaire Castle is not the biggest castle in Ireland, but its beautifully sited, in Kinvara village, right on Galway Bay, with terrific views. It's worth a visit \u2013 and unlike some such places, even the craft sales area is worthwhile, with lovely, original pieces. Also, Dungaire",
          "Dunguaire Castle is open for tours. It was very interesting as the different floors were decorated for different periods that it had been occupied. There was a host that gave you basic info and then you could explore on your own. Great views across to Kinvara from the top of",

          "This was a surprise find on our drive from Galway into County Clare. It was really easy to get to and there's a small parking lot across the street from the castle, with a few minutes walk. We happened to visit the castle before a tour bus came and there were only a few other",

          "We stopped at this castle on our way to the Cliffs of Moher. Nice for a few nice pictures. The castle gates were not open so we only saw the outside. Be careful as you walk around it; the paths are very slippery. Parking is a challenge.",
          "My wife and I were on a Self Drive tour of Ireland, going to Doolin when we stopped by this castle. There is a small, free parking area right off the road and a few minute walk to the castle. This castle is not a large one, but looks just like you would expect when you imagine",
          "We were heading to Galway and Kinvara was more or less on the way. A good opportunity to get some pics of the Dunguaire Castle. It's easy to spot and parking is right across the street (free). There are also some nice thatched houses at the parking lot, worth a pic or two. We",
          "A friend strongly recommended attending the dinner banquet so I purchased tickets for myself and my wife at ~$50 each. I hesitated at the price but took the \"might as well do it while I'm here\" approach and went for it. We had a wonderful time. The food was good (not great) but",
          "This pretty little castle sits perched above a bog and was a just-right start to our drive from Shannon to Galway. Parking is a little tricky, since the signs aren't very clear (and watch out for cars as you walk along the street!), but it's worth a quick trip snap a few pics.",
          "This is an attractive 16th century tower house on a promontory near Kinvarra. The building is largely intact and medieval banquets are staged here (we couldn't go inside when we visited because of one of these events). There is a very rough trail around the outside of the",
          "It was a lovely walk from Kinvara to the castle. Great photo oportunities on the way and of the castle itself. We paid a reasonable fee to tour the castle and enjoyed going up winding stone steps and entering each room on the way. Once you reach the top and go outside, there is",
          "Nice castle to see, with views from the top even better. This was a convenient stop between 2 destinations, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. A bit pricey for what it is.",
          "Lovely castle, very easy to walk through but a little expensive. That said, I would visit again if I was a first time visitor to the area.",
          "First, this is the most photographed castle in Ireland. However it is not real big, but very authentic. I booked the medieval banquet and could not have been more pleased. The cost was only $100, which gives you food, drink, entertainment and castle tour. Food was good, but",
          "Absolutely a great dinner. Served soup, huge chicken breast, mashed potatoes and veggies. Hot and service exceptional. Unlimited red wine to go along with it. A must to do in Kinvara.",
          "If the tourism body of Ireland is trying to entice more visitors to Ireland and the Wild Atlantic Way, I would advise Dunguaire Castle to extend their opening hours. What visitor attraction closes at 4.30pm in the height of the summer? It might be a nice castle, but we arrived",
          "you don't need more than 30 minutes at the most for this castle and the 6 euro entrance fee seems a bit much for what you see. but it was still very interesting. the parking lot isn't adjacent to the castle so we had a short walk in the rain to the castle. worth a stop if you're",
          "We didn't have a lot of time to see the castle but what we did see was very nice. Sits high on a bluff overlooking Galway Bay. We did see a number of castles on our tour of Ireland that I would put ahead of Dunguaire but still it was a nice stop.",
          "For our last night in Ireland, we made reservations for the Medieval Dinner at the Dunguaire Castle. First, we were joined by a tour group, which made it very crowded in the reception area, but we all squeezed together and enjoyed our Meade and listened to a harpist, who was",
          "We had a wonderful night here at the castle dinner. the castle was lit up looking magnificent and the meal was nice. Great local entertainment of songs poetry and laughter. I would recommend as something different to do.",
          "I would say an excellent Castle for Medieval Festival and to celebrate small things like Birthday or Wedding Anniversary. When we came to the Castle it was actually full. The people were dressed up into the medieval costumes, the ladies were playing medieval music on the Harps",
          "My brother and I had a great time at the Dunguaire Castle banquet. We did the later dinner. An easy short drive from our B&B in Galway. The food was great, as was the entertainment. It was the only castle that we had the chance to go in while there. It has a circular staircase",
          "Castle definitely worth seeing. Standing on the castle hill you can see a beautiful view of the countryside.",
          "We attempted to book online but the new booking agency put us at another castle by mistake. We arrived and were politely turned away with tickets for the next night. We just switched up our site seeing to make it work. We're glad we went because it's an excellent time. Just",
          "Located in a beautiful location. was a nice stop for us on a day tour. there was a private event going on inside so we did not get to go in but the pictures were great.",
          "Just had a quick walk around as it was quite late so couldn't go inside . Easy to walk to if staying in Kinvara. Stunning views.",
          "Glad we took the time to visit this old Irish castle set in a small bay, it contains a winding stone staircase leading up past the medieval banquet room to the view from the turrets up at the top very interesting.",
          "We had heard about this place but not certain where it was. We were on our way somewhere else and came upon it. So pleased we stopped and went in. It was very interesting. You look around by yourself (have a booklet guide) so you can take as long as you like. We were able",
          "We heard about this castle and read about it online so we knew it was a good place to stop. One of the things I do know before traveling to Ireland is to copy places On Facebook that I like and read about them. I keep the information on my IPad so I can easily get to it. We",
          "Some of the most beautiful scenery in Ireland is found in Kinvara and the Castle is wonderful from the outside. Touring inside the Castle was fun for two 7 year olds, two 30-something year olds, a fifty five year old and one sixty five year old but there were far too many",
          "We just saw it from the road and stopped\ud83d\ude03 Saw it from the outside only. The view of the castle with the surroundings is absolutely amazing. Dinner is served at 1730 and at 2000,depending if enough boomings were done in advancethe cost is 50 euros per person.",
          "Dunguaire Castle is well worth a visit - even if only for a photograph. \"Photogenic\" position on the shore. The coach park is about a ten minutes walk from the Castle - and because the stop is at the end of the Healy Tour - time is at a premium (as many get back to the coach",
          "Dungaire Castle is a stately castle on the outside, but the 6 euro admission fee might be a bit too much. The exhibition room is limited to three floors and the explanatory texts aren't that informative either. So overall impressive on the outside, but a bit too expensive for",
          "We stopped here briefly while driving from Galway to the Cliffs of Moher. Beautiful setting. Our friends paid a few Euros to go inside but we stayed outside. I hear they have a great dinner at night.",
          "Castle is nice but not impressive from the outside. Great spot for picture taking of Kinvara and the surrounding area. Would recommend stopping by. I'm reviewing the Medieval Dinner separately - but I would highly, highly recommend that.",
          "Worth a visit while in Kinvara, amazing views over Kinvara Bay & great place to take photos. A short walk from the village",
          "Dunquaire Castle is not a particularly impressive castle by Irish standards, but its location on Kinvara Bay adds photogenic quality and gives the place a lot of stop-and-have-a-closer-look appeal. It\u2019s very nice inside, and well worth the price of the tour. I attended the",
          "Contrary to many others, this one is in rather good conditions and you can actually visit it! The rooms are nicely furnished and the view from the top of the tower is nice",
          "Dunguaire Castle is a short 2 KM walk from the main square & is beautifully preserved. Lots a great photo opportunities & an opportunity to take a glimpse into the past. If in Kinvara, Dunguaire Castle is a must see",
          "Not too bad of a castle a little small though the six euro admission seemed a bit high, but the castle was nicely furnished and appointed. First note of interest is that the castle was occupied by the owner until 1965, which explains a lot of the modernized furniture in the",
          "My mom and I had so much fun going to the dinner show at the castle. The Castle is beautiful as it sits on the water but even more fun was the dinner show they put on. The meal was delicious and the entertainment was so much fun!",
          "This feast and theatrical production with serene Harp music played live with vocal accompaniment is not to be missed, generous beverage service, generous and excellent food all served up in the Grand Hall and Receiving Foyer of this beautifully romantic castle.",
          "This was a quick stop a long the way but well worth it. Great small place to check out and explore. Always nicer to learn some thing. There is a small fee about 4 \u20ac per person which is more than worth it we thought. There is a small gift shop, restrooms and a coffee cart out",
          "Dunguaire was the second castle we toured during our vacation in Ireland. It was awesome. It is so interesting to see how and why the castles were built, but then also how they evolved over the years. Kinvara itself is a neat place, and Dunguiare is one place that should not",
          "I loved this castle So much history and a real step back in time. My son really enjoyed it also and my partner. Definitely a must see if in the area.",

          "Dungunaire Castle is a neat castle. The free parking is located down the road from the castle. You must park and walk. The tour of the castle is self-guided. The castle is used for parties and events. At the top of the castle are great views of Galway Bay. The water in",
          "We visited here on our tour of Ireland recently. The view of the castle from the road is attractive, but it is a bit disappointing when you enter. The courtyard is small and then there is a tiny gift shop and reception with no room to queue to pay if there are more than a couple",
          "We went to the banquette which was booked out but they kindly got space for the 3 of us. The night couldn't be more perfect! Brilliant artists, nice and well served food with wine included! I'm still delighted! Was the best thing I've ever payed for in Ireland!",
          "we were late to visiting the castle and missed the opportunity to see inside since the banquets had started..............but got to see the outside...a very impressive site worth visiting on the way to Galway",
          "We stoped on the way and entered. They take 8 euro each for one and a half small floors of the Castle. The first floor is a gift shop, 2 of the floors were close for what seems like a private event. The forth and only floor available is a small room and exit to a very nerrow",
          "Stopped here while heading south from Galway to Cliffs of Moher. Not a large castle but worth the stop. There is also a Great craft store with locally made items",
          "Went early in the morn with nobody around castle opens at 1000. Situated in a lovely spot and everything is well maintained. Another great slice of Irish history",
          "We attended the Medieval Feast at Dunguaire Castle, and it was like a journey through time. Quite an enjoyable experience.",
          "Dungaire is a 16C Tower House. It doesn't take long to view the couple of floors inside and is not suitable for wheelchair or mobility impaired people because of the narrow spiral staircase. You can actually get out on the top to take in the views, but it is so narrow two people",
          "We paid \u20ac3.50 student rates to see the castle, and although I enjoyed the history and views, I wouldn't feel I had gotten value for money if I had to pay the full fee. Takes about 40 minutes to view the castle and its grounds and the car park is a short walk away. Crossing the",
          "This is a beautiful location for a quick stop if you are in the area. Lovely pictures and beautiful view of the town. We did not go on the tour of the castle but took many pictures of the area surrounding. Not great parking and very busy with tourists when we stopped by.",
          "This was a nice early morning call and a chance to get up close to an Irish Castle. Did not go in but it was certainly worth a photo stop close to water.",
          "Dropped into Dunguaire on my way through Kinvara. It makes for a beautiful photo and the scenary is stunning. However, the door going inside was closed and didn't look either open or inviting so I simply walked the path around the castle. This took about 4 minutes but there was",
          "One of the fun things about an unplanned vacation is driving along and finding a little gem of a stop. For the past two years my wife and I have taken vacations to Ireland and rented a car and taken us where the the wind blows. We plan a start and stop location and perhaps one",
          "Take a quick and quiet trip back in time by visiting this castle. It is an authentic experience and definitely worth the time and money to visit. The view at the top is truly amazing. Free parking is provided across the street.",
          "After driving over two hours to visit this \"Castle\", what we found was a residence that was open to the public. However the castle had very little in the way of history, information, or viewing rooms. The website looked far better than the actual castle itself.",
          "Though we didn't get to go inside, we did walk around the outside and took some pictures. The castle has an interesting history and if you visit, make sure you can get a peek inside.",
          "Real nice little castle. If you are already on the Wild Atlantic Way it is definitely worth a stop. (there's also a student discount)",
          "Castle Dunguaire buildin 16th century on the south east coast of Galway Bay, near the town of Kinvara, strategic location allowed to fight effectively against the enemy assaults,, Castle consist of a large square tower 25m high, protected by a defensive wall. .Closed in March",
          "We have visit Dunquaire Castle several times and this time we attended the Medieval banquet. We have attended others in Ireland, but felt this was the best. It's smaller than other castle so the dining and program had a more personal feel to it.",
          "We really like Dunguaire Castle, especially its location. Spectacular views and was really cook to see with low tide and the water just running out of the ground flowing out to sea, like a river. While this isn't the largest castle it has been carefully restored. I only wish",
          "Good medieval castle very near Kinvarra, has a lot of steps so be prepared but good view from the top but very narrow to walk round. Wonderful craft shop and nice gift shop.",

          "We happened upon the castle while driving to the Cliffs of Moher. Due to time constraints we didn't have a chance to take the tour, but we did walk up to the castle which has a nice little handcraft shop inside. The castle appears to be well preserved and I would try to find",
          "We arrived early evening in Kinvara so the castle was closed. But, it was only a short walk away from Fallon's B&B, and we took a relaxing evening stroll around the town and castle grounds. The castle sits on Galway Bay and the scenery was beautiful at sunset. Even if you",
          "Popped into Dunguaire Castle. Nice little jewellery shop and gift shop available. Great views from the Machiocolation. Which are common features on Mediaeval castles and tower houses. They were originally intended to give defenders a view of the ground near the walls and make",

          "We stopped by this castle during a trip to Kinvarra and it was beautiful, very picturesque, but unfortunately it wasn't open so we could only walk around the outside! I imagine it's as we aren't in the tourist season yet but we didn't see anywhere beforehand that it wouldn't be",
          "when you arrive from galway this is the first feature that will hit you as you arrive in kinvara.has lovely banquets with music and singing to match to give you that authentic medieval feeling",
          "This charming little castle is an excellent place to stop and wander around. There are medieval dinners to be had if you plan your visit well (and I was very sad that I hadn't the foresight to plan well.). The castle provides an excellent view of Kinvara and the sunset is",
          "This ranks up with one of the best castles in Ireland that we saw. It is well cared for and in wonderful condition. In addition, its location along the coast provides for an interesting photo subject at any time, tide in or tide out. Take a few minutes to explore the waterfront",
          "Not a lot to see here but it's such a great looking castle so why not stop for a photo? There's a little gift shop inside. It's in a picturesque location - you know you want to take a photo of every castle you see in Ireland anyway. Besides, it's free!",
          "Great castle to take a picture. Not much else you can do. There is a small shop inside and you can tour but if you do not bring cash you can't purchase or tour. We found this to be true nearly every place we visited.",
          "Nice photo opportunity. Not much more though. Can live without. Only made a quick stopover with the tour bus here. The interior of the castle is usually open for visitors, or so we were told, but was closed for the time we went there unfortunately. The castle is quite small",
          "It was closed when we were there but it's so darn picturesque, how could be upset? We were able to get close (but not IN) so we took tons of photos and it was so cool to be able to do that. This is my idea of Ireland. Great for a quick visit.",
          "Although you cannot go in it is neat to look at. We were driving through town and the castle is in great shape. You can walk around part of the way during low tide put you cannot enter - at least during the time we were there.",
          "This is a great looking castle and nice and small making for a quick but satisfying visit. You can also walk around the outer wall on narrow but manageable dirt path. It must be fantastic to go to a banquet in the main hall! Walk up the main road a bit for some excellent",
          "Restored 16th Century Tower house on outcrop of Galway Bay. Tours Summer to Fall around $17 US. Medieval Banquets about $52 US. We just stopped for photo op of a restored castle in July 2013. Saved our Medieval Banquet for Bunratty Castle.",
          "Castle restored by Lady Ampthill in the 1960's and later sold to Bord Failte as a tourist destination. Worth a visit but take the time to explore the village and talk to the locals too. several good restaurants and lots of pubs.",
          "Didn't go inside, but stayed in a cottage across the street from the castle. Very picturesque. The water inlet that it sits on adds for beautiful scenery. I hear the banquets inside are rather good!",

          "Interesting to walk thru, climb the tower, and lots of little rooms tucked away. Glad we made the time to stop on our way through the Burren. Important to note that it is not open in October. Fortunately we were here in Sept.",
          "If you are driving along Wild Atlantic Road it is worth to stop in Kinavarra village to take a short walk around the well preserved small medieval castle. This is a good opportunity to take a nice photo, especially in the sunset.",
          "Impressive castle to view from the outside however was closed when I visited so was unable to view he inside.",
          "We stopped in at Dunguaire Castle on our way to explore the Burren, and it was worth the 45 minute diversion. The staff are friendly, and do a good job explaining the history of the castle and it's former inhabitants. The views from the walk around the very top are great,",
          "Quite a treat to visit one of the most iconic castles in Ireland. Unfortunately we were unable to experience the banquet but the visit was interesting and the gift shop quite lovely.",
          "At least one Heritage Ireland website for Dunguaire advertises October hours. To our chagrin we found out October hours are for Oct 1 only, because as of Oct 2 Dunguaire was locked up tight for the season. I felt bad for the hordes of tourists piling off the tour buses, milling",
          "Great small castle to visit. Well maintained and good historical information. We spent a few hours looking around. It would be lovely to visit for the castle dinner on our next visit!",
          "The format of this medieval entertainment and dinner has changed a little but it is still as good as it was in the 1960s. We have excellent memories of our previous visits - all BC (before children). Thoroughly recommended even for first timers - Irish or not.",
          "The castle feels very authentic and the views from the top spectacular. Worth the 6 Euros. Also, be sure to go upstairs in the gift shop.",
          "This is actually a Tower House. It is interesting, but fairly non-descript other than the 77 stairs to get up to the top and the views are lovely. I would give it a better review if admission were free. When the huge buses roll in, it gets pretty crowded. They do offer",
          "Dunguaire Castle is located on the N67, right before entrance to town of Kinvara. There are plenty of signs for it, so, even if your GPS doesn't know how to find it, you won't get lost as long as you set it for Kinvara. There is a large parking lot 2 minutes down the road on",
          "A lovely castle which is very well kept! Lovely place if you like to capture good photography. Do not miss visiting if you're staying at Kinvara vicinity.",
          "Fun evening at the medieval banquet. The food was very good, as well as the wine. Enjoyed the entertainment. Beautiful singing voices and harp music.",
          "At high tide the castle sits almost surrounded by water and is very photogenic. Not to be missed by those driving by. Worthy of walking around the outside.nthe castle itself was closed when my daughter and I visited.",
          "Called in on our way through after a week in the Burren area. Disappointed that for \u20ac6 a head you get a short self guided climb of 3 flights of curved stairs allowing the viewing of each floor and access to the parapet on top. Perhaps guided tours are available and we missed it?",
          "We stopped on our way to Galway. It self guided and you have to climb a circular stairway to view the castle floors. At the top you can walk around the top outside, but some places are very narrow. We didn't stay too long. Gift shop is nice. There is a man making jewelry in",
          "Really enjoyed the evening here, and the entertainment at the banquet. Definitely worth our time and money!",
          "A small but nice castle. Inside has been set up for medieval banquets which give you a view to what the castle would have looked like in its heyday. The view from the roof is a very nice view of the bay. Worth a quick stop, allow 30 min probably not much more time needed there.",
          "Overall, this was a really fun night and we would definitely do it again. The food is average and the actors were good, but the whole experience made it a merry event. The banquet room was atmospheric with the round, stone walls and long banquet tables. One could easily",
          "We stopped here on our trip out of Galway to see the Burran. It is very conveniently located along the way and good for a drive by. We got out to see it but there was no activity and it was closed. Great view from the road but I wouldn\u2019t bother stopping again.",
          "We made a quick stop here when passing through Kinvara. It's such a cool setting, looking out over the lake and the town. We didn't actually pay to go inside, but you can walk around the perimeter without paying, which was fine for us. It didn't seem like it would be worth",
          "I toured this castle because my travel partner is a descendent of the original clan. King Guaire is said to have been so generous that his right arm was longer than his left. I think the castle is somewhat small but l loved it and climbed to the top to see the beautiful view",
          "Short hours, not much there, but photogenic. I didn't go to the big dinner there, but it sounded like it was fun!",
          "Nice castle with great views, didn't pay for tour as thought expensive for what it was. Easy walk the around castle to appreciate the area.",
          "We came upon the castle as we were driving to Galway and decided to stop in for a visit. There is a medieval banquet here, but we arrived too early. But you can purchase a self-guided tour of the castle. It's ok, but a little high priced for what it is.",
          "Lovely castle. Don't suffer from vertigo if you want to go to top. Free car park across road. Nice gift shop.",
          "My husband and I stopped here quickly on our way from Galway to the Cliffs of Moher. It was an unexpected detour as we simply happened upon it while driving through. One of the best pictures from our entire Ireland trip turned out to be of this castle with the evening light as a",
          "Having to pay the steep fee for walking up three flights of stairs that long ago used to be free is a tad bit incredible. But if you can put that aside it is a nice stop. You can take pictures of the castle from the roadside, and the thatch roof houses across the road are",
          "Closed for visitors when we arrived, but one could book a castle dinner night, - so the good thing was it was maintained and kept. Nice location",
          "this little castle looks great from afar, but to see the real inside, you need to bay 6 euros and that seemed a little steep to me. I didn't like that the small courtyard had at least one area (a small staircase up to the wall where I presume you could look through) that was",
          "This was a pretty little castle overlooking the water. We went all the way up to the top and walked around the outside, it had some wonderful views. We enjoyed this stop because it was informative, pretty but did not take up a half a day to see it. Perfect!",
          "Not Bad could of had more to see no guides to show you round overall boring gift shop had many unique items for sale though",

          "This tiny castle...tower house...was just the right size for my granddaughter's first castle. We began with a short narration and then enjoyed exploring on our own. My granddaughter had lots of fun taking photos both inside and out. The rooftop view was wonderful. We saved a",

          "Although we were unable to enter the castle when we visited due to an ongoing ceremony at that time, we were able to walk around the grounds and take pictures of the outside. Dunguaire Castle is easily the most photogenic castle we experienced during our time in Ireland. Perhaps",
          "Kinvara is on your way to the Burren . The village has stunning views over galway bay. The castle is stunning and has banquettes during the summer. There are many lively bars and restaurants to relax in and have a bite to eat and just chill. Love this place",
          "We went in the afternoon to tour the \"castle\". It is not a castle, but a tower home. There was not much to see and there was almost no room to walk around outside on the top of the tower. Not much to see from the top. Save your money for something else. We did not go to the",
          "The castle has a very interesting past and is well worth a visit since it is very accessible for a short visit. But to really appreciate the place, book an evening at the evening banquet. The meal its self was better than I expected, but they do have a full kitchen in the",

          "I was really excited to visit this location having seen beautiful pictures, When we arrived it was a lovely day but the tide was out so unfortunately the stunning vista I'd expected was mostly sea-weed. We paid in and my partner handed in a \u20ac20 which had been roughly folded. He",
          "This castle is located in a very picturesque location and it looks very nice from outside. Inside I don't think it is worth the entry fee as the interior is quite simple and basic. Views from the top are very nice. So if you are around go and visit it, but only pay admission if",
          "Beautiful Old World Castle that holds volumes and volumes of stories, real and imagined. Even though enchanting it must have also been a hard life.",
          "A lovely stop over on the WAW. Outside the traffic hubbub of Galway and back on the coastal road is this quaint old tower house. There are many of these along the West Coast but this one is better preserved than many and was lived in by a Lady Something who made it an eccentric",
          "This castle to me was just okay. When compared to Kylemore Abbey, I think it's just an okay castle. I've heard of its use as a location for various events. When I visited, it was a nice spring day and it was cool to just walk around the location and check out a little bit of",
          "I happened upon this castle unexpectedly on my way to the Burrnen via Kinvara. It was a lovely castle, perched on the edge of the bay. As it was February, it was not open, but still fun to traipse around and snap a few photos. Would have loved to tour it, but another time.",
          "We traveled in January and had checked online ahead of time, where it noted that admission was from 10am to 4pm year round, so were a little disappointed to find that it was closed the day we visited - if the inside tour is important to you, be sure to double check whether or",

          "This relatively small castle has a rich history, including its literary history when owned by physician-poet-patriot Oliver St. John Gogarty who hosted William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory, George Bernard Shaw, et al. We attended the \"medieval\" meal and musical program. The food,",
          "This makes a nice little pit stop to get out and stretch your legs. There is a bathroom, but you must pay the tour fee of a few euro to use it. The tour is not guided but still a nice castle to explore. We visited when the tide was out, so there was not water near the castle.",
          "My mom has a love for castles like none other, so when she wanted my dad, husband, and I to stop in so she could visit, we resisted since we thought we'd never make it to our destination. This turned out to be well worth it! I wasn't sure what it would be like, but we paid a",
          "Very enjoyable evening. Good food, good entertainment in an intimate banquet setting. The host provided a very interesting musical history of the castle. Well worth the money. It's listed as only 10 minutes walk from the centre of Kinvara - I would put it at more like 20 minutes.",
          "This was one of the first castles we drove past while in Ireland. We decided to not pay the \u20ac to take a tour since there was no guide. We walked around the outside of the castle. Don't miss the jewelry maker who makes his own jewelry above the shop! My sister in law and I bought",

          "\u20ac6 entry charge is a bit too much to charge for what you get to see and no tour guide. Not completely authentic, too much modern reconstruction. Probably a good banqueting facility. Best views are from outside the castle on a sunny day. The castle is very photogenic against the",
          "Another castle along the road to somewhere else. It was small and nice. Sits near a small village and seems to fit in well with the fabric of their day. I wasn't there for one of the banquets but that seems like it would be a good time. Good view, recommend stopping in if",
          "We found this castle purely by accident, travelling up from Shannon to Galway on the scenic coastal road. We had been trying to plan a route back down from Galway to the Cliffs of Moher the following day, which we would be doing with family members who had not travelled this",

          "If castles are your thing this is a great example of a classic Irish one. You can get great views of the castle from all around. Some of the best are from near the car park. we paid to go in and spent a 20 mins looking around. The views from the roof are worth the entry fee",
          "We stopped as we saw this castle on our way to the cliffs. There is a small entrance fee to tour it, and a gift shop. Takes about 20-30 min total. Not a large castle. We couldn't book the dinner as it is pretty busy in the summer.",

          "We were driving past the castle and saw a lot of people touring around, so we decided to stop in. When we arrived at the gate, there was a man handing out tickets. We asked how much and he said they were free. So we went in. Once inside the castle, they were handing out mugs of",
          "Rated as the most photographed castle in Ireland you can see why from the parking area. We happened upon this castle on our way to the Cliffs of Moher. The entrance fee was a bit pricey but exploring the castle was great. Just happened to meet a couple from Canada inside the",
          "If you want to climb through an interesting castle, this is a good one. A little pricey but I imagine upkeep is expensive. Only takes an hour to go through and we walked the perimeter as well. Erosion is doing quite a number on the site...not sure how long they have before",
          "This castle was beautiful, inside and out. It was in such a picturesque location, with a lot of history. I think it was worth the money, even if just to get a feel of medieval times.",
          "When we went in early July there was availability on the 5:30 dinner even though I booked online months before. The castle is quaint and scenery is beautiful. We went during the day and found out we could tour the castle that afternoon and then come back for the dinner. We",
          "It was neat that you could walk up and in without paying, but the cost was not worth it (we opted not for like 6 euros a person). I wish it was more reasonably priced. We were able to walk around the castle outside. It was just a brief stop - if you take a tour I think you",
          "Splendid 'castle' on a rock outcropping just outside of Kinvarra - we were lucky to be there on a sunny day and at low tide - we walked to the top and around the upper roofline, but more interesting was learning about what an Irish Tower House was, and recognizing the experience",
          "This venue caters to groups. Could not get dinner at 5:30pm because this was blocked by a coach company who shall be nameless. Went on line and every day is blocked. Had to dine at 9:00pm and sit with another group. They seemed happy but complained it was to late for seniors.",
          "This was a great stop on the way to the lovely town of Ennis. The roads to get there seem to get more and more narrow but by the time you get arrive to see this delightful castle, you will become enchanted. Get ready for stairs though. It's the only way to see everything.",
          "We stopped off here on our way from Galway to Cliffs of Moher. I'm not sure that the castle is 'big' enough to warrant the entrance fee, so we didn't do the tour, rather walked there, had a look around, bought some excellent jewelry from the onsite jewellery maker (Thom Brady),",

          "We absolutely hate ever giving bad reviews, but in this instance we feel the need to warn others after our experience. This is an Irish style of castle and so we expected a lot of spiral stairs, there were four adults and three dogs, we accepted that the dogs would have to",
          "As castles go, this is a small one, next to a rather weak river. The setting from the outside is pretty, however. It's probably worth the small admission fee to go inside the castle, although there isn't really that much to see. It's damp, with a musty, moldy smell that gives",
          "Just popped over from Ballyvaughan to see the town of Kinvara and the castle. Lovely views of the castle from the road and up to the walls, though we did not take in the whole site. Kinvara is a postcard-picture village. Well worth the time, even for such a short visit.",
          "Very pretty setting and view. Worth pulling over for pictures. The drive along this area is very nice. Good parking and free to castle.",
          "Thought we'd take a break and check out the castle. We didn't have time to do a tour but we explored the outside and some of the inside. It's not as big as some of the other castles we'd seen but it had some unique features and it seemed to be in better shape.",
          "We had the place almost to ourselves! We arrived just a few minutes prior to the opening time, just by happenchance. We are glad we waited a few minutes to tour the inside. Worth a stop!",
          "We happened to drive by on our way to Doolin and decided to stop by to take in the views of and from the castle. The 6 euro price for the ticket was a little steep compared to what we paid for other tourist spots, but we had the place to ourselves which was nice. Each floor",

          "We had read that the castle is open from 10am. We got there about 10:30am and it was locked up and not a sole was around. We decided to look at gets we could. It is a magical place even though we could only see through the locked gates. We did walk around the castle amongst the",
          "While you can pay to enter the castle, it is not really big enough to justify the fee (Eur 6/Person). The bay views around the castle are perfect, with the little town of Kinvarra in the background. Walking around the grounds gives you plenty of great vantage points. You",
          "This one of the more well-preserved castles in Ireland, and the local gov't should be commended for its fine work. The castle is easy to find, and even if closed for the season, one can come through the gates and enjoy the ambiance of the environment.",

          "Although I wasn't expecting much we decided to check out the castle before leaving the area. It was very interesting and the docent was so well informed that we learned a lot about the history of the castle and the town. The view from the top was worth the climb up the stairs",
          "We toured this attraction on our way out of town, and were not disappointed. We learned a lot about the history of the castle, as well as the woman who was generous enough to do much of the restoration. The view from the top of the castle was spectacular!",
          "Fortunately, I knew quite a lot about this castle before I visited, so my expectations were realistic. I knew it was small; I knew it was an Irish fortified house built by an Irish clan chieftan. For me, this was just more reason to visit rather than less. I was here in",

          "Ireland has many castles but this one was one of my favorites. The parking was easy, it wasn't too crowded, they had clean bathrooms, and it was a very well preserved castle. The interesting history was readily available and the furnishings made it all more interesting. Well",

          "We did not visit the castle during the day. Instead we purchased the Medevial banquet attraction. The castle itself isn't much to speak of but the experience of the banquet was definitely worth the money. You are greated with Mead and Fruit punch while you listen to beautiful",

          "It was a neat experience and a nice family price of 13.50 Euros for the six of us.",

      "name": "Legend of the Claddagh Ring",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Claddagh ring (Irish: f\u00e1inne Chladaigh) is a traditional Irish ring which represents love, loyalty, and friendship (the hands represent friendship, the heart represents love, and the crown represents loyalty).The design and customs associated with it originated in the Irish fishing village of the same name in Galway. The ring, as currently known, was first produced in the 17th century.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Claddagh ring belongs to a group of European finger rings called \"fede rings\". The name \"fede\" derives from the Italian phrase mani in fede (\"hands [joined] in faith\" or \"hands [joined] in loyalty\"). These rings date from Roman times, when the gesture of clasped hands was a symbol of pledging vows, and they were used as engagement/wedding rings in medieval and Renaissance Europe.Fede rings are distinctive in that the bezel is cut or cast to form two clasped hands that symbolize  \"plighted troth\". The Claddagh ring is a variation on the fede ring, while the hands, heart, and crown motif was used in England in the early 18th century.Towards the end of the 20th century there was an explosion of interest in the Claddagh Ring, both as jewelry and as an icon of Irish heritage. In recent years it has been embellished with interlace designs and combined with other Celtic and Irish symbols, but this is a very recent phenomenon that corresponds with the worldwide expansion in popularity of the Claddagh ring as an emblem of Irish identity.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nGalway has produced Claddagh rings continuously since at least 1700, but the name \"Claddagh ring\" was not used before the 1830s. Although there are various myths and legends around the origin of the Claddagh ring, it is almost certain that it originated in or close to the small fishing village of Claddagh in Galway.As an example of a maker, Bartholomew Fallon was a 17th-century Irish goldsmith, based in Galway, who made Claddagh rings until circa 1700. His name first appears in the will of one Dominick Martin, also a jeweller, dated 26 January 1676, in which Martin willed Fallon some of his tools. Fallon continued working as a goldsmith until 1700. His are among the oldest surviving examples of the Claddagh ring, in many cases bearing his signature.There are many legends about the origins of the ring, particularly concerning Richard Joyce, a silversmith from Galway circa 1700, who is said to have invented the Claddagh design as we know it. Legend has it that Joyce was captured and enslaved by Algerian Corsairs around 1675 while on a passage to the West Indies; he was sold into slavery to a Moorish goldsmith who taught him the craft. King William III sent an ambassador to Algeria to demand the release of any and all British subjects who were enslaved in that country, which at the time would have included Richard Joyce. After fourteen years, Joyce was released and returned to Galway and brought along with him the ring he had fashioned while in captivity: what we've come to know as the Claddagh.  He gave the ring to his sweetheart, married, and became a goldsmith with \"considerable success\". His initials are in one of the earliest surviving Claddagh rings, but there are three other rings also made around that time, bearing the mark of goldsmith Thomas Meade.\nThe Victorian antiquarian Sir William Jones described the Claddagh, and gives Chambers' Book of Days as the source, in his book Finger Ring Lore. Jones says: The clasped hands [style ring]... are... still the fashion, and in constant use in [the]... community [of] Claddugh  [sic] at [County] Galway.... [They] rarely [intermarry] with others than their own people.\nAn account written in 1906 by William Dillon, a Galway jeweller, claimed that the \"Claddagh\" ring was worn in the Aran Isles, Connemara and beyond. Knowledge of the ring and its customs spread within Ireland and Britain during the Victorian period, and this is when its name became established. Galway jewellers began to market it beyond the local area in the 19th century. Further recognition came in the 20th century.In his 1911 book Rings for the Finger, American mineralogist George Frederick Kunz addresses the importance of gold wedding rings in Ireland but does not mention the Claddagh ring. He does, however, include a photo of one, captioned with its correct name. Furthermore, it is unclear exactly how or when the ring was brought to the United States.\n\n\n== Usage and symbolism ==\nThe Claddagh's distinctive design features two hands clasping a heart and usually surmounted by a crown. These elements symbolize the qualities of love (the heart), friendship (the hands), and loyalty (the crown). A \"Fenian\" Claddagh ring, without a crown, is a slightly different take on the design but has not achieved the level of popularity of the crowned version. Claddagh rings are relatively popular among the Irish and those of Irish heritage, such as Irish Americans, as cultural symbols and as friendship, engagement and wedding rings.While Claddagh rings are sometimes used as friendship rings, they are most commonly used as engagement and wedding rings. Mothers sometimes give these rings to their daughters when they come of age. There are several mottos and wishes associated with the ring, such as: \"Let love and friendship reign.\" In Ireland, the United States, Canada, and other parts of the Irish diaspora, the Claddagh is sometimes handed down mother-to-eldest daughter or grandmother-to-granddaughter.According to Irish author Colin Murphy, a Claddagh ring was worn with the intention of conveying the wearer's relationship status:\n\nOn the right hand with the point of the heart toward the fingertips: the wearer is single and might be looking for love.\nOn the right hand with the point of the heart toward the wrist: the wearer is in a relationship; someone \"has captured their heart\"\nOn the left ring finger with the point of the heart toward the fingertips: the wearer is engaged.\nOn the left ring finger with the point of the heart toward the wrist: the wearer is married.There are other localised variations and oral traditions, in both Ireland and the Irish diaspora, involving the hand and the finger on which the Claddagh is worn. Folklore about the ring is relatively recent, not ancient, with \"very little native Irish writing about the ring\", hence, the difficulty today in finding any scholarly or non-commercial source that explains the traditional ways of wearing the ring.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEcclesiastical ring\nEngagement ring\nLuckenbooth brooch\nPre-engagement ring\nWedding ring\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n18th century Claddagh ring \u2013 Victoria and Albert museum",

        "wiki": "The River Corrib (Irish: Abhainn na Gaillimhe) in the west of Ireland flows from Lough Corrib through Galway to Galway Bay. The river is among the shortest in Europe, with only a length of six kilometres from the lough to the Atlantic. It is popular with local whitewater kayakers as well as several rowing clubs and pleasure craft. The depth of this river reaches up to 94 feet.The Corrib drains a catchment area of 3,138 km2.Although the Corrib is one of Ireland's shortest rivers, it has a mean long-term flow rate of 104.8 m3/s, making it Ireland's second-largest river (by flow), only surpassed by the River Shannon.\n\n\n== Naming ==\nThe translation of the Irish name of the river is Galway river i.e. from Gaillimh. In Irish it is sometimes called An Ghaillimh (\"the Galway\") and also incorrectly called Abhainn na Coiribe. The legend concerning its naming states that it was called after Gaillimh inion Breasail, the daughter of a Fir Bolg chieftain who drowned in the river. The word Gaillimh is believed to mean \"stony\" as in \"stony river\". The commonly held myth that the city takes its name from the Irish word Gallaibh, \"foreigners\" i.e. \"the town of the foreigners\" (from Gall, a foreigner) is incorrect as the name Gaillimh was applied to the river first and then later onto the town. Indeed, the earliest settlement at Galway was called D\u00fan Bhun na Gaillimhe, or \"the fort at the end of the Galway (river)\".\n\nThe river gave its name to the town, which grew to a city, and from c. 1570 onwards, the city gave its name to the county. It also aided massively in the industrial development of the town, allowing it to develop electrical power before London. At the height of water power, there were over twenty water wheels in operation from races built on the river and its accompanying cut, the Eglinton Canal, which was built as part of the \"Drainage and Navigation scheme of Lough Carra, Lough Corrib and Lough Mask\" in the mid-19th century. The canal, which is about three-quarters of a mile long, had a sea-lock, a large basin, a second lock at Parkavore and five swivelling bridges. It is still in water but the swivelling bridges have been replaced by fixed bridges; the last vessel to use the navigation was the Amo II, a 90' motor-yacht that had been sold by the Guinness trustees to Frank Bailey, a Galway hotelier.Lough Corrib is the anglicised form of Loch Coirib which itself is a corruption of Loch nOrbsean which, according to placename lore, is named after the Irish god of the sea. There is good fishing to be had on both the lake and river.\nPtolemy's Geography (2nd century AD) described a river called \u0391\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1 (Ausoba) which probably referred to the River Corrib.\n\n\n=== Upper and Lower Corrib ===\n\nThe part of the river that flows from the southern end of the lake to the Salmon Weir is known as the Upper Corrib. The weir, a set of weir gates also built during the above navigation scheme, was originally built from stone and timber but now only two of these gates remain and are only opened in times of flood. The rest have been replaced by fourteen steel gates, as shown in the photograph above.\nThe main channel leaving Lough Corrib is called Friars' Cut or Friars' River (Irish: Abhainn na mBr\u00e1ithre) as it is the result of a very early piece of canal engineering. In 1178 the friars of Claregalway Abbey, being tired of the long detour they had to make to the west to enter the river, asked permission from the Blakes of Menloe to make an artificial cut, which in time became the main course of the river and was then widened.The section of the river that runs from the Salmon Weir through Galway city and out into Galway Bay is known as the Lower Corrib. Three bridges cross the Lower \u2013 the Salmon Weir Bridge, William O'Brien Bridge and Wolfe Tone Bridge.\nThe only tributary of the Lower Corrib is Sruth\u00e1n na gCaisle\u00e1in (Castle Stream) known by whitewater kayakers as the Shit Chute and the access point to the river, a small stream that flows through Newcastle, the grounds of NUI Galway, and empties into the Lower just downstream of King's weir, commonly known as the fish gates.\nThe official publication of NUI Galway, Cois Coiribe, is named in reference to the Corrib.\n\n\n== Bridges ==\n\nFour bridges span Corrib in Galway.

We did the Vault, most of us already did escape games in their lives, but still didn\u2019t make it out in time ! I greatly recommend",

My boyfriend and I weren\u2019t able to escape in the hour, but with a group of people it\u2019s more doable. Definitely going to come back and",

          "On a girls weekend away in Galway, we stumbled upon The Great Escape Rooms in the centre of the city close to Eyre Square. We enquired whether they could squeeze us in last minute for an escape room and despite being busy, they got us in and made sure we had a blast of a time.",

          "It was good but when you got clues you didn't get enough info as to what to do u had to ring all the time which was OK but u had to ring quiet a bit so it was a little silly ,both rooms felt the same boys against girls ages between 30. ...40 staff were good. Very help full",
          "Had a couple of friends visiting from out of town and this was the perfect activity for a floody day! We had a ball and thankfully managed to escape with 4 minutes to spare!!",
          "The kids had a brilliant time and we\u2019re delighted to get out of the hardest room with 6 seconds to spare !!! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "It was one of the best experiences I've had in a very long time. Myself and my girlfriend had a fantastic time. We will definitely b back to try the other 2 rooms.",
          "Our group (of 7) went to try the hardest Quarantine room. It was challenging and fun. Could have done it without help, but under pressure of time asked twice only to find out that we were on the right track. Got out in 47 min. All group had fun and everyone could participate,",
          "A friend and I did the Escape Rooms not really knowing what they were about, such fun, most enjoyable",
          "Group of 6 people, 2 tenns. It was a very enjoyable experience. Takes a few minutes to figure out what you need to do, but it gets exciting the future you go.",
          "The staff members were really helpful and friendly. Explained everything really well because it was our 1st time. The game was great while being tricky. Would recommend it",
          "a great way to see if your better at problem solving and team work than your friends, colleagues or family... whoever you go with you will have to do a bit of lateral thinking. I can't wait to try the new rooms soon",
          "This was an absolutely amazing experience! It was the first time we have ever done this type of thing. I found it while searching TripAdvisor for things to do in Galway. We walked in with no reservation and were given a spot within a couple of hours, which isn't bad knowing now",
          "Great fun for a group or twosome so pass a few hours. highly entertaining. We did the The Auld Shebeen Traditional Irish Pub and got out in under an hour with a little help from the very helpful employee who provided hints when requested :)",
          "We all had a really good day and enjoyed it. Staff are very friendly. It is very fun and exciting. Would highly recommend for parties, families, etc.",
          "Visited great escape rooms as part of a hen party! Great fun. Nice to do with a few people also. Staff were very nice. Great activity for an hour.",
          "Went with two friends and did the Ould Shebeen. We had never done anything like it before and we all really enjoyed it.",
          "We had great fun in the escape room. I would highly recommend this as an activity though beware. You might get addicted.",
          "Tried both the prison room and the asylum! Both very challenging but fair. Thoroughly enjoyed it!!!!",
          "I've been to the Great Escape Rooms twice and each time was great fun! The staff are super friendly and overall it's a great experience which I would recommend to anyone!",
          "This is second time going to escape room, was great experience and the two rooms are very different with much harder challenges , can\u2019t wait to do third room",
          "I\u2019ve visited lots of escape rooms and most of them had a lot of codes to crack and puzzles to solve. The prison break seemed to be lacking in the number of puzzles to solve, especially when 6 people were in the room. A good room for two but not enough for six. I look forward to",
          "We went to the escape rooms in Galway as our first escape room experience, and now we are hooked! Such great fun and challenging! Came back again few months later with my friends and 6 of us did the quarantine room was pretty tricky but brilliant fun!!! Will definitely be back",
          "We had an awesome time and were treated so well! Can\u2019t wait to go again! It is finally something else to do in the Rockford area.",
          "I tried all three rooms and each was unique and challenging! I loved working with my friend to solve the puzzles, and we had a great time!",
          "Great way to pass an hour and the staff are nice and friendly. Tried 2 of the rooms so far (pub and prison) and looking forward to trying the next 1. Would definitely recommend it to friends.",
          "4 of us decided to book in while staying in Galway for the weekend. Great afternoon out. Book the quarantine room!!",
          "Best fun ever, can't wait to go back. Online booking was easy. Good value for money. Haven't laughed so much for ages, real adrenaline kick. Our host was so lovely. Thank you.",
          "Had a fantastic experience in the prison room. Would encourage everyone to give it a go. Can't wait to go back and try the other rooms now. You must be very patient in this room.",
          "This was my first time trying one of these escape room places and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. You need to try one of these.",
          "Tried this out while in Galway and it was good fun. We did it as a couple and tried the asylum room. Unfortunately we didn't escape but it was still really enjoyable! The staff were lovely and it was very well thought out. We'll be back to try out the other rooms and try to",
          "We visited today as family of two adults and two teenagers, (13 and 14 ). It was the quickest hour of our lives and we enjoyed every second. We did not manage to escape within the hour but if we had maybe another 10 min we could have cracked it. Already we are looking forward to",
          "Today we returned to Great Escaoe Rooms having done the Pub previously and failed it in the last minute! It was fabulous though. Anyway today we tried the Prison escape and succeeded. So proud! The staff are great. Incredibly friendly and more importantly helpful! We will be",
          "You barely notice the hour fly by, suitable for most ages, great family activity, will be back soon.",
          "We had a really great time at the Great Escape Rooms! Staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and explained everything really well! We would highly recommend this to families, groups of friends, team building etc! We survived and didn\u2019t kill each other trying to get out! We",
          "The Galway escape rooms were fantastic, we tried the prison escape room. The staff were lovely and also very helpful when giving details of the game and getting hints. I would definitely recommend the escape rooms and will most likely be coming back!",
          "We came across the Escape Rooms after looking through trip advisor for something different to do in Galway outside the usual tourist stuff. Based on the number of 'excellent' reviews, we booked the Pub Escape for myself, my wife and our 3 teenage children. We weren't sure of",
          "There is two men working there and they are both very nice and helpful. I did the Beer Room the set was very good and I enjoyed the puzzles. Me and my wife got out with a few minutes to spare so I was delighted. I would recommend it to everyone to give it a go, I promise you",
          "Had never even heard of things like this until a couple of months ago and now I'm obsessed !! What clever ideas! I loved it from start to finish, even when my boyfriend and I were on the edge of killing each other!! We did the pirate room but didn't make it out!! Apparently we",
          "Great way to spend an hour, especially on a rainy day. Harder than we probably anticipated as none of us had ever tried anything like it so did need a clue or two however made it out in the final minute! It was something different for our family which included 3 generations and",
          "We have just completed our 3rd room in 3 days. We were addicted from the first, the only problem is that there are only 3 rooms!! We did the prison break first then the pub room and lastly the hospital quarantine. The prison and the hospital Ones were our favourite. The 3 staff",
          "Visited the Great Escape Room Galway for the first time with my girlfriend & all I can say is I hope it isnt our last! Our third overall escape room & so far our favourite. Room was challenging but easy to follow & thoroughly enjoyable! The two members of staff there were",
          "We had never been to one before didnt know what to expect. The girl at the reception was real helpful friendly and great crack. We had an hour to escape the room with a few sneaky hints we got out with literally seconds to spare. We had a fun day out it was really clever and",
          "really great, challenging, as a family it was interesting to see how we all work.....differently It is only an hour long, too short for us. A point to note, the pricing, Online doesn't quote /charge student prices, but when you go , you can claim the discount back, if you",
          "I've done a couple of these previously & have found them hit & miss. This one, though is very well organised. I came her with my wife & sister. It was my sister who booked the experience for my birthday. And we did the quarantine one - the most difficult one. My idea is that",
          "A fantastic place right in the heart of Galway city I relly enjoyed the place I would give 100 of 100 kept up the fantastic works see ye sometime again from Sir Tony Judge athenry Co Galway",
          "If this isn't your first escape room, you might find it a bit different to what you're used to, but still a good challenge. If this is your first escape room then it's a great first room. Looking forward to trying the other rooms.",
          "Had a great time. This was the first escape room I had done, will definitely go back and do another room. Very friendly staff as well.",
          "Went with a group of four to the quarantine room and had such a great time we came back the next day!",
          "We went to pub room with 2 kids (8 & 9). Absolutely fantastic experience. Staff very friendly and full of energy. We are organising going back to do another room very soon! A must do......",
          "I enjoyed it but we got it done relatively fast as one of the puzzles were already solved before we got into the (prison escape) room. We probably would've enjoyed it more if that wasn't the case. Bit pricey but it's a nice team building activity. Very friendly staff.",
          "We had a great girls night at the escape rooms. We did the pub room and had a fantastic time. We laughed and talked about it so much afterwards. It was so much fun!! We will be trying another room sometime soon and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is up for a fun",
          "With my son (13) , we get in while visiting Galway in the evening. We were excited to know there was a possible \"prison break\" starting in ten minutes. Carolyn was a great host setting up the ambiance and helping us when needed ! We are from France and we successfully escaped,",
          "A really fun experience! Perfect for all ages , We are from Sweden and it was no problem understanding what we were supposed to do, the girl who work there was fun and very welcoming , everyone should try this :)",
          "My friend and I did the prison room and even though we failed to escape in time we had so much fun! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to do something fun and a bit different. We can't wait to go back and try the other rooms....we are already planning our next visit!",
          "Really nice staff and really enjoyed the room itself. Also they allowed us to bring two small kids for free, really sound crowd",
          "We called in on the off chance and were able to get into the quarantine hospital room. It was brilliant, and we almost made it out; 5 more minutes and we'd have done it!! The girl on reception was lovely and if you go to Galway give it a go, it's great craic and you won't be",
          "14 women for a hen party - 7 into the Auld Shebeen and then the other 7 into the prison cell. Absolutely great craic collecting clues and working as a team. Will definitely return to do the other rooms. Both teams managed to escape within 10 seconds of each other and under the",
          "We booked the auld Shebeen room and as a family that loves games and puzzles we expected it to be fun. It was our first time trying something like this in real life but we've all played games and Aps along similar lines. We had a ball! It's just like in the games without giving",
          "My two teenagers and I booked the prison room, and had such a great time, we went back two days later for the quarantine room. The staff here are very friendly and help you if needed, without giving too much of the puzzles away. One of the best things we did in Galway!",
          "Loved it & would love to do another room. The hour went way too fast though! Staff were enthusiastic.",
          "A hidden gem in the heart of the city! The staff are beyond helpful and their feel good attitude is contagious. Completed the Quarantine Room and it was a great way to test team work skills and knowledge. Really tests the mind at times but well worth a try!",
          "First time here. Chose the prison option. There was 8 of us on a night out. Great fun working as a team to figure out the clues. Staff very friendly. Want to go back again & choose a different room. Great way to spend a night out for a group, max is 1 hour, include it as go",
          "Really enjoyed this. We did the bar one and it was really interesting. The hour flew by. Really well done and the staff were very friendly. Definitely going to make a point of going back to galway to try the other two!",
          "Staff very firendly build up good blindfolded until you enter the room and then a voiceover tells you have an hour to escape the prision room. very well done if you get into the zone and can ask for clues if needed. Escaped with 35 seconds to spare . will return to do the other",
          "We had a lot of fun doing this escape room. We did the Pub and Prison rooms and enjoyed both. Only wish we had more time to do their hardest room. Definitely worth checking out.",
          "We did the pub escape room and its was great fun. Wasn't too hard but we did get clues when we really needed them! Lovely staff. Great experience.",
          "Had a fantastic time in the prison break room! Staff were so lovely and really get you excited for the room :) definitely challenging but we'll worth a trip! Determined to go back and escape :)",
          "This was just amazing way to pass an hour. A group of 2 adults and 3 \"kids\" aged 17,13,11. Had a ball. Got locked in a pub and had to solve clues to get door opened in one hour. We all loved it. Definitely a fan way to work as a team and pass some time. Will definitely be back",
          "The girl working there was so nice! We did the quarantine one but did get a couple of hints! Really fun & I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",
          "This is a \"do not miss\" activity in Galway! The staff were so great-we went back for a second go in one of the other rooms and they made us feel like family! This was a challenging, bonding activity that we supremely enjoyed together!",
          "A group of us visited the Escape rooms in Galway recently. We were down for a weekend to the city and were interested in things that were in the city centre. This was a very entertaining hours work. It's a team effort and quite a challenge , especially for novices such as",
          "We loved escape the room. The staff were so friendly and very accommodating. We went for a hen and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.",
          "This is a fantastic activity that will test your mental ability. We were a group of fourteen that were on a stag weekend and booked two rooms (challenges) of three available, in this attraction. The staff there are excellent and Carolyn and David made it a very easy to book the",
          "My partner and I decided that on a cloudy day why not try the Escape Rooms and it was great fun. We did the pub room and we were happy to say Brendans reciepe is safe with us. The host was super friendly and overall the whole experience was really cool. We will be back to try",
          "First time, just in galway for the weekend with the wife. We had a great time! Highly recommend! Something different!",
          "Immersive, Exciting and Difficult. Brilliant group activity! Knock your heads together and work as a team to escape. Great way to spend some time.",
          "Really enjoyable, get the brain working again . Went with 4 people just enough and a good group. Fun day out.",
          "I had previously played in a Great Escape room when I was abroad and I was hooked. I didn't notice that there were ones in Ireland until late last year. I brought my partner with me on an alternative Valentine's date and he loved it. It really gets you thinking logically and",
          "I'm from America and my friends and I visited Ireland in July of 2016 shortly after graduating high school. We went here and escaped from the room quarantine in 58 minutes. The lady helping was so nice. It was such a stressful time since my friends and I are so competitive but",
          "Fantastic time, great service and atmosphere. Will be going back for definite. Great for double date too.",
          "What more can I say. Great experience. In my experience the Pub is more difficult than the Prison - but great for the family, friends, etc etc. Once you have seen the beach and the local sights - this should be the next thing on your list.",
          "Been here twice now and booking my third and final visit! Something totally different to do with friend and family. Would highly recommend for anyone and everyone",
          "Locked in a pub, with no beer, while some others were locked in a prison, that\u2019s the scenario we found ourselves in, on a recent Stag Party, while visiting The Great Escape Rooms in Galway. Given one hour to escape, we had to solve mind blowing puzzles, while searching for clues",
          "Very enjoyable, adults and teens had great time. Escaped from jail cell before time up with a few clues. Great friendly staff. Highly recommended. Looking forward to returning soon",
          "We have done prison break and quarantine, both are absolutely brilliant!!!! U really need to use your head so I wouldn't suggest doing this after a few drinks! It's our new addiction can't wait to try the next one!",
          "We booked a couple of weeks ago for my daughter's 10th birthday party. We all enjoyed our time, from the 7 year mold to the 45 year old! The staff were really helpful, and thoughtful, they even had gone to the bakery to get a cupcake for the birthday girl. We had great fun",
          "An amazing concept and well executed! Me and my girlfriend had a great hour trying to figure out the puzzle! We won and it was the most amazing feeling! Would highly recommend, will be back next time we are in galway.",
          "Probably the best way to spend an hour. Whether your a couple, group of friends or work related there is something for everyone here. We were walking through the city when we came across this place.... starting with 'prison room' we got pushed to are limits as the clock counted",
          "Went with my girlfriend and we had so much craic we came back the next day with backup tp try the next room!\ud83d\ude01",
          "Tricky challenge to get out of the room but there's plenty of clues to work out so everyone should see some progress.",
          "We had our family here just for a weekend but the weather wasn't too good so we decided to go there, definitely I highly recomen it! The staff is friendly and helpful, as my family didn't speak English, and they did the experience even better! So much fun to be there and feeling",
          "We had intended to visit the escape rooms for a while now. My Sister visits me about 3 times a year and was always mentioning it as an activity. We finally visited in December 2016. 3 adults and 2 children aged 11 & 12. We just completed the Pub in time and we all had a great",
          "Great couple of hours fun to break up the day and keep us outta the pubs for a bit. Highly recommend.",
          "Superior room themes and puzzles! Still my favourite, will be back to complete the others. Since done another in another city but not as good!",
          "I didn't know what to expect when agreeing to have a go but was blown away by how well put together the experience was, we did the prison cell escape as we didn't know what to expect so went for the 'easiest' one which was more than challenging and definitely good value for",
          "So me and my boyfriend went to the escape rooms while staying in Galway city. We had the best fun trying to figure out all the steps! The staff were great and soo helpful when we got stuck and were useless lol. All the staff were very friendly and made the experience fab. As for",
          "Visited with my boyfriend who was over from Texas. The staff were wonderful and very accommodating! From the minute we walked in the door, we were made to feel so welcome. This was my second visit and I was not disappointed! We will definitely be back!",
          "Four of us tried the Quarantine Room today and escaped with our health intact! It was very challenging but heaps of fun. The staff were very friendly and congratulated us when we escaped. We did need a few clues along the way but we expected that. None of us had ever done an",
          "The woman at the counter was a delight, good for the craic, patient with questions, and explained everything clearly. We did the Hospital Room, we (a group of 7) solved it in 40 minutes because one of our party went searching and found a major clue that cut a lot of the chase",
          "I brought my girlfriend there for her birthday, and it was really exciting ! The pub was really challenging so I hope to test the other ones soon.",
          "6 of us went down to galway for the weekend in late may for the nightlife. We had no plans for during the day but came across great escape rooms when walking around the town one day! We went in and asked what it was because none of us had ever done anything like it. We then",
          "Me and my friend did this as we had time to kill. Found it on trip advisor so thought why not. Only 20 euros so not too pricey for a tourist thing. It was brilliant. I won't give anything away but it's all riddles. I enjoyed it alot. Will hopefully do more if I visit again.",
          "I would definitely recommend trying to Escape! I was locked in the 'Pub' with my boyfriend for an hour and the time flew by. It was challenging, as we did not get out, but it was so much fun and a great activity. I could see this being enjoyable with a group of people any age.",
          "I organised to come here with the company I work with for our Christmas Party activity while we were in Galway for the weekend. We made it a bit of a competition as we had two groups and did two rooms so we were racing against each other then we switched over rooms and raced",
          "I must say I was very impressed with this type of entertainment. First time to an escape room for me, and second for my girlfriend. We were not expecting to do an activity like this but the store front caught my attention. We went in and lucked out, being able to get a time slot",
          "We choose the old sheebeen pub for our first escape room experience. We loved it! The time flies but it was great craic even with a hangover! The staff were very helpful and welcoming. Would highly recommend as a couple or a larger group would be great fun. Will be checking out",
          "Having done several escape rooms in multiple cities, Galway is very much bottom of the barrel. This is primarily down to the interface, and the fact to have to \"give up\" and ask for clues when you get stuck. This interrupts the experience and stops you being completely immersed.",
          "Myself and wife visited just before Christmas and played the Quarantine and the Auld Sheeben. Both games were really super immersive and made you feel like you were exactly where you were meant to be. Some great use of tech in the rooms and really enjoyed both games. Escaped",
          "A great thing to do with teenage kids - well recommended - is challenging and needs teamwork and sharp thinking - well done!",
          "The room was setup so well. Really, so much effort went into its design! The authenticity and detail made it! Kelsey the host was awesome! Definately a must do.",
          "We visited here on a team work night and it was amazing. Staff are extremely friendly and the room itself was great fun. I would highly recommend.",
          "Me and a couple of friends tried the prison room and it wasn't at all what I expected. We had such a good time trying figure everything out, it was brilliant. The staff were very friendly to and I can't wait to go back again to try a different room. Would recommend this place to",
          "We visited the Great Escape rooms as part of a team building exercise. It was fantastic fun, a brilliant team building event and a great way to spend an hour. Would be suitable for families, team mates and even for a first date! A great team behind it - helpful and friendly",
          "This is a great way to spend an hour if you're bored in Galway. I have passed it so many times and had gone in with a group of friends. The staff member that greeted us was very friendly. We were blindfolded and brought into the prison escape room (we chose that). If we got",
          "Decided to try out the escape rooms as part of 40th birthday celebrations recently. 6 of us took on the auld shebeen and we all had a blast. The hour flies, and the escape is anything but easy - team work is a must. Having help at the end of an intercom is a good idea. We",
          "After being here not once but TWICE in the space of a month (I loved it so much the first time I just had to go back!) I must say this experience was by far one of the best things to do in Galway in my opinion!! You pick between 3 rooms (currently The Sheebeen Pub, The Hospital",
          "We visited the great Escape Rooms in mid-term with two bored teenagers, who were certainly not bored during this visit! It's hard to think of another indoor activity we could've done that both the adults and teenagers would have enjoyed as much. We did the jail cell room, and I",

          "My friends and I have completed 2 of the 3 rooms - Shebeen Pub and Quarantine. Both times we found it exhilarating even with the contrasting ways to approach finding your way through the two rooms which we found to be a surprising change from one to the other. The staff were",
          "Did the jail break one with two people. tremendous fun, staff were friendly and very helpful. Will definitely go again",
          "Went with a group from work and we all thoroughly enjoyed it! Staff were really friendly. We did the jail room and can't wait to get back and try the others. Would highly recommend!",
          "We booked the quarantine game with great escapes last weekend and we had a blast. Lovely staff and great game. Highly recommended. We'll be back for the second game when we find ourselves in Galway. Cheers. K & B",
          "Very nice staff. really good puzzles the time just flies by. we did the prison break and it was very entertaining.",

          "This is our second time coming to Great Escape rooms, having done the quarantine hospital room last year, and the prison room yesterday. Staff are enthusiastic and very friendly. Highly recommend.",
          "1 hour to escape from a room, the jail, the bar or quarantine room. Working together to escape, so much fun finding clues that we returned and did it a second time the same day. If you need glasses to read, bring them in.",
          "Was a great thing to do. Little pricey and puzzles were good fun. However there was a few issues with hardware that detracted from the experience,",
          "Great way to pass an hour if you enjoy puzzles. Good fun and tricky enough to complete. Staff member was very helpful and friendly. Highly recommend and I will return for a crack at one of the other rooms!",
          "My friend booked 5 of us for the pub room. It was great fun. Not scary. I was wary it might be scary. Had to solve a \"mystery\" in order to escape. Really enjoyed ourselves and would go back to try the other rooms. Picked up a loyalty card too. Highly recommend. We escaped with 5",

          "We absolutely loved this adventure. Went with a family of 4 adults and 2 young children. We had to get three clues to solve. We would highly recommend this adventure.",
          "What an amazing experience , super idea a ball of fun. We did the prison and its was genius , loved it will be back to do other rooms.",

          "We just made it out but needed a couple of clues to do so. One of the locks was a little stuck which is annoying when you think you've messed up and haven't. I've given it 4 as it's good value and a decent place. I've been to better but I'd still recommend others to visit.",

          "Superb Concept. Kids had a ball trying all the different sports. Staff very friendly and helpful. Very safety conscious as well. My boys dying to go back there again",
          "I visited here as part of a large group and all agreed it was an excellent couple of hours of fun and competition. It is very well set up and has a great range of activities. There was ample car parking.",
          "Visited with 3 teenagers and their dads. Excellent afternoon of activity. Staff helpful and coffee good.",
          "Four teen boys and their fathers completed this fun circuit. It allowed them to try their skill at various sports....basketball, tennis, baseball, golf, soccer, cricket, Gaelic football, rugby and hurling. The boys had a lot of laughs! The weather was a bit cool and gloomy",
          "Excellent Facility. I brought three teenagers who had an hour and a halfs entertainment at 10 different sports. Staff were friendly and helpful also. I did a couple of the sports at the end. Very suitable venue for families, teams, stag/hen partys or work socials. Little bit",
          "If you're in a fix and need somewhere indoors it may be an option but although unique, it's a bit too pricey for what you really get out of it",
          "Total rip off. Avoid. \u20ac50 to hit a couple of balls. Complete stag party bait. I wish I was in the pub",
          "Visited recently for my stag party. Pure skill was great fun and everyone enjoyed it. Its a lot more challenging than we thought it would be. We would all love to visit again and give it another crack.",
          "Great way to pass a few hours on a rainy day with the kids. On the morning we visited, it was quiet so we had 2 hours to play at our leisure. Brings out the competitive streak in families. We didn't stick rigidly to the rules of play as it would've been unfair to the younger",
          "was here with friends and we all enjoyed it even the non sporty lads had a good time looking forward to returning here",
          "Upon initial examination, this looked less fun than what it turned out to be. Good craic was had by all. Price was pretty steep through.",
          "This was an ideal way to spend a couple of hours on a dull afternoon Great fun was had trying all the different sporting challenges It really is for all the family from 11 up, and we all got a chance of trying our skills at about 12 different sports...soccer, Gaelic, hurling,",
          "The selection of sports is a great leveller, great for a group outing. On a Saturday there is a pitta truck with great food parked outside. The only missing ingredient is beer, but Sheridans in just 5 mins walk",
          "About 25 of us went on a Stag - and this is a great way to kill a couple of hours and get out of the pub. The staff were all good, most of the games fun, and the place was very well run. I thought it was probably a little over-priced - but aimed at stags and the like I guess it",
          "A great venue for travelers to Galway and indeed Iocal Irish that want to try thier hand and hone thier skils for all types of sports. Great for indoor activity for bad weather; Stag and Hen parties and team building. A great way for tours of Ireland to get an all around taste",
          "Great way for a bunch of lads to spend a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon. Bit pricey to be honest not something you could afford to do every weekend. But overall definitely worth doing at least once.",
          "It was very good. Me and my boyfriend enjoy a lot. We are definitely bringing the rest of the family, brothers, sisters,parents. it had a good timing to do all of it. its challenging. Half of the sports i did not score. very fun, great pictures after.",
          "Pure Skill is great fun. It is an excellent set up and the staff were superb! I absolutely love the idea and thoroughly enjoyed it despite the whole stag party feeling a little worse for wear when there. Definitely worth a visit if you are with a group like a stag party but it",
          "We spent a couple of hours here as a family and had a fantastic time. It was great to try out sports we all thought we were good at as well as trying some brand new sports. The staff were great and explained exactly what to do and gave us instruction on any sports we hadn't",
          "Title speaks for itself. Great way to pass a few hours. Went with a stag party last weekend of August and it certainly didn`t disappoint. Even though there was a slight grogginess from the previous nights festivities the competition was immense. So much so that if we`d been",
          "We headed to Pure Skill having visited most 'sport orientated' activities in the past. what we got was a great varied competitive experience for the entire group and it suited the non sports members of the group as well. it was certainly something different and is a lot trickier",
          "visited here in Aug,great 2hrs fun very helpful staff and kids went back with dad a 2nd time to beat their score!",
          "My boyfriend picked this place out as his choice after I dragged him along to lots of sight seeing! We loved it. 90 minutes of pure adrenaline, sports action, competition and good fun! The sports actually are very tricky and you certainly need to take it seriously (we didnt!)",
          "Had a try at this with my son to repay him for being toured around Connemara. Great fun, I think provided you're the type of person who likes sports and is willing to give stuff a go. Website says it all but I would add that the staff are most helpful, particularly for sports",
          "Well nearly never made it but almost just about did! This place makes the competitive adrenalin run. Good day out for everyone...",
          "The lads took me here on my stags. About a 10-15 min trek outside the city. Pure skill is exactly what it says on the tin. Don\u2019t let the videos/reviews cod you. You may think its easy but it\u2019s a different story when your in the cages. It really does require skill/good hand eye",
          "Love going here as its very competitive and takes the best of everyone's skills and experience and blends them together to field the perfect spread of sports for everyone to fair a bet on - LoL :-) Great crack though!",
          "Really enjoyed this place and had great fun, would have being better if I had being as good as I remembered at all the sports - LOL - but a great day out and would recommend going with your uncoordinated friends!",
          "This is another example of a place I didn't want to go, but ended up having a great time. Simply you move from section to section trying out various sports/ball related skills. There are crowds of noisy children/adolescents - but if you take a step back you see that they are",
          "Really surprisingly well organised. The whole sports place is brilliant, lots of fun, and everything is just brilliant, must do if coming to Galway.",
          "Had a great time in Pure Skill. Well setup and very professional facilities. There were over 20 of us and we went around in groups of 3 -4 people. The only down side was that our card time ran out before we were finished so one of the guys working there had to use his card to",
          "Pure skill is a great facility for a group, suitable for teens, adults, teams, groups. It's well organised and great fun for anyone looking for entertainment or a competitive game. Parking is adequate. There is a novel range of sports skills from soccer, free kicking,",
          "if you have teenagers along for the trip, bring them here. Somewhat of an unsual twist to the idea of theme park. Sport based; healthy but fun. Our kids loved it so much they had a second go; would have had a fourth if we had time. not suitable for the small one but there is",
          "Seems very dear in comparison to similar places at 20 Euro a head before any discounts (student and family) but still cost 17 a head. Try your skill at a variety of sports - takes about 90 minutes for four to complete.",

          "This is great craic - I went with three children of various ages and another parent - we moved from cage to cage trying out different ball related sports (golf, baseball, GAA, rugby, tennis and so on), we didn't get too competitive and had some good laughs. The pass lasts a",

          "Went as a family while holidaying in Galway and this was recommended by a fellow hotel guest. My teenage boys and husband had a great time but my 9 year old daughter and I didn't fair as well. If you can't kick a ball you won't end up with a great score. The golf was my only",

          "I went here with a group of friends on a stag weekend and found it to be brilliant. Really enjoyable, good craic and some of us got very competitive. A lot more difficult than you think. Probably a little steep at \u20ac40 but it was a great few hours.",
          "Really good fun but a bit costly at \u20ac20 a head, but worth it I think! There are 10 different sports with only two people able to access each sport at a time so it can be a wiat for a group. There is no cafeteria on site to hang around.",

        "wiki": "Westlife are an Irish boy band, which was formed 1998 in Sligo, Ireland. They disbanded in 2012 and reunited in 2018.

Before the start of their Turnaround Tour in 2004, one of the original members, Brian McFadden, departed from the band. The four remaining members continued as a group to release their cover albums Allow Us to Be Frank (2004) and The Love Album (2006) and the studio albums Face to Face (2005) and Back Home (2007). After an almost one-year hiatus of studio recording in 2008, they regrouped and released the studio albums Where We Are (2009), and Gravity (2010), and the compilation album Greatest Hits (2011).

On the best-selling boy bands of all time list, they are currently eighth worldwide along with the biggest selling boy band from Ireland in history globally.The pop band has received numerous accolades including one World Music Award, two Brit Awards, four MTV Awards, four Record of the Year Awards, with an overall total of 91 awards and 20 nominations so far. As a live act, Westlife have sold 5.5 million concert tickets worldwide from their fourteen concert tours so far. They still hold the record for the most shows played at The SSE Arena, Belfast and SSE Arena, Wembley. It makes them the biggest arena act of all-time in the United Kingdom. They sold out Croke Park Stadium in their home country in a record-breaking five minutes. Their fourteenth, and latest concert tour is called Stadiums in the Summer Tour.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin: Byrne, Egan, Feehily, Filan, and McFadden's beginnings ===\nKian Egan, Mark Feehily and Shane Filan were schoolmates in Summerhill College in Sligo, Ireland. All three of them participated in a school production of Grease with fellow Sligo men Derrick Lacey, Graham Keighron, and Michael Garrett. They considered it as the start of Westlife. The six mentioned individuals formed a pop vocal group called Six as One in 1997. They changed their band name to IOYOU later. Before this, Egan was part of a punk-rock band called Skrod. The group, managed by choreographer Mary McDonagh and two other informal managers, released a single titled \"Together Girl Forever\" under Sound Records which was written by Feehily and Filan with fellow Irish Those Nervous Animals and The Strong are Lonely band members Padraig Meehan and Daragh Connolly. Another song \"Everlasting Love\" included in the single was written by Feehily, Keighron, Meehan, and Connolly. There is also an unreleased song called \"Good Thing\". McDonagh first encountered Egan as a six-year-old student at her weekly dance classes, and came to know Filan and Feehily in their early teens as they starred in shows such as Oliver! and Godspell for Sligo Fun Company.\n\nLouis Walsh, the manager of fellow Irish boy band Boyzone, came to know the group after he was contacted by Filan's mother, Mae Filan, but the group failed to secure a BMG record deal with Simon Cowell. Cowell told Walsh: \"You are going to have to fire at least three of them. They have great voices, but they are the ugliest band I have ever seen in my life.\" Three members of the band (Lacey, Keighron, and Garrett) were told they would not be part of the new group, and auditions were held in Dublin where Nicky Byrne and Brian McFadden were recruited. McFadden was part of an R&B group called Cartel before this.\nThe new group, formed on 3 July 1998, was renamed Westside but that name was already in use by another band, so it was changed to Westlife. It was revealed that Walsh was already calling them Westlife before Westside name came along. In Westlife \u2013 Our Story, Byrne revealed that, unlike the others in the group, he was keen to change the name to West High. McFadden also changed the spelling of his name to Bryan to make it easier to sign autographs. They managed to secure a major record deal the second time around under BMG with all other record labels competed. They have signed a four million pound record deal with RCA Records. Westlife's first big break came in 1998 when they opened for Boyzone and Backstreet Boys' concerts in Dublin. Boyzone singer Ronan Keating was brought in to co-manage the group with Walsh. Later, they won a special Smash Hits Roadshow award at that year's Smash Hits Poll Winners Party. Their first live television performance as a group in Ireland and worldwide was on the Irish TV series and the world's second longest-running late-night talk show, The Late Late Show that had its broadcast on 13 November 1998. They performed \"Flying Without Wings\". The band then released an EP titled Swear It Again afterwards. Both recorded songs under Westside were produced by Steve Mac and written by Mac and Wayne Hector. The debut extended play and single was chosen by Cowell with the guidance of his father, Eric Cowell. His father stated then, \"I think they will be big\".\n\n\n=== International breakthrough, Debut album, Coast to Coast, World of Our Own and super stardom (1999\u20132002) ===\n\nIn April 1999, the group released their first single, \"Swear It Again\" which immediately topped the charts in Ireland and in the UK for two weeks. It became the biggest-selling single in a week one by a debut artist. On the week of its release and its chart achievement announcement, Cowell's father died. Their second single, \"If I Let You Go\" was released in August 1999, which established them as the first boy band to hit the No. 1 with its first two singles. They also performed for billions in 1999 at the Miss World telecast with this song. The third single was the highly acclaimed \"Flying Without Wings\" (their first 'Record of the Year' and their third No. 1 single), released in October the same year, also followed suit. It made them the only the second Irish act and fourth act to debut at No. 1 with their first three singles, B*Witched, Robson and Jerome, and Spice Girls being the other three. \"Flying Without Wings\" was also included on the soundtrack of the Warner Brothers film, Pok\u00e9mon: The Movie 2000. Their first album, simply titled Westlife, was released in November 1999 and went to No. 2 in the UK and their first No. 1 in Ireland. The album was the biggest chart dropper on the top 40 in UK music history when, in its 58th week on the charts it leapt from No. 79 to No. 3 before falling to No. 37 the following week. Despite the history, the album successfully managed to peak at No. 1 in Scotland in the year 2001 after premiering at No. 6 at the Scottish Albums Chart in 1999.In December 1999, a fourth and a double-side single was released, \"I Have A Dream\"/\"Seasons in the Sun\". It knocked Cliff Richard's \"The Millennium Prayer\" off the top spot and earned them the 1999 UK Christmas number-one single. It is also their fourth No. 1 single. It was the first official No. 1 single music act in the 2000s decade of UK Singles Chart and also the last official No. 1 single music act in the 1990s decade of UK Singles Chart. They are also the only music act to have four number ones in UK Singles Chart in only a year. The fifth and last single from the album, \"Fool Again\", also peaked at No. 1. With this, they broke records of being the only male band to have every singles released from an album to reach No. 1 in the UK and the only male group with most original songs in an album that went straight to No. 1 in the UK with multiple and/or with four original singles. Afterwards, Westlife signed to Arista Records for the North American territory after auditioning for the label's founder, Clive Davis. Then the group had a promotional tour in the United States for their \"Swear It Again\" single and peaked at No. 20 in the Billboard Hot 100. An Asian tour followed in support of their debut album before releasing a second album. On 1 July 2000, they were honored as Freemen of the Borough of Sligo.Coast to Coast, their second album, was released a year later and was their first No. 1 UK album, beating the Spice Girls' Forever album by a large margin, the said chart battle was widely reported by British media. It became the country's 4th biggest selling album of 2000. This is their second No. 1 album in Ireland. The album was preceded by a duet with Mariah Carey singing \"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)\" and the original song \"My Love\" (their second Record of the Year award). Both singles reached No. 1 on the UK charts, their sixth and seventh number ones respectively. With this, Westlife broke an unexpected record of the most consecutive No. 1 singles in the UK, having their first seven consecutive singles debut at the top by a debuting act and group, and by an act, a group, a male group, a pop act and a pop group in UK and became the fastest number one music act beating Elvis Presley's previous record of three years versus 23 months of Westlife getting each its first No. 1 singles and second music act to have the longest string of number ones in UK history. However, in December 2000, their eighth and an Ireland and UK exclusive single \"What Makes a Man\", only debuted at No. 2. The single \"My Love\" was controversially used by Central Intelligence Agency as part of a torture program in Afghanistan. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, \"the music pounded constantly as part of a scheme to assault prisoners\u2019 senses\". They survived the 2000 Mexico City major earthquake and lightning during this time. Outside the UK and Ireland, they gained chart success with \"I Lay My Love on You\" and \"When You're Looking Like That\". This time as well, they were included in the top ten earners list of all acts in UK and Ireland and sold over 2.5 million units in Asia Pacific region. Also in this year, they launched their first world tour, \"Where Dreams Come True Tour\". A recording of a concert from the tour live from Dublin was released on 19 November 2001. Also in the same month and year, Westlife released their third album World of Our Own, their second No. 1 album in the UK and their third No. 1 album in Ireland.\n\"Uptown Girl\", \"Queen of My Heart\" and \"World of Our Own\" were released as singles, all of which peaked at No. 1 in the UK. Those singles are also their eighth, ninth, and tenth number ones respectively. With their tenth No. 1, they made history by being the shortest music act or band to have ten or double-figures number ones in the UK Singles Chart (2 years and 10 months or 149 weeks) \u2013 more than 3 months quicker than The Beatles (165 weeks). \"Bop Bop Baby\" was also released as a single, but it peaked at No. 5 in the UK. In 2002, Westlife went on their second world tour, the World of Our Own Tour (In The Round). Overall in 2002, IRMA awarded the band plaque about their 1 million units sold in Ireland and ranked seventh as Irish's millionaires under age 30 with 18 million euros for all the five members. For every performance each band member will get 228,000 euros, which means the 68 dates raked in 1.55 million euros for them by June 2002. The cash rolled in from sales of their merchandise, while a recent advertising deal with Adidas was worth 488,000 euros to each of them with a total of 3.33 million euros each at the end of the said tour.\n\n\n=== Unbreakable, Turnaround, and departure of Brian McFadden (2002\u20132004) ===\n\nThe group sold more than 12 million records in a span of three years during this time. They released their eleventh UK No. 1 single, \"Unbreakable\" in 2002. Amidst rumours of a split, Westlife released their first greatest hits album in November that same year titled Unbreakable - The Greatest Hits Vol. 1, which zoomed all the way to No. 1 in the UK and Ireland. Their third No. 1 in the UK and the fourth one in Ireland. Also during that time, Westlife bagged another Guinness World Record for most public appearances by a pop group in a 36-hour period. The band made stop-offs in five different cities (Dublin, Belfast, Edinburgh, London and Manchester) to promote their then-new album. The release was followed by the double A-side single \"Tonight\"/\"Miss You Nights\", which debuted at No. 3 in the UK and No. 1 in Ireland. At this time, Because Films Inspire made a TV documentary titled \"Wild Westlife\", directed by Iain MacDonald and starred the group, featuring their daily life as musicians and their tour experiences. It was aired on BBC Choice. In 2003, Westlife went on their third world tour, The Greatest Hits Tour and invited to play at the annual Edinburgh Military Tattoo, shrugging off rumours of a split which is what most of the pop bands do after a Greatest Hits album and tour. A recording of a concert from the tour, live from Manchester, was released in November 2003.\nBack in September 2003, Westlife released \"Hey Whatever\", which peaked at No. 4 in the UK. Their fourth studio album, Turnaround, was then released in November, earning the group another UK No. 1 album, the fourth one. The album is also their fifth No. 1 in Ireland. \"Mandy\", was released a week before the album release. The band's twelfth No. 1 single. Their version won them their third Record of the Year award, in under five years. Their version of \"Mandy\" is also considered the single with the longest leap to the top (from No. 200 to No. 1) in UK music history. \"Obvious\" was released as the final single from the album, charting at No. 3.\nOn 9 March 2004, just three weeks prior to embarking on their fourth world tour, McFadden left the group to spend more time with his family and six months later to release solo music projects. On that day, a press conference was held where all the group's members were present, each giving emotional individual speeches. McFadden's final public performance as part of Westlife was at Newcastle upon Tyne's Powerhouse nightclub on 27 February 2004. McFadden attended the first day of the band's tour date as an audience. The last time the five had reunited in public was when McFadden acted in an Irish reality television show Anonymous where he disguised as a fan in an album signing event of the group in November 2005 and had a broadcast in January 2006. He subsequently began a solo career, and reverted the spelling of his first name back to its original 'Brian'. McFadden later released more albums and singles, but only with moderate success.\nLess than a month after McFadden's departure, the group kicked off their \"Turnaround Tour\". A live version of \"Flying Without Wings\" from the said tour was released as an official UK download, earning them the first official UK Downloads No. 1. A recording of a concert from the Turnaround Tour, live from Stockholm, Sweden, was released in November 2003.\n\n\n=== Face to Face, Back Home, and cover albums (2004\u20132008) ===\nIn September 2004, they performed on the World Music Awards, where they were recognised as the Best Irish Act of that year. They then released a Rat Pack-inspired album and fifth album ...Allow Us to Be Frank, which peaked at No. 3. No singles from this album were released in the UK but \"Ain't That a Kick in the Head?\", accompanied with a music video, was released as a digital download in the UK and peaked at No. 4 and as a physical single in other European countries. \"Smile\" and \"Fly Me to the Moon\", both with music videos as well, were released as digital downloads only.\nPrior to the release of the ...Allow Us to Be Frank album, Westlife scouted for \"the perfect fan\" to help promote their album. After X Factor-style auditions, they found Joanne Hindley, who recorded \"The Way You Look Tonight\" with the group. To mark this special collaboration, a special programme was televised, showing auditions and live performances, called She's The One, presented by Kate Thornton. It also featured a live performance by their fathers with their version of \"That's Life\". Westlife continued to tour Europe as part of their \"The Number Ones Tour\" which started in early 2005. The tour at ranked at number 84 worldwide with top concert tour ticket sales with 191,361. A recording of a concert from the tour, live from Sheffield, was released in November 2005.\nBy 2004, they sold over 30 million albums already, the biggest live act in UK, and making around \u00a34m each as reported in 2005. In October 2005, Westlife returned with their comeback single, \"You Raise Me Up\", which was taken from their sixth album Face to Face, their thirteenth No. 1. On 5 November 2005, both the album and the single were at No. 1 in the UK, at the same time, during the second week of the single. It was the first time that Westlife had held both the top album and the top single position in the same week and the first Irish music act to have such feat. This is their fifth No. 1 in the UK and sixth one in Ireland. \"You Raise Me Up\" was awarded as their fourth Record of the Year in the UK, for 2005. In December of that year, the group released \"When You Tell Me That You Love Me\", a duet with Diana Ross, as the second single, and it debuted at its peak position of No. 2. This single marked its fourteenth year since the original Diana Ross version was released and peaked at No. 2, the same chart position in the UK Singles Chart in 1991.

The new album titled Gravity was released on 22 November 2010. It went to No. 1 in Ireland and No. 3 in the UK. This is their ninth No. 1 in Ireland and this album made Westlife as one of the few musical acts and band and the only pop band to have number one albums in three consecutive decades (1990s, 2000s, 2010s) in their home country.  \n\nAs the 2000s decade ends with 275 singles reached the No. 1 position on the chart in the UK.

On 14 March 2011, Westlife confirmed that they had left Cowell after 13 years and his record label Syco Music after nine years. The group cited Syco's decision not to release a second single from Gravity as the reason Byrne felt it as another reason of being unloved,\n\nWe signed to Simon back in 1998 and he was brilliant, but then came the development of The X Factor and American Idol. Simon became famous himself and his interests went that way rather than on Westlife. We almost felt a little bit unloved with Simon Cowell, if I was to be honest. We had it (full time support) with Simon but he got so busy and would do it at the very last minute and we needed someone who was on it all the time.\nOn 23 April 2011, Egan's Twitter account posted a series of tweets saying he was to walk away from the group. He later said his account was hacked and debunked the announcement. After going back to RCA Records full-time for a one-year album contract, they announced their Greatest Hits album to be released on 21 November 2011. It debuted at No. 1 in Ireland and No. 4 in the UK. This is their tenth No. 1 album in Ireland. The first and lead single, \"Lighthouse\" was released in November 2011. And a follow-up promotional single \"Beautiful World\" released later. In October 2011, Egan ruled out speculation that McFadden would reunite with them for the new compilation album and its promotion for a television show. Egan said: \"All the rumours about Brian re-joining Westlife are untrue. We have been a 4 piece for too long now. We love Brian but it's not going to be. That includes any TV performances.\" With a new compilation album coming out, it was speculated Westlife would be doing a new greatest hits tour. They were scheduled to headline the ChildLine Concert in Dublin on 12 November 2011 and to have another exclusive concert on O2 Blueroom, also in Dublin on 24 November.A UK tour was first officially announced on 18 October 2011, with dates confirmed for May 2012 and it was titled, The Greatest Hits Tour or The Farewell Tour. Stereoboard reported that the tour sold out within minutes. On 19 October 2011, Westlife officially announced they were splitting after an album and a tour.\nAfter 14 years, 26 top ten hits including 14 number one singles, 11 top 5 albums, 7 of which hit the top spot and have collectively sold over 44 million copies around the world, 10 sell out tours and countless memories that we will forever cherish, we today announce our plan to go our separate ways after a greatest hits collection this Christmas and a farewell tour next year. The decision is entirely amicable and after spending all of our adult life together so far, we want to have a well-earned break and look at new ventures. We see the greatest hits collection and the farewell tour as the perfect way to celebrate our incredible career along with our fans. We are really looking forward to getting out on the tour and seeing our fans one last time.\nOver the years, Westlife has become so much more to us than just a band. Westlife are a family. We would like to thank our fans who have been with us on this amazing journey and are part of our family too. We never imagined when we started out in 1998 that 14 years later we would still be recording, touring and having hits together. It has been a dream come true for all of us.\n\nKian, Mark, Nicky and Shane\nDuring this time, the Official Charts Company compiled the band's chart history which states that other than their number-ones they had, 25 UK Top 10s, 26 UK Top 40s, 27 UK Top 75s, 20 Weeks at No. 1, 76 Weeks in Top 10, 189 Weeks in Top 40 and 282 Weeks in Top 75 in the UK Singles Chart.

They also had seven number-one albums in eight years, the most number-ones with different albums by a music album act, group, pop group, and male group in UK Albums Chart in the 2000s and the second most number ones, tied with Rod Stewart, with different albums by a music album act, group, pop group and male group in UK clustered per decade since The Beatles in the 1960s and of all time. In Ireland, they have fourteen No. 1 singles and ten No. 1 albums, the most for a pop band and act and male band and act, and Irish band next to U2.\nA second statement was issued through their official site, saying the fans were continuing to be the best support system. Some fans on social networks described themselves as feeling \"devastated\" following news of the split. People left their messages on Twitter by using #WestlifeForever and #Westlife, it trended on Ireland, Indonesia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Sweden, and UK. A live stream Q&A happened on 28 October 2011 as a \"thank you\" to their fans. As part of it, ITV commissioned a one-off music event as they took to the stage to sing some of their greatest hits, it was entitled Westlife: For the Last Time. Another show entitled, The Westlife Show: Live, was broadcast from Studio One of London Studios on the same channel on 1 November 2011. They then had a live guesting on The Late Late Show. They were honored at that time by Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) with four specially commissioned bar stools to mark 49 performances at the venue for over 380,000 fans, selling more tickets than any other act. The band had their final concert on 23 June 2012 at Croke Park Stadium in Ireland. The 82,300 capacity show was sold out in 4 minutes. Due to this popular demand, an extra date was added at Croke Park on 22 June 2012, which also sold out. Combined, there was a total of 187,808 spectators on both nights, exceeding the capacity of the stadium. Their last concert was also screened live in more than 300 cinemas in the United Kingdom, and 200 cinemas worldwide. They also released a DVD, which went to number 1 in both UK and Irish chart. In that year they were also declared the 34th top-grossing tour act of the year with earnings of $35.2 million (\u20ac27 million). The farewell tour consisted of eight dates in China and 33 in the UK and Ireland; in total, the band sold 489,694 tickets from the tour.Cowell and some media predicted a possible reunion in the future, but Westlife put an end to that speculation by vowing they would never reunite. Later reports from the Daily Record said there was an \"irreparable rift\" in the band, but was later denied by a source close to the band saying: \"There's no bad blood in the band, they're still great pals. But all good things come to an end and they are all keen to do their own thing.\" Later, the band also denied it and called the split a \"united decision\". However he confessed three months after the split, Byrne said that members of the group fought with one another more and more often in the latter years leading up to the split and he felt that it was the right time to end their time together. A year after Westlife ended, they agreed to all voluntarily wind up Bluenet Ltd, their main entertainment firm, after going their own ways and split \u20ac2.3million to \u20ac595,500 each except for Filan who missed out any of it as he declared bankruptcy at that time due to property crash problems.Since the split, the four lads have released albums and singles individually. Filan, with three studio albums and with singles and tours (with support act dates for Lionel Richie) released and a Top 5 hit album in UK. Feehily associated with an independent record label (which he is the co-director) and released albums and singles. He also made it as a supporting act to Mariah Carey and Wet Wet Wet. Egan was voted King of the Jungle on the 2013 series of ITV's I'm a Celebrity series, released one studio album with singles, was a coach judge on The Voice of Ireland, and was a support act for Boyzone. Byrne released one studio album, joined Strictly Come Dancing, hosted several major Irish television and radio shows, and represented Ireland in Eurovision, which was also his debut solo single.In 2014, Syco Music said to The Sun: \"All the guys are up for it in principle. It's now just a matter of sorting out all the details, Syco would love Brian to be part of the band again. It\u2019d create the same sort of buzz as when Robbie Williams returned to Take That. But the other lads will need to be convinced because they were always very clear that when Brian left it was for good.\" but Egan later tweeted, \"Guys I'm sorry to say but I don't know where these rumours are coming from about a Westlife reunion but it's untrue. Sorry #westlifeforever.\" In 2015, 2016 (On this year, Walsh posted on the band's social accounts that they will not regroup as of the moment), 2017, Walsh expressed that the four-piece band would reunite. He had been in contact with Ed Sheeran and James Arthur to create songs for the band.However, on 2016\u20132017, four years following the split, Filan told Lorraine and other media outlets that while there are currently no plans for a Westlife reunion, he would not rule it out for the future. Byrne expressed in 2017, \"Shame this Westlife news is not true. They were always my guilty pleasures.\" He also talked about touring with the group: \"Who wouldn't want to do that again? The laugh with the boys and travelling around and seeing all the fans again. It's nearly six years next summer since we've done it so who knows? Maybe in ten years. I've spoken to all the lads individually but we've never brought up a Westlife reunion, the thing about it is the four of us haven\u2019t been in a room together since Jodi's [Kian's wife] mum's funeral,' That was the last time we spoke properly as a band, if you want to call it that., I'm sure it will happen but I don't know when and I know know if even we know when the right time will be.\" Feehily added, \"People have offered us blank cheques to get back together but it's not about money. There are no plans to reform. The time isn't now. We all have a lot more that we want to achieve first. It feels way too soon to be honest, a 20th anniversary tour could still happen one day as 2019 is 20 years since we released our first single, while 2021 is 20 years since our first world tour. So you never know\".On 31 March 2018, it was reported on Allkpop that all of them might guest on a popular Korean musical show Immortal Songs 2 but Filan was the only one who appeared on the show as a judge and a guest performer afterwards. Egan answered that this and other reports were untrue and the rest of the group members sided with Egan's response after as well. Later they revealed they had been phoned up by Walsh and Cowell every six months since their split. On 23 September 2018, several Irish news outlets started reporting that the group has been signed to Universal Music Group for a new five-year album and tour deal with Virgin EMI Records.\n\n\n=== Reunion, new singles, tours, and Spectrum album (2018\u2013present) ===\nOn 3 October 2018, the group formally announced that there'll be new music and a tour coming soon on their official social media accounts like on their newly created Instagram.

According to the reports, they had been preparing for their comeback for the past year of 2017 as Feehily had said on the same year that he hoped to get them all together for a proper catch-up. It was later revealed that Egan and Filan first talked about their reunion when Adele released \"Hello\" in late 2015. While Byrne raised his concerns about \"...where Westlife's music fits into the current market\" and not wanting to be simply a \"nostalgia\" act. He went on to say, \"While we were away, we realised what Westlife really meant to the fans \u2013 and to us.\" McFadden was not involved in the reformation as he said on an interview with Closer Magazine, \"...there's no reason for me and the boys to stay buddies.\" and \"For me, it was just a job. I only met the guys when I joined the band and have no regrets about leaving.\" Their first live interviews and press conferences as a four-piece in six years were made 20 days later held in Dublin and Belfast where they revealed their plans to stick around longer. Days later, it was followed by several radio interviews in Manchester, Ulster, Dublin and Glasgow. Walsh also said in separate interviews that the most important things now are the songs, it will be featured as an introduction to their new sound and added, \"I was just waiting for them to decide when. There were record deals on the table, but the icing on the cake was Ed Sheeran writing these amazing songs for them, as well as having Steve Mac, who produced their early songs, on track too.\" [...] \"Sheeran's input adds a contemporary edge\", \"I've heard the first two songs and they are just incredible.\" Mac and Sheeran have come up with four new tracks for them. One will be a single co-written by Sheeran. Some had been composed since 2016.

We wanted to come back and recreate Westlife's sound, but better, and be a better band, and the most important thing about any band is music.\" In November 2018, Byrne expressed 2019 will be \"one hell of a year\" On 19 December 2018, Egan and Feehily posted a picture of the group's first rehearsals together in six years and Egan added that \"2019 will be nothing but epic\".

In South Korea, their albums Coast to Coast and World of Our Own are the top two best selling albums from a western boy band of all time and nine out of twenty albums listed in the top best-selling albums of western boy bands of all time are from the band. Also in South Korea, their singles \"My Love\" and \"You Raise Me Up\" stayed in the top 75 of the Official International Karaoke Charts since the inception of the charts in December 2010 up to its recent chart released. The only Irish act, pop band, boy band to have two of previous Marvel Hollywood Actors had been cast in two of the lads' music videos. Vinnie Jones who played as Juggernaut in X-Men: The Last Stand was featured as the Duke Vincent in \"Bop Bop Baby\", while Ioan Gruffudd who played as Mr. Fantastic in Fantastic Four 2005 and 2007 was featured as one of the high class customers in \"Uptown Girl\". The only Irish act, pop band, boy band to have worked with three American Idol judges (Mariah Carey, Simon Cowell, Lionel Richie). Demo song \"Beautiful in White\" reached more than 242 million views (on a single video only) on YouTube as of November 2019, making it as the most successful original song from a pop act that was not released as an official single and never made any albums (until Filan released a different version for his solo album, accompanied with an official music video). Their song \"My Love\" is the most viewed, liked, and shared Facebook video post from a boy band and their medley video is also the second most liked one.They were invited by Wayne Rooney and Coleen Rooney to sing on their wedding reception in Portofino, Abbey of Cervara, Italy and got paid \u00a3400,000, one of the highest amount paid acts, highest for a pop band, boy band and Irish act and band for a wedding in world history. They are Coleen's favorite pop band, also invited to her 21st birthday but was unable to make it. Egan said later that it was more of Rooney who is a big fan of the band as revealed to them by Coleen. The band also performed for the Sultan of Brunei, an occasion on which they were paid \u00a32.5 million to play a private concert of seven songs. They also performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 2000 with \"I Lay My Love on You\" and \"My Love\", in 2005 with the songs \"World of Our Own\" and \"You Raise Me Up\" with Rolf L\u00f8vland and Fionnuala Sherry, and in 2009 with \"What About Now\" and \"You Raise Me Up\" in front of former US President Barack Obama and met him afterwards. They also played for Queen Elizabeth II twice and for Pope John Paul II once in a live concert television show and shook hands with them after. They were the first ever pop band to top the entertainment bill at the Vatican City and a private concert for the Pope. They also personally met former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and picked autographs also for his daughter. The band was also mentioned in the book version of Me Before You, which was released in 2012. Westlife's songs were also used as film soundtracks six times that include \"Safe\" for Dolphin Tale in 2011, \"You Raise Me Up\" for Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie in 2014 and \"Flying Without Wings\" for Pokemon: The Movie 2000. Their songs were also used as soundtracks for television shows such as Britain's Got Talent, Coronation Street, Dancing on Ice, Emmerdale, EastEnders, So You Think You Can Dance UK, and The X Factor UK (they are the most performed professional and international live music act in X Factor as well). Westlife's name was used by the main character Vicky Pollard in the popular UK comedy television series Little Britain with one of her famous lines, \"swapping her baby for a Westlife CD\". They were referenced as part of  1990s pop culture on the British band Busted's 2018 music video \"Nineties\". Their songs appeared in more than a thousand compilation albums.Despite their success worldwide, Westlife was unable to break into the U.S. market. They had only one hit single in the United States, \"Swear It Again\", which peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2000. The band made an appearance on MTV's Total Request Live and the U.S. edition of their debut album, Westlife was released, but it didn't meet with success. In 2002, with the two most prominent boy bands in the US, the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, going on hiatus that year, an attempt was made to promote and release a US version of \"World of Our Own\", but was never successful. Billboard called the failure due to corporate politics.\n\"We sent over a CD of World of Our Own with no name on it. They didn't know it was Westlife and every single radio station in the States \u2013 all came back and said that this is an absolutely huge hit. They said it was great for radio and people are gonna love it, especially as there's just a slight bit of rock guitar to it. But as soon as we revealed it was Westlife, the radio pluggers all went, 'Whoa, not Westlife \u2013 it's a boyband.' And we cannot break that down, no matter what song we come out with. The problem with America is that it's all radio and you've got to break into radio first. And currently radio doesn't want to play boy bands or pop music. If Bono wrote a song with us tomorrow and it was the biggest hit in the world, if Westlife's name is put to it, it won't be a hit in America because radio will not play us.\"\n\"Flying Without Wings\" peaked at number-two in the US when American Idol: Season 2 winner Ruben Studdard recorded and released it as his debut single. In 2003, Westlife went to Nashville to film a TV documentary. While they were there, they gave a live performance of the song \"Daytime Friends\", originally by country music singer Kenny Rogers. Though Westlife didn't gain as much success in the States as they did elsewhere, their music was still appreciated. Kid David Corey, assistant PD and music director at top 40 WXKS (Kiss 108) radio station in Boston, Massachusetts was a Westlife supporter that was recorded saying \"Bands like Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync are still climbing the charts, and radio is supporting them, so I don't think the boy band thing is going to hurt them. Besides, this song [\"Swear it Again\"] is just too good for any of that to be a concern. I can't imagine anyone not playing this because it's another boy band, especially when it doesn't even sound like those other guys.\"Celebrities including Elton John, Sharon Osbourne, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Jamie Vardy, Mike Tyson, Martine McCutcheon, Niall Horan, Neil Murillo, Leona Lewis, C. J.

Some have also criticized the band for doing many covers, having the same sound on every album released, lack of use of musical instruments and lack of songwriting skills. Feehily revealed in 2009: \"There were many songs which I would be even scared to mention, you know, that were suggested to us which we turned down. There were many cover versions and many original songs that were either terrible. There was loads of stuff through the years, like 'You Are Not Alone' by Michael Jackson?, that were suggested by their record company chief Cowell\". Westlife have proven to have more original songs, worked with many songwriters and music producers and co-written numerous songs throughout their career. (See Westlife songlist for the compilation.)

        "wiki": "Galway ( GAWL-way; Irish: Gaillimh, pronounced [\u02c8\u0261al\u0320\u02b2\u026av\u02b2]) is a city in County Galway in the West of Ireland, in the province of Connacht. It lies on the River Corrib between Lough Corrib and Galway Bay, and is the sixth most populous city in Ireland, with a population at the 2016 Census of 79,934.Galway is renowned for its vibrant lifestyle and for hosting numerous festivals, celebrations and events such as The Galway Arts Festival. In 2018, it was named the European Region of Gastronomy. The city is currently the European Capital of Culture for 2020, alongside Rijeka, Croatia.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe city's name comes from the Irish name Gaillimhe, which formed the western boundary of the earliest settlement, D\u00fan Gaillimhe \"Fort Gaillimh\". (Mythical and alternative derivations of the name are given in History of Galway). Historically, the name was Anglicised as Galliv or Gallive, closer to the Irish pronunciation. The city's name in Latin is Galvia. Residents of the city are referred to as Galwegians.\nThe city also bears the nickname \"City of the Tribes\" (Irish: Cathair na dTreabh) because of the fourteen merchant families called the \"tribes of Galway\" who led the city in its Hiberno-Norman period.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nD\u00fan Gaillimhe (\"Fort at the Mouth (bottom) of the Gaillimh\") was constructed in 1124, by the King of Connacht, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088\u20131156). A settlement grew around it. During the Norman invasion of Connacht in the 1230s, D\u00fan Gaillimhe was captured by Richard Mor de Burgh, who had led the invasion. As the de Burghs eventually became Gaelicised, the merchants of the town, the Tribes of Galway, pushed for greater control over the walled city.\nThis led to their gaining complete control over the city and to the granting of mayoral status by the English crown in December 1484. Galway endured difficult relations with its Irish neighbours. A notice over the west gate of the city, completed in 1562 by Mayor Thomas \u00d3ge Martyn, stated \"From the Ferocious O'Flahertys may God protect us\". A by-law forbade the native Irish (as opposed to Galway's Hiberno-Norman citizens) unrestricted access into Galway, saying \"neither O\u2019 nor Mac shall strutte nor swagger through the streets of Galway\" without permission.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Galway was ruled by an oligarchy of fourteen merchant families (twelve who claimed to be of Norman origin and two of Irish origin). These were the \"Tribes of Galway\". The city thrived on international trade, and in the Middle Ages, it was the principal Irish port for trade with Spain and France. The most famous reminder of those days is ceann an bhalla (\"the end of the wall\"), now known as the Spanish Arch, constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin (1519\u201320). In 1477 Christopher Columbus visited Galway, possibly stopping off on a voyage to Iceland or the Faroe Islands. Seven or eight years later, he noted in the margin of his copy of Imago Mundi:\n\nMen of Cathay have come from the west. [Of this] we have seen many signs. And especially in Galway in Ireland, a man and a woman, of extraordinary appearance, have come to land on two tree trunks [or timbers? or a boat made of such?]\nThe most likely explanation for these bodies is that they were Inuit swept eastward by the North Atlantic Current.During the 16th and 17th centuries Galway remained loyal to the English crown for the most part, even during the Gaelic resurgence, perhaps for reasons of survival. However, by 1642 the city had allied itself with the Catholic Confederation of Kilkenny during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. During the resulting Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Cromwellian forces captured the city after a nine-month siege. At the end of the 17th century the city supported the Jacobites in the Williamite war in Ireland and was captured by the Williamites after a very short siege not long after the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. The great families of Galway were ruined. The city suffered further under the potato famines of 1845\u20131852, and it did not fully recover until the period of strong economic growth of the late 20th century (see Celtic Tiger).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike most of Ireland, Galway has an oceanic climate (Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, being one of the world's mildest cities for latitude, partly because it is on an island. Galway has a year-round mild, moist, temperate and changeable climate, due to the prevailing winds of the North Atlantic Current together with the Gulf Stream (on the other side of the Atlantic temperatures can be 20 \u00b0C cooler or more.). The city does not experience temperature extremes, with temperatures below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) being rare. The city receives an average of 1,156 mm (45.51 in) of precipitation annually, which is evenly distributed throughout the year. The average January temperature in the city is 5.9 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F) and the average July temperature is 15.9 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). The highest temperature ever recorded in Galway was 31.7 \u00b0C (89.1 \u00b0F) in July 1921, whilst the lowest temperature recorded was \u221211.7 \u00b0C (10.9 \u00b0F) in January 1945.While extreme weather is rare, the city and county can experience severe windstorms that are the result of vigorous Atlantic depressions that occasionally pass along the north west coast of Ireland. Most of these storms occur between late autumn and early spring. Due to the city's northerly location, Galway has long summer days. Sunrise on summer solstice occurs at 05:07 WEST and sunset at 22:07. By contrast, on winter solstice, the sun rises at 08:49 WET, and sets at 16:19.\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\nLynch's Castle on Shop Street is a medieval town house built by the prosperous Lynch family in the 16th century and is now a branch of Allied Irish Banks.\nThe Church of Ireland St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church is the largest medieval church still in everyday use in Ireland. It was founded in 1320 and enlarged in the following two centuries.\nThe Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas was consecrated in 1965 and is a far larger building constructed from limestone. It has an eclectic style, with a Renaissance Revival dome, pillars and round arches, and a Romanesque Revival portico that dominates the main fa\u00e7ade \u2013 which is an unusual feature in modern Irish church building.\nThe original quadrangle building of NUI Galway which was erected in 1849 (during the Great Famine or An Gorta M\u00f3r) as one of the three colleges of the Queen's University of Ireland (along with Queen's University Belfast and University College Cork). The university holds the UNESCO archive of spoken material for the Celtic languages.\nThe Hardiman, (originally the Railway Hotel, then the Great Southern Hotel and then Hotel Meyrick) built by the Great Southern Railway Company in 1845. Sitting at the southern perimeter of Eyre Square, it is the city's oldest hotel still in operation.\nThe remains of Menlo Castle can be seen outside the city, on the eastern bank of the River Corrib. It was one of the ancestral homes of the Blake family, one of the Tribes of Galway from c. 1600\u20131910. The fa\u00e7ade of the family's townhouse (\"Blake's Castle\") is still extant next to Jury's Hotel at the bottom of Quay Street.\nEglinton Canal, named after a former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, joins the River Corrib to the sea, and flows for just more than a kilometre from the University to the Claddagh.\nThe Claddagh is the oldest part of Galway but little or nothing remains of its old thatched village. However, in a side altar of the parish church, St Mary's on the Hill, is the late medieval statue of Our Lady of Galway. The ancient ritual of the Blessing of the Bay takes place on the Sunday nearest the feast of the Assumption.\nThe Browne doorway, originally located on Lower Abbeygate Street but now standing at the north end of Eyre Square, was the doorway to the townhouse of the Browne family, one of the fourteen Tribes of Galway.\nThe Lynch Window, (on Market Street), at which is a plaque commemorating one of the city's legends. According to legend, in 1493, the then Mayor, James Lynch FitzStephen, hanged his own son for the murder of a young Spanish visitor who had the misfortune to befriend the girlfriend of the Mayor's son.\nThe Hall of the Red Earl (Halla an Iarla Rua) can be viewed through a protective glass wall off Flood Street. It is the earliest medieval settlement fragment surviving within the walls of the city. It was built by the de Burgo family in the 13th century and was a key municipal building for the collection of taxes, dispensation of justice and hosting banquets. It was the medieval equivalent of tax office, court house and town hall.\n\n\n==== The Claddagh ====\n\nOn the west bank of the River Corrib as it enters the sea is the ancient neighbourhood of The Claddagh. For centuries it was an Irish-speaking enclave outside the city walls. Claddagh residents were mainly fisher folk and were governed by an elected 'King'. The King of the Claddagh settled or arbitrated disputes among the locals and had the privilege of a white sail on his fishing boat. The last true king, Martin Oliver, died in 1972. The title is still used but in a purely honorary and ceremonial context. The current King is Michael Lynskey. The area is also famous for its association with the Claddagh Ring.\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nThe Galway City Museum has two main sections: one about the heritage of Galway and one about Irish artists from the second half of the 20th century. This museum also houses the statue of the poet, P\u00e1draic \u00d3 Conaire which was originally located in the Kennedy Park section of Eyre Square, prior to the Square's renovation. A replica of the statue was erected in Eyre Square in 2017. The museum is part of the Spanish Arch, the historical remnants of the 16th century wall.The city's University has numerous museums, including the James Mitchell Geology Museum and the Computing and Communications Museum of Ireland.\nThe Nora Barnacle House Museum in Bowling Green is the smallest museum in Ireland. Nora was the lover, companion and, later, wife of writer James Joyce.\n\n\n==== Cemeteries ====\nFort Hill Cemetery, on Lough Atalia Road, is the oldest cemetery still in use in Galway City. Inside the main gate is a memorial to sailors of the Spanish Armada who were buried here in the 1580s.\nRahoon Cemetery (officially known as Mount St. Joseph Cemetery), Rahoon Road, on the western edge of the city affords splendid panoramic views of the city.\nAmong the notable persons buried here are:\n\nMichael Bodkin, an admirer of Nora Barnacle, the wife of James Joyce, who was the inspiration for the character, \"Michael Furey\" in the story The Dead from Dubliners\nMichael Feeney, the \"lover\" in Joyce's poem She Weeps Over Rahoon\nthe actress Siobh\u00e1n McKenna.Bohermore Cemetery (or the New Cemetery, as it is more popularly known), Cemetery Cross, Bohermore, was opened in 1880. It contains two mortuary chapels and is the burial place of several important Galwegians, including P\u00e1draic \u00d3 Conaire the Gaelic author, William Joyce, more widely known as Lord Haw-Haw the Nazi propagandist, Augusta, Lady Gregory, co-founder of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin and Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin, a senior member of one the Tribes of Galway and former world president of the International Olympic Committee. A memorial to the 91 people who died on 14 August 1959 when Dutch aeroplane KLM Flight 607-E crashed into the sea 180 km (112 mi) west of Galway can be seen just inside the main gates. Several bodies of the passengers are buried around the memorial.\nThere are several smaller cemeteries within the city boundaries. Some are no longer in use or are used primarily by families with ancient burial rights. These are St James's Cemetery (Teampall) in Glenina Heights, Menlo Cemetery near Menlo Castle, Ballybrit Graveyard near the entrance to Galway Racecourse, and a very ancient early Christian graveyard at Roscam near Merlin Park. Several city churches have graveyards attached which were formerly used for the interment of clergy and parishioners \u2013 Castlegar Church, Claddagh Church', St Patrick's Church on Forster Street and St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church. Several bishops are buried in the crypt below the RC Cathedral but this not usually open to the public.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nInformation from the 2016 census shows Galway City has a population of 79,934, an increase of almost 4,000 over the 2011 census figures.If the current growth rate continues, the population of the city will hit 100,000 by 2020. Galway City is the fourth largest in the Republic of Ireland, and sixth on the island of Ireland.\nAs of 2009, approximately 80% of the population of Galway were Irish. Following an influx of immigrants to Galway during the 2000s, approximately 20% of the population is non-Irish. Slightly more than half of this group (11.3%) are white Europeans, coming from Poland and other Central European and Baltic States, such as Latvia and Lithuania. Smaller numbers of Asian and African immigrants come from East Africa, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka. In the 2006 Census, 15.4% of the population were aged 0\u201314, 76.1% were aged 15\u201364, and 8.5% were aged over 65. 51.9% of the population were female and 48.1% were male.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nWith a population of 79,934, Galway is the fourth most populous urban area in the State and the 23rd most populous area of local government. Services such as waste collection, recycling, traffic control, parks and housing are controlled by a fifteen-member city council elected to five-year terms by proportional representation through means of the single transferable vote. The City Council is chaired by a mayor who is elected to a one-year term by fellow councillors. The role of mayor is mainly ceremonial, although they do have the casting vote. The first mayor was Peirce Lynch Fitzjohn, elected in 1485. The current mayor, Cllr. Mike Cubbard, was elected in June 2019.The symbols of the office of the Mayor and the emblems of the dignity of the City Council are the Civic Sword (1620s) and the Great Mace (1710) which are carried in procession before the Mayor and Council on solemn civic occasions. When not in ceremonial use they can be seen at the Galway City Museum. In 1579, Queen Elizabeth I confirmed the city's charter and appointed the Mayor as 'Admiral of the Bay and of the Aran islands'. The title, though extant, is rarely used except for purely ceremonial purposes.Galway City is part of the Galway West constituency of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. Its TDs are:\n\nNoel Grealish (Independent). A Native of An Carn M\u00f3r.\nCatherine Connolly (Independent).

Higgins, President of Ireland, 2012.\n\n\n=== The courts ===\nGalway's District Court is the main court of summary jurisdiction and hears minor cases without a jury. It is responsible for hearing small civil claims, certain family law cases, administers the liquor licensing laws and is responsible for indicting the accused and sending them forward for trial at the Circuit Court and the Central Criminal Court.\nThe Circuit Court in Galway tries all indictable offences (those cases triable by a judge and jury), except murder, rape, treason, piracy and genocide, which are reserved to the Central Criminal Court. It can also hear appeals from the District Court. Its decisions can be appealed to the Court of Appeal. Civilly, the court is limited to compensation claims of not more than \u20ac75,000. Both parties may waive this amount and grant the court unlimited jurisdiction. Divorce, Judicial Separation and probate cases can be heard provided they are within the financial parameters of the courts jurisdiction. Decisions in civil cases can be appealed to the High Court.The High Court sits four times a year in Galway to hear original actions (actions that are not appeals from lower courts). It also sits twice a year in Galway to hear appeals from the Circuit Court in civil and family law cases. Its decisions can be appealed to the Court of Appeal, or in some instances, to the Supreme Court, which sit in Dublin.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nGalway is known as Ireland's Cultural Heart (Cro\u00ed Cult\u00fartha na h\u00c9ireann) and is renowned for its vibrant lifestyle and numerous festivals, celebrations and events. Every November, Galway hosts the Tulca Festival of Visual Arts as well as numerous festivals.\nOn 1 December 2014, the Director General of UNESCO announced the official designation of Galway as a UNESCO City of Film.\nIn 2004, there were three dance organisations, ten festival companies, two film organisations, two Irish language organisations, 23 musical organisations, twelve theatre companies, two visual arts groups, and four writers' groups based in the city.Furthermore, there were 51 venues for events, most of which were specialised for a certain field (e.g. concert venues or visual arts galleries), though ten were described as being 'multiple event' venues. The main squares in the city are Eyre Square (containing John F. Kennedy Park) in the centre of the city, and Spanish Parade next to the Spanish Arch.\nIn 2007, Galway was named as one of the eight \"sexiest cities\" in the world. A 2008 poll ranked Galway as the 42nd best tourist destination in the world, or 14th in Europe and 2nd in Ireland (behind Dingle).

It is sometimes referred to as the 'Bilingual Capital of Ireland', although like elsewhere in the Republic of Ireland, inhabitants converse mostly in English. The city is well known for its \"Irishness\", mainly because it has on its doorstep the Galway Gaeltacht. Irish theatre, television and radio production and Irish music form a component of Galway city life, with both An Taibhdhearc, the National Irish Language Theatre, in Galway city itself, while TG4 and RT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na Gaeltachta headquarters are in the Connemara Gaeltacht elsewhere in County Galway.

The Roman Catholic diocese of Galway was created in 1831 following the abolition by the Holy See of the Wardenship of Galway. It was united with the diocese of Kilmacduagh (est. 1152) and given the administratorship of the diocese of Kilfenora (est. 1152) in 1883. Its full name is the Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Apostolic Administratorship of Kilfenora (in Irish \u2013 Deoise na Gaillimhe, Chill Mac Duach agus Riarach\u00e1n Aspalda Cill Fhionn\u00farach, in Latin \u2013 Diocesis Galviensis, Duacensis ac Administratio Apostolica Finaborensis). The diocese is under the patronage Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas (Galway), Saint Fachanan (Kilmacduagh) and St Colman (Kilfenora). As the diocese of Kilfenora is in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Cashel the Bishop of Galway is its Apostolic Administrator rather than its bishop. The dioceses of Galway and Kilmacduagh are in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Tuam. The current bishop is Most Rev. Martin Drennan, installed 3 July 2005. Of the 38 parishes in the RC diocese 14 are situated in the city and are divided into two deaneries \u2013 the deanery of Galway City West and that of Galway City East. In each deanery a Vicar Forane exercises limited jurisdiction on behalf of the bishop.\nIn the Church of Ireland, Galway is a parish of the United Diocese of Tuam, Killala and Achonry. The principal church of the parish is the St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church (founded 1320). Russian, Romanian, Coptic, and Mar Thoma Syrian Orthodox Churches use the facilities of St Nicholas Collegiate Church for their services. The Ahmadiyya-run Galway Mosque, opened in 2014, is the only purpose-built mosque in Galway.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nGalway has a diverse sporting heritage, with a history in sports ranging from horse racing, Gaelic games, soccer and rugby to rowing, basketball, motorsport, greyhound racing and others. The Galway Races are known worldwide and are the highlight of the Irish horse racing calendar. Over the years it has grown into an annual festival lasting seven days.\n\n\n==== Gaelic games ====\n\nBoth hurling and football are strong in Galway city. Pearse Stadium in Salthill is the home to Galway GAA, the county's Gaelic games body. The Galway hurlers compete annually in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship for the Liam MacCarthy Cup.  Despite having won the cup only five times in their history, Galway is considered as one of the top teams in the Championship. Galway reached the 2012 All-Ireland final only to draw with Kilkenny to force a replay, the first since 1959, which they eventually lost. In 2017 Galway lifted the Liam MacCarthy Cup for the first time in 29 years beating Waterford by 0-26 to 2-17. The footballers compete annually in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship for the Sam Maguire Cup. The Gaelic footballers have won the cup nine times with the most recent being in 2001.\n\n\n==== Association football ====\n\nGalway United FC is based in the city and plays in the League of Ireland Premier Division. The team plays its home games at Eamonn Deacy Park. The club was formed in 2013 and first competed in the 2014 season.\nThe previous tenants of Eamonn Deacy Park, also called Galway United, first competed in the League of Ireland since 1977, then known as Galway Rovers. Michael D. Higgins, later elected President of Ireland in 2011, served as a president of the club in a ceremonial capacity. Following struggles with debts, the club became defunct at the end of the 2011 season. The Galway United Supporters Trust (GUST) had been servicing many debts of the company and were able to keep the club afloat for the 2011 season, with it having been effectively abandoned by its directors. GUST withdrew their support for the team and applied to join the 2012 League of Ireland as a community enterprise, rather than as a private company, which the old club had been. This application was not successful, however.\nGalway F.C. was formed the following year from a merger of GUST with Mervue United and Salthill Devon, two other clubs in the city, who had competed in the First Division since 2009 and 2010 respectively.\n\n\n==== Rugby ====\n\n\n===== Professional =====\nThe professional team for the province, Connacht Rugby, is based in the city.

These provide related facilities and organise rowing competitions. These clubs include: Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol Rowing Club, Tribesmen Rowing Club, Galway Rowing Club, Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id ('The Jes') Rowing Club, St. Joseph's Patrician College ('The Bish') Rowing Club, NUIG Boat Club and Cumann R\u00e1mhaiochta Chol\u00e1iste na Coiribe.\nIn 2009 Galway hosted a stopover on the Volvo Ocean Race and the city was finishing point of the round-the-world competition in July 2012.\n\n\n==== Greyhound racing ====\nNear the city centre, on College Road, the Sportsground has greyhound races every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night.

The city has experienced very rapid growth in recent years. Galway has a strong local economy with complementary business sectors, including manufacturing industry, tourism, retail and distribution, education, healthcare and services that include financial, construction, cultural, and professional.\nMost (47%) of the people employed in Galway work in either the commerce or professional sector, with a large number (17%) also employed in manufacturing. Most industry and manufacturing in Galway, like the rest of Ireland, is hi-tech (e.g. ICT, medical equipment, electronics, chemicals, etc.), due to the Celtic Tiger economic boom. Companies such as Boston Scientific, Medtronic, EA Games, Cisco and SAP AG have their regional offices or other offices in Galway City and environs. Tourism is also of major importance to the city, which had over 2.1 million visitors in 2000, and produced revenue of over \u20ac400 million.The head office of Smyths, a toy shop company, is in Galway.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\n\n==== Radio ====\nThere are two radio stations based in the city \u2013 Galway Bay FM (95.8 FM) broadcasts from the city to the whole county; Flirt FM (101.3 FM) is the student radio station for NUI Galway.\n\n\n==== Print ====\nOne of the main regional newspapers for the county is The Connacht Tribune which prints two titles every week, the Connacht Tribune on Thursday, and the Galway City Tribune on Friday.

Galway Hub is a free resource for both practitioners and the general public in which to engage with the arts and cultural events across the city and county.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Air ====\nGalway Airport, located 6 km (3.73 mi) east of the city at Carnmore, ceased to have scheduled passenger flights on 1 November 2011.  Because the runway is too short to take modern passenger jet aircraft, it it only capable of imited operations. Aerfort na Minna (22 km (13.67 mi) west of the city) operates regular flights to each of the Aran Islands (Oile\u00e1in \u00c1rann). Shannon Airport (90 km) and Ireland West Airport Knock (86 km) are the nearest international airports, both of which have flights around Ireland and to Britain, Continental Europe and North America (from Shannon).\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nBuses are the main form of public transport in the city and county. Routes operated by Bus \u00c9ireann include routes 401 (Salthill/Parkmore), 402 (Seacrest/Merlin Park), 404 (Newcastle/Oranmore), 405 (Rahoon/Ballybane), 407 (B\u00f3thar an Ch\u00f3iste) and 409 (Parkmore Industrial). Routes operated by City Direct include routes 410 (Salthill), 411 (Knocknacarra - Cappagh Rd), 412 (Knocknacarra Express), and 414 (Barna).Various bus companies also provide links throughout County Galway and nationwide.  These operate from a number of locations:\n\nThe main bus and rail station in the city is Ceannt Station.\nGalway Coach Station, located at Fairgreen, is also a coach transport hub. Scheduled direct and commuter services operate between the Coach Station, Dublin and Dublin Airport, as well as services to Limerick, Cork and Clifden. These are operated by Gobus and Citylink.\nOther regional bus operators use various bus stops around the city centre, and many serve the NUIG and GMIT campuses as well.\n\n\n==== Rail ====\n\nGalway's main railway station is Ceannt Station (St\u00e1isi\u00fan Cheannt), which opened in 1851, and was renamed in honour of \u00c9amonn Ceannt in 1966. A major redevelopment, including a completely new urban district, Ceannt Station Quarter, has been proposed for the station and adjoining land.\nThe Midland Great Western Railway reached Galway in 1851, giving the city a direct main line to its Broadstone Station terminus in Dublin. As the 19th century progressed the rail network in Connacht was expanded, making Galway an important railhead. The nearby town of Athenry became a railway junction, giving Galway links to Ennis, Limerick and the south in 1869 and Sligo and the north in 1894. In 1895 the MGW opened a branch line between Galway and Clifden.\nThe 20th century brought increasing road competition, and this led the Great Southern Railways to close the Clifden branch in 1935. In the 1970s the state railway authority C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann closed the Sligo-Athenry-Ennis line to passenger services. It later closed to freight as well.\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann, Ireland's national rail operator, currently runs six return passenger services each day between Galway and Dublin Heuston, also serving intermediate stations. Travel time is just under 3 hours. Services on the Galway\u2013Limerick line have now resumed, with around 5\u20136 trains each way per day.\nFrom Galway railway services along the Western Rail Corridor link the city with Ennis, and Limerick where trains run to Cork via Limerick Junction (for Tipperary, Clonmel and Waterford) and Mallow (for Killarney and Tralee).\n\n\n==== Road ====\nFour national primary roads serve the city: the M6 motorway running east\u2013west (Athlone, Dublin), the M17 motorway running north from the M6 to Tuam, the N63, formerly the N17, connecting Galway with the Northwest (Tuam, Sligo, Donegal Town, Letterkenny and Derry), and the M18 motorway linking Galway to southern towns and cities Gort, Ennis, Shannon Town, Limerick and Cork joining up with The Wild Atlantic Way. In addition, there are plans for a semi-ring road of the city, the Galway City Outer Bypass. There is also an Inner City Ring (Cuar Inmhe\u00e1nach) route that encircles the city centre, most of which is pedestrianised.\nGalway is considered the gateway to Connemara and the Gaeltacht, including M\u00e1m, An Teach D\u00f3ite, Cor na M\u00f3na, Ros Muc, Bearna and An Cheathr\u00fa Rua. The N59 along the western shore of Lough Corrib and the R337 along the northern shore of Galway Bay both lead to this largely rural and highly scenic region.\n\n\n==== Waterways ====\nThe River Corrib is by far the most important waterway in Galway and a number of canals and channels were built above and through the city. The purposes of these to divert and control the water from the river, to harness its power and to provide a navigable route to the sea.  Of these, there were two major schemes \u2013 one between 1848 and 1858 and the other during the 1950s. The canals provided a power source for Galway and were the location of the first industries in the mid-19th century. The Eglinton Canal provided a navigation from the sea (at the Claddagh Basin) to the navigable part of the river (above the Salmon Weir Bridge). Most of the mills are still used today for various purposes; for instance, NUI Galway still uses a water turbine for electricity generation for their building on Nun's Island.\nCurrently, there are four bridges across the Corrib. Following the southward flow of the river these are, from the north: the Quincentennial Bridge, the Salmon Weir Bridge, the William O'Brien Bridge and the Wolfe Tone Bridge. There are plans for a fifth bridge as part of the Galway City Outer Bypass project. The Clare River flows from the North of the County Galway, through Tuam, Claregalway into Lough Corrib.\n\n\n==== Harbour ====\n\nGalway is the most central port on the West Coast of Ireland in the sheltered eastern corner of Galway Bay. The harbour can be used by vessels up to 10,000 tonnes deadweight (DWT) and the inner dock can accommodate up to 9 vessels at any one time. Pending approval, Galway Harbour may see major changes, should the \u20ac1.5 billion development plan go ahead.\nRegular passenger ferry and freight services operate between Galway and the tourist destination of the Aran Islands which is home to World Heritage Site D\u00fan Aonghasa. The islands also have regular links with the towns of Rossaveal and Doolin, which are physically closer but far smaller.\nCommuter ferry services have been proposed to the tourism town of Kinvara, on the opposite side of Galway Bay.Major work in the harbour area was carried out in 2009 to accommodate the stopover of the Volvo Ocean Race. This was one of the biggest events ever to visit Galway. The event returned with the finale of the race in June 2012. This was unprecedented in Volvo Ocean Race history.\n\n\n==== Walking ====\nThe city is planned as the start of the E2 European long-distance path, running for 4,850 kilometres (3,010 mi) to Nice, though the Irish section is as yet incomplete.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nGalway Textile Printers, located on Sandy Road, was the first major industry to come to Galway and quickly became one of the biggest employers in the west of Ireland. Some of those who worked there were specialists who were brought in to help set the factory up, but most employees were local. The Mills eventually went out of business in the early 1980s and its former site now hosts various small business establishments.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAs of 2002, there were 27 primary schools and 11 secondary schools in Galway.\n\n\n=== University ===\nNUI Galway was founded in 1845 as Queen's College, Galway, and was more recently known as University College, Galway (U.C.G.).

The National Institute for Prevention and Cardiovascular Health (NIPC) is an affiliate of NUI Galway.The offices of the Central Applications Office (C.A.O.) are also located in the city, this being the clearing house for undergraduate college and university applications in the Republic of Ireland; a related organisation, the Postgraduate Applications Centre, processes some taught postgraduate courses.\n\n\n=== Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) ===\n\nGMIT, in addition to having two campuses in Galway City, also has campuses in Castlebar, Letterfrack and Mountbellew. GMIT's Galway campus is based on the Dublin Road in Galway city, overlooking Galway Bay. It is the administrative headquarters for the Institute and has four Schools of study; the School of Business, the School of Engineering, the School of Science & Computing, and the College of Tourism & Arts.\n\n\n== Health ==\nPublicly funded health care and social services are provided in Galway by the HSE (West) division of the Health Services Executive.\nThe main city hospital, University Hospital Galway, is located on two campuses \u2014 Galway University Hospital and Merlin Park University Hospital.Two private hospitals \u2013 The Galway Clinic and the Bon Secours Hospital, Galway \u2013 also operate in the city.\nGalway Hospice provides palliative care for the people of Galway City and County on a homecare, inpatient and daycare basis.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of twin towns and sister cities in the Republic of Ireland\nThe Galway Line\nTerryland Forest Park\nGalway Technology Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Galway travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGalway City Council (local authority)\nGalway City and County Cultural Website",

        "wiki": "Oranmore (Irish: \u00d3r\u00e1n M\u00f3r) is a town and parish in County Galway on the outskirts of the city of Galway in the west of Ireland.\nOranmore is 9 km (5.6 mi) east of Galway City on the edge of Oranmore Bay, an inlet of Galway Bay.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nOranmore is the anglicisation of Uar\u00e1n M\u00f3r. The first written record of Oranmore is in the Annals of the Four Masters. It was originally called Fuar\u00e1n M\u00f3r (\"Great Spring\" in Irish). The name refers to a spring to the northwest of the main village. A bi-lingual information sign was erected by Oranmore Community Development Association in 2010 outlining the history of the spring.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-history ===\nEvidence of prehistoric settlement in the Oranmore Parish area include a number of fulacht fiadh (at Frenchfort townland), ringforts (Rinn townland) and a megalithic structure (at Garraun South townland). Griffith's Valuation, a land survey completed in 1957, shows several such structures (sometimes colloquially and collectively known as fairy forts) in the area.\n\n\n=== Medieval church ruins ===\nThe ruin of a medieval Roman Catholic church is one of the oldest buildings in Oranmore town. Its northern wall forms part of the enclosure which encompasses the church and its graveyard. The church is believed to date to the 13th century. If true, this means it was built no later than one and half century's after the initial Anglo-Norman Invasion of 1169 AD.The existing remains measure approximately 32 feet by 72 feet, however, there is evidence that the church was larger at one time. Some grave markers in the adjoining cemetery have no discernible name or date. Other graves have been marked with pieces of the fallen church walls. The oldest grave stone, with a discernible date inscription, is a Celtic cross dated 1661. It is no longer in its original location, but is instead lying on top of another, newer stone slab.There is a gated section within the graveyard set aside for the Presentation Sisters, an order of teaching sisters who established a convent in Oranmore in 1861. Some interments occurred within the ruined walls of the actual church.\n\n\n=== Oramore Castle ===\n\nOranmore Castle is a tower house which was originally associated with the Norman Clanricarde family. It was built around the 15th century, reputedly on the site of an earlier structure.\n\n\n=== St. Mary's Church ===\n\nCompleted in 1803, St. Mary's is a large church building with a bell-cote above the front door and an elaborate ceiling. In 1972, it was replaced as the local parish church with the newer, larger Church of the Immaculate Conception.  St. Mary's was deconsecrated and converted to become the town's public library. Its carved baptismal font was moved to the new church, but the graveyard was left intact.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe focus of industry has shifted from dairy agriculture to tourism, manufacturing and logistics. Oranmore has four hotels and 23 restaurants.\n\n\n== Railways ==\nOranmore railway station opened on 1 August 1851, closed on 17 June 1963. A new station was built 1.4km west of the original station and was opened on 28 July 2013. Trains connect directly with Galway, Athenry, Athlone, Portarlington, Kildare and Dublin Heuston, as well as on the Western Rail Corridor to Ennis and Limerick.\n\n\n== Education ==\nOranmore has three primary schools, Scoil Iosaif Naofa, Scoil Mhuire and Gaelscoil de h\u00cdde. Calasanctius College, founded in 1861 by the Presentation Sisters, is the secondary school in Oranmore.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nOranmore village is near the old N6 Galway to Dublin road and the old N18 from Galway to Limerick. The M6 Motorway connects to the existing road at Doughiska, as well as connecting with the M18 at Glenascaul. The former N6 leading into Oranmore has been reclassified as the R338 regional road. The M18 motorway was officially opened on 27 September 2017 and connects to the M6 at Rathmorrissey at a three-level interchange. This road runs close to Oranmore but does not connect directly to it, and instead, motorists have to access it using the R381 at Kiltiernan or the M6 at Rathmorrissey.\nBus \u00c9ireann, Citylink, and Nestor Bus services through Oranmore serve Galway, Dublin, Cork, and Dublin and Shannon Airports. \nOranmore aerodrome was a Royal Air Force base in World War I. It later became a civil airfield serving the city of Galway. It was the site where many British and Irish troops lost their lives and there is a ceremony in Oranmore each year to remember them.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nOranmore-Maree GAA is the local GAA club, and has won a number county titles across several age groups, including a Galway Senior Hurling Championship title in 1933 and All-Ireland Intermediate Club Hurling Championship title in 2019. The club fields teams in Gaelic football, hurling and camogie. Naomh Mhuire Ladies Football Club, Oranmore Maree fields ladies' Gaelic football teams from under-10 to minor and junior.Galway Bay Golf Resort is based in Renvile, Oranmore, and has been named best golf resort in Connacht 10 times.Maree/Oranmore Soccer Club was founded in 1988. Other clubs in the area include the Oranmore Badminton Club, Maree Badminton Club, Maree Basketball Club, Oranmore Judo Club and Galway Bay Sailing Club. The latter is based in Renville, Oranmore. Junior \"Park Run\" events are run on Sunday mornings.\n\n\n== People ==\nJoseph Henry Blake, nobleman and socialist, grew up on a nearby estate in Treanlaur, Maree.\nThomas Nicholas Redington, Irish politician, born here.\nJoe Howley, Irishman involved in the struggle for Irish Independence, was killed by the British in December 1920. A statue stands in Oranmore in his honour.\nBill King, round-the-world sailor and owner of Oranmore Castle.\nC\u00e9lestin Lain\u00e9, leader of the Bezen Perrot lived there after World War 2\nAaron Connolly, professional Premier League footballer\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOranmore community page",

          "Heard there was a castle - thanks to TripAdvisor. Turns out it has pretty restrictive hours and tours via appointment. Access is available around the side on the sea side. Good for a 5 minute walk around, not a bad scenic stop. Please see photo for times and appointment",

          "You cannot go inside, and there are far more impressive castles in surrounding areas and towns. It's one of the only things to see in the town, but it's not somewhere you'd more than glance or spend 10-minutes at.",

          "We were visiting the whole area and we were so disappointed to see the castle was closed and opened only during certain periods of time. Very sad for such a lovely view and an amazing summer day, which in Ireland is very rare. I would recommend it though, but check it first",

          "This castle is behind supermarkets, and on the shoreline. Gate was padlocked and a note about opening times. If the family are restoring it, which must be a huge expense, it could be opened more frequently. Disappointed I'd wasted time driving to find it.",
          "This atmospheric castle sits forlornly behind the Aldi and Tesco stores. It was closed to the public at the time of our October visit, but made a decent photo opportunity. The rocks are slippery at low tide.",
          "While we didn't go into the castle itself (it was after hours when we arrived), the view out into the bay with the castle in the foreground was magical. Truly brings you into another world (if you aren't used to being around castles all the time ;-))",
          "As an archaeology student, I love visiting all the different castles scattered around Galway. Oranmore castle is a little smaller and not as well-researched as some of the other castles, but still definitely worth a visit! The lady running the tours of the castle, Leonie, is",

          "Small castle but worth a look. Not good for the disabled due to access via numerous stairs. View from the top is worth the climb. There is a guided tour if you are interested. Car park for castle is further down the road from the castle, people come and go all the time.",
          "OK for a ten minute stop. The bottom part is free but you need to pay to go to the top, which isn't really necessary.Village it's in is very pretty and also worth a little walk around.",

          "This castle seems to be of an embarrassment to Oranmore as i can't think of another reason that they don't utilise it more- unlike most other towns/cities that have a castle. Its found down the bottom of a road that then makes you feel like you're trespassing to find a locked",
          "This castle was not open for touring. The sign on the front gate said that the castle opens for tours starting in July. It looked like someone might live there. We did park at the entrance and walk around the outside of the walls. The castle is located on Galway Bay, and",

        "wiki": "Theobald Wolfe Tone, posthumously known as Wolfe Tone (20 June 1763 \u2013 19 November 1798), was a leading Irish revolutionary figure and one of the founding members of the United Irishmen, a republican society that revolted against British rule in Ireland, where he was a leader going into the 1798 Irish Rebellion. He was captured at Lough Swilly, near Buncrana, County Donegal on 3 November 1798, and was sentenced to death on 12 November by hanging. He died seven days later in unclear circumstances. It has since been theorised and agreed upon by most Irish scholars that he committed suicide while in prison.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWolfe Tone was born on 20 June 1763. His family were descended from a French Protestant family who fled to England from Gascony in the 16th century to escape religious persecution. A branch of the family settled in Dublin in the 17th century. Theobald's father, Peter Tone, was a coach-maker who had a farm near Sallins, County Kildare and belonged to the Church of Ireland. His mother came from a Catholic merchant family who converted to Protestantism after Theobald was born. His maternal grandfather was captain of a vessel in the West India trade.He was baptised as Theobald Wolfe Tone in honour of his godfather, Theobald Wolfe of Blackhall, County Kildare, a first cousin of Arthur Wolfe, 1st Viscount Kilwarden. However, it was widely believed that Tone was the son of Theobald Wolfe, which, if true, made him a half-brother of the poet Charles Wolfe. After his death, he was widely referred to as Wolfe Tone.\nIn 1783, Tone found work as a tutor to Anthony and Robert, younger half-brothers of Richard Martin MP of Galway, a prominent supporter of Catholic emancipation, at Dangan, the Martin family home. Tone fell in love with Martin's wife, but later wrote that it came to nothing. During this period he briefly considered a career in the theatre as an actor.He studied law at Trinity College Dublin, where he became an active member in the College Historical Society debating club and was elected its auditor in 1785. He graduated BA in February 1786. He qualified as a barrister in King's Inns at the age of 26 after keeping the requisite terms as a student member of the Middle Temple in London. As a student, he eloped with Martha Witherington, daughter of William and Catherine Witherington (n\u00e9e Fanning) of Dublin. She would go on to change her name to Matilda, at Tone's request.\nWhen they married, Tone was 22, and Matilda was about 16. In 1796, while he was in France and she in Hamburg he wrote in his journal: \"She is the delight of my eyes, the joy of my heart, the only object for which I wish to live. I doat upon her to distraction.\"Disappointed at finding no support for a plan that he had submitted to William Pitt the Younger, to found a military colony in Hawaii, Tone initially planned to enlist as a soldier in the East India Company, but applied too late in the year, when no more ships would be sent out until the following spring.\n\n\n== Politician ==\n\nIn September 1791, Tone published An Argument on behalf of the Catholics of Ireland, signed \"A Northern Whig\". It displayed the growing breach between Whig patriots like Henry Flood and Henry Grattan, who sought Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform without severing the tie to England. Tone expressed contempt for the constitution Grattan obtained from the British government in 1782. Himself an Anglican, Tone urged co-operation between the religions in Ireland as the only means of obtaining redress of Irish grievances. The British government had just passed the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791, but the Dublin parliament was in no hurry to do so. \nIn October 1791 Tone converted these ideas into practical policy by founding, in conjunction with Thomas Russell (1767\u20131803), Napper Tandy and others, the Society of the United Irishmen. Until 1794, this society aimed at no more than the formation of a political union between Catholics and Protestants, with a view to obtaining a liberal measure of parliamentary reform. In 1792 he was appointed an assistant secretary of the Catholic Committee.The Catholics involved were not united regarding the steps they were to take, and in December 1791, sixty-eight members withdrew, led by Lord Kenmare, with the support of the higher clergy. When the British government questioned the legality of the Catholic Convention called in December 1792, Tone drew up for the committee a statement of the case on which a favourable opinion of counsel was obtained. A petition was made to King George III early in 1793, and that year the re-enfranchisement of Catholics was enacted \u2013 if they owned property as \"forty-shilling freeholders\". They could again be called as barristers and serve as army officers. They could not, however, enter parliament or be made state officials above grand jurors. The Convention voted to Tone a sum of \u00a31,500 with a gold medal and voted to dissolve. In this new climate of goodwill the Maynooth College Act 1795 was passed. \nSectarian animosity threatened to undermine the United Irishmen movement: two secret societies in Ulster fought against each other: the agrarian Protestant Peep o' Day Boys and their Catholic opponents the Defenders. Tone's aim was to unite both into a revolutionary army of Irish \"men of no property\".\n\n\n== Revolutionary in exile ==\n\nIn 1794 the Society of United Irishmen became a sworn association, using oaths that aimed at the overthrow of the Kingdom of Ireland. Given that France and Britain had been at war since early 1793, administering or making such oaths turned a reformist republican society that had wanted to extend the franchise within the existing system into a republican revolutionary one.\nAffiliating more closely with the new French Republic also associated Tone with its evolving policy of \"Dechristianization\", which was strongly opposed by the Catholic Church in Ireland. Seen as a Catholic champion in the early 1790s, most of his wealthier Catholic supporters fell away in 1794. \nAlso in 1794, the United Irishmen, persuaded that no party in the Dublin parliament (where being an MP was limited to Anglicans) seemed likely to accept their scheme of universal manhood suffrage and equal electoral districts, began to recast their hopes on a French invasion. An Irish clergyman living in England, the Reverend William Jackson, who had taken in revolutionary opinions during his long stay in France, came to Ireland to ascertain to what extent the Irish people were ready to support a French invasion. Tone drew up a memorandum for Jackson on the state of Ireland, which he described as ripe for revolution. An attorney named Cockayne, to whom Jackson had imprudently disclosed his mission, betrayed the memorandum to the government. In April 1794 Jackson was arrested on a charge of treason and dramatically committed suicide during his trial.Several of the leading United Irishmen, including Archibald Hamilton Rowan, fled the country; the papers of the United Irishmen were seized by the Dublin administration, and for a time the organisation was broken up. Tone, who had not attended meetings of the society since May 1793, remained in Ireland until after the trial of Jackson and was advised to leave Ireland in April 1795. Having friends among the government party, including members of the Beresford family, he succeeded in making terms with the government and emigrated to the United States, where he arrived in May 1795. Before leaving, he and his family travelled to Belfast, and it was at the summit of Cavehill that Tone made the Cavehill Compact with fellow Irish radicals, including Russell and McCracken, promising \"never to desist in our efforts until we had subverted the authority of England over our country, and asserted our independence.\"The United Irishmen reformed in 1796. The Society began seriously to look to France to support a rising with troops.Living in Philadelphia, Tone wrote a few months later to Thomas Russell expressing unqualified dislike of the American people, whom he imagined to be no more truly democratic in sentiment and no less attached to authority than the British; he described George Washington as a \"high-flying aristocrat\", and he found the aristocracy of money and achievement in America still less to his liking than the European aristocracy of birth. Tone also lived briefly in West Chester and in Downingtown, Pennsylvania.\nFinding himself at Philadelphia in the company of Reynolds, Rowan, and Tandy, Tone went to Paris to persuade the French government to send an expedition to invade Ireland. In February 1796 he arrived in Paris and had interviews with De La Croix and Carnot, who were impressed by his energy, sincerity, and ability. A commission was given him as adjutant-general in the French army, which he hoped might protect him from the penalty of treason in the event of capture by the British; though he himself claimed the authorship of a proclamation said to have been issued by the United Irishmen, enjoining that all Irishmen taken with arms in their hands in the British service should be instantly shot; and he supported a project for landing La Legion Noire in England, who were to burn Bristol.A sympathizer wrote of him, in French,  saying:\n\nWolf Tone was sent to France to claim the support of the Directory, under the express condition that the French should come to Ireland as allies, and should act under direction of the new government, as Rochambeau had done in America.  With this view, Tone had frequently conferences at Paris with Hoche; and the Directory finally determined to send from Brest a fleet of forty-five sail, with an army of fifteen thousand men, under the charge of this able general, December 15, 1796.  England was saved by a violent tempest.\n\n\n== Hoche's Expedition and the 1798 Rebellion ==\n\nThe French Directory planned a military landing in Ireland in support of the coming revolution foretold by Tone. The Directory possessed information from Lord Edward FitzGerald and Arthur O'Connor confirming Tone, and prepared to despatch an expedition under Louis Lazare Hoche. On 15 December 1796, the expedition, consisting of forty-three sail and carrying about 14,450 men with a large supply of war material for distribution in Ireland, sailed from Brest. Tone accompanied it as \"Adjutant-general Smith\" and had the greatest contempt for the seamanship of the French sailors, who were unable to land due to severe gales. They waited for days off Bantry Bay, waiting for the winds to ease, but eventually returned to France.\nTone served for some months in the French army under Hoche, who had become the French Republic's minister of war after his victory against the Austrians at the Battle of Neuwied on the Rhine in April 1797. In June 1797 Tone took part in preparations for a military expedition to Ireland from the Batavian Republic, a puppet state created during the Batavian Revolution in the Low Countries in January 1795. However, the Batavian fleet under Dutch Vice-Admiral Jan de Winter was delayed in the harbour of Texel island that summer by unfavourable easterly winds and from mid-August by a British North-Sea fleet blockade. It eventually put to sea in the first week of October only to be immediately crushed by Admiral Adam Duncan in the Battle of Camperdown on October 11, 1797. Tone then returned to Paris. General Hoche, once tasked with an Irish expeditionary force, died of tuberculosis on 19 September 1797 at Wetzlar after returning to his command on France's Rhine frontier.\nIn Ireland the membership of the United Irish had reached 300,000, about 6% of the population, but a vicious counter-insurgency campaign in 1797 weakened the organisation and forced the leadership to launch a rising without French aid. More importantly, in a largely devoutly Catholic country, the Roman Catholic hierarchy was completely opposed to the United Irish, as they were allied to the French who had just invaded Rome and set up the anti-clerical \"Roman Republic\" in early 1798. \nNapoleon Bonaparte, with whom Tone had several interviews at this time, was less disposed than Hoche had been to undertake in earnest an Irish expedition; and when the Rising broke out in Ireland in 1798 he had started for Egypt. When Tone urged the Directory to send effective assistance to the Irish rebels, all that could be promised was a number of raids to descend simultaneously around the Irish coast. One of these under General Humbert succeeded in landing a force near Killala, County Mayo, and gained some success in Connacht (particularly at Castlebar) before it was subdued by General Lake and Charles Cornwallis. Wolfe Tone's brother Matthew was captured, tried by court-martial, and hanged; a second raid, accompanied by Napper Tandy, came to disaster on the coast of Donegal; while Wolfe Tone took part in a third, under Admiral Jean-Baptiste-Fran\u00e7ois Bompart, with General Jean Hardy in command of a force of about 3,000 men. This encountered a British squadron at Buncrana on Lough Swilly on 12 October 1798. Tone, on board the ship Hoche, refused Bompart's offer of escape in a frigate before the battle of Tory Island, and was taken prisoner when the Hoche surrendered. Tone was brought ashore at Letterkenny Port and all French forces of the Hoche were taken to Lord Cavan in Letterkenny's home where he faced arrest.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nWhen the prisoners were landed a fortnight later, Sir George Hill recognised Tone in the French adjutant-general's uniform in Lord Cavan's privy-quarters at Letterkenny. At his trial by court-martial in Dublin on 8 November 1798 Tone made a speech avowing his determined hostility to England and his intention \"by frank and open war to procure the separation of the countries\".\nRecognising that the court was certain to convict him, he asked that \"the court should adjudge me to die the death of a soldier, and that I may be shot\". Reading from a prepared speech, he defended his view of a military separation from Britain (as had occurred in the fledgeling United States), he explained his motives:\n\nI entered into the service of the French Republic with the sole view of being useful to my country.  To contend against British Tyranny, I have braved the fatigues and terrors of the field of battle; I have sacrificed my comfort, have courted poverty, have left my wife unprotected, and my children without a father.  After all I have done for a sacred cause, death is no sacrifice.  In such enterprises, everything depends on success:  Washington succeeded \u2013 Kosciusko failed.  I know my fate, but I neither ask for pardon nor do I complain.  I admit openly all I have said, written, and done, and am prepared to meet the consequences.  As, however, I occupy a high grade in the French army, I would request that the court, if they can, grant me the favour that I may die the death of a soldier.\nA commentary on the trial continues: \"After a long silence, interrupted by some expressions of admiration, he was told that his request should be submitted to the Lord-lieutenant.  Thinking, however, that there was but little prospect, he committed suicide in prison.  With Wolfe Tone, terminated the insurrection of 1798. He was the prime mover of it, and was its last victim\u2026\"He also lamented the outbreak of mass violence, saying: \"Such are my principles such has been my conduct; if in consequence of the measures in which I have been engaged misfortunes have been brought upon this country, I heartily lament it, but let it be remembered that it is now nearly four years since I have quit Ireland and consequently I have been personally concerned in none of them; if I am rightly informed very great atrocities have been committed on both sides, but that does not at all diminish my regret; for a fair and open war I was prepared; if that has degenerated into a system of assassination, massacre, and plunder I do again most sincerely lament it, and those few who know me personally will give me I am sure credit for the assertion.\"To the people, he had the following to say from the dock:\n\nI have laboured to abolish the infernal spirit of religious persecution, by uniting the Catholics and Dissenters. To the former I owe more than ever can be repaid. The service I was so fortunate as to render them they rewarded munificently; but they did more: when the public cry was raised against me\u2014when the friends of my youth swarmed off and left me alone\u2014the Catholics did not desert me; they had the virtue even to sacrifice their own interests to a rigid principle of honour; they refused, though strongly urged, to disgrace a man who, whatever his conduct towards the Government might have been, had faithfully and conscientiously discharged his duty towards them; and in so doing, though it was in my own case, I will say they showed an instance of public virtue of which I know not whether there exists another example\n\nHis eloquence was in vain, and his request to be shot was denied. On 10 November 1798, he was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged on 12 November. Before this sentence was carried out, either he attempted suicide by slitting his throat or British soldiers tortured and mortally wounded him. The story goes that he was initially saved when the wound was sealed with a bandage, and he was told if he tried to talk the wound would open and he would bleed to death. He responded by saying \"I can yet find words to thank you sir; it is the most welcome news you could give me. What should I wish to live for?\".He was treated at the time of his death by military surgeon Benjamin Lentaigne, who treated Tone just hours before he was due to be hanged. A pamphlet published in Latin by the doctor some years after Tone's official \"suicide\" refers to an unusual neck wound suffered by an unnamed patient which indicated that \"a bullet passed through his throat\". This has led to speculation that Tone may have been shot.Theobald Wolfe Tone died on 19 November 1798 at the age of 35 in Provost's Prison, Dublin, not far from where he was born. He is buried in Bodenstown, Co. Kildare, near his birthplace at Sallins, and his grave is in the care of the National Graves Association.\n\n\n== Support from Lord Kilwarden ==\n\nHis godfather Theobald Wolfe was Tone's natural father, according to several sources. A cousin, Arthur Wolfe, Lord Kilwarden, had warned Tone to leave Ireland in 1795. Then when Tone was arrested and brought to Dublin in 1798, and facing certain execution, it was Kilwarden (a senior judge) who granted two orders for Habeas Corpus for his release. This was a remarkable act, given that the rebellion had just occurred with great loss of life, and one that could never be enlarged upon as Kilwarden was killed at the beginning of Emmet's revolt in 1803. The Wolfes knew that Tone was their cousin. As a pillar of the Protestant Ascendancy and, as Attorney-General for Ireland the prosecutor of the case against United Irishman William Orr, Kilwarden had no other obvious motive for trying to assist Tone in 1795 and 1798. Portraits of Wolfe around 1800 arguably show a resemblance to Wolfe Tone.Maud Wolfe (1892\u20131980), the last of the Wolfes to live in Kildare, continued her family tradition of annually laying flowers at Tone's grave until her death.The historian A. T. Q. Stewart has commented (2001) on Tone's long obsession with the heroism and death in battle of James Wolfe in 1759, seeing him as a cousin to be emulated. In this sense \"Wolfe Tone\" becomes a surname reflecting his true paternity.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\"[Tone] rises\", said William Lecky, the 19th-century historian, \"far above the dreary level of commonplace which Irish conspiracy in general presents\u2026 His judgement of men and things was keen, lucid and masculine, and he was alike prompt in decision and brave in action.\"His journals, which were written for his family and intimate friends were published in Washington DC in 1821 by his son, William Theobald Wolfe Tone. They were republished in 1910 by Richard Barry O'Brien. \nTone was adopted by the Young Ireland movement of the 1840s as an iconic figure, as the father of Irish republicanism and above religious divisions. Its leader Thomas Davis found and publicised the location of Tone's grave in 1843. Modern republicans quote his ideals:\n\nTo subvert the tyranny of our execrable government, to break the connection with England, the never-failing source of all our political evils, and to assert the independence of my country\u2014these were my objects. To unite the whole people of Ireland, to abolish the memory of all past dissentions, and to substitute the common name of Irishman in the place of the denominations of Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter\u2014these were my means.\nTo unite Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter under the common name of Irishmen in order to break the connection with England, the never failing source of all our political evils, that was my aim'.\n\nIf the men of property will not support us, they must fall. Our strength shall come from that great and respectable class, the men of no property.\nIn 1898 a series of centenary commemorations of the 1798 rebellion were held by the nationalist Irish Parliamentary Party, the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Catholic Church in Ireland, that to a large extent sidelined Tone and the other Protestant Nationalist leaders. This \"Faith and Fatherland\" approach mythologised Tone and recast the rebellion as Church-sanctioned, the exact opposite of its policy in 1798.Every summer, Irish Republicans hold commemorations at Tone's grave in Bodenstown. In 1912 an annual commemoration march from Naas to Bodenstown was started by Tom Clarke, who was to be executed after the 1916 Rising. The march became a part of the folklore of Irish republican groups, with a new headstone placed in the 1940s. \nAn attempt on 17 June 1934 by Protestant Republican Congress members from Belfast to join in the commemoration march was prevented by IRA stewards. The marchers were stoned and \"scuffles broke out\". This was portrayed by some commentators as sectarianism, that republicans had abandoned Tone's aim to unite Irishmen by ignoring their religious differences, paying tribute only to his anti-British republicanism. However, Brian Hanley's history of the IRA from 1926 to 1936 concludes that the trouble arose because they were seen as \"communist\", and not for sectarian reasons.From the 1960s the Wolfe Tone Societies were founded, but failed to have an impact on mainstream Irish politics. Some members were also affiliated with the IRA. As a result Tone's grave was bombed at night by the Ulster Volunteer Force in 1971, and was then rebuilt.\n\n\n== Descendants ==\nOf Tone's four children, three died prematurely. His eldest child, Maria Tone (1786\u20131803; died in Paris) and his youngest child, Francis Rawdon Tone (1793\u20131806) both died of tuberculosis. Another son, Richard Tone (born between 1787 and 1789) died in infancy.\nOnly his son William Theobald Wolfe Tone survived to adulthood. Raised in France by his mother after Tone's death, William was appointed a cadet in the Imperial School of Cavalry in 1810 on Napoleon's orders. He was a naturalised French citizen on 4 May 1812. In January 1813 he was made sub-lieutenant in the 8th Regiment of Chasseurs and joined the Grand Army in Germany. His nom de guerre was the punning le petit loup \u2013 the little wolf. He was at the battles of L\u00f6wenberg, Goldberg, Dresden, Bauthen, M\u00fchlberg, Aachen, and Leipzig. He received six lance wounds at the Battle of Leipzig, was promoted to lieutenant and aide-de-camp of General Bagneres and was decorated with the Legion of Honour.\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, he emigrated to the United States, where he was commissioned a Captain in the United States Army and died there on 11 October 1828 at the age of 37. Matilda Tone also emigrated to the United States, and is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.\nWilliam Tone was survived by his only child, his daughter Grace Georgina.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nSeveral Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in Ireland are named in honour of Wolfe Tone. These include, in Armagh, Wolfe Tone GAC, Derrymacash; in Derry, Bellaghy Wolfe Tones GAC; in Meath, Wolfe Tones GAA, and in Tyrone, Drumquin Wolfe Tones GAC and Kildress Wolfe Tones GAC. In North America, there is the Chicago Wolfe Tones GFC in Illinois, and the Edmonton Wolfe Tones in Alberta, Canada.\nIn 1963, Brian Warfield, Noel Nagle, Tommy Byrne, and Derek Warfield formed The Wolfe Tones, an Irish rebel music band. They play Irish rebel music and are strong supporters of Irish independence. Several streets, plazas and a bridge have been named in honour of Tone, including Wolfe Tone Square in Dublin.\nA documentary by Kenneth Griffith on the life of Wolfe Tone was completed but not released. It was offered to the BBC but due to the film being mired with political controversy they did not take up this option.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Ronald McNeill (1911). \"Tone, Theobald Wolfe\".

        "wiki": "James Lynch fitz Stephen was mayor of Galway for the civic year 1493\u20131494. He is believed to have been the father of Stephen Lynch fitz James, mayor 1509\u201310, 1516\u201317 and 1523. James Lynch funded a window in St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church.\n\n\n== Hanging legend ==\n\nA legend states that James Lynch, during his term as mayor, sentenced his son to death for \"broken trust\" and murder of \"a stranger\", and personally hanged him from a window of his own house. The earliest extant account was written by a Spanish Dominican in 1674. James Mitchell argues that the story is a pure myth, since numerous earlier accounts of the period make no mention of it. Later accounts state that the \"stranger\" was a Spaniard. By the eighteenth century, the site of the hanging was identified as a house in Lombard Street whose facade included stones inscribed with the date 1624, a skull and crossbones, and the motto \"REMEMBER DEATHE / VANITI OF VANITI & ALL IS BUT VANITI\".  In Edward Mangin's 1807 novel, George III, a sea-captain tells an embellished version of the story in which the son kills a Spanish friend whom he wrongly suspects of wooing his fianc\u00e9e. James Hardiman's 1820 History of Galway presents Mangin's account as legend rather than fiction, though Hardiman's later writings give it less credence. Edward Groves' 1831 play The Warden of Galway is based on the legend, with the protagonist \"Walter Lynch\" as Warden of Galway rather than Mayor.In 1844, the house in Lombard Street was demolished, and the inscribed stones were retained by a committee. They were displayed at the Great Industrial Exhibition in Dublin in 1853. In 1854 Galway town commissioners allowed the committee to set them in a specially constructed imitation house-front set in the Market Street boundary wall of St. Nicholas' churchyard, near the site of the demolished house. A new inscription states: \"This Ancient Memorial Of The Stern And Unbending Justice Of The Chief Magistrate Of This City James Lynch Fitzstephen Elected Mayor A.D. 1493 Who Condemned And Executed His Own Guilty Son Walter On This Spot Has Been Restored To This Its Ancient Site A.D. 1854\". Concrete supports were added in 1978.In the twentieth century, the story of mayor Lynch has been presented as a false etymology of the verb \"to lynch\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nMitchell, James (1966\u20131971). \"Mayor Lynch of Galway: A Review of the Tradition\".

The woods are approximately 3 miles from Galway city centre near Galway Bay. The Woods are accessible from Cappagh park which is located in Knocknacara or from Barna Road (Coastal Road - R336) where there is a small carpark. Other sections of the Woods include an area across the road known as the South Wood which leads to marshlands ending in the Silver Strand (Irish: Tr\u00e1 na gCeann) on Galway Bay.\n\n\n== Ecological importance ==\nThe woods are owned by Galway City Council and are open to the public. They are managed as part of a large Special Area of Conservation, the Galway Bay Complex, which protects a diverse range of marine, coastal and terrestrial habitats.\nBarna Woods have been claimed to have the last natural growing oaks in the west of Ireland.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.irelands-directory.com/Galway/Barna/Tourism/photos.html\nhttp://www.galwaybarnawoods.com/",

        "wiki": "Galway ( GAWL-way; Irish: Gaillimh, pronounced [\u02c8\u0261al\u0320\u02b2\u026av\u02b2]) is a city in County Galway in the West of Ireland, in the province of Connacht. It lies on the River Corrib between Lough Corrib and Galway Bay, and is the sixth most populous city in Ireland, with a population at the 2016 Census of 79,934.Galway is renowned for its vibrant lifestyle and for hosting numerous festivals, celebrations and events such as The Galway Arts Festival. In 2018, it was named the European Region of Gastronomy. The city is currently the European Capital of Culture for 2020, alongside Rijeka, Croatia.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe city's name comes from the Irish name Gaillimhe, which formed the western boundary of the earliest settlement, D\u00fan Gaillimhe \"Fort Gaillimh\". (Mythical and alternative derivations of the name are given in History of Galway). Historically, the name was Anglicised as Galliv or Gallive, closer to the Irish pronunciation. The city's name in Latin is Galvia. Residents of the city are referred to as Galwegians.\nThe city also bears the nickname \"City of the Tribes\" (Irish: Cathair na dTreabh) because of the fourteen merchant families called the \"tribes of Galway\" who led the city in its Hiberno-Norman period.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nD\u00fan Gaillimhe (\"Fort at the Mouth (bottom) of the Gaillimh\") was constructed in 1124, by the King of Connacht, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088\u20131156). A settlement grew around it. During the Norman invasion of Connacht in the 1230s, D\u00fan Gaillimhe was captured by Richard Mor de Burgh, who had led the invasion. As the de Burghs eventually became Gaelicised, the merchants of the town, the Tribes of Galway, pushed for greater control over the walled city.\nThis led to their gaining complete control over the city and to the granting of mayoral status by the English crown in December 1484. Galway endured difficult relations with its Irish neighbours. A notice over the west gate of the city, completed in 1562 by Mayor Thomas \u00d3ge Martyn, stated \"From the Ferocious O'Flahertys may God protect us\". A by-law forbade the native Irish (as opposed to Galway's Hiberno-Norman citizens) unrestricted access into Galway, saying \"neither O\u2019 nor Mac shall strutte nor swagger through the streets of Galway\" without permission.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Galway was ruled by an oligarchy of fourteen merchant families (twelve who claimed to be of Norman origin and two of Irish origin). These were the \"Tribes of Galway\". The city thrived on international trade, and in the Middle Ages, it was the principal Irish port for trade with Spain and France. The most famous reminder of those days is ceann an bhalla (\"the end of the wall\"), now known as the Spanish Arch, constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin (1519\u201320). In 1477 Christopher Columbus visited Galway, possibly stopping off on a voyage to Iceland or the Faroe Islands. Seven or eight years later, he noted in the margin of his copy of Imago Mundi:\n\nMen of Cathay have come from the west. [Of this] we have seen many signs. And especially in Galway in Ireland, a man and a woman, of extraordinary appearance, have come to land on two tree trunks [or timbers? or a boat made of such?]\nThe most likely explanation for these bodies is that they were Inuit swept eastward by the North Atlantic Current.During the 16th and 17th centuries Galway remained loyal to the English crown for the most part, even during the Gaelic resurgence, perhaps for reasons of survival. However, by 1642 the city had allied itself with the Catholic Confederation of Kilkenny during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. During the resulting Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Cromwellian forces captured the city after a nine-month siege. At the end of the 17th century the city supported the Jacobites in the Williamite war in Ireland and was captured by the Williamites after a very short siege not long after the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. The great families of Galway were ruined. The city suffered further under the potato famines of 1845\u20131852, and it did not fully recover until the period of strong economic growth of the late 20th century (see Celtic Tiger).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike most of Ireland, Galway has an oceanic climate (Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, being one of the world's mildest cities for latitude, partly because it is on an island. Galway has a year-round mild, moist, temperate and changeable climate, due to the prevailing winds of the North Atlantic Current together with the Gulf Stream (on the other side of the Atlantic temperatures can be 20 \u00b0C cooler or more.). The city does not experience temperature extremes, with temperatures below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) being rare. The city receives an average of 1,156 mm (45.51 in) of precipitation annually, which is evenly distributed throughout the year. The average January temperature in the city is 5.9 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F) and the average July temperature is 15.9 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). The highest temperature ever recorded in Galway was 31.7 \u00b0C (89.1 \u00b0F) in July 1921, whilst the lowest temperature recorded was \u221211.7 \u00b0C (10.9 \u00b0F) in January 1945.While extreme weather is rare, the city and county can experience severe windstorms that are the result of vigorous Atlantic depressions that occasionally pass along the north west coast of Ireland. Most of these storms occur between late autumn and early spring. Due to the city's northerly location, Galway has long summer days. Sunrise on summer solstice occurs at 05:07 WEST and sunset at 22:07. By contrast, on winter solstice, the sun rises at 08:49 WET, and sets at 16:19.\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\nLynch's Castle on Shop Street is a medieval town house built by the prosperous Lynch family in the 16th century and is now a branch of Allied Irish Banks.\nThe Church of Ireland St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church is the largest medieval church still in everyday use in Ireland. It was founded in 1320 and enlarged in the following two centuries.\nThe Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas was consecrated in 1965 and is a far larger building constructed from limestone. It has an eclectic style, with a Renaissance Revival dome, pillars and round arches, and a Romanesque Revival portico that dominates the main fa\u00e7ade \u2013 which is an unusual feature in modern Irish church building.\nThe original quadrangle building of NUI Galway which was erected in 1849 (during the Great Famine or An Gorta M\u00f3r) as one of the three colleges of the Queen's University of Ireland (along with Queen's University Belfast and University College Cork). The university holds the UNESCO archive of spoken material for the Celtic languages.\nThe Hardiman, (originally the Railway Hotel, then the Great Southern Hotel and then Hotel Meyrick) built by the Great Southern Railway Company in 1845. Sitting at the southern perimeter of Eyre Square, it is the city's oldest hotel still in operation.\nThe remains of Menlo Castle can be seen outside the city, on the eastern bank of the River Corrib. It was one of the ancestral homes of the Blake family, one of the Tribes of Galway from c. 1600\u20131910. The fa\u00e7ade of the family's townhouse (\"Blake's Castle\") is still extant next to Jury's Hotel at the bottom of Quay Street.\nEglinton Canal, named after a former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, joins the River Corrib to the sea, and flows for just more than a kilometre from the University to the Claddagh.\nThe Claddagh is the oldest part of Galway but little or nothing remains of its old thatched village. However, in a side altar of the parish church, St Mary's on the Hill, is the late medieval statue of Our Lady of Galway. The ancient ritual of the Blessing of the Bay takes place on the Sunday nearest the feast of the Assumption.\nThe Browne doorway, originally located on Lower Abbeygate Street but now standing at the north end of Eyre Square, was the doorway to the townhouse of the Browne family, one of the fourteen Tribes of Galway.\nThe Lynch Window, (on Market Street), at which is a plaque commemorating one of the city's legends. According to legend, in 1493, the then Mayor, James Lynch FitzStephen, hanged his own son for the murder of a young Spanish visitor who had the misfortune to befriend the girlfriend of the Mayor's son.\nThe Hall of the Red Earl (Halla an Iarla Rua) can be viewed through a protective glass wall off Flood Street. It is the earliest medieval settlement fragment surviving within the walls of the city. It was built by the de Burgo family in the 13th century and was a key municipal building for the collection of taxes, dispensation of justice and hosting banquets. It was the medieval equivalent of tax office, court house and town hall.\n\n\n==== The Claddagh ====\n\nOn the west bank of the River Corrib as it enters the sea is the ancient neighbourhood of The Claddagh. For centuries it was an Irish-speaking enclave outside the city walls. Claddagh residents were mainly fisher folk and were governed by an elected 'King'. The King of the Claddagh settled or arbitrated disputes among the locals and had the privilege of a white sail on his fishing boat. The last true king, Martin Oliver, died in 1972. The title is still used but in a purely honorary and ceremonial context. The current King is Michael Lynskey. The area is also famous for its association with the Claddagh Ring.\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nThe Galway City Museum has two main sections: one about the heritage of Galway and one about Irish artists from the second half of the 20th century. This museum also houses the statue of the poet, P\u00e1draic \u00d3 Conaire which was originally located in the Kennedy Park section of Eyre Square, prior to the Square's renovation. A replica of the statue was erected in Eyre Square in 2017. The museum is part of the Spanish Arch, the historical remnants of the 16th century wall.The city's University has numerous museums, including the James Mitchell Geology Museum and the Computing and Communications Museum of Ireland.\nThe Nora Barnacle House Museum in Bowling Green is the smallest museum in Ireland. Nora was the lover, companion and, later, wife of writer James Joyce.\n\n\n==== Cemeteries ====\nFort Hill Cemetery, on Lough Atalia Road, is the oldest cemetery still in use in Galway City. Inside the main gate is a memorial to sailors of the Spanish Armada who were buried here in the 1580s.\nRahoon Cemetery (officially known as Mount St. Joseph Cemetery), Rahoon Road, on the western edge of the city affords splendid panoramic views of the city.\nAmong the notable persons buried here are:\n\nMichael Bodkin, an admirer of Nora Barnacle, the wife of James Joyce, who was the inspiration for the character, \"Michael Furey\" in the story The Dead from Dubliners\nMichael Feeney, the \"lover\" in Joyce's poem She Weeps Over Rahoon\nthe actress Siobh\u00e1n McKenna.Bohermore Cemetery (or the New Cemetery, as it is more popularly known), Cemetery Cross, Bohermore, was opened in 1880. It contains two mortuary chapels and is the burial place of several important Galwegians, including P\u00e1draic \u00d3 Conaire the Gaelic author, William Joyce, more widely known as Lord Haw-Haw the Nazi propagandist, Augusta, Lady Gregory, co-founder of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin and Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin, a senior member of one the Tribes of Galway and former world president of the International Olympic Committee. A memorial to the 91 people who died on 14 August 1959 when Dutch aeroplane KLM Flight 607-E crashed into the sea 180 km (112 mi) west of Galway can be seen just inside the main gates. Several bodies of the passengers are buried around the memorial.\nThere are several smaller cemeteries within the city boundaries. Some are no longer in use or are used primarily by families with ancient burial rights. These are St James's Cemetery (Teampall) in Glenina Heights, Menlo Cemetery near Menlo Castle, Ballybrit Graveyard near the entrance to Galway Racecourse, and a very ancient early Christian graveyard at Roscam near Merlin Park. Several city churches have graveyards attached which were formerly used for the interment of clergy and parishioners \u2013 Castlegar Church, Claddagh Church', St Patrick's Church on Forster Street and St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church. Several bishops are buried in the crypt below the RC Cathedral but this not usually open to the public.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nInformation from the 2016 census shows Galway City has a population of 79,934, an increase of almost 4,000 over the 2011 census figures.If the current growth rate continues, the population of the city will hit 100,000 by 2020. Galway City is the fourth largest in the Republic of Ireland, and sixth on the island of Ireland.\nAs of 2009, approximately 80% of the population of Galway were Irish. Following an influx of immigrants to Galway during the 2000s, approximately 20% of the population is non-Irish. Slightly more than half of this group (11.3%) are white Europeans, coming from Poland and other Central European and Baltic States, such as Latvia and Lithuania. Smaller numbers of Asian and African immigrants come from East Africa, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka. In the 2006 Census, 15.4% of the population were aged 0\u201314, 76.1% were aged 15\u201364, and 8.5% were aged over 65. 51.9% of the population were female and 48.1% were male.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nWith a population of 79,934, Galway is the fourth most populous urban area in the State and the 23rd most populous area of local government. Services such as waste collection, recycling, traffic control, parks and housing are controlled by a fifteen-member city council elected to five-year terms by proportional representation through means of the single transferable vote. The City Council is chaired by a mayor who is elected to a one-year term by fellow councillors. The role of mayor is mainly ceremonial, although they do have the casting vote. The first mayor was Peirce Lynch Fitzjohn, elected in 1485. The current mayor, Cllr. Mike Cubbard, was elected in June 2019.The symbols of the office of the Mayor and the emblems of the dignity of the City Council are the Civic Sword (1620s) and the Great Mace (1710) which are carried in procession before the Mayor and Council on solemn civic occasions. When not in ceremonial use they can be seen at the Galway City Museum. In 1579, Queen Elizabeth I confirmed the city's charter and appointed the Mayor as 'Admiral of the Bay and of the Aran islands'. The title, though extant, is rarely used except for purely ceremonial purposes.Galway City is part of the Galway West constituency of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.

The festival involves both professional and amateur musicians.Galway Cathedral Recitals is an international series of concerts of classical music which has taken place in Galway Cathedral each July and August since 1994.A number of notable choirs are based in the city.  They include Tribal Chamber Choir (founded in 2009) directed by Mark Keane; the Galway Baroque Singers (founded in 1983) directed by Audrey Corbett; Cois Cladaigh Chamber Choir (founded in 1982) directed by Brendan O'Connor, which sang at the inauguration of President Michael D. Higgins in St Patrick's Hall, Dublin Castle, on 11 November 2011; Galway Gospel Choir (founded in 2001) directed By Michel Durham Brandt; and Galway Choral Association (founded in 1998) directed by Norman Duffy. Galway Cathedral is home to Galway Cathedral Choir (founded in 1965), which sings every Sunday and at all the major ceremonies in the cathedral. In addition to its parish choir the Collegiate Church of St Nicholas is home to two other choral groups, the Choral Scholars (adult) and the Schola Cantorum (juvenile).\nThe Galway Arts Festival (F\u00e9ile Eala\u00edon na Gaillimhe) takes place in July. It was first held in 1978 and since then has grown into one of the biggest arts festivals in Ireland. It attracts international artists as well as providing a platform for local and national performers. The festival features parades, street performances and plays, musical concerts and comedy acts. Highlights of the festival tend to be performances by Macnas and Druid Theatre Company, two local performance groups.\nThe Galway Youth Orchestra was formed in 1982.\nThe renowned folk and traditional singer Dolores Keane lives in Galway.\n\n\n==== Traditional Irish music ====\n\nGalway city is a major centre for traditional Irish music. The traditional group De Dannan were based in Galway. Musicians such as Mickey Finn, Frankie Gavin, Johnny (Ringo) McDonagh, Alec Finn, M\u00e1irt\u00edn O'Connor and Gerry Hanley were born or came to prominence in Galway. Carl Hession, an Irish composer, arranger and traditional musician, also hails from Galway city.\nComhaltas branches operate in several parts of the city, teaching Irish traditional music to children. Dusty Banjos runs classes and sessions in the city for adults switching from other musical traditions to Irish traditional music, and for adult beginners and improvers who are not at a level where they could participate in general sessions.\n\n\n==== Live music venues ====\nTraditional and contemporary music can be heard at numerous locations around the city. Among the more notable are The Crane Bar on Sea Road, Tigh Neacht\u00e1in Quay Street and R\u00f3is\u00edn Dubh on Lr Dominic Street.\n\n\n==== Pop music ====\nThe girls from Galway have inspired many artists, most notable are Steve Earle (Galway Girl (2000)) and Ed Sheeran (Galway Girl (2017)).\n\n\n=== Irish language ===\nGalway City has a reputation among Irish cities for being associated with the Irish language, music, song and dancing traditions. It is sometimes referred to as the 'Bilingual Capital of Ireland', although like elsewhere in the Republic of Ireland, inhabitants converse mostly in English. The city is well known for its \"Irishness\", mainly because it has on its doorstep the Galway Gaeltacht. Irish theatre, television and radio production and Irish music form a component of Galway city life, with both An Taibhdhearc, the National Irish Language Theatre, in Galway city itself, while TG4 and RT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na Gaeltachta headquarters are in the Connemara Gaeltacht elsewhere in County Galway. Four electoral divisions, or neighbourhoods (out of twenty-two), are designated as Gaeltachta\u00ed. NUI Galway also holds the archive of spoken material for the Celtic languages.\n\n\n=== Events and festivals ===\n\nMany sporting, music, arts and other events take place in the city. The largest of these annual events begins with the Galway Film Fleadh and the Galway Arts Festival in July, the Galway Races in August, and the Galway International Oyster Festival in September. Other events include the Fleadh Imboilg, the Babor\u00f3 International Children's Festival, the C\u00fairt International Festival of Literature, the Galway Early Music Festival, Seachtain na Gaeilge (March), Salthill Air Show (June), the Colours Fringe Festival, Little Havana Festival, the Galway Sessions, Galway Garden Festival, Galway Comedy Festival, Baffle Poetry Festival, Galway Aboo Halloween Festival, Tulca Festival of Visual Arts, Irish Fly Fair and Angling Show, Galway Science and Technology Festival, Spirit of Voice Festival, Galway Christmas Market, Galway African Film Festival and Galway Pride Festival.\nIn June 2010, the Super8 Shots film festival was launched in Galway, the first Super 8 mm (0.31 in) film festival to occur in Ireland.In 2019, Galway is due to host a session of European Youth Parliament.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe patron saint of the city since the 14th century has been St Nicholas of Myra. The Roman Catholic diocese of Galway was created in 1831 following the abolition by the Holy See of the Wardenship of Galway. It was united with the diocese of Kilmacduagh (est. 1152) and given the administratorship of the diocese of Kilfenora (est. 1152) in 1883. Its full name is the Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Apostolic Administratorship of Kilfenora (in Irish \u2013 Deoise na Gaillimhe, Chill Mac Duach agus Riarach\u00e1n Aspalda Cill Fhionn\u00farach, in Latin \u2013 Diocesis Galviensis, Duacensis ac Administratio Apostolica Finaborensis). The diocese is under the patronage Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas (Galway), Saint Fachanan (Kilmacduagh) and St Colman (Kilfenora). As the diocese of Kilfenora is in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Cashel the Bishop of Galway is its Apostolic Administrator rather than its bishop. The dioceses of Galway and Kilmacduagh are in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Tuam. The current bishop is Most Rev. Martin Drennan, installed 3 July 2005. Of the 38 parishes in the RC diocese 14 are situated in the city and are divided into two deaneries \u2013 the deanery of Galway City West and that of Galway City East. In each deanery a Vicar Forane exercises limited jurisdiction on behalf of the bishop.\nIn the Church of Ireland, Galway is a parish of the United Diocese of Tuam, Killala and Achonry. The principal church of the parish is the St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church (founded 1320). Russian, Romanian, Coptic, and Mar Thoma Syrian Orthodox Churches use the facilities of St Nicholas Collegiate Church for their services. The Ahmadiyya-run Galway Mosque, opened in 2014, is the only purpose-built mosque in Galway.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nGalway has a diverse sporting heritage, with a history in sports ranging from horse racing, Gaelic games, soccer and rugby to rowing, basketball, motorsport, greyhound racing and others. The Galway Races are known worldwide and are the highlight of the Irish horse racing calendar. Over the years it has grown into an annual festival lasting seven days.\n\n\n==== Gaelic games ====\n\nBoth hurling and football are strong in Galway city. Pearse Stadium in Salthill is the home to Galway GAA, the county's Gaelic games body. The Galway hurlers compete annually in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship for the Liam MacCarthy Cup.  Despite having won the cup only five times in their history, Galway is considered as one of the top teams in the Championship. Galway reached the 2012 All-Ireland final only to draw with Kilkenny to force a replay, the first since 1959, which they eventually lost. In 2017 Galway lifted the Liam MacCarthy Cup for the first time in 29 years beating Waterford by 0-26 to 2-17. The footballers compete annually in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship for the Sam Maguire Cup. The Gaelic footballers have won the cup nine times with the most recent being in 2001.\n\n\n==== Association football ====\n\nGalway United FC is based in the city and plays in the League of Ireland Premier Division. The team plays its home games at Eamonn Deacy Park. The club was formed in 2013 and first competed in the 2014 season.\nThe previous tenants of Eamonn Deacy Park, also called Galway United, first competed in the League of Ireland since 1977, then known as Galway Rovers. Michael D. Higgins, later elected President of Ireland in 2011, served as a president of the club in a ceremonial capacity. Following struggles with debts, the club became defunct at the end of the 2011 season. The Galway United Supporters Trust (GUST) had been servicing many debts of the company and were able to keep the club afloat for the 2011 season, with it having been effectively abandoned by its directors. GUST withdrew their support for the team and applied to join the 2012 League of Ireland as a community enterprise, rather than as a private company, which the old club had been. This application was not successful, however.\nGalway F.C. was formed the following year from a merger of GUST with Mervue United and Salthill Devon, two other clubs in the city, who had competed in the First Division since 2009 and 2010 respectively.\n\n\n==== Rugby ====\n\n\n===== Professional =====\nThe professional team for the province, Connacht Rugby, is based in the city. The team play their home matches at the Galway Sportsgrounds which is the current provincial Rugby Stadium.\nThe team participate in the Pro14 League competition, and in season 2015\u20132016 won their first ever Championship by defeating reigning Champions Glasgow Warriors in the Semi-final and then beating four times champions Leinster Rugby in the Grand Final on 28 May 2016 played at Murrayfield Stadium.The team participated in European Rugby Champions Cup 2016/2017.\n\n\n===== Club (amateur) =====\nThere are two senior amateur rugby union teams in Galway, Galwegians RFC and Galway Corinthians RFC, who play in the All-Ireland League. There are also two junior clubs, OLBC RFC & NUIG RFC who both participate in the Connacht Junior League.\n\"Barna Knocknacarra Rugby Club\" (or Na Bairneacha\u00ed), established in 2007, offers \"mini rugby\" for children at levels U8 to U12.\n\n\n==== Swimming ====\nNearby Salthill has a 25m competitive swimming pool in the Leisureland complex and three competitive swimming clubs (i) Shark Swimming Club, (ii) Laser Swimming Club and (iii) Galway Swimming Club train there. There is also a handball and racketball club while there are several martial arts clubs throughout the city. There is a 25m pool at NUI, Galway as well as one at Renmore's KingFisher Club.\n\n\n==== Sailing and rowing ====\nSailing is common and rowing on the River Corrib is undertaken by seven rowing clubs. These provide related facilities and organise rowing competitions. These clubs include: Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol Rowing Club, Tribesmen Rowing Club, Galway Rowing Club, Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id ('The Jes') Rowing Club, St. Joseph's Patrician College ('The Bish') Rowing Club, NUIG Boat Club and Cumann R\u00e1mhaiochta Chol\u00e1iste na Coiribe.\nIn 2009 Galway hosted a stopover on the Volvo Ocean Race and the city was finishing point of the round-the-world competition in July 2012.\n\n\n==== Greyhound racing ====\nNear the city centre, on College Road, the Sportsground has greyhound races every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night. It was refurbished by the Irish Greyhound Board, Bord na gCon, and the facility is shared with the Connacht rugby team.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\nGalway City is the capital of Connacht. The city has experienced very rapid growth in recent years. Galway has a strong local economy with complementary business sectors, including manufacturing industry, tourism, retail and distribution, education, healthcare and services that include financial, construction, cultural, and professional.\nMost (47%) of the people employed in Galway work in either the commerce or professional sector, with a large number (17%) also employed in manufacturing. Most industry and manufacturing in Galway, like the rest of Ireland, is hi-tech (e.g. ICT, medical equipment, electronics, chemicals, etc.), due to the Celtic Tiger economic boom. Companies such as Boston Scientific, Medtronic, EA Games, Cisco and SAP AG have their regional offices or other offices in Galway City and environs. Tourism is also of major importance to the city, which had over 2.1 million visitors in 2000, and produced revenue of over \u20ac400 million.The head office of Smyths, a toy shop company, is in Galway.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\n\n==== Radio ====\nThere are two radio stations based in the city \u2013 Galway Bay FM (95.8 FM) broadcasts from the city to the whole county; Flirt FM (101.3 FM) is the student radio station for NUI Galway.\n\n\n==== Print ====\nOne of the main regional newspapers for the county is The Connacht Tribune which prints two titles every week, the Connacht Tribune on Thursday, and the Galway City Tribune on Friday. As of January 2007, The Tribune has a weekly readership of over 150,000. Another Galway-based newspaper is the Galway Advertiser, a free paper printed every Thursday with an average of 160 pages and a circulation of 70,000 copies. It is the main paper of the Advertiser Newspaper Group which distributes 200,000 newspapers per and more week to a variety of other Irish cities and towns.\n\n\n==== Online ====\nBeing a city of culture, Galway has a dedicated hub for all cultural events and organisations. Galway Hub is a free resource for both practitioners and the general public in which to engage with the arts and cultural events across the city and county.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Air ====\nGalway Airport, located 6 km (3.73 mi) east of the city at Carnmore, ceased to have scheduled passenger flights on 1 November 2011.  Because the runway is too short to take modern passenger jet aircraft, it it only capable of imited operations. Aerfort na Minna (22 km (13.67 mi) west of the city) operates regular flights to each of the Aran Islands (Oile\u00e1in \u00c1rann). Shannon Airport (90 km) and Ireland West Airport Knock (86 km) are the nearest international airports, both of which have flights around Ireland and to Britain, Continental Europe and North America (from Shannon).\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nBuses are the main form of public transport in the city and county. Routes operated by Bus \u00c9ireann include routes 401 (Salthill/Parkmore), 402 (Seacrest/Merlin Park), 404 (Newcastle/Oranmore), 405 (Rahoon/Ballybane), 407 (B\u00f3thar an Ch\u00f3iste) and 409 (Parkmore Industrial). Routes operated by City Direct include routes 410 (Salthill), 411 (Knocknacarra - Cappagh Rd), 412 (Knocknacarra Express), and 414 (Barna).Various bus companies also provide links throughout County Galway and nationwide.  These operate from a number of locations:\n\nThe main bus and rail station in the city is Ceannt Station.\nGalway Coach Station, located at Fairgreen, is also a coach transport hub. Scheduled direct and commuter services operate between the Coach Station, Dublin and Dublin Airport, as well as services to Limerick, Cork and Clifden. These are operated by Gobus and Citylink.\nOther regional bus operators use various bus stops around the city centre, and many serve the NUIG and GMIT campuses as well.\n\n\n==== Rail ====\n\nGalway's main railway station is Ceannt Station (St\u00e1isi\u00fan Cheannt), which opened in 1851, and was renamed in honour of \u00c9amonn Ceannt in 1966. A major redevelopment, including a completely new urban district, Ceannt Station Quarter, has been proposed for the station and adjoining land.\nThe Midland Great Western Railway reached Galway in 1851, giving the city a direct main line to its Broadstone Station terminus in Dublin. As the 19th century progressed the rail network in Connacht was expanded, making Galway an important railhead. The nearby town of Athenry became a railway junction, giving Galway links to Ennis, Limerick and the south in 1869 and Sligo and the north in 1894. In 1895 the MGW opened a branch line between Galway and Clifden.\nThe 20th century brought increasing road competition, and this led the Great Southern Railways to close the Clifden branch in 1935. In the 1970s the state railway authority C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann closed the Sligo-Athenry-Ennis line to passenger services. It later closed to freight as well.\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann, Ireland's national rail operator, currently runs six return passenger services each day between Galway and Dublin Heuston, also serving intermediate stations. Travel time is just under 3 hours. Services on the Galway\u2013Limerick line have now resumed, with around 5\u20136 trains each way per day.\nFrom Galway railway services along the Western Rail Corridor link the city with Ennis, and Limerick where trains run to Cork via Limerick Junction (for Tipperary, Clonmel and Waterford) and Mallow (for Killarney and Tralee).\n\n\n==== Road ====\nFour national primary roads serve the city: the M6 motorway running east\u2013west (Athlone, Dublin), the M17 motorway running north from the M6 to Tuam, the N63, formerly the N17, connecting Galway with the Northwest (Tuam, Sligo, Donegal Town, Letterkenny and Derry), and the M18 motorway linking Galway to southern towns and cities Gort, Ennis, Shannon Town, Limerick and Cork joining up with The Wild Atlantic Way. In addition, there are plans for a semi-ring road of the city, the Galway City Outer Bypass. There is also an Inner City Ring (Cuar Inmhe\u00e1nach) route that encircles the city centre, most of which is pedestrianised.\nGalway is considered the gateway to Connemara and the Gaeltacht, including M\u00e1m, An Teach D\u00f3ite, Cor na M\u00f3na, Ros Muc, Bearna and An Cheathr\u00fa Rua. The N59 along the western shore of Lough Corrib and the R337 along the northern shore of Galway Bay both lead to this largely rural and highly scenic region.\n\n\n==== Waterways ====\nThe River Corrib is by far the most important waterway in Galway and a number of canals and channels were built above and through the city. The purposes of these to divert and control the water from the river, to harness its power and to provide a navigable route to the sea.  Of these, there were two major schemes \u2013 one between 1848 and 1858 and the other during the 1950s. The canals provided a power source for Galway and were the location of the first industries in the mid-19th century. The Eglinton Canal provided a navigation from the sea (at the Claddagh Basin) to the navigable part of the river (above the Salmon Weir Bridge). Most of the mills are still used today for various purposes; for instance, NUI Galway still uses a water turbine for electricity generation for their building on Nun's Island.\nCurrently, there are four bridges across the Corrib. Following the southward flow of the river these are, from the north: the Quincentennial Bridge, the Salmon Weir Bridge, the William O'Brien Bridge and the Wolfe Tone Bridge. There are plans for a fifth bridge as part of the Galway City Outer Bypass project. The Clare River flows from the North of the County Galway, through Tuam, Claregalway into Lough Corrib.\n\n\n==== Harbour ====\n\nGalway is the most central port on the West Coast of Ireland in the sheltered eastern corner of Galway Bay. The harbour can be used by vessels up to 10,000 tonnes deadweight (DWT) and the inner dock can accommodate up to 9 vessels at any one time. Pending approval, Galway Harbour may see major changes, should the \u20ac1.5 billion development plan go ahead.\nRegular passenger ferry and freight services operate between Galway and the tourist destination of the Aran Islands which is home to World Heritage Site D\u00fan Aonghasa. The islands also have regular links with the towns of Rossaveal and Doolin, which are physically closer but far smaller.\nCommuter ferry services have been proposed to the tourism town of Kinvara, on the opposite side of Galway Bay.Major work in the harbour area was carried out in 2009 to accommodate the stopover of the Volvo Ocean Race. This was one of the biggest events ever to visit Galway. The event returned with the finale of the race in June 2012. This was unprecedented in Volvo Ocean Race history.\n\n\n==== Walking ====\nThe city is planned as the start of the E2 European long-distance path, running for 4,850 kilometres (3,010 mi) to Nice, though the Irish section is as yet incomplete.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nGalway Textile Printers, located on Sandy Road, was the first major industry to come to Galway and quickly became one of the biggest employers in the west of Ireland. Some of those who worked there were specialists who were brought in to help set the factory up, but most employees were local. The Mills eventually went out of business in the early 1980s and its former site now hosts various small business establishments.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAs of 2002, there were 27 primary schools and 11 secondary schools in Galway.\n\n\n=== University ===\nNUI Galway was founded in 1845 as Queen's College, Galway, and was more recently known as University College, Galway (U.C.G.). It is divided into several colleges including the College of Arts, Social Science and Celtic Studies, the College Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences,  the College of Business, Public Policy and Law, the College of Science and the College of Engineering and Informatics. The university had an enrollment of 16000 in 2010.\nThe Biomedical Research Building was opened in 2014. It houses the Regenerative Medicine Institute (REMEDI). Also opened in 2014 were the Hardiman Building and a School of Psychology. The Hardiman Building is home to the university's collection of more than 350 literary, theatrical, political and historical archives. The building houses also the Moore Institute for Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences and the Whitaker Institute for Innovation and Societal Change. The National Institute for Prevention and Cardiovascular Health (NIPC) is an affiliate of NUI Galway.The offices of the Central Applications Office (C.A.O.) are also located in the city, this being the clearing house for undergraduate college and university applications in the Republic of Ireland; a related organisation, the Postgraduate Applications Centre, processes some taught postgraduate courses.\n\n\n=== Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) ===\n\nGMIT, in addition to having two campuses in Galway City, also has campuses in Castlebar, Letterfrack and Mountbellew. GMIT's Galway campus is based on the Dublin Road in Galway city, overlooking Galway Bay. It is the administrative headquarters for the Institute and has four Schools of study; the School of Business, the School of Engineering, the School of Science & Computing, and the College of Tourism & Arts.\n\n\n== Health ==\nPublicly funded health care and social services are provided in Galway by the HSE (West) division of the Health Services Executive.\nThe main city hospital, University Hospital Galway, is located on two campuses \u2014 Galway University Hospital and Merlin Park University Hospital.Two private hospitals \u2013 The Galway Clinic and the Bon Secours Hospital, Galway \u2013 also operate in the city.\nGalway Hospice provides palliative care for the people of Galway City and County on a homecare, inpatient and daycare basis.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of twin towns and sister cities in the Republic of Ireland\nThe Galway Line\nTerryland Forest Park\nGalway Technology Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Galway travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGalway City Council (local authority)\nGalway City and County Cultural Website",

          "Once visited by Christopher Columbus and used as stables for Oliver Cromwells army the church has a lot of history! A lot of memorials to the Connacht rangers and to the men and women who died in WW1. If your have an interest in military history then visit.",
          "An amazing church. You have to walk through the church and spot all the amazing historic sites within - the baptismal font (with the tiny carving of a dog, to watch over the babies who are baptized), the Celtic Cross. The sanctuary is beautiful. If you are lucky, you might",
          "We were on our way to St. Nicholas when the skies opened up so we ended up staying longer than planned. And we are glad we did. This is a very lovely old chapel, with some very thoughtful commemorations, especially to WWI soldiers and to victims of the potato famine.",
          "Lovely to visit...love old churches and buildings. Lovely to see the war memorial inside the church. Amazing stained windows",
          "Follow the changes in Christianity in Ireland when you tour this still active parish church built in the 1200s. Rumor is that Christopher Columbus attended Mass in this building. A marvelous sign of changing attitudes is that this Anglican church now leases space to an Eastern",

          "We went to a Sunday service sung by the choir after their summer break. Music was outstanding. Well worth a visit and be aware that they do not allow sightseeing during church.",
          "I grew up in Galway, but I was raised as a Catholic, and only went to St. Nicholas' Church for Christmas hymns, if at all. It is an impressively old, pretty church. Although they could do even more to make it a tourist destination, it is worth a visit.",

          "Always refreshing to see these old churches. This one dates back to about the 1400 hundreds. Stopped in here as part of our land tour of Ireland. Worth a quick look if you're in town.",

          "There is a music show in St. Nicholas most nights from 7-8:30. It also includes a tour of the church. It's a nice venue for an intimate trad music experience and is much calmer and less crowded than going to a bar to hear music. The show was lovely. There were three",

          "A wonderful little church with a real sense of history. The crusader tomb and the angel defaced by Cromwell's troops are particularly worth finding. It doesn't take long to walk around but it is definitely worth the short diversion.",

          "This is an old Medieval church that has a spectacular stain glass window. It also happens to be where Christopher Columbus came to worship before he set sail for the Americas. If you are in the area it's worth stopping by for a few minutes.",

          "Fantastic historical church in the heart of Galway. Regret not having a guide although purchased an interesting booklet about it.",
          "What do you need to hear other than about the history steeped here since 1220? If you like to learn about historic buildings, and in particular churches, this is the place for you! Built by the Normans, nearly destroyed by Cromwell, visited by Christopher Columbus! Recommend?",
          "This is a gorgeous medieval church and the oldest active one in Ireland dating from the Norman era and finally completed by 1320 although dating back to the 1200s. It is where Columbus worshipped in in the 1400s before setting sail to discover America and is where Cromwell",
          "Located in the city and founded by the Normans in the 1200s, although there is some doubt as to when it was built, but it was completed by1320. It is the largest medieval parish church in Ireland in continuous use. There is an Australian connection with Robert O'Hara Burke",

          "This church was founded in 1320. To get some perspective, in 1477 Christopher Columbus worshiped here! Amazing history and beautiful church.",

          "One of the oldest Irish Galway churches, built in 16. Beautiful arcitecture, statues and windows. Still being used today.",
          "Stop by for a quiet moment whilst you're wandering Gallway. It's free to go in but they request donations. Not only is it cool to see a 700+ year old building still in day-to-day operation, you'll get a look at the tomb of real-life Jane Eyre, who supposedly was the",

          "We took a tour in conjunction with the Tunes in Church trad music concert (5 stars- do it) . Tour was between sets and lasted 10 minutes. Learned about the history of the church as Catholc, then switching to Protestant and having horses stabled in it by Cromwell, whose army",

          "It was a very interesting experience exploring this Medieval church in the heart of Galway. We enjoyed the artistry of the architecture and the decor. I found the memorial to World War One dead moving. This is a historic treasure right in the middle of all the tourist activity",
          "Viewed the church Saturday morning while also strolling around the Galway Market. Worth a walk thru - helps to connect the history of Ireland.",
          "Beautiful church which is steeped in history. Still functional with beautiful service welcoming to all. There are also frequently concerts there and the acoustics are wonderful. The Carols around the Christmas tree service on Christmas Eve is one not to be missed.",

          "Very interesting visit, the history here as in most churches in Ireland goes back hundreds of years. Reading some of the inscriptions is humbling.",
          "wonderful way to experience the beautiful and perfect acoustics of this old historical church and enjoy the traditional sounds of the Irish musician. They are right up close and then also there is an interesting tour of the church in the intermission.",
          "Expected to see a small, quiet medieval church - but found camera, lights, action! Gather they were setting up to record this evenings live music, which we were told included 3 fellows from India. Wish we had had the time to stay and listen Note: seating capacity seemed",
          "This was one of our favorite sights in Galway. Its not a big extravagant church, but it is stunning in its own way. And Christopher Columbus prayed here on his way to discovering the Americas!",
          "My mother, brother and I were drawn to visit this church primarily because of the name \u2013 my brother is a Nicholas. However, upon entering this impressive medieval building we were amazed by its beauty. We were welcomed by Richard who shared his extensive knowledge of the church",
          "Beautiful 14th century church. Go on Sundays between 12-6 when the famous Galway Sunday Market is open and enjoy both the sacred and profane",
          "The Irish marble of red, greens & amber are really beautiful in this church. Take your time to really walk around and view all the areas of this church. Photos are allowed inside. We were on a tour and learned it was probably visited by Christopher Columbus in 1477. I would",
          "It's not always easy to fully appreciate traditional Irish music and dance in a noisy pub atmosphere, so getting the opportunity to experience it in the hallowed space of a church was quite a novelty. Not only were the accoustics just right, but so was the stage... It was on top",
          "This medieval parish church built in c.1320 is dedicated to St Nicholas of Myra(now in Turkey),better known as the patron saint of children or \"Santa Claus\". Christopher Columbus almost certainly worshipped here in 1477. A beautiful historic church",
          "We had a great Sunday morning service here. Everyone was so welcoming and even invited our daughters to Sunday School which was a big highlight of our trip. The music was lovely and the Church was beautiful. Sad we can\u2019t go again before we leave!",
          "we didn't go in but checked out the outside of the church. on sundays there is an open market on church lane with artists selling their beautiful artwork and lots of food vendors ranging from coffee, crepes, sushi, baked goods, sausages, curries, and vietnamese bun. We had a",

          "This is a very interesting church near the Latin quarter, some evenings they have an Irish music and tap dancing concert-well worth seeing",
          "This church building, originally Catholic, then Anglican, and now being restored by the Anglican community carries quite a story. And the volunteers tell it well. The smashed statuary is a testimony to the hard times that Catholics experienced. There was a warmth and presence",
          "My wife loves these types of side-stops, and this is so convenient to the shopping, pubs, and restaurants. Lots of history.",
          "It\u2019s a must see because it\u2019s history goes back to the 1200s. Some lovely stained glass. Offers regular concerts that are donations only. Was sorry to have missed that as acoustics seemed excellent.",
          "St. Nicholas is over 700 years old with a convenient location when walking in Galway . This is excellent to visit with lots of history and the architecture and stained glass excellent to see. Admission is free but donations help with keeping the building up.This is well worth",
          "This church is in a convenient location, so it allows for a quick easy visit. Its claim to fame, apparently, is that Columbus may have worshipped there. Hmm. Inside it's not that impressive. A plus is that it often offers concerts for a small charge, if you visit at the",
          "Beautiful old church, walked up Market Street on Saturday and the stalls were really busy but we managed to squeeze through all the people to get to the church. The difference between the noise and bustle from outside to the calm serenity of the church was unreal. Inside it has",
          "We found this church and learned so much history like Christopher Columbus attending here at one time. It is a great place to visit and the guides there give great information",
          "Older church in Galway just 100 feet off Quay Street. We were lucky enough to be there on a day when a college choral group was performing in this church - amazing accoustics in such an old building. Lots of interesting glass and sculpturing.",
          "The stained glass windows were exquisite. There is one behind the nave i n an area that appears to be used as a chapel.",
          "though much smaller than the Galway Cathedral, this church has much more history and significant artifacts. I really enjoyed walking through the church and looking at the historical items.",
          "This is a really cool small church that is worth a quick visit. It's right in the down town area so you can't miss it. If you have a few minutes to spare, I'd definitely recommend popping in.",
          "Worth visiting if in town. I would not travel a distance just to see. I would recommend follow around with the maps available inside.",
          "Was visiting pedestrian mall and saw church off side street. Nice place to step into for history and look. Would not go out of way to visit but nice if in area",
          "Lovely little church with a lot of history attached to it. Easy to find in the heart of the city centre.",
          "Galway is a lovely port city brimming with history, and this church is in the heart of the city. It is easy to find, free and beautiful. It is rumored that Columbus prayed here before sailing to North America. A beautiful place to see amidst the rest of Galway.",
          "While this is a smaller church it was a neat piece of history to see. An extra bonus was they had an organ player today which was a great treat!!",
          "When it comes down to it, it\u2019s a church. It was worth the visit and right in the heart of everything else you\u2019d want to do. It\u2019s free. There\u2019s no reason not to stop in, but don\u2019t lose any sleep if you miss it.",
          "This is a very historic building and is a \"must see \" for anyone visiting Galway. Christopher Columbus stopped here on his journey to new world. So be sure to visit this Church.",
          "The church is located in the heart of old Galway city center area. It is easy to walk to and was worth seeing. It is a busy area on the weekends and within easy walking distance of all of the major sights of the city center.",
          "Historic building, with detailed and interesting information leaflets provided in many languages. Welcoming atmosphere",
          "This Church was built circa 1320 and is Ireland's largest medieval parish church, which is still in use. St. Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors (seafaring has long been associated with this church). it is the Church where Christopher Columbas worshipped in 1477. Well worth",
          "Aside from a quiet place to center oneself, to be still and to BE, the church has a very rich partrimony. One of the most surpising elements was to see a Iconostase. The Episcopalian church also welcomes the Romanian and Russian Orthodox communities of Galway.",
          "Nice church on the outside, nothing special on the inside. Go to the Cathedral instead; beautifully decorated!!",
          "This beautiful 14th century Anglican church is right in the heart of Galway and worth stopping in to see, especially if you're there on a Saturday and plan to attend the Galway Market. The Market takes place along side the church.",
          "On a recent visit to Galway we took a walk through 700 year old St. Nicholas\u2019 Church. It was a moving and powerful experience. You are transported back to the 12th century by simply walking by the stone pillars of the ancient church. An experience not to be missed!",
          "Like many parish churches in Ireland, this one is rather plain on the inside but has loads of local history, including occupation by Cromwell's troops. I doubt that the Jane Eyre buried here was the one in the famous book, which was set in England. Worth a look.",
          "There is a convenient helpful brochure outlining a self-guided tour. Plenty to see. There is talk that Christopher Columbus prayed here before venturing off to \u2018discover North America\u2019. The church enjoys a happy juxtaposition of old history and current use. It is a living",
          "This Medieval church dates back to 1320 and although it is 'Church of Ireland'- part of the worldwide Anglican communion - I was interested to read that they allow three other Orthodox denominations to hold services there. There is a large side chapel that I presumed they may",

          "I can normally find a lot to interest me in churches, cathedrals, abbeys, priories, etc., but there was really not a lot to recommend this one. There were a few interesting gravestones in the floor with the tools of trade of the person buried there, also some music practice",

      "name": "River Corrib",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The River Corrib (Irish: Abhainn na Gaillimhe) in the west of Ireland flows from Lough Corrib through Galway to Galway Bay. The river is among the shortest in Europe, with only a length of six kilometres from the lough to the Atlantic. It is popular with local whitewater kayakers as well as several rowing clubs and pleasure craft. The depth of this river reaches up to 94 feet.The Corrib drains a catchment area of 3,138 km2.Although the Corrib is one of Ireland's shortest rivers, it has a mean long-term flow rate of 104.8 m3/s, making it Ireland's second-largest river (by flow), only surpassed by the River Shannon.\n\n\n== Naming ==\nThe translation of the Irish name of the river is Galway river i.e. from Gaillimh. In Irish it is sometimes called An Ghaillimh (\"the Galway\") and also incorrectly called Abhainn na Coiribe. The legend concerning its naming states that it was called after Gaillimh inion Breasail, the daughter of a Fir Bolg chieftain who drowned in the river. The word Gaillimh is believed to mean \"stony\" as in \"stony river\". The commonly held myth that the city takes its name from the Irish word Gallaibh, \"foreigners\" i.e. \"the town of the foreigners\" (from Gall, a foreigner) is incorrect as the name Gaillimh was applied to the river first and then later onto the town. Indeed, the earliest settlement at Galway was called D\u00fan Bhun na Gaillimhe, or \"the fort at the end of the Galway (river)\".\n\nThe river gave its name to the town, which grew to a city, and from c. 1570 onwards, the city gave its name to the county. It also aided massively in the industrial development of the town, allowing it to develop electrical power before London. At the height of water power, there were over twenty water wheels in operation from races built on the river and its accompanying cut, the Eglinton Canal, which was built as part of the \"Drainage and Navigation scheme of Lough Carra, Lough Corrib and Lough Mask\" in the mid-19th century. The canal, which is about three-quarters of a mile long, had a sea-lock, a large basin, a second lock at Parkavore and five swivelling bridges. It is still in water but the swivelling bridges have been replaced by fixed bridges; the last vessel to use the navigation was the Amo II, a 90' motor-yacht that had been sold by the Guinness trustees to Frank Bailey, a Galway hotelier.Lough Corrib is the anglicised form of Loch Coirib which itself is a corruption of Loch nOrbsean which, according to placename lore, is named after the Irish god of the sea. There is good fishing to be had on both the lake and river.\nPtolemy's Geography (2nd century AD) described a river called \u0391\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1 (Ausoba) which probably referred to the River Corrib.\n\n\n=== Upper and Lower Corrib ===\n\nThe part of the river that flows from the southern end of the lake to the Salmon Weir is known as the Upper Corrib. The weir, a set of weir gates also built during the above navigation scheme, was originally built from stone and timber but now only two of these gates remain and are only opened in times of flood. The rest have been replaced by fourteen steel gates, as shown in the photograph above.\nThe main channel leaving Lough Corrib is called Friars' Cut or Friars' River (Irish: Abhainn na mBr\u00e1ithre) as it is the result of a very early piece of canal engineering. In 1178 the friars of Claregalway Abbey, being tired of the long detour they had to make to the west to enter the river, asked permission from the Blakes of Menloe to make an artificial cut, which in time became the main course of the river and was then widened.The section of the river that runs from the Salmon Weir through Galway city and out into Galway Bay is known as the Lower Corrib. Three bridges cross the Lower \u2013 the Salmon Weir Bridge, William O'Brien Bridge and Wolfe Tone Bridge.\nThe only tributary of the Lower Corrib is Sruth\u00e1n na gCaisle\u00e1in (Castle Stream) known by whitewater kayakers as the Shit Chute and the access point to the river, a small stream that flows through Newcastle, the grounds of NUI Galway, and empties into the Lower just downstream of King's weir, commonly known as the fish gates.\nThe official publication of NUI Galway, Cois Coiribe, is named in reference to the Corrib.\n\n\n== Bridges ==\n\nFour bridges span Corrib in Galway. These are the Wolfe Tone Bridge, the William O'Brien Bridge, the Salmon Weir Bridge, and the Quincentenary Bridge.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRivers of Ireland\nList of rivers in Ireland\nList of loughs in Ireland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLower Corrib River Guide\nCanoeing at O'Brien's Bridge, Galway\nSurfing O'Brien's Wave on the Lower Corrib from YouTube - No longer available 01Jul17\nJes Rowing on the Corrib\nSalmon fishing on the River Corrib (Galway Fishery), from Salmon Ireland\nThe Eglinton Canal",

          "Boat comfy and a decent bar but otherwise it's really overpriced and there's not much to see. Views of the uni? Views of reeds where people fish? Was very disappointed for \u20ac17.50 each and felt it was nothing more than a boat trip to a lake. Would suggest a Galway Tours coach",

          "Was hoping to see more than the river and lake. Lovely swans. Nice narration. Relaxing. My husband napped on the way back. We paid the OATS of 15 euro per person. A bit steep for what we got. The University and Cathedral are about all you see. Nice walk there along the river",
          "They charged \u20ac16 per person on boat - which included nothing (a drink would be nice)... The staff were grumpy. We didn't feel welcomed on board and that by itself ruined the journey. The tour guide speaks way too much. I rated 2 because we enjoyed the loch and the scenery.",

          "We got lucky with the weather and were able to sit up on the open deck for the trip. It's quite a relaxing way to spend 90 minutes. The captain doubles as the tour guide, and he's entertaining and informative in equal measure. There is an onboard bar that serves alcoholic",

          "My husband and I took this cruise thinking it would be a nice way to see the area around Galway. Most of scenery during the cruise is just trees and grass. Still, it might have been a nice cruise, if we hadn't been on the cruise with 2 LARGE tour groups. There was no room to",
          "This is something well worth doing in Galway, especially on a warm summer's day. The trip lasts about 90 minutes and goes into Lake Corrib . It is a must for nature lovers as the countryside is lovely and it is interesting to see Galway from another perspective. Bar and Irish",

          "We took the 2 hour trip with pretty low expectations. We were so wrong. The staff were very friendly and served great coffee. The scenery was beautiful and overall the trip was very relaxing. Make sure you see the quieter side of Galway.",

          "This was pretty boring. We passed some ruins, but that is about all. The way back was much more interesting. There was a Irish coffee demonstration and Irish dancing. I don't think I would spend the money on this",
          "It was a perfect weather day for a cruise. A taped history played as we floated down the river. Was given a demonstration on how to make an Irish coffee while cruising. You could purchase drinks and snacks.",

          "This is a well organised cruise, with plenty of information from the crew. It runs from Galway City into the mouth of Lough Corrib. Our trip include sandwiches and drinks on the way back. I have only marked it as average because I have been on far more scenic cruises.",

          "Nice little boat cruise--- good commentary on the river. Note this is not the Seine in Paris or anything, but the scenery was nice. The thing that was great was Roisin who showed how to make the perfect Irish Coffee (she should have done so at the beginning of the cruise-",
          "We went with a group and it was a relaxing time and the show (how to make Irish coffee and do Irish dancing) was great, but it could easily have been shortened in time. We went out and then turned around and there were not a lot of sights on the trip that you need to see twice",
          "Since the day was sunny I decided to take the Corrib Princess cruise. Get information on the way out to the lower lake and peaceful silence on the way back. Upper deck had full sun and a nice breeze. Good photo ops.",

          "We enjoyed the boat trip on a very sunny day. The first half of the tour was filled with the history of the buildings we passed. The way back you could really enjoy the sun and beautyful nature. Don't know if the trip would be as nice with bad weather.",

        "wiki": "Kylemore Abbey (Irish: Mainistir na Coille M\u00f3ire) is a Benedictine monastery founded in 1920 on the grounds of Kylemore Castle, in Connemara, County Galway, Ireland. The abbey was founded for Benedictine Nuns who fled Belgium in World War I.  The current Mother Abbess of the Benedictine Community is Marie Hickey.\n\n\n== History ==\nKylemore Castle was built in 1868 as a private home for the family of Mitchell Henry, a wealthy doctor from London whose family was involved in textile manufacturing in Manchester, England. He moved to Ireland when he and his wife Margaret purchased the land around the Abbey, after having travelled there on their honeymoon in the mid 1840s. He became a politician, becoming an MP for County Galway from 1871 to 1885. The castle was designed by James Franklin Fuller, aided by Ussher Roberts. The construction of the castle began in 1867, and took the total of one hundred men and four years to complete. The castle covered approximately 40,000 square feet (3,700 m2) and had over seventy rooms with a principal wall that was two to three feet thick. The facade measures 142 feet (43 m) in width and is made of granite brought from Dalkey by sea to Letterfrack, and of limestone brought from Ballinasloe. There were 33 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 4 sitting rooms, a ballroom, billiard room, library, study, school room, smoking room, gun room and various offices and domestic staff residences for the butler, cook, housekeeper and other servants. Other buildings include a Gothic church and family mausoleum containing the bodies of Margaret Henry, Mitchell Henry and a great grand-nephew.\nThe Abbey remained in Henry's estate after he returned to England. The castle was sold to the Duke and Duchess of Manchester in 1903, who resided there for several years before being forced to sell the house and grounds because of gambling debts. In 1920, the Irish Benedictine Nuns purchased the Abbey castle and lands after they were forced to flee Ypres during World War I. The nuns, who had been based in Ypres for several hundred years, had been bombed out of their Abbey during World War I. They were rescued by men of the 8th Battalion of the Royal Munster Fusiliers, a scene that was later reproduced in the Freeman's Journal. After they left Ypres they were evacuated to England where they remained until 1920. The nuns continued to offer education to Catholic girls, opening an international boarding school and establishing a day school for girls from the locality. The school acted as the main educator for most girls from Renvyle, Letterfrack and further afield for almost a century but it was forced to close in 2010. The nuns have since been developing new education and retreat activities. Since 2015, the Abbey has entered a partnership with the University of Notre Dame. The abbey hosts academic programs for Notre Dame students, and the university renovated spaces in the abbey.\n\nThe Estate includes large walled Victorian Gardens. Since the 1970s these have been open for public tours and 'nature' walks. The Benedictine community has restored the Abbey's gardens and church with donations and local artisans in order to be a self-sustaining estate.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of abbeys and priories in Ireland (County Galway)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKylemore Abbey & Victorian Walled Gardens, Connemara, County Galway, Ireland.\nKylemore Abbey, Connemara, Co.

          "Was beautiful as always but the lady at the ticket booth was so rude. We were merely at the entrance and wanted to glance around the corner and she sarcastically told us we can\u2019t go in as if we don\u2019t know how to read the sign just because we were asian.",
          "We enjoyed walking around Kylemore, through the grounds and around the castle. Between Kylemore and Ballynahinch - you have to visit at least one of them. We visited both and enjoyed both. The gardens are nice. The abbey is lakefront - so it offers beautiful photo ops.",
          "We really didn't expect much of this stop on our tour but when we arrived, wow. Its fairytale like, the setting is perfect and the story of the abbey is beautiful. Even the younger ones of the family enjoyed their time. When travelling to Ireland, make sure you choose a tour",
          "The place was stunning the views onto the lake amazing the mountains in the distance behind it. The abbey itself is lovely the history off it all the detail of it. We found the walk around lovely the small church really nice to see very therapeutic settings. There is a bus up",
          "Do your self a favour. Don't be turned off by the drive out to Kylemore. It's worth it and more. The place is enormous. The \"abbey\", in reality a 19th century manor house that became an abbey and then a convent school has a most interesting and chequered history that is very",
          "We've been to Kylemore several times. They've a new intro about the history of the house at the entrance. It's excellent and really adds to the experience much more so than in the past. The cafe is lovely. The gardens too",
          "My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our visit to Kylemore Abbey. It is 100% a must-see if you are in Galway - it really took our breath away. It was so interesting to learn about the colourful history of the Abbey, the exhibition was really well done and interactive. There was",
          "We were told by several people (locals and friends) that this is something that was not to be missed. Now we know why, even though we went on rainy misty day we still managed to spend hours here. We had originally planned to spend only hour but we hadn't realized there is so",
          "stunning abbey, only some rooms on ground floor open to public. visited on a damp winter day. but, still had a nice visit. gardens a bit dissapointing,as not much winter colours.however still enjoyed my visit. think would be best to visit summer months",
          "Kylemore Abbey in Connemara, Galway is a truly breathtaking site. The Castle was built in the 1800's as a private residence, but became a Benedictine Abbey in 1920 for the Nuns who fled Belgium in WWI. Unfortunately, you cannot tour the entire castle, but that should not deter",
          "One could easily pass an entire day touring the Abbey, the Gothic Church and the Victorian Walled Gardens. Lovingly maintained on spectacular Pollacappul Lake, the opportunities for photos are endless. The tour of the Abbey has a historical perspective and the rooms are",
          "Such a pity the rain was really down for the day when we visited. TOMMY's TAXI brought us safe and sound (lovely gentleman). SUSIE gave a wonderful history of the building and the newly renovated exhibition brings it all to life. Such a sad history. We only caught a glimpse of",
          "A beautiful serene setting with lovely gardens. The drive there is through beautiful countryside and well worth it. The cafe has lovely food. Plenty of free parking.",
          "We really appreciated our visit to Kylemore Abbey - and in particular the peaceful serenity of the place. It was so heartwarming to know the story of the owners and how their hearts were to give local peoples jobs and a fair go! Obviously the presence of the prayerful monks",
          "The main building itself only has certain portions of lower floor but it is authentically decorated and guides are knowledgeable. The grounds are exceptionally scenic and fun to explore. Enjoyed a little shopping and food there as well.",
          "The beauty of the Abbey is seen from afar. You can tour the abbey and learn its history, walk along the short path to the right and get to the monastery. In addition you can either take a short bus trip or walk 20 minutes to the left and get to the Victorian Walled Garden. Given",
          "Visited as part of a tour group. Sadly as we arrived there was a torrential downpour with hail . The abbey was lovely, beautiful rooms but probably extra busy due to the weather. Very similar to a National Trust visit . There was transportation to the gardens but seemed to have",
          "Kylemore Abbey is truly lovely to see and we were very happy we took the trek out there. The views driving between the mountains and the water was stunning and it was interesting to have to wait to move along when the sheep were crossing the road. Unfortunately for us it was",
          "This was such a cool way to see a modern castle. The grounds are a few miles long, but they do offer a bus between the entrance and the gardens (about a mile). They also offer a wheelchair service (either manual or electric) so it helped with the disabled member of our party to",
          "Had not been there for years took a walk visited the walled garden stunning take internal bus ate in Restaurant very good.",
          "Yes, you will feel this is in the middle of nowhere, but the views are stunning, gardens well appointed, and the elcairs in the cafe are worth it.",
          "We loved our visit to Kylemore, especially the family history and the beautiful little gothic church. I've taken one star off because there was virtually nothing about the life and works currently being done in a working Benedictine Abbey. I would have loved to know more about",
          "This was my first visit to Kylemore Abbey .Had often passed by but never been into castle or grounds before.It cost's 14 euro per person to enter thought it was a bit expensive .There is a little shuttle bus that brings you out to gardens or else you could walk which would take",
          "The visit to Kylemore Abbey was definitely one of the many highlights of our trip. As soon as the Abbey came into view from the road we were enchanted - despite the teeming rain ! There is a big lake right in front with the reflection of the Abbey in the waters; a tree cloaked",
          "Must say this place is a must to visit the abbey itself is fabulous the grounds are imaculate and the garden is brilliant also the shuttle bus is great as garden is a bit away",
          "This was the day we put 19,000 steps on our tracking devices! After touring the house and chapel and burial site, we headed in the other direction on the property and walked the long route to the Victorian Walled Garden. This is mid October and still the gardens were lovely. Be",
          "Amazing place located near the Connemara national park. The abbey, gothic Church and gardens are just awesome ! A Must visit !",
          "First took a short walk to the Gothic church aound the pond plus the Ironing stone nearby. Was impressed with the Abbey and the layout inside, with the family's history. On to the shuttle ride to the Walled Garden which didn't take too long because much of the vegetation was not",
          "Our hiking group spent an afternoon on this property. We had a guided tour of the Abbey and the Garden which was quite well done. The tour allows you to get up close and personal within the Abbey. This is a wonderful property to view with a nice gift shop, cafe and plenty of",
          "We only had time for a quick stop, and did not tour the castle. There was an extensive gift shop and cafe with lots of choices. If we had been traveling on our own we probably would have toured the castle.",
          "A highlight of our Irish visit, probably the highlight! We spent 4 hours exploring the various features of the Abbey and Gardens. It's history is most interesting and the environment peaceful and beautiful. The visit was enhanced by the picturesque drive down the Conemarra",
          "Terrific spot. Weather was beautiful. We walked to the Abbey, toured around inside, then down to the little church and mausoleum around the lake. We then took the bus to the Victorian Gardens which were stunning. Had lunch at Mitchell\u2019s cafe. This is an amazing site, wish I",
          "Our tour stopped and we were mesmerized by the beautiful grounds and of course the Abbey and the chapel. This is a must see for anyone in the area.",
          "We pulled into Kylemore Manor expecting just another Manor House and were looking more for somewhere to have late lunch after our visit to the Connemara National Park. First impression was - wow! The Manor house is set on the shores of the lake with surrounding forest and",
          "My favorite place so far. I came on a tour with lally tours from Galway and its the highlight of connemara tour. The Kylemore Abbey is a breathtaking Gothic castle and its garden is truly magnificent. I enjoyed every minute and I wish to comeback.",
          "An idyllic scene - so picturesque. The house with the lake in front makes a beautiful picture. The history of the place and the family - and now the nuns - all add to the magically history here. Gardens are beautiful.",
          "I was pleasantly surprised by Kylemore Abbey and walled gardens. Most tours don\u2019t offer the opportunity to spend much time here so I would definitely recommend choosing a tour that spends at least half a day. The Victorian Walled Gardens are stunning - even under a grey October",
          "The abbey itself was built in the Baronial style in 1868 by Michael Henry as a gift to his wife. Since 1920 it has been the home of a Benedictine community of nuns who still own and run it. Plenty to see in the Abbey itself, then you have the Victorian Walled Garden that you",
          "From the moment you set eyes on Kylemore you'll be amazed at it's beauty. Whether you can peruse the walled gardens or just drive by, it's definitely worth a look.",
          "We were part of a tour group and this was one of our stops. We arrived at a place that was almost like looking at a movie set. Kylemore Abby was on the right side of the bus as we approached and it was a sight that was amazing. A beautiful structure sitting on a huge lake!",
          "This was a beautiful property, the house had a few rooms to go through and the Gardens were nice but not exactly what I had expected. I feel it is just missing something. Makes for a great photo. Not handicap accessible in the house.",
          "The garden was the main attraction for me; the walled six acres were beautifully maintained and the plants were apparently those that would have been in situ during and prior to 1901. There was a gardener's cottage and glass houses. The day we visited in September, the birds",
          "It was a great experience. The landmark surrounded abbey is magnificent. Abbey itself is great. Lakes with dark brown water, hills, forest park, garden, church are worth to be there. Live music performances in the church, guided tour in the main building combined with friendly",
          "Kylemore Abbey is much more than just an abbey. The pleasant walk around the grounds on the shore of a lake yields a lot of the resident family's history. There is a smaller abbey and memorial, as well as extensive gardens. The grounds are kept up beautifully, and I enjoyed",
          "The building is pretty surrounded by beautiful greenery. But the best part is the walled garden. The incredible manicured garden and the symmetric kitchen gardens with vegetables and herbs is pure beauty. A nice stop along the scenic drives in the Connemara national park area.",
          "A lovely abbey, we visited years ago when it was a school, this time we were able to go inside. A lovely building and don't miss the church and mausoleum, a beautiful drive to get there and great cafe and gift shop.",
          "Kylemore Abbey is an impressive structure, with a fascinating history, but the Victorian Walled Garden was a \"Wow\"! I could have spent several hours here, especially as the Gardener was pleasantly receptive to brief questions and talk about plants - including ones they don't",
          "Found Kylemore Abby in a travelbook and decided to check it out. Was so glad we did. It was beautiful. We walked the grounds, checked out the Abby, the church and was blown away at the beauty. Was worth the trip! One of the highlights of out trip. Pictures do not do it",
          "I recently visit Kylemore Abbey and gardens with a group of friends. It is certainly worth a visit, the gardens are stunning. To be able to visit all of the grounds you need at least half a day. It has a very nice restaurant with outside seating, although it does get very",
          "Fourteen years ago I visited Kylemore Abbey in the pouring rain. This time we were blessed with glorious sunny weather and able to fully explore the gardens and grounds. The Abbey home is beautifully restored and shows what it was like for the families who lived there. But the",
          "This is was a highlight of our two weeks in Ireland! The setting is gorgeous and the history of the families who have lived here is so interesting, then to hear of it\u2019s transformation to a girls school under the Benedictine sisters was amazing. Truly a special spot on earth!",
          "If you are staying in Galway, drive along the coast and across the Connemara countryside to this wonderful abbey. It is beautiful inside and out, with lots of history and info on it's past. Nice walk to the gardens and to the gothic church. There is a cafe and gift shop too.",
          "This was one of our stops during our Globus Scenic Ireland Tour. The castle was acquired by the Benedictine nuns. The restored house, church and gardens are stunning. You will feel like royalty walking the grounds. Give yourself at least 2 hours to tour this beautiful place.",
          "We arrived at kylemore Abbey to show friends around the walled garden. We have been a few times and didn't want or need to see the Abbey again. I asked for tickets to just see the walled garden and was told this is not possible. It's \u20ac14 for a ticket to see it all, no tickets",
          "This is a place with so much history. Building has original furniture, with history of being a private family home and then becoming an elite private girls school. The garden is still maintained and you can stroll along the river to the LITTLE Cathedral.",
          "The story behind the construction of the castle is not a movie..... yet. Some budding screenwriter should get here and write the movie about this now Abbey. It is fascinating! 70 rooms of opulence but access only to the lower floor provide an insight into the life of the people",
          "Free parking, entry to the house and grounds not cheap at 14 euros each but it was a nice place to visit even on a rainy day. There are exhibitions and information boards in many rooms of the abbey, a few are furnished, we thought the best was the dinning room laid out for",
          "This Abbey and property is really beautiful! Built in the mid/late 1800\u2019s and transferred to royalty then the abbey nuns\u2014 used as a school and now a museum. Very nice! Hard to imagine how it could be built out there as remote as it was, and it was a major employer of local",
          "The setting is stunning, eerily beautiful . Great walks , an amazing walled garden. Mitchell Henry must have been a genius. The tourist facilities are great. A complete day is required to enjoy this jewel in the West.",
          "It was drizzling when we visited nevertheless, we still roamed around. The abbey looks really marvelous with the mountains as its backdrop with the lake. It is picture perfect! However, I was expecting that there are more rooms on display. Still worth a visit though. The chapel",
          "Our B&B hostesses in Doolin and Oughterard said we should see the Abbey, as did a couple staying in the Oughterard B&B. Once we got there, we understood why. The Abbey has a newly opened series of history exhibits as you come into the main hall. There is a history talk a",
          "First day of rain in Ireland during our stay but didn\u2019t stop us visiting. It just looks stunning when you get out of your car and look across the lake to the abbey. Good information in the abbey about timeline of events and what is planned for the future. The walled garden is a",
          "Four of us had a spectacular early drive up from Galway and spent the best part of the day at Kylemore Abbey. The house was fascinating, the gardens were both interesting and stunning. Make sure you visit the Head Gardeners house too. It\u2019s a perfect, tranquil setting. We also",
          "First of all, it's a stunning setting for the big rambling estate, and it's easy to see why Dr. Henry fell in love with the location and relocated his bride there. The house is mostly closed because the nuns still reside in and use much of it, but there's enough to get a feel",
          "This Abbey and Gardens are in a fantastic setting and a visit is highly recommended. If your attraction is the Abbey itself, I think you may be disappointed but taking the visit as a 'package' it is well worth the expenditure. As it was dry and one was reasonably mobile (on",
          "Stopped here on a August 2019 bus tour. Totally enjoyed this beautiful home. I love touring historic buildings/homes. A bygone period in time. Everything is very well maintained and laid out for easy access. Very nice self guided tour, informative, neat and clean.",
          "This place is stunning. It has the most amazing grounds and scenery I have seen in a long time. I could have stayed for a week as its so calm and peaceful with mountains, lake and trees all around u. The Abbey is so beautiful with all the old furniture and memorabilia. The",
          "The first trip to Kylemore I didn't see the gardens. This second trip out we went back and this time we saw the gardens and it was BEAUTIFUL. I recommend getting there early!",
          "Set in stunning Connemara National Park beautiful historic buildings and garden. Well worth a visit.",
          "We spent a long time touring the Abby and old Gothic Church. The views of the lake were spectacular and very photogenic. Lunch at the Abby Cafe was delicious.",
          "Nice visit if weather is good. Food is good. Lots of stuff to see, the abbey i thought was cool. Would recommend if in area",
          "The area around the Abbey is surely worth the time, but the Abbey itself has not so much to offer. Visitors are admitted only to the ground floor, which is mainly renewed and has nothing of the original historical flavour. If you are looking for five, six rooms that probably",
          "My wife and I visited Kylemore Abbey in August and we both agreed, this was our favorite part of our trip. Our trip from Belfast was long but definitely worth it. The scenery around the Abbey was gorgeous. I took many photos of the surroundings and was in awe of how picturesque",
          "The main building is interesting. Only part of the first floor is open, so you won't see a whole lot. Take a walk down to the church, a small one with fine detailing. The gardens are fine. The rhododendrons all over the property are beautiful in late May. Skip the",
          "So, we were on a bus tour and it appear that most of them make their lunch stops at the Abbey. It can be very crowded between around 11 am to 2 pm. If you are on your own, it would make sense to arrive earlier in the day or later in the afternoon. There are three main",
          "The gardensare beautiful and nice for a walk. Sadly, you don't see very much from the abbey. In the gardens there are so much things to see",
          "The views are beautiful and the has been a lot of work put in to preserve and showcase the history. Well worth the trip. The gardens were well maintained and the self guided tour was easy to follow.",
          "One of the highlights of our first trip to Ireland. The view of the mansion across the lake is spectacular. The garden was beautiful the history well done. Hope the abbey remains vibrant",
          "The surrounding of the castle is amazing. Landscape is beautiful...... Entrance ticket is \u20ac14 each for adult. There\u2019s nothing much to see. Lounge area, dining area. It\u2019s the ground floor and another floor, that\u2019s it. You won\u2019t be able to access the whole castle - not even",
          "Fabulous day out at this amazing Abbey. Great family day out and plenty to keep all ages happy. Don\u2019t let the rain put you off. These Benedictine nuns should be running the country.",
          "Kylemore Abby is a very well run attraction, very professionally managed. It was something I couldn\u2019t put my finger on that makes me say this, but there is some magic there. The day we had was a good fine, mostly sunny day and if you get the chance to choose Then I recommend",
          "We had so looked forward to this tour on our trip around Ireland but on arrival.... after we had paid learned the place was under renovation and only 4 rooms available for viewing and to be honest, there wasn't much there to see. Yes they were beautiful but given the very",
          "This is a wonderful combination of a garden attraction and a historical house. We took a shuttle up to The Victorian Garden on the mountain which is stunningly beautiful. The restoration of the grounds is wonderful though it is a shame that only two of the grow houses have been",
          "Take the tour and find out about some great products! Very enjoyable and unique! Plan to spend many hours if not the whole day. Beautiful and calming.",
          "Take your time and see it all. We were lucky enough to hear a harpist in the Gothic Church. Priceless!! Had a tour of where they make soap, pottery and their award winning chocolate. The abbey is beautifully restored",
          "The Victorian garden is stunning and very well maintained. The guide of the castle/ abbey gave a very personal and engaged introduction to the visit of the buildings that are more recent than indicates the architectural style",
          "The setting is everything, but a quick interior shuttle lands you at the walled garden, a formally set garden paradise. I can't say enough, even in pouring rain, as I experienced. I will let my photos speak.",
          "It is possible to take in the scenery of the abbey without having to enter the place. Parking is free and you can walk up to the lake and see the castle. Also, the gift shop in the area is excellent. Restaurant serves quick and good food too.",
          "First things first, after a long drive to get there - the restrooms are very close to parking. There are nice places to eat and shop near the parking as well. Prices are reasonable and seniors get a discount. There are just a few restored rooms in the Abbey and stories about the",
          "We visited The Abbey on the 7th of August 2019. To say that it\u2019s a great place would be an understatement. It was splendid. We took a tour from Galway and on our way back we realised that my husband had left his phone somewhere on the property. On contacting the Abbey we were",
          "Kylemore Abbey, walled gardens and restaurant are all must-sees. We arrived one wet afternoon. There were large crowds, but upon arrival, the parking lot attendants were all well organised to direct us to the available parking. Then there was the long line for the food area, but",
          "We all enjoyed our visit to Kylemore Abbey this week. The landscape is dramatic and inspiring and the facilities were very good. I had the best Irish stew of the entire trip at the restaurant and even found some dried Dillisk in the craft shop, result! The gothic Church, house",
          "This is a beautiful location that is absolutely worth a visit. The story of the Abbey's creation is enchanting. The walled garden is a beautiful area and a brilliant example of a Victorian walled garden. The setting of the Abbey is spectacular. The Abbey building is worth seeing",
          "We spent most of the day here but should have got here earlier as we didn't have time to see everything. (We will have to come back I guess\ud83d\ude09)It's a glorious gem of a place in the heart of a wonderful part of Ireland. The house and the walled garden give you a glimpse into the",
          "No doubt: beautiful place on Connemara. Take your time, visit the abbey, have a walk in this charming place. You won't regret.",
          "We joined a tour to visit Kylemore Abbey. The Abbey sat in front of a mountain and faced a lake. The 1000acre property and the surrounding area were beautiful and tranquil. I was very impressed by the garden. It was old-fashion elegant by design. Most plants were not special",
          "Just the drive through the Canamera nation park marks the visit worth it. The scenery is breath taking before getting to the Abbey and at the site itself. I wish not dooms were accessible to visit, but it was still a great visit! Take a walk to the garden, grab a piece of apple",
          "The setting for this beautiful, grand building is gorgeous and well worth the visit. The small neo-Gothic Chapel on the grounds is lovely and often houses informal concerts in its excellent acoustic. The museum itself is only moderately interesting. The walled gardens are",
          "A beautiful experience. Stunning view from across the water. Well restored and presented for the public to enjoy. The \u201ckitchen\u201d garden is very impressive, followed by a visit to the tea room.",
          "This place is incredibly beautiful and I loved it! It is a large property so allocate about 3 to 4 hours to see it all. This was a castle built by the Henry family with tons of rooms. You can only self tour about 4 or 5 rooms as the nuns still live there. The Benedictine nuns",
          "beautifully located and with some of the rooms refurbished traditionally the review is only 'average\" because of the steep price for this attraction, which is not in relation to the actual things one gets to see. First and last impression : tourist trap",
          "We had seen the picture postcard photos in guidebooks and had to make a stop. It was even more stunning in \"real\" life. The setting is incredible. The view from the abbey as well as approaching it was alone worth the price of admission. The tour was limited to just a few rooms",
          "We visited this beautiful part of the world and we were very impressed. The natural surrounding are out of this world. The hills and mountains in this area seem to come alive. The Abbey is just a beautiful building and when you learn the history of it, you can't but be",
          "My first time at Kylemore Abbey. Visited with my husband and our 4 children under 7yrs. They loved it. A great place for children. Lots of space to run around outside and they loved the history.",
          "The gardens made the trip worth it! I like the history, and the lovely outside of the main house, but the inside tour felt truncated (repairs, I think?). The shuttle bus to the gardens was nice. We enjoyed walking over to see the chapel, too. Not the very most fun activity",
          "Treasure in the mountains. Tranquil, beautiful area. The Connemara National Park is some of the most beautiful land I\u2019ve ever seen.",
          "Somewhere I read...after our group stopped here...that it was best to take a picture and move on. I second that! The setting is breathtaking but if you are on a short trip of the area, this is not a must see. The Abbey is a house that was built in 1868; this puts it just a bit",
          "We were on a tour and unfortunately didn't have enough time here, we missed the walled garden that can be accessed via a shuttle bus. Nevertheless we enjoyed the house, we walked to the church and mausoleum and walked by the water. The cafeteria was busy and the food was OK.",
          "These gardens are beautiful but do require some time and a lot of walking to see it all. There is a free shuttle which will take you to the gardens and back from Kylemore Abbey's entrance. At the garden is also a nice cafe with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.",
          "The abbey and gardens are beautifully presented and a lot of effort has been put in which is nice to see, the Abbey itself is really nice but you dont get to see a lot, upstairs is closed off to the public I'm a real history buff so I would have loved to see more, there are",
          "Sat in cafe as weather was bad, had delicious lemon cheesecake and pot tea. Not much choice on hot food counter just quiches stew and fish pie. I sat down and noticed the floor under table had crumbs and pieces food waste, staff cleaned tables area but not one in 30 mins that",
          "We arrived at Kylemore Abbey as soon as it opened. The estate was built in the 1860\"s by Mitchel Henry as a gift for his wife Margaret. He was an innovative developer and treated his 300 employees well. He paid them 19-20 cents a day, a large amount back in those days, and",
          "We were lucky to visit on a beautiful summer's day. Visitors centre has everything for a good day out. Plenty car parking, beautiful abbey with informative history talk, ornate church and a tranquil walk to the stunningly well kept gardens. I could have spent spent hours",
          "Visited here with friends. The old house/abbey is beautiful and it is well presented. The location is stunning. The Gothic chapel is also worth a visit. We had a pleasant lunch. A visit is recommended.",
          "We returned after our first visit 30 years ago, and the place looks fabulous! The kids had plenty to see and do and the parents were equally enthused, something for everyone! That being said, we spent hours here and were never bored. Gardens are beautiful and lots of walking too",
          "The castle tour was wonderful. Loved the dining room and table setting. Reality lived up to the iconic picture of the abbey. Don't miss the view that the owners had of the lake and surrounding countryside. We walked to the Gothic church and were pleasantly surprised by a touring",
          "We arrived and started with a cuppa in the lovely tea shop/restaurant. Despite lots of people the queue moved quickly. The gift shop has a very nice range of all sorts of items. Nice to see the products produced in Kylemore in a prominent place. The ticket office was staffed by",
          "Fantastic exhibition in the Abbey, beautiful interpretation. Lovely gardens. Not so good for younger children. You cannot go up to the statue of Christ on the mountain without a guide (paying), which was disappointing. Great day out, beautiful grounds.",
          "Kylemore Abbey and Gardens is such a Treasure! The spectacular views of the Abbey and the beautiful gardens were amazing! The tour of the Abbey was very well laid out and the incorporation of animated screens was very unique. The Gothic Church just a short hike from the Abbey",
          "We visited Kylemore Abbey while we were on vacation in Co Mayo I always wanted to see it and I have to say it is beautiful we had our dogs with us and were not allowed into the buildings with them which was OK so my husband and I took turns watching the dogs while the other went",
          "If you are in the area stop by to see this. This was an included stop on our tour we were on. The Castle/Abbey and grounds are gorgeous. Everything is self-paced, so you can see what you want. We ate in the cafeteria, which was extremely busy and it seemed that we spent most",
          "Kylemore Abbey is so beautiful, the setting and gardens are stunning, the cafe there is 5 star food. i had the most delicious apple tart and custard, fab. food in the cafe. beautiful to just stroll around the grounds and take it all in. The history is great attached to the",
          "Arrived at lunchtime and it was extremely busy. The drive to the abbey was so beautiful, lakes, mountains and a few stray goats on the road. The abbey itself is stunning to look at however was very disappointed the upstairs was not open. Just seeing a few rooms downstairs was",
          "The abbey and its surroudings are stunning; worth a trip to spend a day walking on the gardens, visiting the buildings and watching the nature surrounding you. There are pic-nic spots or you can eat in the restaurant.",
          "We stopped here with our group tour and it does seem to be a popular destination with the coach bus crew. Kylemore Abbey is yours to explore as you wish - and there's a lot to see! The views the exterior really are stunning as you arrive, but I don't know that the actual tour",
          "One of the maintained historic sites visited during our vacations in Southern Ireland. To avoid the crowd, we recommend starting your visit as early as possible. Don\u2019t forget to visit the walled garden. One of the nicest seen so far in Ireland.",
          "Classic castle, lake and gardens, what more needs to be said. Nice for half a day out when you\u2019re in Connemara. Easy enough to access for families and the elderly, who were there in abundance. There\u2019s a couple of places to eat and drink, and you can walk around the estate by",
          "Kylemore Abbey is in a wonderful location and really worth a visit. The house itself is interesting with good accessible explanations of the history; the church is very pretty (particularly the different marbles in the columns), but the real star is the Victorian walled garden",
          "Wow. I see why they wanted to build a home here, it's gorgeous. Part of the castle is inhabited so you only see a small portion of the actual castle, but seeing the views outside (from the garden to the church and everywhere in between) is where to spend your time anyways. Allot",
          "Had a lovely day here. Lots to see, and learn its history. It is worth seeing the home and the little church to see it as it was before the nuns took over. I really enjoyed the walled gardens and seeing how well they are maintained. There were other trails we would have",
          "You\u2019ve seen the photos on Irish souvenir calendars, post cards, and everything in-between. Now visit the actual Abbey. But if you\u2019re expecting the grandeur of TV\u2019s Downtown Abbey, then you may be disappointed. At Kylemore Abbey, privately owned originally but now a nunnery,",
          "A beautiful setting in itself the abbey and walled garden makes this a worthwhile stop.Although busy with tourists in the Summer it is very well organised so you never feel crowded. On a sunny day you can enjoy lingering by the lake for a while, look around restored rooms in the",
          "Go early, so you don't have to deal with crowds! We saw the Abby, and the Cathedral. Had tea in the gardens and we were amazed at how affordable everything was. And their pastries are incredible. It was an experience I will never forget, and will go back next time I visit",
          "We had visited Kylemore Abbey before. While in Connemara recently we returned there on two consecutive days (June 22 and 23) because we had heard that much of the castle had been renovated and was now open to the public. The Benedictine Community has done an amazing job.",
          "I advised the lady at the booking office that i had a chld's buggy and that i wished to walk along the lakeside with my family. We did not want to enter any of the buildings. She explained that there was a choral music concert in the gothic chapel. I was delighted with this. She",
          "That exterior scenic shot is picture postcard beautiful, isn't it? So go into the (free) car park; gaze at it across the crystal clear water; take a few snaps, then leave. You'll save your wallet and avoid bumping into the thousands of tourists that get brought here by the",
          "Gardens, Abbey and Chapel are all beautiful. We got here right as it opened and I cannot recommend that enough. The abbey and chapel were empty and we really go to enjoy them. There is a walk to the gardens that takes about 10-15 minutes. There is a shuttle that comes every 15",
          "It is already nice to learn how people of wealth can be trustworthy and warm to their own spouse and kids but also to their staff always with the vision of everybody should have a life as decent as possiblel",
          "Absolutely fascinating history and info from the head gardener. Give this plenty of time. Lovely tea rooms nearby. Nappy changing facilities also.",
          "It is quite sometime since we visited Kylemore and it still impresses. The location is absolutely stunning overlooking the lake and with a mountain in the background. The tour of the Abbey is essential and the new interpretive centre is excellent giving a complete history of the",
          "This is an old private home on a pair of lakes which was turned into a true working abbey. (The nuns inhabit the second floor of the home, which is closed to the public.) The house itself (palace?) is exquisite and filled with period furniture, beautiful floors, hand carvings,",
          "I had heard that this may not be worth our limited time on our trip to Ireland, but I had to stop to see this from the outside. It is magnificent in person. I got some great photos from the lake looking up at the castle. I actually had a perfect day for it. The sun and clouds",
          "Beautiful grounds and gardens in a picture perfect setting, even on a rainy day. The information tour provided an interesting brief history of not only the house and grounds but also the region. Be sure to check the calendar for the day before you go to plan your time there - we",
          "Amazing building, but, I was extremely disappointed with the fact that mist of the abbey is closed to the public.... I thought we\u2019d get to see the abbey in its glory as a convent, but, it was restored to pre num inhabitant which was another disappointment. On the positive side,",
          "We arrive just near the end of our ticket time and that was no problem. The House was beautiful, though there are only a few rooms you can walk through, there is plenty of information to read. I thought the mini cathedral was really neat. The walled garden was great too and",
          "This is a beautiful stately home that went through two owners since the 1860s then was purchased by the Benedictine Order to move the abbey from Ypres, Belgium because of World War 1. Ten rooms have been restored to the early days of the Stately Home for historic and",
          "The abbey is brilliant. It\u2019s history is displayed inside the abbey and it is presented very well indeed. The place is so scenic and it is a joy just to be able to sit and take in the views.",
          "This place is beautiful and worth the trip out. Make sure to visit the gardens and church on the grounds.",
          "The story behind the castle is truly amazing, and the upkeep and restoration of the castle is phenomenal. It did feel a bit touristy but is still worth the visit. If you want to stop for a quick prayer, the chapel is quaint and charming. It\u2019s worth a visit if you have the time.",
          "Beautiful set in a lovely location. A \u201cmust go and see this \u201cif you are in the area and allow plenty of time to enjoy it",
          "Amazing building and grounds a must see. drive there through beautiful countryside, friendly staff, good cafeteria for lunch, reasonably priced food.",
          "Our family of 4 loved our visit here! The history is interesting. The entire grounds are absolutely stunning!! All the staff was very friendly & helpful! Highly recommend visiting here!!",
          "We unfortunately timed Kylemore Abbey and Connemara badly due to poor wether when we went but even in spite of it pouring with rain, they were both stunning to see and made for a lovely drive. There is a restaurant, a cafe (this was closed not sure if this was because it was a",
          "As a regular visitor to the restaurant throughout the year Iwas disappointed to see my coffee and scone taking a second price increase in 12 months and now costing \u20ac5.20 That's a little saucy!",
          "There is quite a lot to see here. The Abbey is active so you only get to see a bit of it on the inside but it is worth the price of admission! the church and history of this Abbey is incredible. The grounds are just overwhelmingly breathtaking. Be sure to look up in the",
          "We visited Kylemore Abbey whilst on a church tour of Ireland. unfortunately the weather was not good but it didn't hinder our visit. A good guide and plenty of information. Good selection in the restaurant.",
          "We did a big day trip from Galway, we should have planned the trip a bit better to give more time at Kylemore Abbey, it is terrific. The way was rainy and cold but that did not stop us from doing as much exploration as possible - Firstly we took the regular 'bus' from the",
          "Beautiful historic home that was ultimately turned into, and remains, a working abbey. The setting is spectacular. It is no surprise that this is one of the most heavily visited sites in Ireland. It\u2019s heavily featured on websites and brochures. Plan on a 1-1/2 to two hour",
          "We visited whilst touring Ireland. Our first view was a wowser, the house and history is amazing. Beautiful church and a great job at restoring the walled gardens. A place not to be missed",
          "In our journey throughout Galway, Cannamara, etc last May 5,2019 we stopped at this beautiful place. It is located just one hour from Galway and is one of Ireland\u2019s top tourist attractions. Kylemore Castle was built in the late 1800s by Mitchell Henry a wealthy businessman,",
          "We saw the Abbey in photos and decided to take a drive out on the Connemara Peninsula to take in the sights. This stop was by far our favorite. Pictures do not do it justice. From the moment you cross the bridge and see the Abbey across the water, it is simply breathtakingly",
          "Spent at least 3 hours there on a sunny afternoon... and boy did the sunshine make it all seem wonderful! The gardens are awesome. You can take a shuttle bus to & from the car park to the gardens... or else walk it in 20 minutes alongside the lake. There's a cafe by the gardens",
          "This Abby is beautiful from the outside. Scenic area it is located in. The tour inside is very short though and really gives you a lacking experience inside.. There is a nice walk to a church and mausoleum. These were beautiful.. They became my favorite part of the location..",
          "Incredible estate with so much history. The gardens were fabulous as well the abbey. We came on a sunny day and enjoyed our visit.",
          "Our visit was a bit disappointing because the rain was heavy and when it stopped we were attacked by midges. I don't know how often that happens but I would take some insect spray if I visited again. The Abbey looks good from the outside but only a couple of rooms are open to",
          "We had a great visit right before a new addition to the abbey opened. The place was buzzing with activity! It\u2019s got many sights to see so plan on at least 2 hours to see the place. Also make a point to enjoy the homemade food onsite!",
          "This is a great place to spend a half a day exploring the beautiful grounds, gardens, and wonderful buildings. It can be quite crowded with lots of tour buses but there are plenty of places to spread out and enjoy the beauty. The beginning of June is the perfect time to view",
          "The scenery is beautiful. The Abbey at this time is under renovation and you can only visit the ground floor. The gardens are the worth the visit. Food in the restaurant was good. We had the soups of the day-excellent. Nice gift shop too",
          "If you are in the Connemara area you must plan a visit to Kylemore. What a beautiful place to see. Beautiful old private mansion that was turned into an Abbey. Beautiful Chapel. And beautiful gardens. Great paths to walk and take your time enjoying this beautiful place. It is a",
          "Kylemore abbey was one of our favorite places we visited in Ireland. It is in such a gorgeous area located on a private lake surrounded by mountains. Everything about it is picturesque. You can buy tickets online for slightly cheaper at 11.70 Euro/person. The gardens were",
          "Ok I suppose. Overpriced, Abbey half closed but still full admission fee. Coffee was rank in the tea room. Gardens good. Interesting to find out the origin of the expression \"hooray Henry\" stems from the Henry family and their unfortunate demise in a series of clumsy accidents.",
          "Kylemore was built as a 19th century castle by Mitchell Henri, who is labelled as doctor, industry tycoon, pioneer...a true visionary whose work will be enjoyed for generations to come. It isn't just the majesty of this romantic castle over the lake, built after 1850 for his",
          "Having visited Portumna castle and gardens I found Kylemore rather disappointing- there was no vast arrays of color like what I had encountered upon going through the wall entrance of Portumna castle garden- they are truly spectacular!!! Can\u2019t understand as both are situated in",
          "Picture-postcard setting for this amazing building with more than a few stories to tell. Gets very busy on holiday weekends but the parking seems to be very well controlled. Recommended.",
          "It was early for the gardens as they were just beginning. It was still wonderful to walk through the area and see the variety. At the stunning Abbey itself you can explore the rooms as they were back in the day. The setting itself is lovely overlooking the lake. Down the road is",
          "A trip to Kylemore Abby can take a full day if you are interested in gardens and walking through the forests. We had a great time looking at all the different plants and trees. The didactics were very useful and gave you just enough information. I would highly recommend this as",
          "The gardens, Abbey and Cathedral are breathtaking. There is a wonderful gift shop and lunch. One of our best days in Ireland.",
          "From pictures alone we knew it was a must see and we weren\u2019t disappointed! The drive is a true test of Irish fearlessness (tight roads) but upon arrival the property is simply breathtaking! Come prepared for rain and to enjoy the gardens regardless! Shop while you\u2019re there as",
          "This is a gorgeous building in a gorgeous setting. The food onsite is also great. You can't access much of the abbey itself, so don't be surprised. If you purchase tickets online in advance it's a bit cheaper. My group was there when a choir from the USA performed in the church",
          "The Abbey is beautiful from the road and looks so big, but be aware, you are only going to see two rooms! The grounds are beautiful but not much fun in a downpour.",
          "What a discovery we found on our recent visit to Ireland! It is absolutely beautiful! It is well worth the \u201cout of the way \u201c drive. Of course the gardens weren\u2019t developed yet when we went in May, but I imagine they will be beautiful! It\u2019s a must see.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Abbey and Gardens, but I have to say, I enjoyed the gardens the most. It was lovely and peaceful walking around and looking at all the plants, trees, and flowers. The Abbey itself had only a very small area open to the public. The gothic",
          "Whilst visiting this Abbey was on our list of thing to do I was disappointed. The rain was pouring down and that\u2019s not the problem. Entry cost of \u20ac14.50only allowed access to three rooms and then the garden. As it was extremely wet it was hard to view too much as everyone",
          "A lot of history is in this site and its buildings. It has been marvelously restored, and they did not oust the bats in the cathedral. (I did not see signs of them either- just go in daylight if you are not excited about the bats in the belfry) The drive to the Abbey is also",
          "I offten wonder why such grand homes are also so remote. The \"Home\" is impressive and still being used by Nuns. The Chapel is incredible. The stone used is so colorfull and it begs to wonder where those craftmen were found to create it. We did not make it to the walled",
          "Approx 1 hr. from Galway (3.5 from Dublin says brochure). Dining options a cafeteria type line at Mitchells Cafe includes Hot, cold food items, along with yummy pastries and teas & beverage offerings.Outside patio dining available. Very nice gift shop. Enjoyed strolling the",
          "Last time I drove past here it was a boarding school run by nuns. Now it is a beautifully restored Manor House set in glorious scenery and with all modern tourist amenities. Wonder what the nuns would think! Lots of coach tours but still possible to find a quiet spot.",
          "We\u2019d really been looking forward to visiting Kylemore Abbey and along with many others took photographs as we approached as it really is a stunning sight. Unfortunately, that\u2019s all it has going for it!! There was a sign which stated \u201cbusiness as usual during restoration\u201d which",
          "This is as beautiful as the guidebook tells you. Both the abbey and the grounds are great, but i particularly loved the Victorian walled gardens!",
          "The main view of the Abbey from across the lake was impressive, however there are only three rooms inside open to the public, this was unexpected. The walled garden was nice, however it will become more impressive as the summer continues. Meal in the tea house was good, cheap",
          "We passed thee Abbey on our way to Galway and decided to drive back to take in the whole experience a couple of days later. Wow, this place is just so majestic, and you can certainly see why the original owners built the castle. To be able to retreat to such a serene",
          "Beautiful Abbey in picturesque surroundings. Lots to do and see; Abbey, gardens, church, lake, tea rooms.",
          "The Abbey is a Benedictine monastery founded in 1920 by Benedictine Nuns who fled Belgium during World War I. It is on the grounds of Kylemore Castle, in Connemara, County Galway, Ireland. The castle-turned-abbey is drop-dead gorgeous, and we were so looking forward to touring",
          "Very interesting, alas some of the rooms in the Abbey were+not open due to some refurbishment, but what we did see was interesting. The gardens are really fantastic, they must have many dedicated and experienced gardeners, very well maintained.",
          "We arrived long before anyone else did, and it was peaceful and beautiful. The location itself is interesting but other than spending under an hour here, I dont see what else you could do. We did not go inside so I can not comment on the Abbey itself, but did visit the",
          "The pictures speak for themselves. I have traveled extensively and it doesn\u2019t get any better than this in Ireland or anywhere in the world. What a treasure. A must see. Outstanding facilities and very well thought out for the traveler.",
          "The grounds are absolutely Beautiful. Go early to beat the crowds. We got there right when it opened and had the opportunity to enjoy the chapel without overcrowding.",
          "Great place for one external picture. You can do it at the entrance gate. Nice (outside) castle in a great background. The entry ticket is 14\u20acpp and it\u2019s a total scam. The visit of the castle (first floor) take you 2 min for the 4 rooms. The gothic church well there is nothing",
          "Even in the dreary misty weather which precluded visiting the gardens; even with the Abbey under renovation, we found our visit to Kylemore compelling and well worth the time. That's because staffer Joanne Smith delivers a riveting narrative about the history of those who called",
          "Spent seven days in Ireland and the Abbey was the best part of my trip. It is absolutely a sight to behold. The lake and gardens are serene. You will want to pull up a chair and reflect. The inside of the Abbey and chapel were nothing extraordinary. There is a shuttle to the",
          "we began by visiting the abbey and even though there is renovation work in progress we enjoyed reading the history of the abbey and its residents. we then headed to the walled garden and were impressed by all the restoration work in progress. we would have loved to have spent",
          "Biggest disappointment of trip. Very misleading as it looks impressive from outside but inside consists of 4 rooms of shabby furniture and furnishings. There is a vestibule with a seating area and fireplace that an extremely rude tour guide occupied with a tour group to her",
          "Lovely views and gardens . Great gift shop as well with tons of argan sweaters and a nice bathroom as well. Inside the abbey is a great example Of how the older generations furnished their homes complete with antiques and paintings !",
          "I am probably in a minority here but I think the best experience is the view across the water before you pay your entrance fee. The abbey is not especially old nor exceptionally well decorated so if short of time or on a budget I would rather enjoy the countryside...",
          "Good value and great day out. This is an attraction that is easy for kids and adults to enjoy in a leisurely way. Between the gardens, abbey, church and grounds there is plenty of variety and leg stretching. It\u2019s about \u20ac30 for 2 adults + 2 children and most of the local hotels,",
          "We had planned a guided 3 hour hike but with winds >45 mph it was cancelled for safety reasons. We were not disappointed because the gardens were beautiful and you got to see many rooms of the Abbey. We drove from Belfast and that is the warning I need to annotate. There is",
          "We were amazed by the historical information and layout of these grounds. It is the first time that I have seen fuchsia and rhododendron hedges which I am sure will be beautiful in the next few weeks. The Abbey and the mini cathedral were also well worth the extra part of the",
          "The gardens and the inside of the abbey aren't too or exciting, but it is a photogenic place, and it's lovely for a relaxed side-trip and stroll.",
          "Kylemore Abbey is our first drive experience since moving to Ireland. I must say that the castle and the view didn't disappoint. We were lucky that the weather cooperated with us. The castle has been highly maintained. It's actually more beautiful in reality than in photos. It",
          "We decided to brave the crowds and headed for Kylemore Abbey from Galway on Easter Sunday. It was a straightforward drive from Galway, reasonably well signposted. The roads were surprisingly quiet and we arrived at the Abbey just after midday. You can book tickets online to",
          "Visited with my wife and enjoyed every bit of it. Entry tickets could be cheaper, all right. We paid 14 euro each. Especially liked castle rooms and some nice historical paraphernalia on display. Chief Gardener's house was another highlight - well preserved and maintained.",
          "I visited Kylemore with my wife, as we hadn't been there in years. It's an amazing place in a beautiful setting, but seriously, charging \u20ac14 even just to walk in the grounds?! As far as I remember this used to be free.",
          "The castle is beautiful, they have a nice restaurant with good food and a nice structure for the visitors, the landscapes in Connemara is breathtaking and worth it. My friends and I had a good time and we were happy with this company, before we book the tours we tried another",
          "The castle looks nice like a LEGO castle with the red chimney and blocks color. But the garden is pretty normal.",
          "We drove quite a ways to see the abbey. The setting was beautiful, unfortunately, the Abbey was closed for renovations. They gave us a slight discount on our entry fee and we were able to see the chapel and gardens. It was rather cold and windy but we enjoyed the gardens and",
          "The drive to the abbey is worth the trip on it\u2019s own. The abbey and gardens are something you will always remember. Shuttle bus to walled garden is included in the price and is really convenient... well worth the price and trip.",
          "We visited this place on a sunny day, we were super lucky with the weather but not so lucky with the garden as it was not so colorful as expected! The only issue is the price, honestly, 14 euro per person for what we experienced looks too much.",
          "The property is gorgeous and the gardens are really enjoyable. Nice walk and amazingly beautiful landscape, including the lake. Really worth a visit.",
          "When you arrive into Kylemore abbey there is a large car park with a view of the abbey itself. We arrived in April which was off season. The ticket boot was a small kiosk but the queue moved quickly. There was a shuttle bus to the Victorian gardens but we decided to walk. The",
          "As a Catholic, I love supporting Religious Communities such as the Benedictine Nuns at Kylemore. I was a little surprised that the religious aspect, other than the Community Chapel and the Gothic Chapel was a little more subdued than I am used to. Other than the Sacred Heart",
          "My husband and I visited at the end of March; chilly but no less amazing. The main added building featured in all the tourist photos, is currently under renovation, having been purchased by Norte Dame University. However, the gorgeous chapel is open and active (the interior",
          "Well I guess the College of Notre Dame just bought the abby,who knows what they are gonna do with this large piece of property. It is tucked away in the side of the mountain,with an ole church and massive garden.",
          "The Abbey is a delightful experience for the whole family. Unfortunately, the Abbey was closed for renovation, but all of the other facilities were up and running. This is a great place to walk and familiarize yourself with the garden and history of the ancient family. The",
          "I am giving this 4 stars because the Abbey building was closed. Also, it is not a great experience when the weather is cold and very wet. The 19th century chapel is lovely and shows the 4 types of Irish marble. I would like to come back to the gardens in better weather. The",
          "We visited this beautiful estate in the off season, so it was cold and rainy. But still completely worth it! We had a rental car and thoroughly enjoyed the gorgeous drive through the hauntingly beautiful Irish mountains. While the Abbey itself was not open due to renovations",
          "At the present moment Kylemore Abbey is not currently open. We drove 200km out of our way and had an overnight stay in Westport in order to pay a visit today only to find out on arrival that only the gardens and Gothic Church were open. They are offering entry fee at a reduced",
          "The abbey itself is not the only attraction here. It's big and beautiful but wasn't open to visitors during our stay (they are planning to re-open in April); we toured the gorgeous onsite chapel and the Victorian walled garden, plus walked the grounds a bit, which were stunning.",
          "Visited in the week, was very quiet but an amazing place. Road to the abbey wasn\u2019t the best, pay attention if you are driving yourself there are twists and turns and a lot of sheep in the road. Lovely restaurant and huge gift shop with items made by the nuns.",
          "The cherry of our visit to Connemara was to meet Kylemore Abbey. We stayed 2 hours in the abbey and we would have stayed all afternoon, the landscapes around the place are fantastic and the story of love, tragedy and change leaves you in love with the place. We loved the",
          "I was a little concerned visiting Kylemore on a rainy and foggy day, but it was magical! What you don't see in the pictures are the multiple waterfalls streaming off the mountainside and into the lake. Very Lord of the Rings vibe all through the property.",
          "The Abbey was built by a couple in love but sadly while it was being constructed his wife died. Because it was a special promised gift, he continued to build while the wife\u2019s remains was kept in a mausoleum. When he died, they were both laid side by side near the Abbey.",
          "Kylemore Abbey and gothic church is well worth a visit. It is a former Stately home and Boarding School. The Sisters of the Order of Benedictine nuns still live here today. Aside from the Abbey - there is a wonderful walled garded too.",
          "Well worth a visit when in Connemara. There is plenty to see and do and a nice cafe and gift shop too. It is \u20ac13 for an adult (or \u20ac11.70 if you book online). You get entry to the abbey which you can stroll around and they have history talks and an audio visual presentation. A",
          "The Abbey is beautiful with a neat Gothic Church and amazing gardens. The pictures that you will take are so amazing and will top off your travel album.",
          "My experience was short lived at Kylemore abbey, It won me over with the beautiful scenery, But it wasn\u2019t until I stepped foot into the overly priced gift shop, I was set upon by suspicious staff, who all followed me around as if I was a criminal. No friendly hello! No: \u201cCan I",
          "First Off....Greatest Gift Shop Ever! Be prepared to spend several hours here if you intend to see all its wonders. The gardens during the winter may be underwhelming but the walk there is still beautiful. The walk from the Abbey to the church and maosuleum will be well worth",
          "I went to the Abbey on a family vacation. It was picturesque. The gardens were also pretty. We walked to the small church and cemetary down the path along the lake. What a beautiful area and the drive to get here is just as beautiful. Try the crepes that you can purchase",

          "Kylemore Abbey is beautiful. The sight of the grand old building from the car park just took our breath away. We enjoyed a picturesque walk along the lake from the abbey down to the little chapel. I would have liked to see more of the inside of the abbey though but understand it",
          "We visited Kylemore Abbey on our way home after a weekend spent in Clifden. We expected the Connemara rainy weather and testing roads so no surprise to us there. Upon arrival at the expansive car park of the Welcome Center, I got my first glimpse of the Abbey seen many times by",
          "Kylemore may be an iconic location and it's hard to argue with the gorgeous shots across the lake and the location is simply stunning. But as a place to see and visit, not so much. I expected a fabulous house and inside would be jaw dropping. Truth is it needs a good clean and",
          "Well run and beautiful spot to stop on the road. Very massive complex you\u2019d need 2-3 hours to see it all. Nice gift shop and cafe as well.",
          "The grounds around Kylemore Abbey are one of the most peaceful places I've visited and found myself stopping just to look out at the mountains across the lake multiple times. I arrive on a tour bus and even the ride out to Kylemore was breathtaking. There's a shuttle that runs",
          "We had this planned for a day that turned out to be extremely rainy, cold, and windy. Despite that, we had a great visit to Kylemore. The locale provided us with a drive that was full of dramatic scenery. It almost felt otherworldly. We were grateful for the bus that shuttled us",
          "Do yourself a favour and add this to the must do options in the Coonemarra National Park. We came here by accident seeking directions to the start of the nearby Diamond Hill hiking track and decided to pay a visit as the Abbey looked interesting. The storyboard through the Abbey",
          "This is one of the most stunning Castles we've seen in our years of travel. The view across the lake is a sight to see in itself. Just spectacular! We were fortunate to visit on a clear day which added to the beauty. Discovering the history of the Abbey and also the chapel",
          "You don't get to see much of the Abbey as it is still functional but the grounds, views and walled garden are brilliant. Definitely a place to take post card quality photos around every corner. Highly recommended. (p.s. re-watch Two Fat Ladies, Series 3, Episode 1 for their",
          "The story of the Abbey and its renovation is a marvel. When you visit the abbey, don't forget the walled garden -- it is spectacular. We enjoyed a light and yummy lunch (soup) at the Garden Cafe.",
          "As part of a Royal Irish Tour, we had some time at the castle/abbey. We tried to see as much as possible in our allotted time, but the gardens themselves deserve part of a day! The self-guided tour of the castle/abbey was interesting, although only a small part is open because",
          "The gardens are amazing, mush better than the actual Abbey itself. The weather was lovely and got some great photos here.",
          "We simply stopped at the (free) parking lot to stretch our legs and take a few photos of the Abbey and fisherman on the adjacent lake, before continuing on our way. Beautiful spot!",
          "After planning/plotting for over a year, we made the Connemara National Park & the Kylemore Abbey our only day trip out of Galway. Man we were right to do so, just an AWESOME DAY!",
          "All of connemara is absolutely beautiful so the drive out their is lovely of old rural Ireland and kylemore Abbey is breath taking",
          "We were here over 20 years ago when restoration was ongoing. Couldn't believe the difference. Will definitely go back in Summertime to view the fantastic flowerbeds in full bloom",
          "Kylermore Abbey and its grounds are absolutely stunning. Arrive when gates open (30 minutes prior to the abbey opening) and you'll have the place to yourself to explore. Walk around the reflective lake and get an outside glimpse of the abbey before you're able to go in to see",
          "This was a beautiful place to visit. We started with the walled garden and it was not difficult to picture what it would have looked like during it's peak years. The history of this residence is amazing but in some ways sad regarding all the changes made to the original",
          "we were very fortunate that we had a beautiful day for this trip. The leaves were beginning to show their autumn colours. The gardens are so interesting to visit, but unfortunately we had not a lot of time to spend there.",
          "Of this huge beautiful building you only get to see about 5 rooms. It was a bit disappointing for the actual Abby itself. On the other hand the little church is beautiful and the garden is the real reason to come here. You don\u2019t actually need to take the shuttle to the garden",
          "This was an amazing Abbey with awesome and historical items perserved. The Gothic Church was simply beautiful. A must SEE!",
          "What a beautiful setting? And well worth the drive. Both there and back there was always something to see. Once there, we were able to soak up the love story of the Henry's up to the present day. The tour guide inside the main house, certainly knew her stuff and added detail to",

          "Being seniors we took the carriage ride & tour. Very, very nice. The weather was good, the grounds massive and impressive, and very, very beautiful",
          "I can't say anything bad about this place. Even in the rain the abbey was beautiful from across the lake and the setting is serene. However keep the weather in mind. It is a bit of a walk from the car to the chapel and obviously spending the day in an outdoor garden will be",
          "We went with Lally tours, and had a great experience. Our driver/guide was Michael, he made it a very interesting ride with alot of information. He gave us nice tips for the visit and stopped at many places to take some pictures along the road.",
          "We visited this Abbey on a rainy Saturday morning in Oct. Admission is 13euro for an adult which we found to be a little expensive. The Abbey is on a large estate which is well kept and very peaceful. There is a shuttle bus service from the main Abbey building towards the walled",
          "A visit to Kylemore Abbey is like stepping back in time. There is such an emotive history to this building, originally used as a Castle, back in 1868, and now an Abbey for a Benedictine community of nuns who arrived at Kylemore in 1920 after their Abbey in Ypres, Belgium, was",
          "Would I pay 13 euro per person to go? No. However, the shop, restaurants and the few from afar were very nice. The road to take you there from Galway is also beautiful, so why not go?!",
          "The public rooms in the house aren\u2019t much but the exterior is impressive, situated next to the lake. The walled garden is an impressive accomplishment and made even more so by the juxtaposition it makes with the surrounding hills. The walk from the house to the walled garden",
          "Kylemore Abbey was beautiful to view from across the lake (there is a parking lot available). We didn't have any interest to tour it.",
          "The drive to Kylemore is beautiful. Very disappointed that the guests can only view a very small section of the Abbey. You can go in/out in a little more than 5 minutes. The gardens are well maintained but that\u2019s about it. Don\u2019t get me wrong; come visit the place. But don\u2019t have",
          "We were short on time, so we did not pay to go in. We had been told that much of the abbey is closed to the public anyways so we elected to skip it since we were short on time. Parking is free so we stopped in for some photos and to check out the gift shop - which was awesome.",
          "Kylemore Abbey was not built as an abbey, but as a country house in the Victorian era. It was later sold and became a convent and girls school. The school is now closed , but nuns still live in the complex. The house still has a school feel to it , with not much of the original",
          "After a enjoyable meal in the restaurant we visited the abbey with its fascinating history. Built to be a wealthy country retreat with all facilities it was then turned into a boarding school. Clearly if the walls could speak there would be many stories to tell. We then walked",
          "My husband and I visited Kylemore Abbey and Victorian Walled Gardens on a rainy day in middle October. Although the adult admission is 13\u20ac per person to gain entrance, I think it is worth it. We spent over three hours here: walking to the Abbey, Gothic mini-cathedral, mausoleum,",
          "We had a diverse group of 6 and think everyone found something they liked about visiting Kylemore Abbey. That first look at the Abbey across the lake is breathtaking. The history of the \"abbey\" was very interesting. The grounds were amazing, and we saw it in October I can only",
          "Lovely house, church, gardens to visit and stroll the large, beautifully maintained grounds. Fascinating story behind it all. We enjoyed some great food in the cafe. There\u2019s a shuttle for the 1.6 km from abbey to Victorian garden but the property would be challenging if mobility",
          "Our last stop of the tour was Kylemore Abbey,beautiful story and history,we spent two hours walking and taking pictures of the gardens and landscapes,stopped in the rest area to enjoy a lovely lunch and walk through the gift shop for special gifts to bring home,all in all the",

          "We toured the abbey and walled gardens through Lally Tours. It was a beautiful place. The gardens looked fantastic even though it was almost October. Treat yourself to Irish tea and scones before leaving the grounds. Definitely worth the visit!!",
          "Get all 10,000 steps in at the Victorian Walled Garden! It is pure magic. The Abbey and Gothic Church were icing on the cake. If you love the glorious outdoors find a way to spend a few hours in the walled garden. It is soulfully fulfilling.",
          "This castle is STUNNING from the outside and so worth seeing. My husband and I did feel like it was a waste of money and time to try and go in. It was crowded and they only actually let you see 3 rooms of the entire castle. They do have beautiful gardens and a Gothic Cathedral",
          "First sight of the abbey is breathtaking Viewed from across the lake it was really beautiful.I did the tour which was well worthwhile.A short walk away is an interesting Gothic church.I recommend taking the free bus if going to see the Victorian Walled Garden.It is a long walk",
          "The Kylemore Abbey is a beautiful setting, with an amazing building and church. The storey of it\u2019s history is quite fascinating as well. The trip out there from Galway was worth it alone. The fjord with the mountains surrounding it is so amazing. Lots of sheep along the side",
          "Lots of history here going from the romantic,heartbreak, to the destruction, and rebuilding of this magnificent place. The 6 acres of gardens were a joy to walk in. I was amazed at how the original owner managed to produce all their food on this spot,",
          "This is a beautiful place to visit and spend some time. The Abbey is amazing along with the grounds. There is also a Gothic Church that is beautiful. We had lunch there and and the food was good. The lines were long and disorganized to get food. Lovely place to visit.",
          "This was a nice place. The grounds are very pretty and it looks like a imaginary place in pictures and as you walk up. You are only allowed to go through a small portion of the abbey itself (maybe due to renovations?) it there are 6 acres of a walled garden to go through and a",
          "This place just doesn't look real from the road. Just so beautiful. It's still being used as an Abby so we could go to the gift shop and restaurant and gardens. Please to for a lovely few hours looking at the mountains.",
          "This abbey could not stand in a more spectacular landscape. The sight of it is purely magical, standing over that lake surrounded by Connemara mountains. The colours of the stones, the grass and the skies are sure to leave a print on your eyes for a long time. The building is",
          "We visited Kylemore Abbey and found the exterior and the grounds to be worth the time and the drive. Beautiful setting and glorious lake, gardens and grounds. After reading reviews that only three rooms of the Abbey are open to the public, we decided against the admission fee",
          "This place was very beautiful and we visited despite the wind a intermittent rain showers. The grounds were clean and beautiful. Sorry that they are doing renovations on the house and only got to see a few rooms",
          "What a beautiful place, we had a guided tour and our tour guide was wonderful, highly recommend this place of places to see when in Ireland..",
          "We visited on a rainy September day so skipped the gardens but loved the setting and learning about the history. Plus the cafe serves the most delicious food. We shared the bacon and mash special and it was more than enough for two people. The shop is also good.",
          "A wonderful ecperience to an Extraordinary landmark in Connemara. A misty morning greeted us as we arrived giving an aura over the water. The day cleared up when we visited the beautiful gardens. A light snack in the restaurant before some shopping in the adjacent building. All",
          "We visited with our 2 children, early in the morning and it was wonderful. Entrance fee reasonable and gets your into the Abby, church, gardens and walks. I think tours are included too but we didn't do any. There could be more to see in the main Abby though, as you only get to",
          "The Abbey is a real vista and quite impressive looking from afar and near. But if you pay to go inside, you don't see much. Just a few sparse rooms (most of the Abbey is still a convent evidently). But, if you are into gardens, walking the walled garden and the garden's cottage",
          "We took the shuttle to the Walled Garden after we explored the Abbey, and even though it was a little chilly and misty - it was well worth the stop. The garden area is beautiful and worth walking through. My daughter especially loved the hidden \"Fairy Garden\" that is on one of",
          "Toured the Abbey and gardens while on tour of Ireland. Overall, I say it is well worth the time to visit. You don't get to tour much of the Mansion which is a disappointment since there isn't much to the downstairs which I have found is the norm for mansions (especially if",
          "We stopped her for a little over an hour with a tour group. The Abby is large but you only visit a small part of the building as the rest is a working Abby. A few rooms elegantly decorated. A small church is a little further down the property. We did not visit the gardens,",
          "We were very pleased with our trip to the Abbey, but would have liked to have been able to see more of the building. The tour only allows you to see 5 rooms of the whole castle building. Disappointing! The gardens were excellent as well. The scenery is stunning.",
          "The Kylemore is worth a visit. You should plan to spend several hours as there is a lot to see. The Kylemore Abbey is under restoration thus it is limited on what you can see. The furnishing in the rooms (that you can see) are sparse and not set up as they were when the home",
          "This place was on our itinerary and we were sure about it. The tour guide told us the story of the school, cathedral and mausoleum. Amazing architecture. We were not able to take the hike to the Jesus statue, if you want to do that make sure you book it ahead of time because you",
          "I visited Kylemore Abbey with a friend in June. The abbey and gardens were stunning. Inside the abbey you can visit some of the rooms, which give an insight into how the place was run many years ago and some of the historic events that\u2019s have taken place over time. I would have",
          "Wow is the word that springs to mind as you turn the bend and catch your first glimpse of the stunning abbey. We hadn\u2019t planned to visit, we were just out for a drive enjoying the beautiful scenery and unusually sunny September day. We spent a really enjoyable 3 hours here. This",
          "Our tour visited the Abbey and the Victorian Walled Garden. It was such a pleasant few hours. There were many photo opportunities as we walked to the Abbey castle and the lake surrounded by mountains. Mitchell Henry built this castle in the wilderness out of love for his wife.",
          "5 of us toured Kylemore Abbey and its secret gardens today ... WOW ! Admission was $12 Euro per person and it was with every bob ! The Abbey is gorgeous and the gardens are splendid! The history of this incredible estate is well presented ! A must see !",
          "We absolutely loved everything about this place. Its gorgeous, well maintained and with a great history. Lots of opportunity for stunning photos. There are 2 restaurants on site as well as a gift shop. This is a MUST do if in the area. Didn't want to leave.",
          "We went there from Clifden . It was a terrible raining day so it prevented us from a longer visit. Nevertheless we we pleased to go . It\u2019s a spectacular place in a spectacular location . There were 10 bus loads of people visiting from many countries. It was raining to much to",
          "This place is simply great. There is a walled garden to die for. If you don\u2019t want to walk the tree lined 1km walk to the garden, there is a shuttle bus every 10 minutes. The garden is amazing, a truly wonderful place. The abbey itself is still in use so only the lower level was",
          "The Abbey is absolutely gorgeous on the lake. We did not go inside, we just parked, walked and took a bunch of great photos with the Abbey in the background. Parking was free. The gift shop, restrooms and restaurant were accessible without paying for entry to the Abbey. If",
          "We found this to be worthwhile attraction, mostly for the impressive gardens and scenery. Fun to envision this place at its prime with the 24 glass green houses in-tact. My husband, who is a gardener and landscape designer, thoroughly enjoyed wandering the flower and vegetable",
          "We loved the setting of this beautiful house. Enjoyed the walk and the tram ride to the Tea House for lunch which was delicious. All homemade items. Then the walk through the walled garden. It is fantastic how well the gardens have been restored in the last few years. Loved",
          "I really love the Victorian walled garden, the history in the gardener's quarters and the ongoing restoration of the glasshouses. The twenty minute walk to the gardens is very lush with lovely views. There is a shuttle bus should you need it. The house/school itself holds a",
          "I can see the upside of tourist traps, I see the beauty in good food, attractions that are published and draw crowds. I love people watching. This place is that. I may not be the most qualified to rate this place. I can tell you we pulled in and parked for free. We walked with",
          "I came here on a Saturday morning. It was very crowded. Even though it was raining, I got some wonderful photos of the abbey. It is a vast property. I would love to walk to the garden but ran out of time. The cafe got some good looking food but was very crowded. My tuna",
          "The gardens are stunning and the house and cathedral beautiful. I highly recommend a tour here for a first class experience. Also have a great gift shop and cafe that was lovely.",
          "Beautiful castle, now run by a sister order, and you can only see a fraction of the rooms. The garden a mile away (have shuttle busses) is worth a 1/2 hour stroll . Top it off with a visit to the restaurant and rest tired feet.",
          "Its breathtakingly beautiful at first sight, very well kept, its a real let down that its so big but the public can only access a few rooms on the ground floor, that said it gave a good story of the history, it would also have been nice to actually see some nuns on the grounds",
          "if you planning to do a visit at Kylemore abbey please allow yourself for at least 3 hours, because to be honest the abbey inside is not really nice you can visit only 3 rooms, the most beautiful part is the woodland you need to walk in order to reach the Victorian Garden ( you",
          "This was rated very highly by all the guides books but was a complete waste of time. The gardens were nice but no better than any others we\u2019ve seen. We spent all of 15mins inside the abbey itself and part of that was watching an out of date and repetitive audio visual",
          "Gorgeous setting, and immaculate looking Abbey. However, the tour of the inside of the Abbey was bare boned. You get to walk through only a few of the rooms on the ground floor, they have a looping video giving some history, but that was it. Not much to see and left you",
          "Fantastic day out coach tour told us a lot on the way there. We had lunch in little restaurant on arrival.Great selection of homemade foods really tasty.Reasonably priced too. Then we took the complimentary coach to walled gardens really back in time could have stayed longer",
          "When you are in Galway Kylemore Abby and Victoria Walled Garden is the place you need visit. Abby looks like from fairy tale you can walk or takeven bus to gardens which are beautiful.",
          "Spent a half day at this beautiful place with my family. It was busy with a lot of bus tours (August) but still plenty of room to visit the abbey and wonderful gardens. There are two cafes beside the lake and a tearoom cafe beside the walled garden. Plenty of walks with amazing",
          "To save the time we didn't go inside, but stop outside, took some pictures of the castle, and purchase some goods from the store. The price is better than Galway or Dublin.",
          "My friend and I visited Kylemore Abbey and Victorian Walled Gardens as part of a bus tour. What a delight. Comfortable shoes are a must to really enjoy the expanse of the gardens. We kept turning another corner and gasping at the beauty. The tour of the abbey was pretty short,",
          "We visited this place today. Absolutely beautiful scenery and vintage surroundings on the grounds of kylemore Abbey. Wearing good walking shoes is a must . We will definitely be revisiting this place again.",
          "The tragic romantic history of this \"castle\" home suits Ireland, where everything has a story. A short drive from Galway, this beauty is tucked away in a narrow valley. Now an Abbey, it is affiliated with Notre Dame in Indiana, USA. The main house sits overlooking a lake. A",

          "The weather was perfect for our visit to Kylemore Abbey and gardens. The castle (Abbey) itself was fairly unremarkable, but it is so beautifully situated across a lake that the site is beautifully picturesque. The gothic style church is small. Given the scale of the house and",

          "This place is a place for all ages, the abbey is full of history and shows how it was when it was used as a school, it also has a film to watch before you go around the place. The gardens are really beautiful and have been done so carefully that you can sense how it must have",

          "We had heard that actually taking the tour was a bit of a disappointment plus by the time we got here, the abbey was closed. So, we went into the gift shop and also had a picture taken in front of the lake and abbey. Very peaceful and beautiful. If you're in the area, it is",
          "I loved the 2 hours I spent here. This is something out of a Disney movie, a fairytale like abbey on a lake shore surrounded by lush, green forests. Definitely worth a visit in you are in the area, rain or shine. There is also a great garden and an amazing gothic church as part",
          "The scenery on the drive to the abbey is spectacular and even more so when you arrive. There is a bus to take you to the gardens which are spectacular. They have reconstructed a couple of the green houses but the best part is the outdoor plantings which are beautifully",
          "It's definitely worth the trip to see this beautiful property. Had lunch in the garden restaurant. Quiche was delicious--good service at a good price. You need a few hours to explore all the things offered. Surrounding scenery is nature at it's best. Chapel visit is a must for",
          "We were blown away by how beautiful the abbey, gothic church, and gardens were! The history of the abbey was also very interesting (more to me and my friend, less so to our husbands if we\u2019re being honest) and it was the perfect activity after some hiking in the nearby national",
          "We visited as part of our Royal Irish Tours. The gardens were impressive although most of the flowers hadn't bloomed as yet. It was great to walk around the gardens. The Abbey was also impressive as was the Chapel. Unfortunately, we missed the singing there. The only",

          "We arrived to see the harp playing in the chapel, which was beautiful. Then we seen the Abbey which was educational and interesting. Finally, we went to the Gardens and they were amazing. The picture hold a thousand words. A must see attraction for all ages.",

          "The route we took to the Abbey took us through the Connemara National Park - the scenery was stunning and as we arrived we could see the abbey sitting beside the water edge. There is amble car parking space and a short walk to the clean and bright cafe which can be accessed",
          "TLDR: It's okay, but not worth going out of your way. - honestly I was not that impressed with Kylemore Abbey. It's a \"fake\" castle -- built in the 1800s and it never served as a fortification. - The setting is remarkably scenic but the castle itself is not of vast historical",
          "We really happened on this by chance, but it was probably one of my favorite things we did on our trip. The castleabbey has a lot of history, and is decorated beautifully. We didn\u2019t have time to see the Church, but I\u2019m sure that was nice too. A bus will take you to the gardens.",

          "It was the first time this summer (2018) I visited Kylemore Abbey and lakes. Though for my liking the ticket is a bit expensive (\u20ac13 PP), but worth visiting. The Kylemore Abbey lake is fantastic for quite stay.",
          "From a first view this building is impressive. The history of it is intriguing. The small mausalem is untidy looking and not the effort to see it. Far more interesting and impressive is the walled garden and all the elements of it. Take time to appreciate the amount",
          "Visited here on a very sunny morning in the middle of July. The view as we walked down the drive to the Abby was spectacular. We were with my daughter son in law and our 5 month old granddaughter. We were able to go inside Abby which wasn\u2019t too busy . As we were leaving which",
          "The outside and views across the lake are what are really beautiful and worth the visit. While you can go inside it is not super exciting...certainly do it though. The walled garden was worth a visit and I recommend taking the shuttle bus. The onsite church is also pretty",
          "Kylemore is a very attractive abbey/house from the outside and there are some great photo ops of it and the lake. There are just a few rooms open that have been restored so the house itself was not the highlight. The chapel and the various types of marble is lovely but I found",
          "This was a pricey stop for not much to view. We stopped because the abbey looked stunning from the road, It was an expensive place to visit. We were disappointed you could only view a handful of rooms on the main floor. Sure you could look in the church and walk the gardens but",

          "What a wonderful story behind Kylemore Abbey! I highly recommend this stop on your next Ireland vacation. Worth the drive and the entry fee. Take time to learn the history, enjoy the gardens and when you're done stop in and have one of their decadent desserts! Give yourself",
          "The Abbey is beautiful and set in stunning grounds. The shuttle bus is so handy to get to the gardens rather than having to walk both ways. The benches placed along the walk was a welcome relief to sit and relax on the way back. The food in the restaurant was beautiful and so",

          "Great place and lots to do. You can go for a nice stroll to the gardens (also a bus transfer possible) and than back to the abbey and mausoleum. Plan enough time to visit all places and the Abbey. 2 hours are too short",
          "We were here over 30 years ago and you could just drive up close to the Abbey, which was then a girls school. I remember the nuns were extremely crabby and you really wonder why they ever let tourists on the property. Now, they've discovered marketing and there's a restaurant,",
          "Thus restored abbey is huge and sits on the bank of a lake. Great picture moment therefore and the gardens add to the atmosphere. The outside restaurant doesn't capture all the views but that's the only disappointing thing.",

          "Highly recommend. The gardens are a mix of functional, decorative, and historic. The Abbey has a diverse and rich history. There is a shuttle bus for portions of the area. You must do the extended Woodland Walk. Its a very quiet / secluded wooded pathway. It's about a 20ish",
          "This has all the romance of the Tarj Mahal. An amazing building tribute for love. The history of the Abbey is varied and interesting. First sight of the Abbey takes your breath away although there are only 5 rooms available for visitors to see. There is a garden walk to do and",

          "It\u2019s called an abbey because of its current use and function. Most definitely on your must see Irish Castle / Abbey list. Garden was impressive. Only criticism is that main building tour only includes 3-4 downstairs rooms. Entire castle or abbey is not open to the public as",
          "Went visiting the estate with my husband. We went there with a guided tour by Galway Tour Company. The place is pure magic. In the middle of nowhere, in this beautiful landscape you find this amazing palace, and the gardens, and the lake, oh my! Very very beautiful also the",

          "We went to the Quiet Man town of Cong and then took off driving. My wife had heard of this Abby so we set out. The grounds are amazing and the history is like a soap opera. We had a great walk around the gardens and the memorial chapel.",

          "Kylemore is more than an Abbey or formerly a girls school; it is also the love story of the Henry\u2019s. The walled gardens are well worth the visit alone. Take time to sit a bit in the quiet of the little cathedral, along the waters edge or the pathway between the bus stop and",

          "This is a fantastic place to visit. The abbey itself has lots of interesting information & the church built as a miniature cathedral for his wife is really worth seeing. All this along with the magnificent walled gardens well worth the entry fee of 13 euros. There is a minibus",

          "We travelled up from Galway through the mountain pass and saw some fantastic scenery. The setting of Kylemore Abbey amongst the mountains is fantastic. The inside tour of the house is nothing special as so few rooms are open to the public. Also don't bother visiting the masuleom",
          "Our bus tour stopped here. The abbey is beautiful. You can go inside and tour some of the historical rooms. A guide will point out some of the interesting items. Nearby is the old cemetery. Best of all is the huge walled garden. Go here first, and make sure you have enough",
          "I was very surprised to read a few descriptions of this place as a \"tourist trap\", as I thought it to be anything but. The house and grounds were beautiful; we spent about 45 minutes inside the walled garden and then wandered around the chapel, mausoleum, and along the paths",

There's a nice walk around the house telling you about the history, another walk up to the church and then access to the walled gardens. There is also a nice cafe that serves good food at not terrible prices.",
          "Beautiful place from the outside. Disappointed with the small area that we were allowed to visit inside.  The church is beautiful and the gardens. The apples pie was delicious.",

          "Beautiful setting at a lake. Interiors had nice displays and gave a glimpse I to the history and stories of the families.\nGreat to walk around and enjoy the surroundings. \nStaff were friendly and advised on new protocols due to covid.\nCaf\u00e9 next to car park had some tasty soups. Great for a rainy day.",
          "Its a very scenic drive up to the grounds and when you get there you'll either think you landed in a fairy tale or fell into a Delorean and went back in time. Without giving too much away, the gardens are stunning and the abbey is not only \u2026",
          "Absolutely stunning. We stopped just to see this location and visited the craft shop. You can pay 12 euro to gain access to the abbey and walk around the grounds which would be well worth doing but we were short on time. Definitely a must stop if exploring connemara",
          "The beauty of the place is amazing. Definitely need to see on a visit to Ireland.",

          "I came here with a tour group. It was amazingly beautiful from the outside! I didn't have time to go inside, but I  would have loved to. This castle was the residence of the owner, and later an abbey for a boarding school. Also on the \u2026",

          "The photos I post and the ones I have seen online don\u2019t do justice to how beautiful this place is.  The setting is breathtaking with the lake and house in between the mountains.  The house is beautiful as well but you are limited to a few rooms for viewing.  Interesting history of the property is on exhibit as well.",
          "Amazing gardens, mountains and peaceful setting",
          "This was perhaps my favorite place we visited while in Ireland. The property was stunning and we loved walking around the gardens. I also bought a beautiful sweater at the gift shop. The only downside was not being able to see more of the inside of the Abby.",

          "Long ques but worth it",
          "We just came by and didn't go into the abbey. Weather was bad but never the less there were many people. The building looks stunning but unfortunately we didn't have time to go in. There are free parking lots, toilets and a nice gift shop with a restaurant  attached. So everything you need to have a good time.",
          "Its a beautiful Castle in the midst of beauty of the nature.  Should be around 1hour plus from the Galway city crossing few towns and the LoughInagh lake and mountains (kinda  Irish Arizona). The castle and a history and is beautifully \u2026",
          "Lovely day out.feel food let's it down",
          "The place is one of the best spots for spending a day. The scenic beauty is amazing and relaxes your mind. The fine weather during the Summer time made it more attractive and worth visiting. Strongly recommend to visit the place when you pass through Connemara.",

          "This is such a beautiful place to visit and the ground are exquisite.  Also the drive to Connemara from Galway is probably some of the most beautiful parts of Ireland.  It's like being in a movie.",
          "Commercial touristy spot. All about making money. Ireland and especially the west Ireland has much more to offer. Nature, wildlife, culture. Stay away from this trap.",

          "Very nice house and the history behind it is amazing",
          "Fairy tail castle as you drive up. Had a wonderful time driving up. A definite must tour. Reasonable entrance fee. Food was good at cafe with nice soup options. Spend at least a few hours if possible and enjoy the wake and gardens. Try to walk if weather is good and enjoy the area. My teenage kids also loved it.",
          "Lovely place to visit. I will definitely be back. It was showery the day we visited so we didn't get to spend as much time walking around as we would like to have had. In saying that there are plenty of places to get out of the rain when it starts. You really need to sit in the church and spend some time taking the whole structure in.",

          "What an achievement these beautiful walled gardens are!!  Simply love the attention to detail and the gardening staff were cheerful and happy to answer any and all questions.  A highlight for anyone venturing into Connemara..... a blissful day wandering around with added bonus of excellent food served at all eateries.",
          "Lovely staff, let me in for \u20ac9.50 towards the end of the day. Beautifully kept house and gardens. Nice peaceful walks around the place. Not sure if they allow picnics but they have plenty of nice spots for one.",

          "Stunning walks and beautiful garden to walk around",
          "The Abbey is absolutely beautiful. The views of the Abbey, gothic church, and scenery are to die for. The walk around the grounds and gardens are stunning. The Abbey itself is very well kept up and has many beautiful, historical artifacts \u2026",

          "Beautiful place. Last entry was at 4pm. Google stated open until 5:30pm but website says 4:30pm. Drove 2 hours out of our way for a pretty picture. Check the website for actual details.",
          "Quite a pleasure to discover this Abbey. The history there is quite good. Gardens were a bit slim due to the winter but you could still feel how impressive it might be at it's peak.\n10/10 would recommend despite being a bit expensive.",

          "I visited the castle which is of great architecture and with great views.\nNevertheless, coming from Dublin, I arrived just 5 min late from the last admission. I thought the castle would be open until 17.30 judging from what was stated in \u2026",

          "Wonderful scenery, nice walks nearby, the Abbey itself is very well kept as others have said. Food at the cafes is way overpriced though: 7.5 EUR for a focaccia? Come on :) still, worth a visit for the beautiful views of the abbey by the lake, the Gothic church, and the gardens.",
          "Beautiful love the historical education pieces, wish more of it were open to tour. The walled garden is expansive and well maintained.  The gothic church seemed like a forever walk but really was a mere 600m (we got hailed on twice on the \u2026",

          "Great scenery and brilliant service",
          "If you re lucky with a sunny day, yuo'll find an amazing park on the top of a lake. Walking along the path I suggest you go first to the Gothic chapel, and then go back to the abbey.  Unfortunately, only the central halls can be seen.",
          "Beautiful and absolutely gorgeous. Also very windy. Weather would make a lot of difference... Can imagine if go during winter months, it will be cold and miserable. The time I went though, many things were still under restoration, would \u2026",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "D\u00fan Aonghasa (Unofficial anglicised version Dun Aengus) is the best-known of several prehistoric hill forts on the Aran Islands of County Galway, Republic of Ireland. It lies on Inis M\u00f3r, at the edge of a 100-metre-high (330 ft) cliff.\nA popular tourist attraction, D\u00fan Aonghasa is an important archaeological site. \n\n\n== History ==\nIt is not known exactly when D\u00fan Aonghasa was built, though it is now thought that most of the structures date from the Bronze Age and Iron Age. T. F. O'Rahilly surmised in what is known as O'Rahilly's historical model that it was built in the 2nd century BC by the Builg following the Laginian conquest of Connacht. Excavations at the site indicate that the first construction goes back to 1100 BC, when the first enclosure was erected by piling rubble against large upright stones. Around 500 BC, the triple wall defences were probably built along the western side of the fort.The 19th-century artist George Petrie called \"D\u00fan Aonghasa\" \"the most magnificent barbaric monument in Europe\". Its name, meaning \"Fort of Aonghas\", may refer to the pre-Christian god of the same name described in Irish mythology, or the mythical king, Aonghus mac \u00damh\u00f3r. It has thus traditionally been associated with the Fir Bolg.\n\n\n== Form and function ==\nThe fort consists of a series of four concentric walls of dry stone construction, built on a high cliff some one hundred metres above the sea. At the time of its construction sea levels were considerably lower and a recent Radio Telefis Eireann documentary estimates that originally it was 1000 metres from the sea. Surviving stonework is four metres wide at some points.  The original shape was presumably oval or D-shaped but parts of the cliff and fort have since collapsed into the sea. Outside the third ring of walls lies a defensive system of stone slabs, known as a cheval de frise, planted in an upright position in the ground and still largely well-preserved. These ruins also feature a huge rectangular stone slab, the function of which is unknown.  Impressively large among prehistoric ruins, the outermost wall of D\u00fan Aonghasa encloses an area of approximately 6 hectares (14 acres).\n\n\n== Today ==\nThe walls of D\u00fan Aonghasa have been rebuilt to a height of 6m and have wall walks, chambers, and flights of stairs. The restoration is easily distinguished from the original construction by the use of mortar.There is a small museum illustrating the history of the fort and its possible functions. Also in the vicinity is a Neolithic tomb and a small heritage park featuring examples of a traditional thatched cottage and an illegal poteen distillery.\n\n\n== Nearby sites ==\nD\u00fan D\u00fachathair (\"Black Stone Ringfort\"), D\u00fan Eoghanachta (\"Fort of the E\u00f3ganachta\"), and D\u00fan Eochla are similar prehistoric sites on Inis M\u00f3r.

          "This is a 20 minute hike. Our two children 8 & 9 really enjoyed the hike nothing too strenuous. The views at the top are just amazing & its a definite must see on Inis M\u00f3r",
          "I walked my dog around here after being dropped off at the visitor centre (which has bathrooms, yay!) - it took about 10 mins from the visitor centre to the top and a lot is uphill but relatively easy. There are no barriers at the cliffs so keep young kids away from the edges",
          "Well worth a visit, weather was amazing and views back over the island are truly breathtaking. Highly recommend.",
          "Dun Aonghasa is definitely worth a visit. The views are absolutely phenomenal! I would be wary about bringing young children, as there is no fencing around the cliff so you\u2019d need to keep an eye on them. The path up to it is stoney but it\u2019s not difficult and only take 10-15",
          "We had a perfect day for our visit. We visited on their free day (but also had a voucher from our B&B), 15minutes or so walk from the visitor centre and the most amazing views. Would have to be one of my favourite places we visited. Just stunning.",
          "From the boat ride to the island itself, this is one of my all time favorite trips. Dun Aonghasa was beautiful and the view rivaled that of the Cliffs of Moher; we even saw Basking Sharks in the distance. Definitely a day I won't forget!",
          "This was the only day it rained on our 10 day trip. The rain made the rock a little slippery. The terrain is very rocky and uneven. If you walk slowly and consider every step, the climb to Dun Aonghasa is worth it. The views of the ruins of the fort, the water, and the",
          "A step back in time and some spectacular views....all in one place! It is a bit of a walk from the visitors' center, but well worth the effort. If you can viist this incredible place, leave time to soak in the experience.",
          "You are making a sort of pilgrimage to one of the earth's most breathtaking spots, not only because of the natural beauty, but because the fort is a testament to human imagination and endurance. To get her you must either drive to Rossaveal harbor, or from Galway book the bus",
          "In late September the weather is cool and rainy with low clouds and fog. This fortress must have been some project in the best weather in the age it was erected. Even on a cool and windy day in fall this is an interesting site to come and contemplate the stamina of our ancestors.",
          "I love Dun Aonghasa. It is well worth the trek up the hill. Stunning. We stayed at a nearby B&B that allowed us free entrance.",
          "Visited on Oct. 7th 2019. The excursion to the Aran Islands was part of a Globus bus tour I took. We had a wonderful visit to Kilronan on Inishmore and it was capped off with our visit to DUN AONGHASA. Due to high winds that day it was an arduous hike up to the fort but worth",
          "If you go to Inishmore you have to go to Dun Aengus, but beware. The day we were there the rain was almost sideways the winds were so strong. We were not super close to the edge but a wind gust almost blew my husband's cap over the edge (better his hat than him) to the sea",
          "This was a tedious hike that requires a lot of care to be safe. Views are amazing, though. Well worth the effort.",
          "The hike up was a bit more than we expected, but so worth it. Great views. Enjoyed a light lunch before coming back down.",
          "Dun Aonghasa is an ancient fort on a high sea cliff. The walk up is about 10 minutes through farmland and offers good view across the island. The fort is in good condition and the views are staggering. Well wirth the 5Euro entrance fee. Part of the hop on / off tour of the",
          "OK, first of all when choosing a vehicle for your hop-on, hop-off tour, pick the one with the biggest windows. Second, this is not hop-on, hop-off where you get off the bus & another picks you up later. Everyone gets off & on the bus at a cemetery, at a beach, and",

          "We flew over which I highly recommend. Go on an early flight because the ferry which brings over large groups hasn't arrived yet and you have the island almost to yourself. (six seater plane with an eight minute flight) John was our driver and he was not interested. Couldn't",
          "Visited on a wet and windy day and almost had the fort to ourselves. Pictures do not describe the scale of this ancient fort. The view from here is much better than the Cliffs of Mohr. Its a bit of a hike up the uneven path to teh top so make sure you set enough time in your",
          "Dun Aonghusa is the best-known of several prehistoric hill forts on the Aran Islands. It sits at the edge of a 330 ft. cliff. It is a popular tourist attraction as well is an important archaeological site. It is believed that the first construction goes back to 1100 BC, when the",

          "We took the ferry over from Galway and then did a van tour. It was worth the ride. There can be a lot of traffic on the road and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s real safe to talk or ride a bike. The roads are really thin. The views are spectacular. It is definitely a must see if you were in",
          "Getting to the top is a challenge, especially if it is raining. Even a little bit of rain makes the rocks very slippery. If are unsteady on your feet or have problems with your balance, you may have issues going up AND down along the trail. We didn't spend much time at the top",
          "A great spot to visit and feel and see the strength of Mother Nature. It makes you wonder about why people came to the island and even more as to why they stayed. But locals really enjoy living here. Tremendous views and yes you can get right next to the sheer cliff. The",
          "This place is so different from anything else. The view is spectacular - you look right out at the ocean. The remains of the fort as simultaneously impressive and not much. It is impressive that they still stand, but it is also just a series of walls made from a bunch of hand",
          "We had to cross through water after the flooding. We had our hiking sticks and boots and were able to navigate the rocks and steep inclines. Definitely worth it to be at the top. The cliffs were stunning. A highlight of our trip to Aran Islands.",
          "Stopped here during a August 2019 bus tour. A bit of a walk/hike....almost got to top but path got too rocky and uneven for me...so my daughter continued to the top and got some absolutely beautiful pictures. The weather this day was perfect and her pictures could not have",
          "Approx 30min walk from entrance to fort, along a good path initially but then rocky and slippery steps/rocks. The fort is awesome but was too scared of getting too close to the edge as it was a sheer drop down a cliff (no fencing). Was also warned by staff to hold onto our 4yo",
          "Highly recommend this as a must visit if u are visiting inishmore. It's a fab walk/hike, but wouldn't advise for those unsteady on their feet or for buggy etc. The first section of path is fine but the closer you come to the actual attraction, the pathway is uneven and it's",
          "The view from the top is worth every step of the hike to get there!. You won't be disappointed. Breathtaking and educational.",
          "This place is amazing! It's 3000 years old and an incredible feat of construction. The views are great, even in the rain. You need to find a way to get there from the ferry - we had booked a horse and cart tour - and then it's about a km walk from the museum/visitors center.",

          "Joined Lally Tours for the trip to Inishmore, a ferry-boat ride from Galway. Took a minivan to drive us to Dun Aonghasa. The driver was friendly and informative. From visitor center to the top, it's about 20-30-minute walk one way. The view from the fort is amazing! The vertical",
          "It was a lovely place, really enjoyed it ,a handy walk up to it but the views from the top or amazing and it's also gud value",
          "A bit of a hike (15 to 20 minutes) but the view was spectacular. It was in the final scene of the movie Leap Year.",
          "We cycling from the harbour to here which was lovely. When we got here we left our bikes where we were told and paid the entrance fee. It is a good 15 minutes walk uphill and would be hard for anyone with walking difficulties. The views are great though and worth the effort when",
          "Visited here with a family group including a 2 and 4 year old. Was delighted to hear that we could go free as we were staying in the glamping park. The staff were helpful and agve us good advice. The walk up is nice, some challenging bits but take your time to take in the views",
          "It was a not an easy walk up and down to the fort. Some of the steps were 30 inches tall and no handrails. I had to get on my knees twice to climb a few of those steps and it was the same on the way down. The cliffs had no guardrails or fences so if you step or slide over the",
          "The walk up to the fort can be a small challenge but is well wort the effort. Be sure to wear good shoes, the last part of the path is rather rocky, but take your time and you will be fine. Allow 15-20 minutes for the walk. The view from the fort is stunning and the fort itself",
          "The trail took us up the fort was long. But we appreciated the site very much after we got up there. The fort was like a walled field. Standing there looking out the ocean the view was splendid.",
          "Come later in the day to avoid the 5 euro entry fee! This fortress was originally 1 km from the sea; much has then fallen into the sea through erosion. The hike up is not intense. The views of surrounding cliffs are magnificent. From Dun Aonghasa, you can see the Atlantic on",
          "Amazing place. Lovely and peaceful. Lovely walk from kilmulvey House and to Poll an bPeist. Great views. Friendly staff.",
          "Amazing sight, the climb up is nearly as good with fantastic views of the bay and island. The fort itself is imposing when you are up close with the entire back missing and in its place the cliff drops away to a dizzying fall to the Atlantic ocean.Twenty minutes or so up and the",
          "The place is amazing and a must see if anywhere in that part of Ireland. I wont repeat others comments about the structure itself. Its pretty incredible and a little freaky to be at the edge of the cliff. A couple thoughts- Ideally stay on the island and get to the site as early",
          "During our day\u2019s visit on Inishmore, we hiked to the cliff-side Dun Aonghasa prehistoric fort. When we purchased our tickets, the agent said it\u2019s about a ten-minute walk to the fort. This is an underestimate and a disservice to tourists who are unprepared. The first part of the",
          "Reading the reviews in advance of our trip, I was worried that I should skip this with my kids due to the danger. However the site itself is large and while caution is needed (don't take toddlers), it did not pose a problem for 6 and 7 year olds. They could manage both the",
          "How could you come to the island and not visit D\u00fan Aonghasa. I've wanted to visit for a while now. So glad to that we got to do it this year. It's wonderful to see a part of our ancient heritage being preserved. It was worth the small entrance fee to contribute towards that",
          "It is a somewhat difficult walk up to the fort and cliffs, but worth it! Be sure to wear good sturdy walking shoes. When you get to the cliffs, LAY DOWN and crawl to the cliff edge, look down hundreds of feet to the ocean below. Incredible view! The cliffs are straight down,",
          "\u20ac5 pp entry, with a 20 minute walk which you have to be reasonably fit & able to do but it\u2019s so worth it! Stunning views of the coast with sheer cliff drops to the sea. A good example of a pre-historic stone hill fort. Not too crowded but tours are regular visitors. Park your",
          "This is a must see when visiting Inismore. About a 20 minute walk up. As you near the top the walk is very uneven and as the rocks are quite worn they can be slippy especially on the way down. Wouldn't recommend for anyone unsteady on their feet. Wear comfy shoes. The view once",
          "A Tour to a 2000 year old Iron Age ring fort. It is perching high on the cliffs. It is surrounded by a defensive ring of very sharp stones. There is a walk to the top which is very irregular stone steps. There are small steps and large ones. It is not a walk up for anyone",
          "This is a one in a lifetime experience. Be mindful of the weather, it can be quite windy by the 300-Foot cliff and rocks are really slippery when it rains.",
          "quite an easy walk up (though worth wearing good shoes) over 3000 years old and still standing, the Irish sure know how to build with stone! there is an amazing cafe at the base once you get back down too (Teach dun Phaida)",
          "The fort itself was interesting enough, but it's the location that really makes this special. Perched right up against a massive cliff face, it's pretty darned impressive. Spend some time reading about the fort at the entrance building before heading up to it. It will add to",
          "We got to the visitor's centre and decided not to do the walk to the fort as we did not have time. The cycle to get there had taken longer than we thought (6km from the port) and we also wanted to see the wormhole. Another reason was that we had to pay to get in. I am sure it",
          "My friend and I really enjoyed looking over the edge of the cliffs in the ruin, down into the beautiful water. Definitely take the time to read the posters in the ticket office as you enter. It's about a 30 minute walk up and down. Not too strenuous but definitely wear good",
          "What I love most is that it\u2019s a tourist attraction that is mostly left untouched and uncommercialised. Approach the cliff edge at your own risk! Most people lie flat on their bellies and crawl to the edge to look over. It\u2019s breathtaking and heart stopping all at once!",
          "Adventure Canada offers an 11 day circumnavigation of Ireland. The day spent here, on Inishmore, was one of the highlights of my trip. If possible, catch a ride up to the prehistoric fort, built in 1100 B.C. After exploring the fort, hike along the cliffs until you come to",
          "The best way to explore dun Aonghasa is take bicycle from the Port and ride to the fort. It's about 30-40 mins of riding plus the stops. You will see some amazing views of the rugged island beauty on your way. Once there, take a short hike up to the fort and explore walking",
          "Out of this world... A must see... One of the highlights of the island. A wonderful sight to behold.",
          "Everybody heads for Dun Aonghasa, once they get off the morning boat. I went in the afternoon when the day trippers were all gone and there were barely 15 people in the complex. It's important to be alone here and not be surrounded by the hordes who only want to take photos and",
          "Excellently done, clean and very enjoyable. Staff excellent. We locked our bikes and they were so helpful in helping us replace them. Well done",
          "Worth the climb to see this amazing fort from earliest times. Suggest you go early, or even late, to avoid the crowds and enjoy it.",
          "It is quite a long uphill stony walk to the fort. The views are immense. There is a great information centre which explains everything you need to know",
          "Absolutely beautiful. Def worth the hike up. The view is priceless. A must for anyone who visits Inis M\u00f3r!",
          "A short tour van ride lead us to the long walk to this prehistoric fort. In the rain the stone walkway was very slippery. You have to wonder why anyone would build a fortress on the edge of a cliff on a remote island in the middle of nowhere. The lure of this mystery makes",
          "Well worth a visit, rain hail or sunshine....have been here a few times and loved it, the most amazing views on the island and definitely worth it.",
          "We went on a cold wet day however it wasn\u2019t raining and the sun did peak out for our walk back down. You need good shoes as this is a climb over rough terrain. About 1/2 up and another 1/2 down. Was very windy at the top with a spectacular view. Very happy we did this and",
          "We started our easy 800 metre walk to the clifftop fortress listening to Coo Coo Birds. The fort is on a rocky hilltop with massive piled stone walls. In the fort, there is no retreat as the back of it is easily a 500 foot drop to the sea. This makes for impressive photos of the",
          "Was here recently when the weather was really good, so really enjoyed it. The fort is pretty impressive: considering how it was built thousands of years ago. The views up there are spectacular too, though I\u2019d be careful, don\u2019t get too close to the edge or it\u2019ll be the last thing",
          "It's a must,,, beautiful place, spectacular views, steeped in History, I just want to look up more and more of the story's and history, won't be disappointed take lot's of photo's,",
          "3000 year old fort with incredible views! loved the hike, the view, darling little shopping and lunch spot as well!",
          "Well worth seeing, and definitely #1 on the Island. A stiff walk up - bring good shoes - with long views from the top. Hard to believe it has been there since 11 BC.",
          "The views from here are really great. Be sure to take in views from both sides! The walk up and down is a little unsteady on the rocks but the footing is sure if you take you time and pay close attention to it. I saw people of all ages and ability levels going up and down. Just",
          "We loved this place. We were on one of the \"Hop On/Hop Off\" vans that dropped us off there and allowed 2 hours to visit. The hike up the back side of the cliff took us about 20-30 minutes and, as other reviews have said, was not that difficult. Having said that, you should",
          "This is a must do if you visit the Aran Island of Inishmore. It is a beautiful site and some amazing cliffs / wave action. The visitor center is extremely informative about the history and construction of the site. The hike is very easy.",
          "We got up early and pedaled our bikes along the cost to visit this fort. There is bike parking. The 1k hike to the top is not aggressive (we wore bike shoes and were fine). The views from the fort are incredible. We arrived at 9:30am and had the entire place to ourselves for",
          "You have to pay to enter this site. I believe it was \u20ac5 an adult, or covered if you have an OPW/heritage card. There are toilets before you enter the little information center and a few shops attached. My youngest and I did not go all the way up because we are terrified by",
          "We took Tom Faherty's pony and trap tour in the afternoon so we got to the fort between 5-6pm. By then most tourists have left already, there were 2-3 other people apart from us to enjoy the sunset. The info in the expo was an interesting read and climbing up to the fort was an",
          "Amazing views, its for free when you stay somewhere in the island to sleep. Otherwise it's super cheap. Nice cycle to get there",
          "This is a stone fortress on the very top of the highest cliff on the island that is 200 feet above the Atlantic Ocean. It was reportedly built 2000 years ago. We hadn't expected the long climb up to it, and it easily takes 20 minutes to hike. Part of the pathway is gravel,",
          "We arrived at 8.30am on a clear sunny Sunday morning to the surprise of the staff opening up the heritage center. Given a map we took the gravel track to the looming stone fort. It is stunning a magnificent relic of the past. Four thick stone walls curve and disappear off the",
          "It\u2019s simply breathtaking and the most amazing place on the island. Once you look down that cliff and see the water crashing against the rocks you can\u2019t stop looking down. The staff is very friendly too! Highly recommend visiting this magical place.",
          "D\u00fan Aonghasa itself was absolutely stunning. Two friends and I visited last week. It was our first time there and we were absolutely blown away by the beauty of the fort. Its unlike anywhere else I've ever been. Terrifying, but amazing! The experience was marred somewhat by an",
          "We visited on a dull day and it just started spitting rain as we were leaving. Fabulous place and its mental you can just walk right up to the edge of the cliff. Would be totally stunning on a sunny day. Lovely walk. Another bucket list box ticked!",
          "Please do not be put off by the walk up to Dun Aonghasa. It is soooo worth it. You will not be dissappointed with the spectacular views and scenery.",
          "Quiet a trek to the site but breathtaking once challenged,probably not for frail people,the decent care needed.",
          "Took a day trip to the island and rented bikes .. cycled to this beautiful part of the island. The scenery was just stunning. It was cold so we didn\u2019t last long but are glad we saw it all the same",
          "After a not to hard hike we arrived at this magic bronze-age fortress. Spectacular views in an equally spectacular setting. If in or near Galway you must come to Inishmor and visit this amazing relic from Ireland\u2019s remote past.....",
          "After getting off the ferry we were greeted by tour guides looking to make a few Euro. Jumping on the small bus and we were on our way to this ancient fort. We were dropped off at an intersection to Dun Aonghasa entrance along with the Aran Islands Sweaters shop. We walked a",
          "Our B&B (Kilmurvey House) is the closest to this so we literally just walked here. They have a large place to park bikes there while you're visiting. When we were there in May, they closed at 6pm but we were unaware that they could even close. We got there a little after 6pm",
          "Huge stone fort compared to others that we visited. Great views and sheer cliffs. Very popular attraction, so don't expect peace and quiet, but also don't miss Don Aonghasa when visiting Inishmore. We rode our rented bicycles to the parking area and then hiked to the fort.",
          "Ancient monument on Inishmore with breathtaking drop into the sea. Within easy reach of the ferry on foot or you can hire a bike.",
          "Well worth the walk up to see these ruins and the views along the cliffs. Amazing to see no railings or protection from the cliffs. You can literally walk right to the edge and look over if your heart can take it. We took a van ride from a local tour guide. There really is",
          "After visiting Dun Aonghasa I was moved to create a painting that was later taken as part of the germinate collection for the Country of Ireland. Im not bragging, Im simply saying that the power of this place can move you to great things. You feel the energy of the ocean blast",
          "We took a pony & trap ride to the entrance from our B&B (Seacrest). There is a small visitor center where you pay and can read up on some history of the area. It turns out our B&B has an arrangement with this place so we got in free of charge. There is a small caf\u00e9 at the",
          "This site is at the very end of the Island of Inishmore. The day we visited was quite chilly and windy so we took a bus that dropped us off and then we walked the 20 minutes to the site. Well worth the climb. If traveling with small children, be wary of the edge, there is no",
          "nice walk up to the fort. Really good views. Enjoyed wandering around looking out over the sea. Definitely worth the hike",
          "You have to go to miss this amazing scenery would be a disaster. It is stunning. The cafe is lovely for homemade cake and a coffee after your sightseeing",
          "This is maybe even a better experience than the Cliffs of Moher. The fort is literally on the edge of giant cliffs that you can walk right up to. On a pretty day you can see the mainland and it is spectacular to just sit and soak it all in. The walk up is a bit hardly than you",
          "Dun Aonghusa offered great views and was a worthwhile visit. There is a small visitor centre that you pass through and pay a fee(we has free entry as we stayed at Aran Glamping) and this visitor centre contains some information regarding the history of the site. It's a nice",
          "After having traveled to Ireland several times, we finally got around to visiting the Aran Islands (ok, well, just Inis M\u00f3r). There were four main objectives...renting bikes, hiking to the Worm Hole, going to the Black Fort and visiting D\u00fan Aonghasa. Happy to say we made three",
          "Indulge in a detour from Galway's mainland and take the ferry to Inis Mor. We found a fellow at the dock with a red cart and horse. He took us all around the island for a few hours- showing us all there is to see. We stopped at Dun Aonghusa and enjoyed the history and the view.",
          "Our first visit to D\u00fan Aonghasa was in 2011, on a day trip to Inis M\u00f3r. This was our second trip, and we stayed overnight on the island so we could visit longer this time. We rented bikes and rode to the ancient fort, parking our bikes in a bike park near the museum entrance.",
          "Superb site, but get there early before the tourists arrive - after that it's a drag - hike out to the Black Fort instead, you'll have it all to yourself",
          "If you are visiting Inishmore, you must visit Dun Aengus! The walk up is a little daunting on rocky steps, but I believe that most people can make this walk easily and it's worth the effort. I thought the fort was cool, but I was blown away by the views once inside the fort.",
          "The views from the top left me speechless!! The walk to the top isn't very long and it's definitely worth it!",
          "The walk up is not too long and the fort is dramatic with the long drop to the ocean. It was very windy when we were there.. definitely worth seeing.",
          "We visited Dun Aengus as part of a van tour of Inishmore. It was a spectacular site! The geology of the island is otherworldly. Pure rocky plains stretch along the cliffs. Seashells are embedded in the stone \"floors\". Apparently the cliffs were once under water which accounts",
          "Absolutely stunning place. Amazing scenery. The experience is beyond words. Very friendly and helpful staff at the museum.",
          "Amazing how this ancient fort has withstood the elements. The location right on the cliff face is a sight to see. You can get some fantastic pics of and from the fort. Interesting history and helpful staff to explain what they know about the fort.",
          "If you're visiting the Aran Islands, don't miss Dun Aonghasa. This pre-historic hill fort is of interest in and of itself. In addition has stunning views of the cliffs and the Atlantic.",
          "We were so pleased with the guide and her knowledge of this historical site. The views are beautiful. The walk would be strenuous for some, but it is certainly worth it.",
          "Part of the adventure is just getting there. From the visitor center the walk starts off gentle and smooth, but as you go there are more rocks on the path. The last 5 - 10 minutes of walking your walking up hill, strategizing which rocks will be the best place to put your",
          "This is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been. I would recommend renting a bike--the D\u00fan is ~30-minute ride from the pier, then a 10-15 minute walk up the rocks. The cliff is absolutely breathtaking--just the windy Atlantic and nothing else. The ride there and back is",
          "This is definitely worth the time and walk up to the top for the history and the amazing view. Recommend for everyone to do at least once.",
          "This is probably my favourite sight of all i've seen in Inis Mor. It's fairly off the track of the famous ones, but it's definitely worth biking over there. The view is simply stunning from the \"entrance\" to the Dun.",
          "The biggest reason I did a day trip to Inis Mor was to visit this fortress, which had been recommended by an Irish friend who knew I was interested in prehistoric Irish sites. I'm glad I had not realized in advance what a long slog it is from the entrance to the top; it had",
          "Stone age fort right on the edge of a shear cliff. It was kind of scary and made my knees buckle when I saw that you could walk right up to the edge of the cliff, obviously I got know where near it, not a good place for small children. But beyond that, it was breathtaking and",
          "We were staying overnight on the island so arrived around 2pm and had very few people at the fort when we were there. An OPW employee up at the fort had a New England Patriots hat on so we had to ask about it. Turned into at least a 45-60 minute conversation! It was great",

          "We took the low road along the coast past the seal colony. Great scenery. It took a good two hours to walk there so we caught the bus back.",
          "It's a good walk, and a climb (up a steep and uneven path) at the end, to get there, so not for the feeble or handicapped, but well worth it for those who are ready to go. Not to overstate it - there is a path the whole way, not like climbing a mountain, but the path gets",
          "Stunning. You absolutely must see this. We were lucky with the weather, as we had a clear, sunny day. I felt like it was the end of the world.",

          "Yes it\u2019s not an easy walk and yes it costs to go in. But the views are amazing. This can\u2019t be missed and judging by the number of bikes, horse carts, and tour busses it isn\u2019t missed. Just make sure you go to the facilities before you walk as there aren\u2019t any along the route. The",
          "We rode bikes to the fort and were not disappointed. The cliff was stunning! We rode back on the road going by the seal colony...that was a nice quick ride and much better than the southern road which had a lot of traffic.",
          "We had a lovely sunny day to hike up to the fort. We have a 2 and 4 year old. I would not recommend trying this if the weather isn't nice. It is a long hike up a rocky hill with uneven stones in place of actual steps. In the rain or nasty weather it would be quite treacherous.",
          "I travelled with my son, with a car from the hotel to Dun aonghasa on a pretty wet and windy day. The walk up is a little challenging, its not steep at all but you do have to be fairly nimble to negotiate the rocky, bumpy path and short areas of it are a little slippy. The",

          "Very interesting exhibit in the welcome house and the walk up led to fabulous views. A absolute muss-see on the island.",

          "Visiting Cill Mhuirbhigh is an unique experience. You climb a steep rocky hill to the top, the site of an ancient Celtic fortress. There are guides at the top for the purpose of explaining the history and architecture of the site. Copper was mined in the area and the warriors",
          "This site is an amazing place to see and to stand in. The skills needed to build it are tremendous. I was blown away by how hard the conditions must have been to live in this Fort at the time it was in use. It takes 20 minutes to walk up to it, you cannot cycle to it, you need",
          "We got a horse and trap from Kilronan, which dropped us at Kilmurvey village. After a lovely plate of beef and Guinness stew at Teach Nan Phaidi, we had a little look around the craft shops then headed up the road to Dun Aengus.As we were staying on the island, we got in free,",
          "Dun Aonghasa is a wonder that we could not believe existed or even built at the edge of the cliffs on the Aran island. The views from the site was breath taking and also terrifying considering the drop to the waters below. Be aware that it is a long hike from the ticket office",
          "The site is well worth a visit. We weren\u2019t prepared for the hike up (takes about 20 minutes one way), but the view was worth it. STUNNING! We did it with our toddler, and it was strenuous with him. Parents, don\u2019t even try to bring a stroller! Baby carriers would work but it\u2019s",
          "Don\u2019t miss to visit Dun Aonghasa when in Aran Island. You will amaze the view once you get there. 5 Euro for the adult , children, family and senior has discounted entrance fee.",
          "Dun Aonghasa was the high point of our trip to the Aran Islands, both literally and figuratively. It is not to be missed. It does take a little effort to get there but it is well worth it and then some. You first pass through a visitor center (there is a fee, \u20ac5 or 6 for adults",
          "This is a must. Just another great view from every direction! The views from the cliffs are incredible! The structure and history of this place is well worth learning. This is a great little walk to with your family and friends. Just make sure you have a camera because you will",
          "We were able to make it to Dun Aonghasa before the crowds. It was nice to enjoy the spot and take photos before the hoards of people arrived. The fort and cliff views are breathtaking. If you have a fear of heights beware but don't miss this unforgettable site.",
          "Even though it was a cloudy day we thought these were the most beautiful views in Ireland, and we have been sightseeing in this country for over a decade. If you are visiting the Aran Islands - do stop by!",
          "So far away and so beautiful. Its a climb and a half but the stunning views are more than worth it. Try and get there early so you can get the Daredevil cliff photo!!!",
          "Beautiful views. Really enjoyed it. Bus tour was repeatative the whole way round. Could have done with more time at the fort.",
          "Was not expecting this majestic view when taking the bus tour around the island. From the local basket maker on the hike up (bought a St Brigid's cross) to the view once you reach the top. Wear good shoes and take your time.",
          "We recently did a trip to this special place . The weather was perfect and the Aran Islands were at their 5 star glorious best . We had the misfortune of loosing a mobile phone /wallet at the visitors center at Dun Aonghasa. It contained a large sum of money , all our cards ,",

          "This is a must see if you are visiting Inis Mor.Set on top of a hill it hosts some of the most spectacular views that you will ever see.Breathtaking!",
          "Well worth the ferry, bike, and hike. Perched on the edge of Eurasia, the Bronze and Iron Age builders must have felt protected from attackers. What a site they found\u2014on cliffs 100 m above the Atlantic on three sides and rings of rock walls on the fourth. We biked to and from",
          "The hike is good, but the view at the top is unbelievable! I wouldn't recommend taking kids because there are no railings, but if you keep them from the edge it's alright. Breathtaking views that the camera can't 100% capture, but it can get pretty close. You do have to pay 14",
          "Went there for a day trip from Doolin by ferry, hired bicycle when I arrived and was cycling to Dun Aonghasa, weather wasn't great was drizzle and bit windy most of the journey but I enjoyed because was authentic. When arrived had to pay \u20ac5 to get in but that was fine, it took",

          "What an incredible spot! It IS a climb, but not too steep.....just keeps going for a bit. Once up there, it's the views that make this place so amazing! The dramatic, steep cliff drops straight down to the water. This is the view I always hoped I'd get to see in Ireland. We",
          "Bit of a walk up from the visitor centre but well worth it. We cycled up by 10am and had the place to ourselves!",
          "Stunning views, terrifying cliff, great history! This is a must see. If you visit Ireland this should be on your top five spots to see.",
          "This place is super busy with day trippers between 11-3 pm. If you can go outside these hours its probably a little more serene. But its still amazing and one of the best preserved forts we have seen. People right on the edge of the cliff to get a good photo scared me - so",
          "I was able to spend only a few hours on Inis Mor but what a wonderful place it was. Especially on a nice sunny day (which I gather is not so common here) I really wanted to sit there at the top of Dun Aonghasa and look out into the Atlantic for the whole day. Watching the waves",
          "Rode my bicycle there from B&B. Stunning views. UPhill walk from visitor center. No rail, fencing & few warning signs. I get it now when it is said that \u201cThe Irish believe in natural selection not litigation. Tons of history at the site. Nice beach nearby.",
          "Well worth a visit. Spectacular views and great food nearby. Bit of a walk from the visitors center and may not be suitable for people with restricted mobility. Expect about 20 mins walk each way but we\u2019ll worth it.",
          "Well worth a visit - great history within. If you check in advance you might get a guided tour by one of the site guides",
          "This incredible, and incredibly old fort stands on the edge of a cliff. I don't think anyone is 100% sure what it was used for. Its an odd place to build a protective fort-- some people think it was a site for religious and spiritual rituals. Its a long, bumpy walk, and will be",
          "Definitely worth the walk and you have plenty of time to get there. Beautiful flowers and stone droppings to see along the way. A little climbing might be in order but nothing drastic. View is awesome! The day we went we got caught in a small shower. Just made some of the rocks",
          "this is not for young children. It is cliffs with NO protection. But the view and the history. We were there on a beautiful day and it is the cliffs of Moher but with any safety. One has to ask why would one build this major fort here. It is not an easy place to get to or to",
          "1K walk from the visitors center a good workout but quite manageable, though care should be taken further up if it is raining, as the rounded rocks there can be slippery. Inside, the multi-ringed stone wall interior and 100M high cliffs (no guardrails, take care) are impressive",
          "You wouldn't know it looking up from below, but somebody did a great job grading the path up to Dun Aenghus. It's a steady walk to a series of offset openings that gives way to a series of stone semi-circles constructed at the edge of cliffs tht rival The Cliffs of Moher. Don't",
          "We were impressed at the history and age of this landmark. The walk from the visitor center was surprisingly longer than anticipated, but we walked through beautiful green fields with grazing cattle. The rocks leading up to the fort were slippery from the rain, but the view",
          "After cycling to the foot of Dun Aonghaus which has a small ice cream shop that you really should stop in and have an ice cream at as it was fabulous and charged ordinary prices not the astronomical one I was expecting there was A 1km walk which for the most part was ok but the",
          "It\u2019s a hike to the top, and the last 30ft or so are a little challenging, but once you are at the top the views are spectacular! A must see if you visit Inishmore!",
          "A bit of a hike, which can be slippery when it\u2019s damp, so wear good shoes. Hang on to the kids. No barrier at the edge of the cliff!",
          "amazing view at the top at this superb ancient site perched on the top of the hill, on the edge of the cliffs looking out across the Atlantic. The entrance charge helps keep up of the museum and the ancient monument, and was only 4 euros for seniors. Sturdy shoes and walking",
          "Stunning views of a treacherous cliff drop into the ocean, and inspiring ruins left over from centuries ago. One of the best things about it is getting here. I biked and loved getting an up close and personal view of the island and the farm animals along the way.",
          "I was there on the June bank holiday and it was packed but a great spot to sit down and have a picnic. By David aged 10",
          "We road our bikes and climbed the hill to get to the ancient ruins and we were glad we did. There are easier ways to get to the entry but there is still a 20 minute climb to the top. I also recommend the bike ride as you are able to stop along the way and get some beautiful",
          "Inis Mor is a fab island - either as a day trip or a short stay. If the weather is good, it's fab to cycle the island and explore the many historical and natural attractions.",
          "My husband and I did as many do - take the morning ferry (10:30 am, Aran Island Ferries from Ros a Mil), rent a bike (Aran Bike Hire), ride the island and return on the latest ferry (5:00 pm). It is not a long time on the island. If looking to \"do the whole island\" stay a night,",
          "We took the ferry over, rented bicycles and biked out to Dun Aonghasa. We took the hill route there (steep up and a fun downhill) and the coastal route back. It took about 25-30 minutes going there and much shorter coming back. The island and the views were absolutely",
          "We visited this fort as part of a tour with Faherty Tours (which I also highly recommend). The entrance is cheap \u20ac5 and the hike is short but challenging enough. Well worth the little climb to the top to see this ancient fort over looking the ocean. Beautiful views although",
          "The cycle there, the views when you get there! Everything is just so beautiful! Awe inspiring experience!",
          "We hired bikes from our b&b and cycled there. It took us about 20 minutes. We went the coast road there which had less hills and took the main road back which was mostly down hill. It was about a 15 minute walk from the information center at the bottom too the fort at the top.",
          "I can say this hike was one of the best we had in the country and we\u2019ve been all over. Plan on spending several hours there listening to the crashing waves. It\u2019s truly a special place. Try and go early or Late to avoid the ferry traffic. The pictures speak for themself!",
          "A group of us walked up to the top pf the mountain. It is a strenuous walk, but well worth it. Everything around is stunning, and the view off the cliffs at the top were amazing. Bring rain gear - it can start raining with no notice. Had a lovely day here.",
          "After a hike up the hill and over all the rocks you are rewarded with a view that is second to none. You can look up the coast all the way to Norway or down Inishmaan Island. You sit on the edge of 4 hundred foot cliff surrounded by a Prehistoric,stone wall fortification and you",
          "Very disappointed in the Inism\u00f3r Island. You pay to get over on the ferry, which in our case was \u20ac45. Then you pay \u20ac20 to rent bikes. After peddling up & down hills you come to D\u00fan Aonghasa to see the cliffs and the wormhole only to discover that you have to pay \u20ac5 per person.",
          "We visited during a day trip of Inis Mor. We did the Pony & Trap with Patrick Hernon (I looked to put a review for him, but he does not seem to have a listing here). Great way to tour the island. The cost was well within my budget and a bonus to have a charming island native",
          "Highlight of our trip to Aran. Rode our bikes out here after 6 pm so had the place virtually to ourselves. Great views from all sides.",
          "When visiting Ireland this spot was quite a surprise. Had no idea it was going to be so Breathtaking!!! To me it was even better than the Cliffs!! Amazing site and not so touristy!! Worth the climb!! A must see!!!",
          "Climbed Dun Aonghasa on the hottest day of the year. Tough climb not suitable for anyone not steady on their feet. BUT the view from the top is absolutely fantastic.",
          "Great historical site and amazing views. I recommend staying the night on the island so you have enough time to take in the views here. Just sit near the cliffs and hear the waves crash against the walls. Also talk to the friendly staff on hand to give you the historical",
          "Great place to see and understand history! Very interesting. Make most of the knowledgable guides and ask lots of questions ;)!",
          "This place was so beautiful! A really good hike to get there. But some great picture taking! Nice lawn you can make a picnic and just relax and enjoy the view",
          "It was a wet, cold and windy day when we visited and this should not deter anyone from visiting. A remarkable site and construction perched on a cling overlooking the sea: it should be noted there is no safety fencing so if it is windy, care should be taken if approaching the",
          "Even for us locals, D\u00fan Aonghasa remains an amazing place to visit. The vastness of the Atlantic Ocean stretches into infinity before you and this strategic fort provides an incredible backdrop. Multiple theories abound as regards the true purpose of the fort but constructing",
          "Worth visiting. There is a walk up to it which can be a little sloppy depending on the weather so ensure you have good footwear. Be careful with children as this is built on the side of a cliff!",
          "A must see on a visit to Inis Mor. Walking boots and warm clothes advised. If you arrive in the island without cap and gloves the place to buy is the SPAR supermarket and not the Aran knit shops which are exorbitant! And a rip off.for tourist. Advisable to use a bike to",
          "They aren't the cliffs of Moher, but they are stunning in their own right. On a clear day when the sun hit's the water, it's breathtaking.",
          "The island itself is class, a really nice way to spend a day is cycling around them, the dun is the highlight! Really cool and steeped in history. Don't look down but definitely do!",
          "Absolutely breath taking. Must wear comfortable shoes. The hike up is not as bad as it looks. It is well worth the hike.",
          "Views rivaled Cliffs of Moher, but not as tall. Rode bikes out to the ruins and then walked around for an hour. Great pics. Worth the effort to ferry over. Could do it in one day, we got a B&B.",
          "The veiws are so worth the wait, just make sure you have good shoes on because it is a long walk and super slippery when it rains. Basically all you see is the farming area, the way the walls were set up, and a beautiful view of the sea and cliffs. The view is so worth the walk.",
          "If I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times. One of my favorite things about Ireland is the amount of personal responsibility the Irish put on visitors. I'll explain... The walk up to Dun Aonghasa starts at the visitor's center. There's a fee to enter, and there are",
          "Definitely enjoyed our time here. We had it all to ourselves! We took the plane over to the island and enjoyed a nice bike ride to Don Aonghasa! Beautiful!",
          "The Aran Islands, and Inis Mor in particular, are a must. Dun Aengus is the jewel in their crown. Take a horse and cart tour to the fort. Ask for Patrick and Gracie, if you can.",
          "Beautiful walk to the wormhole & then up to the fort. Wear sturdy shoes & bring a jacket - it was brisk up by the cliff in March!",
          "Visited with family in Aug 17. Trecked from the Serpents Liar - has to be seen also!!- to Dun Aonghasa and it's a fantastic walk. Not for anyone with walking difficulties but well worth the effort. Only about a 20 mins trek. The un- polluted air of the Aran Islands is something",
          "Breathtaking scenes. It was very windy when we went, but was a great experience. The sights were amazing and the landscape is very beautiful, I would go again but dress warmly.",
          "I very much enjoyed the hike up to Dun Aonghasa and the views looking out over the ocean. A bit nervous about the heights, I was quickly appeased at the sight of a park ranger (?) who kindly chatted with me for a while about the fort. Probably the most magical part of the visit",
          "Dun Aenghus is a wonderful place. I've been a couple if times now and just cannot over emphasise here in words how awesomely majestic it is. It is an amazing place, easily reachable from Kilronan if you rent a bike. It's a lovely cycle out as long as you get the weather! It is",
          "Inis Mohr of the Aran Islands is stunning. We planned our wedding vow renewal on the island and had the most wonderful ceremony surrounded by rustic and rural beauty. After our ceremony we took a pony and trap ride to Dun Aonghasa Museum. Our kids took the hike up to the fort",

          "Dun Aonghasa, on the island of Inishmore in the Aran Islands, is a fabulously preserved prehistoric stone fort perched on the edge of a precipitous cliff with the wild Atlantic surging below. Very dramatic! It has massive concentric stone walls ten feet high and you can go right",

          "We took a bus tour of Inis Mor, with the 2,000-year-old Dun Aonghasa as the highlight. In fact, if I could do it again, I would skip the island tour and head directly for the fort -- and spend more time there. The views are incredible. I actually enjoyed the views here better",
          "For such a vast structure to still be as intact as it is after such a long time is astounding. The stone work is truly impressive and the clifftop location provides some breathtaking vistas. There is a small charge to enter at the bottom of the hill although our Ferry ticket",

          "We had a wet and windy day on Innis Mor but were determined to see the top of Dun Aonghasa. The site is amazing from a historical perspective and definitely a stomach turner if you're prone to vertigo! Be aware there are no safety gates or railings; it's your own common sense",
          "The fort is in a lovely location,Such a masterpiece of it's time.A long uphill trek too will keep everyone fit.",
          "Worth the trek for the beautiful views. You pay in, there's a cafe and a few shops also. Best way to get there is by bike, a lovely cycle from the village where you can rent lots of different kinds of bikes.",

          "The fort is an experience. The walk up is long, sometimes rocky/uneven and sort of steep at points. The hike back has one section of uneven rocky stairs that can be tricky for those unsteady. Once there you can imagine the futility of attacking this place. Uphill, stone",
          "A definite highlight of our trip to Inis Mor. Dun Aonghasa is truly amazing and spectacular. Unfortunately we were there on a misty and rainy day and missed the views however it was just amazing to walk around this amazing Fort built so long ago. Highly recommend a visit!",
          "We visited Don Aonghasa as part of an island bus tour. We paid 15 euros each for a tour of around 3 hours. This was the highlight. The main fortifications consisted of a number of rock walls and fenced in areas which I suppose left the invaders very vulnerable to the archers",
          "You need to take a 45\" ferry ride and hire a van, horse cart or ride a bike to get there and back but it was a one-of-a-kind experience. You walk a somtimes steep path for about 3/4 mile and arrive at the top of a cliff at a 3000 year old rock walled fortress. The views are",
          "We were lucky to visit on a sunny afternoon. The light made the views of the oceans and cliffs even more beautiful. It\u00b4s a truly impressive sight, totally worth the 20 minute walk. It really makes one go back in time and image this place hundreds of years ago. Suggestion: the",

          "After a long walk up from the Wormhole, we visited Dun Aengus. Just the view from the edge of this cliff is worth the trip, but one has to appreciate the amount of time and effort that was put into building this awesome fort! A must visit!",

          "What a breathtaking view from such a mystical and intriguing sitethat is easily accessible despite its remote location.",
          "Well worth the walk to the top but the walkway gets quite steep toward the top and is totally inaccessible with a buggy or a wheelchair. Please don't be put off but the pathway/steps do not have any handrails so time and caution is needed when going to the top. I am reasonable",
          "We cycled out to the site in about 1./2 an hour on the low road. We then walked up in about 15 minutes from the site centre. Toilets and food, tourist shops at the base. Magnificent views. Dangerous cliffs. Amazing place. Everybody is stunned by the place.",
          "Hard to imagine what danger prompted the building and maintenance of this fort for over a thousand years. The climb is at times steep and rocky, but doable in about 20 minutes for a granny like me. On a clear day you can probably see 80-100 miles. And the cliffs are",

          "The hike up to the fort is not that long, but there are sections toward the end that are very rocky and even slippery from worn rocks. I would recommend hiking shoes. It's a pleasant climb, however, with the fort as a reward. If you're afraid of heights, you won't want to go",

          "Great sunny day out. It's a lovely gentle climb. The views are fantastic. Would highly recommend this outing.",
          "This is well worth the 20 minutes hike to the fort. Once there you will see breathtaking views of the cliff and see the waves crashing onto the cliffside. The fort is a lot bigger and fairly intact than some of the other prehistoric forts on Ireland.",

          "Its a lovely trek up to this pile of stones, an old Ring Fort, i often wondered about the whole point of these as surely any descending army would have said, \"Why don't we go around the other side of the island cos theres a ring fort on this side \" - perhaps as most times",
          "The only way to get to this Iron Age fort is to walk about a mile from the main road. While not a problem for younger members of our group, it was a challenge for those with mobility limitations. For the rest of us frequent stops along the gravel and dirt path allowed us the",

          "Hard to believe the structure is 3000 years old. I left asking how was the fort built, who built it, what nationality did it protect? The cliffs are fully exposed without railings; one can see for miles and miles on a clear day. The entire scenery made for a very contemplative",

          "This was one of the most breathtaking sights I've ever seen in real life. The prehistoric fort is something to behold, but my favourite part was the view of the sea and cliffs. (I was fortunate to have been there on a pleasant, sunny day.) Unlike the Cliffs of Moher, there are",

          "I have done a bit of travelling, seen a lot of attractions but this is by the far the best thing I have ever seen, it is like walking upto the of the end of the world. Cannot recommend this place highly enough. Will need decent shoes, some water and a great camera, slight trek",
          "Regardless of how u are travelling around the island it is a 20 minute climb up to the fort. The terrain is quite rough especially for younger kids but it is worth it. Lovely spot for picnic and views are spectacular especially if you are brave enough to go out to the edge!!",

          "Our day on Innis Mor was easily one of the highlights of our trip. Our group of six cycled across the island and spent a good deal of time hiking around Dun Aonghasa and the surrounding countryside - include the Wormhole. The views are absolutely breathtaking! If you have the",
          "Dun Aonghasa has amazing views and is a peaceful if normally windswept destination. Views over the cliffs are awesome. Grass and stones are a great setting for groups or couples or individuals to sit and soak up history and to contemplate the meaning of it all.",
          "Our tour driver, Gerald, dropped us here so we could spend more time exploring. It's about a 20 minute walk up from the parking area (gentle incline) and on a clear day, the views of the cliffs are gorgeous. Also, if you're looking for an authentic Aran sweater or cap, visit the",
          "I have been here several times. I can't get enough of it. The whole island of Inis M\u00f3r (and Inis Me\u00e1in and Inis O\u00edrr) is a wonderful place to wander around. You'll never get bored. D\u00fan Aonghusa is the most famous of the sites on Inis M\u00f3r island. It is well worth the walk up to",
          "The first day we were on the Island we attempted to bike to Dun Aonghasa along the coast. But we had already been biking extensively on other parts of the island so we were worn out. So we ended up turning around and going back to the hotel. The following morning we rented a",
          "Reachable by walking from Kilronan, I recommend most should take one of the many buses available at the Kilronan docks (about 15 Euro per person for a tour of the entire island). After arriving, pay your entry fee at the visitors center then walk up a hill to the fort itself.",
          "Not a difficult climb, manageable for people who are unfit. Lovely views when you get to the top. Tour guide on site to give extra info.",
          "Truly enjoyed this more than Cliffs of Moher. Great walk and view of cliffs. Saw a few seals in the distance. A must we for the cliffs and the stone walls.",
          "The views, the air, the magic is undeniably there. Each footstep leads to new discovery exciting every sense. Touch, smell, feel, listen, look and you will not be disappointed. We took bikes around the island and walked the trails to ancient ruins that allow your imagination to",
          "I first visited Dun Aonghasa in 1996 before the heritage center was put up, but I think the addition is important. There's a brief display about the history and culture of the area and then you're on your own to explore. Don't get too near the cliff edge and beware the wind,",
          "Lovely time on the cliff top. The little museum has much to say and the walk is easy. The cafe nearby is absolutely the best.",
          "One of the most impressive forts, yet also the most crowded destination on the island, so it is a little busy and touristy. There is a great opportunity, however to test your daring and fear of heights as there is no fence separating you from the cliffs and hundreds of feet",
          "It was mid February when we went and it was quiet, so we had the whole place to ourselves. We sat and watched the sunset from the top of the cliff. The views were stunning.",
          "Dun Aonghasa is a well-preserved piece of history with a great view of the surrounding area. Getting to the fort is easy because you can take either a hop-on hop-off tourist van or, like myself, rent a bicycle and pedal the 30-minute trip there. There's bike parking outside the",
          "Been here three times and it's very cool. If you like history or archeology or scenery, you don't want to miss. Not great for small kids because the climb is pretty steep and the (unprotected) cliff is very, very high. I would say maybe ~12 yrs would be fine. Beautiful,",
          "Great way to see the island. Pack your walking shoes. Approx 15min walk from the base. My second time here.",
          "Steeped in a fascinating history please visit here.. it's stunning views make the fresh walk so worth while .. bring cameras as you will want to remember every second of this visit",
          "Nice moderate hike to what feels like the top of the world. Truly not to be missed while on the island. Great place for pics, as you can see all around for miles.",
          "On discovering that I'm a travel agent the ladies at recpcetion offered so much help. They are professional and friendly, they knew Gabriel from Aran Goat cheese who dropped me off here. All I feel I should say is that this place for me was a spiritual journey. Its presence",
          "Dun Angus is on the far side of the island from where you disembark the ferry, so there's also a lovely chance to appreciate the scenery of this beautiful island. You can take a car, walk, or bike to the fort, we took the bikes and highly recommend it. On the way back we were",
          "We rented bikes and hiked our way to these beautiful ruins. We then decided to have a picnic lunch on the grounds. The view was stunning. Worth the trip for sure!",
          "Dun Aonghasa is beautiful. It is amazing by itself, before you add the amazing views of the island, and before the amazing cliffs that it hangs over. There is about a 20ish minute hike to the Ring Fort from the entrance (\u20ac5 fee), where you come to a field outside the fort that",
          "While the fort may be the attraction, the interpretive center has a wealth of information about the people who built and lived at the fort. Well worth the entrance price. I was lucky to go on a cloudless November day. Since it was the off season, I was the only one at the",
          "The walk to the fortress was not very difficult, but there was a bit of a climb. The rocks on the path were slippery after the morning's rain shower, especially on the return walk. Sturdy walking shoes helped with my footing. There are no fences along the cliff so one must take",
          "We took the ferry over from Galway City. We took a van tour of the island with the first stop being Dun Aengus. After checking in at the visitor center you have about a mile to walk up to the fort. You should have decent walking shoes as much of the pathway is stones. At the",
          "visited this fort just before the centre closed - it was pretty amazing because myself, my fiance and my parent's were the only ones there! It is quite a walk in, so make sure you have good shoes. the cliff's edge is not fenced - so please, use your head and don't go to close -",
          "Proper footwear is a must! This trail is rustic, to say the least, unlike so many groomed \"tourist trails\" this is not one of them. A long walk, with differing pitches and surfaces, but it is so worth the time and energy! This view rivals that of the Cliffs of Moher, and because",
          "It was raining cats and dogs, but that didn't stop us and glad it didn't. Very interesting and the information Center at the site is most informative. Make sure to stop in the cafe across the road for some delicious pastries or even a meal before heading back! Local craft",
          "Worth the short hike it takes to reach this amazing landmark. You can walk right up to the cliffs edge, so watch out for the wind, but the view from anywhere is stunning, not to mention the history!",
          "Looks a bit of a walk up to it, but well worth it. The views are stunning, but be careful if you have young children, they can be inquisitive and there's no protection from the cliffs.",
          "Totally worth the entrance fee! I was in awe! Just amazing. The cliffs are breath taking and the history very interesting. A short steep hike but 100% worth the effort",
          "Visited this beautiful fort in the late afternoon and spent an hour there admiring the views and the sound of the powerful crashing waves beneath and along the coastal cliffs nearby. For a long time I had always dreamed of visiting and this visit exceeded my expectations! A must",
          "On a clear day this is one of the most awe-inspiring views in Ireland. Bring a packed lunch with you and eat it in the grounds of the fort because there are no eating facilities on site. If there is a guide present don't hesitate to ask them for further information about the",
          "We just returned from two weeks in Ireland. We drove West from Dublin as I wanted to visit the West coast, in particular. Our first stop was Inis Mor, Aran Islands. We toured the island by pony cart with Patrick and his horse, Grace, which took us to Dun Aonghasa by way of the",
          "For those who walk a lot, this is a pretty easy hike and climb. A little rougher at the top. It's worth it, if you are up for it! I'm 70 and it didn't do me in. Bronze age fort still has some walls intact.",
          "One of the Best places in Ireland! We did the half of the famous Wild Atlantic Way, and this destination has became my favourite one! Simply Stunning! I found it much better than the Cliffs of Moher what is amazing as well!",
          "Had wanted to visit Dun Aonghasa for years, and was beginning to wonder if I had waited too long (age 73). But the upward path from the Heritage Center starts gently and and continues gradually for most of the way. Last few yards are a bit challenging, but with a good walking",
          "Dun Aonghasa (pronunciation: Dan Aengus) is a Bronze Age fort in use until the Middle Ages. All this history is clearly visible and it creates an intense experience once you arrive on top of the hill where the fort was built. At the bottom of the hill, where the visit starts, it",
          "Absolutely amazing scenery cliffs are beautiful and the walk up to Dun Aonghasa was really enjoyable ,great day was had by all.",
          "It looks like a huge circle of rocks but the images it conjures of past centuries, invasions from the Vikings, explosive storms, makes the place magical.",
          "We biked there from town in a light rain. It was tough going up hill but we managed. It was nice being on our own schedule and not having to watch the clock.",
          "This is one of the reasons for coming to InshMore. Do read all the information in the visitor centre before you walk up there, otherwise it does not make much sense. It is 600m walk uphill, the last bit being quite rough so be prepared. The site itself is impressive, but one has",
          "My two sons and I got our bikes just as we got off the boat and took the \"high\" road towards Dun Aonghasa. Along the way the boys really wanted to see the Worm Hole. It's not to easy to find. Along the road there is a small stone obelisk. Make a left off the main road there",
          "The day we visited it was wet and windy and we were unsure if we'd bother making the hike up but we said we'd come this far we'll go the rest and it was the best decision we made. The walk up is a bit bumpy for elderly people but the views as you enter the fort are amazing. If",
          "We parked our bikes and made the trek to Dun Aonghasa. It was a wet day and it was quite slippy underfoot so I wouldn't recommend it if you're not steady on your feet. The views of the cliffs and ocean were great, even though it wasn't a very clear day. We enjoyed looking",
          "Moderate hike up a gravel and rocky path to top. Once you get to the top, there are too many beautiful viewpoints to count. The hike can take as long or as short as you want. Highly recommend making this one of your stops.",
          "Headed up with walking boots on easy enough climb and stunning views. Feeling of being at the edge of the earth and truly peaceful.",
          "It is a wonderful experience to hike into this fort; it is about a 20 minute walk to the top but well worth the time and effort. You are rewarded with beautiful views and dramatic scenery in every direction; a truly memorable landscape.",
          "This is a must see on Inis Mor. It is a prehistoric fort on the edge of a 3,000 foot cliff. No guard rails. The most beautiful views you can imagine, even with the less than perfect weather we had. A bit of a climb, so keep that in mind. Would not have missed it.",
          "It's just a must if you visit the island. It's so worth the cycle or drive to it and then the walk up to the top. They have a visitor centre at the base, where you park your car and or bike. Then it's a good 20 minute walk up. But the views are simply awesome.",
          "A stunning walk finished with a stunning view. Amazing fort. Lovely tea rooms at the bottom of the hill.",
          "I was at dun aonghasa a long time ago and remembered how spectacular the view was so we made the climb again!! My memory did not fail me. This has to be seen to be believed. Just be very careful going close to the cliffs edge as there is a very steep drop!!",
          "Everytime I'm in Galway, I set off to visit this Island. Mostly to make a tour by cart driven by Paddy and his horse (used to be Brwny but she can't be alive anymore I think) or Mr O'Tolle and his minibus when it's to rainy and rather cold. Once at Dun Aonghus I looked down the",
          "Visited the dun with friends in July weather turned out terrible but a local young man brought us there on pony and trap and waited while we toured up the dun, it's unreal scenic views across to cliffs of moher, was really relaxed. There was cabin on dun after we found out there",
          "This is a great place to visit with lots of ancient history. The walk or should I say climb to the fort is quite difficult but worth it for the view.",
          "A bit of a hike to get up to the fort but the views are spectacular and breath taking. The fort is in the middle of the island so either a tour or bike ride to get there.",
          "It's a long walk to the top, but boy oh boy is it fantastic to see. For the most part it's an easy walk, but there are a few spots along the way that are rocky and a good climb. The views are spectacular. My wife has had two hips replaced and she made it up and down and was",
          "This is just gorgeous. There are many beautiful sights in Ireland, but this ranks high. The walk up is long and has some uneven steps, so beware if you have any mobility issues. The signs all say that I takes 20 mins to walk up and I wish I had taken note of our time. It",
          "This is a 20 minute hike up to a beautiful vista. The views are breathtaking, make sure to allow time for this when you visit the island.",
          "Excellent example of a prehistoric fort. Scary high to look down with no barriers. Beautiful and exciting. Quite a walk to get to the top, the last part is tough with rocks and steps but well worth the climb. The cliffs are stunning.",
          "The fort Dun Aonghasa was gorgeous if you dared to get to the edge which isn't barricaded or bombarded with hoardes of tourists like the Cliffs of Moher. The height may not be as grand in numbers, but the turqouise water and waves crashing against the cliffs here were stunning,",
          "If you're going to Inishmore, I'd assume you are coming to see the hill fort! It had rained yesterday pretty heavily, so part of the pathway was flooded outside the ring fort's welcome center. Since the pathway was flooded several inches deep, there was no charge. But, for",
          "What can I saw it's a fort on the edge of the world. Sensational views. Tough hike if your not used to walking. Lovely cycle out there and back. Don't bother with bus if you are fit and able. Bring a packed lunch. Coffee at the cottage or even better something sweet.",
          "Fair hike up to fort, but it is on a hill after all. Being on the Aran Islands, which are an attraction intheir own right, it was crowded and I had to wait for an opportunity to take a photo. Spectacular unfenced sheer drops to the ocean for the thrill seekers.",
          "I may be slightly biased since this is where I got engaged, but the Dun Aonghasa ring fort is amazingly beautiful. It's up on the cliffs and the wind is strong, so we crawled out on our knees to look over the edge. It's a small hike up to the fort, but well worth it. One of the",
          "What a wonderful surprise. We had seen the Cliffs of Mor a few years ago but battled the crowds to get there. Here at Dun Aonghasa, the view is lovely and the crowds much more manageable. There is a walk and climb which might be a challenge to some but well worth it. People with",
          "As with Cliffs of Moher, the views are simply stunning. The walk up is invigorating and pretty easy until just before the fort. At that point, you have to watch where you're stepping and be aware of others. Once you're inside the fort area, the walking isn't as treacherous. If",
          "We arrived before any other tourist showed up and were able to see the fort by ourselves. It is a short hike to the fort itself from the visitor center. They do not mark the cliffs at the fort so watch your step and kids if they are running around.",
          "This is the main attraction at Innishmore, and make sure you have your walking shoes! There aren't guard rails or railings, so be careful along the way up and down the path and at the top. It is a beautifully barren site, with wonderful views. Very windy, so sweaters are",
          "Nothing much to say but Just Go Here and see for yourself, words only ruin the views this place has. There is a bit of a trek up to it and it is rugged but worth it also one word of caution it is at the edge of an open cliff, parents should keep a close eye on kids.",
          "Super views, super windy. A bit of a hike from the visitor center -- wear good shoes. There's an entrance fee.",
          "Brilliant setting on the side of the cliffs - be sure to get your pic taken hanging over the cliff edge!!! A lot of history and staff/guides more than happy to tell you all. Not really access able for disabled guite a climb over uneven surfaces.",
          "long walk up to the edge but well worth it as the scenes from the cliffs were beautiful. suitable for all ages however the walk uphill is quite challenging for some older people.",

          "We visited Aron Island and were blown away with it's natural beauty. It was a step back in time when you saw the small houses overlooking the ocean. It would be a dream to live here for a month or two. Although the biking was a bit scary with the cars and trucks it was well",
          "Definately makes the trip worth while. altho Flying out and in on the same day seems like a better option than the ferry ride.",
          "The fort is a testament to the intelligence and ingenuity of the people who built it. However, the winds can be strong, don't go too close to the edge or you will freak out your family!",
          "Very impressive views. But be careful with kids - the cliffs have no fence and there is no warnings. Very dangerous for little ones running around.",
          "This fort requires a bit of a walk up the hill after you pay your admission, but we saw several people walking in sandals and I was in Tevas. No hiking boots required. The views were amazing, but there was a pretty big crowd there. There is another ancient fort on the island",
          "A great wild place , open cliffs , don't go too near , amazing view and the restaurant at the bottom is wondeful , great food excellent scon with tea A must on this wild island",
          "You can't come yo the island without going yo the first. However, the black fort should not be missed. The cliff views are stunning and only a handful of tourists. Try to go back the way you go though as its easy to loose your bearings a bit.. There's no marked paths do you need",
          "An informative experience where the incredible views of the cliffs are the best experience. The price of admission is less than that of the Cliffs of Moher and the view of the cliffs and Inishmor coastline is so much more amazing and intimate.",
          "To access the grounds, you go through an overcrowded information building, which we skipped because of the crowd! The hike to the fort is not wheelchair or stroller accessible and a few seemed to be exerted by the walk. The site is very impressive. We asked questions to one of",
          "Grand walk up to the top where the fort remains are. You would think it should be really windy up there but was actually quite calm. Breathtaking views off the top of the fort but braving it to the edge is not for the faint of heart. Top tip which we found out after we left. If",
          "This is one heck of a climb but well worth it and you can take your time. If you're on a regimented tour, don't bother,because you'll not have the time to experience the vista. If you've hired a pony and trap then take your time and enjoy the incredible vistas and history, your",

          "Dun Aonghasa is not only well preserved, but it has a splendid location, on the highest cliff of Aran and with a great view over the Atlantic. Inishmore is a busy island, but we visited it when it just opened and where the only ones there, which made the experience even better.",
          "We visited this site while on vacation and I want to be honest and let reviewers know that while my kids were able to make the climb, I was not. Even if it wasn't a pelting rain kind of day, the end of the climb would have been too much for my bad knees to handle...a point that",

          "Back in time to our past well worth the visit not advised if you not fit The walk up is slippery and steep. The tour guide are so helpful and charming",
          "Amazing cliff. I can't believe they don't have it blocked off with a fence or anything!! You could easily fall right off. It is so beautiful and amazing to sit on the edge. I am so afraid of heights but I faced my fear and sat on the ledge and I felt so alive!! Would not bring",
          "I chose to go to Inishmore because my daughter and I were on a cycling trip. The other two of the Aran Islands aren't really big enough for cycling, so here we were. The bike ride--out of which Josie opted; she had gone horseback riding earlier--there along the island's East",

          "You can't miss a trip to Dun Aonghasa when visiting the Aran Islands. We have walked to the summit many times and never fail to be in awe of the cliffs and the remnants of the prehistoric fort. Plan your trip and try and visit on a clear day and you will not be disappointed.",
          "Need to have good mobility to reach this awe inspiring destination - one of the jewels in the Aran Island's crown. Worthy of a visit but, a bit overrated for my liking and busy. Yes the cliffs were amazing with their sheer drop unhindered by any form of barrier (too scary for",

          "Worth a visit if your nerves dont mind groups of children hanging out of cliffs or climbing stone-walls... Nice walk , not to recommend if you're disabled, a bit steep and rocky to get there. If you prefer to stay in the coffee-shop that is also a good choice; everything",
          "We rode bikes over to this ruin fort and it was spectacular. A good hike up to it but the views at the top were just awesome. Stay AWAY from the edge though! No railing and it's a big cliff drop.",
          "Chartered a small plane for our group out to the island. It's a quick 10 minute ride. We rented bikes and took the low road up to the fort, grabbed some refreshments and biked the high road back. It's a long day, full of exercise to do the 10 mile bike route and the mile",
          "We planned a day trip to Inis Mor just to go see this site and even with bad weather we were happy. The size of this is impressive, let alone how old it is. There were a fair amount of people here, so it could be a bit crowded on the path. But the views from the fort are",
          "We were taken there by horse cart a little before the crowds arrived. It is somewhat of a steep and rocky climb but worth the effort. We were lucky enough to go on a beautiful day and the views were fantastic. There are small gift shops and a snack area outside the",

          "Dun Aonghasa and the entire island are spectacular! The views from the top are exquisite and it's a thrilling feeling to look over the edge of the cliff. It's best experienced on a nice day, especially when you can rent bikes and visit the island that way!",
          "Amazing place, stunning views, cliff edge not for the faint hearted! Peaceful.definitely worth a visit",

          "There is a short, steep hike to the top of the fort. Once there, little remains of the fort itself. The views at the edge are incredible. I would not bring small children or pets here, as they could not resist peaking over the edge like everyone else."

If it's nice out rent a bike and go, if it's not nice out, rent a bike if you can handle it, if you can't, take a tour with a local van and you'll have a blast either way. I've done both.

          "Nice little boat cruise--- good commentary on the river. Note this is not the Seine in Paris or anything, but the scenery was nice. The thing that was great was Roisin who showed how to make the perfect Irish Coffee (she should have done so at the beginning of the cruise-",
          "We went with a group and it was a relaxing time and the show (how to make Irish coffee and do Irish dancing) was great, but it could easily have been shortened in time. We went out and then turned around and there were not a lot of sights on the trip that you need to see twice",

        "wiki": "Connemara National Park (Irish: P\u00e1irc Naisi\u00fanta Chonamara) is one of six national parks in Ireland that are managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. It is located in the west of Ireland within County Galway.\n\n\n== History ==\nConnemara National Park was founded and opened to the public in 1980. It features 2,000 hectares of mountains, bogs, heaths, grasslands and forests. The entrance is situated on the Clifden side of Letterfrack. There are many remnants of human habitation within the park. There is a 19th-century graveyard as well as 4,000-year-old megalithic court tombs. Much of the land was once part of the Kylemore Abbey estate.\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\n\nWestern blanket bog and heathland are the most common vegetation of Connemara National Park. The boglands are situated in the wet low lying environments whereas the blanket bog exists within the drier mountain atmosphere. Purple moorgrass is the most bountiful plant, creating colorful landscapes throughout the country side. Carnivorous plants play an important role in the park's ecosystem, the most common being sundew and butterworts trap. Bogs hold very little nutrients so many plants obtain their energy from the digestion of insects. Other common plants include lousewort, bog cotton, milkwort, bog asphodel, orchids and bog myrtle, with a variety of lichens and mosses.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nConnemara National Park is noted for its diversity of bird life. Common song birds include meadow pipits, skylarks, European stonechats, common chaffinches, European robins and Eurasian wrens. Native birds of prey include the common kestrel and Eurasian sparrowhawk with the merlin and peregrine falcon being seen less frequently. Woodcock, common snipe, common starling, song thrush, mistle thrush, redwing fieldfare and mountain goat migrate to Connemara during the winter.\nMammals are often difficult to find, but are present nonetheless. Fieldmice are common in the woodlands, whereas rabbits, foxes, stoats, shrews, and bats at night, are often sighted in the boglands. Red deer once roamed Connemara but were extirpated from the area approximately 150 years ago. An attempt was made to reintroduce red deer to Connemara and a herd was established within the park. Nowadays, the largest mammal in the park is the Connemara pony.\n\n\n== See also ==\nConnemara\nKylemore Abbey\nTwelve Bens\nClifden\nLetterfrack\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNational Parks & Wildlife Service of Ireland\nConnemara National Park",

          "Such a lovely place to simply walk or even hike. With beauty at its best, photographer or at least photography lover would find this amazing. The park itself has a several choice of hikes for visitors, starting from the easier one to longer paths, with more challenging routes.",

          "The Diamond Hill has walks suitable for all levels. The views are spectacular and unique and the facilities are simple but appropriate. The board walk paths are necessary I expect as otherwise the area would be inaccessible due to the wet and boggy terrain. Worth a visit in any",
          "I regularly venture on this walk as a local and it never disappoints. The centre has tourist info, toilets, free parking and food and drink. There is no charge to go on the walk and the views are amazing regardless of the weather. It is a long walk with height so good walking",

          "I am 50+ and somewhat out of shape. That said, I made it to the top of Diamond Hill (the red trail), taking my time. Wow, just wow! I highly recommend. The path is not bad, many stone steps. I would have worn sneakers had I known the trail would be so well maintained and dry.",
          "The hike was incredible, all the way from the parking lot to the top of Diamond Hill. My wife grew concerned as the wind was quite crazy, but she soldiered on and we not only crested the top of the hill, but enjoyed some of the most spectacular views I've ever encountered in",
          "We did the whole trail with our 2 children. The views are amazing. And sometimes it's quite challenging, which makes it an even bigger achievement for the children. Especially the way down, the wind was quite extreme and most of the people returned the same way. But we pushed",

          "We came here on a drizzly summer day. The location is easy to find with or without GPS. The walk was pleasant, scenic, and peaceful. Parking lots fill up fast, so people who come early in the morning have a better chance of getting a spot. The park has a variety of hikes",
          "This beautiful national park offers you 3 different trails with different difficulty levels. Even the yellow trail which is the easiest one offers you beautiful views. In case of heavy rain you might want to reconsider walking the red trail (the hardest of them all) as it can",

          "It was great to visit the park. We did the 3.1km lower diamond loop walk (blue) which is a well made rock & gravel track. Fabulous views. There are longer & shorter loop walks. The views are fabulous looking to the bays & sea and the peaks. The visitor centre has a very",

          "I\u2019m still speechless when I remember my drive through the national park of Connemara. The landscape is unique and not comparable with anything else I\u2019ve seen so far. Even though you drive with your car for hours there are still things to see and things which makes you",
          "We drove around Connemara National Park on our way to and from Kylemore Abbey; we did not stop at the visitor center but spoke with people who were enjoying hiking in the park. The entire area, not just the park is beautiful.",
          "Since I no longer hike, I settled for the view of the park most people get - from N59. We still got the vistas, including the 12 Bens, and the bogs and heath lands. Our driver did a great job of describing the park's history, from megalithic tombs to later ruins, and the park's",

          "We toured this entire region and it was spectacularly beautiful\u2014 very impressive in its natural beauty. The history of the peat business and uses is very interesting",
          "Upon entering you get shown the 3 different hike trails (1, 2,5 and 3,5 hours) and a little exhibition about the bog. There were a few animals (like 5 sheep, 2 horses and 3 cows) in the entrance area but the rest of the park was very empty except for hikers. There are great",

          "Great day out had a 9, 10 and 12 year old children with us . Really enjoyed it, so well laid out and maps were excellent . Staff very friendly and helpful . Views outstanding and so many different angles for views. First time doing it but will denfitally be a regular visitor.",
          "Starting from the visitor center are two loop walks, connecting to a third one. Both are easy to walk, the third one going rather steep up the hill but the descend of it is the more difficult. Even from the lower walks there are nice views. The visitor centre features a nice",

          "I left 5 stars as I couldn't fault the place. The hike up Diamond Hill and the views are amazing. However, check the weather beforehand. If it's any way warm or no breeze I'd avoid if you are anyway sensitive to getting bitten by midges or come prepared with repellent and",
          "Recently took a trip here with my 2 small kids and niece and have a beautiful day. The sun was shining so we walked the lower loop of diamond hill twice and after each return the kids got to enjoy the playground. Thrre are lots of benches wher re one can have a picnic .There are",

          "This a great place to visit for families with children people who love walking and fine healthy fresh air. Get in touch with nature see it all around wild flowers, trees. Lovely to see the beautiful friendly Connemara ponies who love to see all the people and especially if you",
          "I wish I had more stars to rate the morning spent here. Beautiful setting and playground. We went to morning craft class to make peg dolls. This was completely free and loved by all. The two girls especially enjoyed this session but the boys also made superhero dolls and enjoyed",

          "Stunning vistas from the 400-metre high Diamond Hill include the distant islands of Inishbofin, Inishturk and Inishshark, and the turreted Kylemore Abbey. It was a decent hike that is uneven but not too hard. The path can be busy but the views are worth it.",
          "The parking lot overflows all the way to the entrance into the park. The Visitor Center isn\u2019t just off parking, you have to walk to it as well. The view from the parking is lovely as is the area. We just aren\u2019t too big on all the walking.",

          "If you\u2019re in Galway county, do not miss the gorgeous drive to Connemara, and once there, do some trekking in the park. Trails are well marked and they cater to every level of ability. The tallest climb to Diamond Hill is doable even if you\u2019re not super fit - just take care at",
          "We climbed Diamond Hill in Connemara and all of us found it great fun, including our teenage kids. We had great weather and were thus rewarded by beautiful vistas all around. This hike was one of the highlights of our trip to Ireland and I would advise visitors not to miss it.",
          "Wonderful natural park, we loved the scenery. You can drive around it on the Connemara loop, which has some viewing point stops. If you can stay in one of the villages and explore the area for longer, there are loads of different activities to choose from. In Letterfrack you",

          "Recommend an early start. Took the RED - long walk- around the top of Diamond hill. Very impressed with the workmanship of the stepping stones - much missed over Dartmoor- allowing many to enjoy the steep climbs. Views from the summit are well worth the effort. Disappointed by",

          "I was very surprised with Connemara, I always thought the roads would be bad and the weather even worse but it was totally the opposite. The roads are great, the weather brilliant, but the scenery was just magnificent. WOW!",

          "Good experience. Visitor center had some very comprehensive displays regarding bogs and surrounding landscapes. Nice tea room! The hikes were picturesque and offered a variety of different lengths depending on your physical ability and time line.",
          "This park is a wonderful preservation of the natural land in the Connemara region. The visitor center and surrounding town have the amenities you need (bathrooms, food stops) and the park is left to be a park, which I love! It's not hyper-commercialized which is so hard to find",
          "A friend and myself visited the park on a sunny Thursday afternoon. As we entered the visitor centre we were greeted by a very friendly lady who welcomed us warmly and informed us on the 3 popuular walking routes and the visitor information centre. We found the information",
          "This is extremely well maintained and the staff were so friendly and helpful. What incredible views and lots of choices as to the walking route which suits you best. Fab play park also for children and interesting AV explaining about the area",
          "For nature lovers, I cannot recommend Connemara National Park enough. We sort of went on a whim (hoping to see Connemara ponies -- Ireland's only indigenous horse) and were completely amazed by its rugged beauty. The park staff itself deserves real commendations for the state",
          "We loved our trip to Connemara. It was a fine day, so we opted to hike Diamond Hill, which was somewhat challenging and offered great views of the countryside. The park and the visitor center were well maintained, with a small but charming museum and clean restrooms.",
          "This is a lovely park with well laid out walking trails that our meticulously maintained. It\u2019s nice to see so much thought put into the walking paths so that environmental degradation does not occur. This place is a gem and is free to enter. The visitor center is informative",
          "Friendly staff , knowledgeable and approachable Fabulous walks for all - from low level to the heights Diamond Hill is a must - views from the summit are awesome",
          "So much beauty at this park and on the route to get there! We had rented a car (the best way to get around Ireland), and we stopped multiple times along the way to enjoy the views! We chose to hike up Diamond Hill, and wow I\u2019m so glad we did! It was truly a remarkable sight from",
          "This National Park is one of my favorite. Our children loved the great scenery and rock climbing . The trails are well marked and satisfies the young and old. Take time to spend at the park reviewing the museum and snack bar.",
          "If you are in Ireland, you have to visit Connemara, you will have beautiful scenary, it\u2019s beauty each step of the way. I highly recommend the tour, they have nice stops on the way and will get you in places with great view, you will also learn about Ireland\u2019s past.",
          "Diamond Hill is a fantastic walk ! The scenery is just amazing and well worth the effort to get up top. Stunning views showing the whole penisula and the bens. 4 hours well spent, and enjoyed every minute.",
          "My 17 year old son and I visited Connemara and did this hike today. My iWatch said it was 5 miles and it took us 2:20 to complete. Getting to the very top is challenging but we did it. While it is challenging I saw two couples in their 60s doing it along with us. There is also a",
          "Visitor Centre was a nice starting point for a great hike. Staff were very friendly and gave good advice regarding hiking the mountain and the various trails. People of all ages were on their way up or down. Hike is very manageable, although we only went about 80% of the way",
          "The visitor centre is located uphill from the main road, well signposted. Large car park. The day we were there was pouring rain so the centre was a welcome relief. An interesting exhibit / museum on the local area, very informative. Nice little tearoom. Worth a stop.",
          "This beautiful walk in the middle of Connemara will take your breath away. The mountain walk will take about an hour to get to the top. The walk is a medium walk and the average person would have no problem doing it.Parts of the walk is on the flat and there is a wooden decking",
          "This is a very seasonal place to visit. In February, the toilets were open, the coffee shop was able to rustle up two lattes and there was a good walk up onto the hillside, well signposted. But mostly it was closed. Still good to visit, lovely scenery and skies.",
          "Natural beauty at its finest. Well worth cycling through the National Park as you can take in more of the beauty.",
          "Very beautiful nature. Suitable alleys a built and signs to show the trail level are setup everywhere. The visitor center provides interesting exhibitions and also coffee and food.",
          "Depends on the weather but it is one of the most beautiful places in Ireland. Climbed Diamond hill for my mums birthday and the scenery was just stunning",
          "The walking trail is in great condition and allows for a relaxed hike while taking in the beautiful panoramic views.",
          "Connemara is an exceptionally beautiful part of Ireland and you can do several wonderful walks through the park that are filled with amazing views. Plenty of interesting flora and fauna can be seen along the way and there are different walks to suit different abilities. I have",
          "I am a regular visitor to experience these great walks and magnificent scenery - the National Park is a \u2018must see\u2019 for any visit to Connemara. Great credit to all the staff who show great commitment to the daily upkeep and maintenance of the entire park. And as for value for",
          "Another spectacular drive. The day was rainy and we arrived at the Abbey too late so we didn\u2019t get to see the inside but the outside and grounds were gorgeous. Next time I\u2019m in Ireland will visit. We saw wild goats and took some beautiful landscape pictures.",
          "We had visited here many years ago when we had young children. This time, it was just us and our energetic English Springer Spaniel! Entry is free and there is ample car parking space. There are three substantive walking routes (aside from the Ellis Wood Nature Trail) and we",
          "If you like the outdoors and enjoy a great walk in the countryside then this is a must. The full walk is well laid out to cater for all ages and abilities. Great staff and a nice tea Room and rest room. What's not to like",
          "Our group of four enjoyed the displays that explained the history and nature of the area. We hiked the lovely trails then enjoyed a nice meal of tea and potato leek soup at the tea house. Connemara National Park is a great place to visit.",
          "We were staying in Cong but took a drive around this amazing part of the Country. The roads are windy but the scenery makes it all worthwhile. Lakes are everywhere and the terrain is tough to beat.",
          "All of Connemara is beautiful but this is surely the most beautiful place in Connemara. I have visited the park on both sunny and rainy days, and in all weathers this a fabulous place to experience the wild nature of Connemara. Entry to the park and visitors center is from",
          "We went up on a particularly windy day but thoroughly enjoyed the views from the midway stop! Neither of us are avid hikers but found the trek relatively easy and fun.",
          "How is it possible that a gem like the Connemara National Park can not be the headline attraction in Co. Galway. So much of the once beautiful Connemara countryside has been blighted with negligent local planning and what should be beautiful striking coastline along the Wild",
          "Bleak, exposed, wild landscape. Be careful of hikes from national park - full Diamond Hill loop is nearly 7km, and involves scaling the ridge up the mountain. We misread the map and were forced to turn around. Will be back to complete in the summer. Well worth a visit, even for",
          "An easy walk along the rugged landscape of Connemara National Park, and its all mapped out for you. Unspoilt scenery as far as the eye can see. Can't wait to go back.",
          "Located about an hour's drive up from Galway, it's well worth the time to get up there. Not only is there good hiking trails out of the National Park's centre at Letterfrack, but there is the stunning Abbey at nearby Kylemore which is aBout 3km before arriving at Letterfrack.",
          "Family of five visiting from US. Was a day trip out of Galway. The boys did the long hike up to the summit while the women stayed closer to the entrance and did the short loop. The tea room is a great spot to warm up and get drinks, snacks or lunch items. Good visitors",
          "I spent a few hours walking some of the trails in the National Park earlier this month after having passed by on a motorcycle tour earlier this year. There are a variety of walks you can do from a short sheltered walk through the lower part of the NP with forest and waterfalls,",
          "Paid a quick visit to this area soly to do the walk It was a pleasant day with a little light rain The park was beautiful to drive through and when we got to the centre the walk was just perfect Beautiful views and very good amenities The terrain is not suitable for anyone with",
          "Absolutely stunning alien landscape. I had many ideas of what would be my favorite part of Ireland, but this was one I didn't see coming.",
          "There are three hiking trails distinguished by duration. We took the middle one which was expected to take 60 minutes and even though we walked at a casual pace, we completed it in less than 45 minutes - I suppose we should have stopped and took more photos. The trails are",
          "What happened to Connemara National Park? I thought it used to be much bigger. To me, it seemed very contained and cordoned off. The walks seemed limited and to cap it off there was a hideous, high boundary fence that reminded me of a prison camp. I couldn't help but wonder if",
          "Informative visitor's centre and clearly marked walkways, including up to the top of Diamond Hill, which has excellent views. Also good to see the Centre has made accessible the graveyard of the Letterfrack Industrial School, where so many youngsters were effectively",
          "We went to visit Connemara National Park and climbed, (when I say climbed, it is an actual walk) Black Diamond Hill. The view was spectacular and looks across at Kilmore Abbey and it's walled gardens. You do need some level of fitness as it gets quite steep and narrow towards",
          "After planning/plotting for over a year, we made the Connemara National Park & the Kylemore Abbey our only day trip out of Galway. Man we were right to do so, just an AWESOME DAY!",
          "Fantastic walk and views on a fine day. Friendly informative staff. Really captures the rugged beauty of Connemara. No entry fee yet very well maintained trails.Would highly recommend.",
          "More beautiful Irish coastal views. This is part of the Wild Atlantic Coast route. We added the lower Sky Road out of Clifden in a clockwise rotation. A bit challenging, but lovely views. Don't forget to stop at Walsh's Bakery in Clifden!",
          "We saw this as part of a day trip and enjoyed the great out of doors experience and visitor center which was most informative! This is one of the two must sees when you visit the area of Galway and thereabouts and is highly recommended! The other is the Cliffs of Moher which I",
          "This place is so beautiful and it\u2019s a different perfect view around every corner and over every hill. This place is a hikers, bikers and photographers paradise. Perfect for a quick drive through or for days of exploration. You could never see it all on your vacation. Definitely",
          "We went to Connemara National Park as part of a day tour through Galway Day Tours and were glad we did. The natural beauty of the area blew us away and the tour company took us to places we would have never found on our own. Highly recommend this park to any visitor to",
          "We had a wonder drive through the landscape of Connemara. It has such a variety of landscapes, from mountains, moors, peat bogs, shoreline, and quaint villages.",
          "Well marked trails and very well maintained. Very nice addition having the cows, donkeys and ponies at the park to get an idea of local agriculture. Lovely way to spend a morning in Connemara, get a good idea of the culture and the land and a gorgeous view!",
          "Great day out for young & not so young & the sun shone brightly on the day we were visiting the park. You can choose what route depending on how fit you are ,",
          "Best place to visit for a hike! Multiple trails of various lengths. Thirty minutes to three hours. We did the hour and a half one. It was not difficult at all but still lead to amazing views. Lots of maps to help with hiking trails. Well kept trails. No cost.",
          "Free admission. Three level of trail difficulty. Beautiful hills and streams. What more could you ask for?",
          "We visited the park on a Misty damp day in oct. unfortunately the views were not great due to the weather. There are 3 different colour routes. Yellow, blue and red. We were advised by the staff not to do the red route, which goes to the sumit, because it may be dangerous due to",
          "We had beautiful weather and we enjoyed the day! There are easy paths to take and more difficult ones if you are up the challenge. Worth the trip to see a \"different\" landscape in Ireland. I also bought a Connemara Marble necklace to take home, take some time to research about",
          "I love how this hike (the long one) is just challenging enough you feel accomplished at the end, but can be done quickly enough that it requires just a part of your day and needs no preparation clothing wise. Wear proper shoes and active wear and as long as you\u2019re in somewhat",
          "Beautiful place to visit with breath-taking iconic Irish scenery. I recommend hiring a bicycle to enjoy the views.",
          "We have passed here several times and finally we decided to stop and pay a visit The good news is its free Theres a visitors centre with tea rooms etc And a nice but small exhibition centre about the history of Turf Then just outside are several walking trails We did 30 mins",
          "Park is amazing. Just don't understand what the staff is supposed to do in this really nice visitor centre subsided by the EU and I got the feel they don't know either.",
          "Nice park. There is a restaurant, although we did not eat there. Several very well marked trails. We took a short one and the views were some of the best we saw on our trip. The visitors center is worth going to. Good information about the area.",
          "Make the hike all the way to the top - it's worth it! Connemara is such a beautiful and unique landscape and the views from the National Park are incredible.",
          "The views of the Park are stunning. There are trails for all fitness levels. If you are driving the Connemara Loop, take time to walk through this national park. The info center was very helpful.",
          "On a trip to galway do not miss a tour to Connemara the scenery is unreal nothing I have seen before and it is absolutely beautiful take in Dogs Bay on a sunny day you could be on a desert island in the Caribbean don't forget to visit the old village pubs the decor and",
          "Diamond Hill is a hidden gem and the walks and views are exceptional with different routes to suit all fitness levels. Not ideal for a windy or foggy day as some routes closed for safety, otherwise excellent and well worth a stop off",
          "Beautiful rural drive from Galway. Sheep and cows and farm lands. Castle/Abbey well worth the trip. Historical info interesting",
          "The displays available in the visitor center are very well done and very informative. They deal with bogs and include both the natural and manmade elements you'll need to know about before exploring on your own. There are tools and some of the oldest wood you'll ever see. Don't",
          "Ate our lunch at the outdoor picnic tables and set out to hike Connemara Mountain. There's some steep steps along the way and hiking shoes are a must. The views from the top are worth the hike. There's a lower, level, easier hike loop for those less experienced.",
          "We did a tour through Galway tour company and it was fantastic. We visited a few other places, like the cute village of Cong, but the Connemara was was beyond words. So beautiful. Highly recommend.",

          "Beautiful place to visit, National Park is very attractive with lakes and places to visit. Lots of walks, natural lakes.",
          "this park is all mountains, lakes and fiords. We went for a hike up one of thew mountains. The wind just about lifted us off our feet but the views were lovely. We took the medium trail which was just right for us.",
          "We went to Connemara to hike the diamond trail. It was an amazing hike other then the small little gangs attacking us! From what we looked up these small bugs come out when there is no wind, no rain and no sun.... there were thousands of them and they bite. Before going take a",
          "Lovely set-up with informative visitor centre and caf\u00e9. Climb to the top of the viewing point was well worth it. Its not difficult and much of it is decked or paved. A few steep bits but a lovely walk nonetheless. Take a warm jacket or jumper as it can get a tad breezy.",
          "Connemara National Park is incredibly beautiful, with views of islands off the coast, farmland all around, bogs and the characteristic limestone rocks of the region. The visitor's center said it takes 2.5-3 hours to climb Diamond Hill, but it will take anyone going at a",
          "Connemara NP \u2013 hard to discern \u2013 you drive into/along it, never quite sure where it actually might be \u2013 no doubt, there are beautiful vistas and lakes everywhere, and plenty of places to pull-off and enjoy the view up close. In fact, driving in Ireland practically means any spot",
          "This was the perfect hike for moderate hikers and even young strong hikers. Going up almost 1,400 ft is a good hike in 3 hours. Great paths for hiking. If it were really wet it may be more of a problem footing wise. The countryside views are worth it. They have a visitor center",
          "An awesome park to visit, the views are to die for. Fantastic that it is free to visit as well. There are 3 routes to cover abilities. Make sure you have sturdy walking boots and be prepared for changeable weather. Loved it.",
          "As a frenchman, visiting the Connermara is something special. It's hard not to be pleased by this beautiful place, all these lakes and the natural warmth of its people",
          "One of the most incredible natural places I have ever visited. The views that this place offers are awesome. If you are looking for the typical Irish scenaries I recommend visiting it.",
          "Very very scenic!! Got to see a fjord near Killary Harbor, had no idea that fjords were part of Ireland\u2019s landscape. Amazing vistas and every possible scene on route to Connemara. Kylemore abbey was a jewel in the forest, or icing on the cake or cherry on the pie!!",
          "Unfortunately visited during bad weather. Thanks to laid out paths, nevertheless easily reached the summit of the Diamond hill for a wonderful but misty experience.",
          "climbed to top of Diamond Hill in the Connemara National Park. It was very exhilarating with breathtaking views over Connemara",

          "Learning of the vast landscape with insight from our tour guide really let's you appreciate the beauty of the land.",

          "The national park is just absolutely beautiful. The view are amazing. There don't much to choose from the cafe but the walks are brilliant. There is one made and her foal you can see. They are brought into the stable area from 2pm-4pm. And there is a lady waiting to give you any",
          "Beautiful scenery. Very diverse and very beautiful. If you go to Ireland this is a Must See. You must have seen the landscaping.",
          "Lovely place to spend a few hours. Fab walks, staff very friendly. There were workshops on for kids on the days we visited, one was an archaeological dig and the other marine life. Very interactive and informative. Kids loved it. There was also a sheep sheering demonstration.",
          "No matter how many times my wife and I travel to Connemara, when doing so again is like coming home. This has been the first time that our daughter has visited this so beloved place to us and she\u2019s also fallen in love with it. A land of wild beauty, dramatic but also romantic",
          "We were very lucky, the weather was perfect. We took the blue trail (about one hour) to circle around, although, one of the younger fellow hiked the red trail, with considerably shorter than the required 3 hours. But we didn't have that much time to walk at our pace. The view",
          "Connemara National Park is a must visit! I especially loved Kylemore Abbey! It was right out of a fairytale",
          "The drive from Galway or other surrounds would be worth the trip! Very scenic. The story is a movie waiting to be made, love, disaster, and financial failure, yet, the buildings still stand. I went into the cafe for a coffee, but wound up eating a HUGE freshly prepared lunch!",
          "We are an athletic family of four who loves hiking, biking and outdoor activities. The visitor center was unremarkable but this national park was fabulous. They had a live demonstration of shearing sheep. The lower walk passed by Shetland ponies before climbing up Diamond Hill.",

          "We took grandchildren 6 and 9 up to top of Diamond Mountain. Not east but real sense of accomplishment getting it done. Cloudy day so view wasn\u2019t spectacular but there was something magical about being up there",
          "The visitor center is nice, but the trails are great! The views are amazing. Our family did the diamond hill trail and while everyone else did the entire thing, I chickened out toward the top due to my fear of heights. But the views are spectacular even if you do not do the last",
          "There is a lot to see and do in this national park, so if you are pressed for time and only have one day, I recommend the following 3 stops: 1). Kylemore Abbey, which is absolutely stunning. Allow yourself at least 2 hours here to walk the the inside as well as the beautiful",
          "Just as the title says! Was massively excited to experience such a landscape only to find it was mainly covered in paths. The bad weather didnt help also. Some interesting wildlife to be seen but wont be going back anytime soon. I think a drive around the area was much more",
          "The drive to Connemara National Park from Galway was incredibly scenic, and even though we arrived at the park in the middle of a storm, we still made it to the top of Diamond Hill (trail starts at the very nice Visitor's Center) and enjoyed miles of breath-taking views in all",
          "Enchanting, beautiful scenery highlighted by interesting narration by our tour guide, Gordon. There were a family with three young children on board and Gordon was so kind and made sure everyone was comfortable. We were able to purchase a picnic lunch at the Peacockes Hotel",

          "Definitely one of the most beautiful places in Ireland. Highly recommended to visit with a guide tour.",
          "Connemara NP is an easily accessible park with a nice visitor's center. Several hiking trails originate from near the center and are well marked, easy to navigate. We took the Upper Diamond Hill trail and highly recommend it. The views are spectacular. It took us 2.5 hours",
          "Enjoyable park. Great views and nice walks arround. Important to count with a nice weather (which is complicate)",
          "I have visited Connemara on a bus tour from Galway. Even though the scenery might look simple, it is stunningly beautiful with the mountains, lakes and bog land. It has a very specific atmosphere and feels like 'real Ireland'. The roads along the coast are narrow, but those were",
          "The Connemara National Park is a lovely place - great scenery, history and wheelchair-accessible in most parts. I\u2019ve been twice, once with my school for a hike on Diamond Hill in 2017 and once a few years before that with my family. The school hike was a great day. However, as",
          "What a place. Driving through an impressing nature with wonderfull lakes. If ever God created earth, for sure he had a good day when creating Irish landscapes.",
          "We recently toured Connemara National Park. The park and surrounding environs were enjoyable to view. If you're doing a driving tour, there are limits to what you can see and if the weather is overcast or raining, the area is not as compelling as I'm sure it would otherwise",
          "On the drive to Connemara national park we saw couple of great sights like Kylemore Abbey and small lake with sheeps wandering on the road. Parking was free but a lot was quite small and might be full. Visitor center has small exhibition and cafe. It was disappointment that",
          "We really enjoyed Connemara National Park. Rugged and beautiful. It\u2019s a place I\u2019d like to spend more time in. Definitely worth a visit.",

          "It was highly recommend that we visit the park when we planned to be in the Galway area, and are we glad we did. Even the drive to the park is stunning with beautiful lakes and bucolic farms along the road. We did have \u201ctypical\u201d Irish weather - misty with low cloud covering",
          "Breathtaking. Would be best by car so can take lots of photos. We went on a Tour bus and was nice also. Small Rivers, mountains, valleys",
          "Fabulous day out with friends to Connemara, a gem of a place situated on The Wild Atlantic Way. Plenty to see and do, made more pleasant by the bucketfuls of Irish sunshine lavished on us. Thoroughly pleasant day had by all.",

          "Had the wonderful pleasure of seeing this area of Ireland. So much to see that photos just don't do it justice. Take your time while driving and stop and see the different views and think what this place must have looked like 6000 years ago before farming and bad decisions took",

          "There is something so stirring about Connemara National Park - the views go for miles and no photo can truly capture the scope of the place. There are trails for every level of hiker, so no one in the family will be excluded, and the isolated nature of the park means that it",
          "We've visited the park today, parked for free and entered by the visitors center: very welcoming personnel gladly explained about the exhibition rooms and the tracks. We picked the longer one and it took around 2h 45' to complete it. Lovely views and stunning panorama from the",
          "My husband's family comes from this part of Ireland - so we had to visit! So glad we did. Rough, unspoiled countryside. Tidy small stone houses. The 12 Bens appeared rocky and unwelcoming. Loved it all. Wear Sturdy Boots!",
          "Staying in the area we followed the Wild Atlantic Way road and came across this place. Popped in the cafe and what a find. Had a couple of toasted panninis which came with a very tasty salad and crisps, along with a pot of tea, all very reasonable priced too. We sat in the",
          "We did the full loop up Diamond Hill. It's a well-maintained trail, with a bit of a scramble at the top and some slippery bits on the way down (sudden burst of cold wind and rain). I was glad for hiking boots, water, a sandwich, and a rain jacket--but there were kids in sneakers",
          "Great for driving through or better, stop and hike about. One of the special places you can visit. Not to be forgotten.",

          "This has been one of the best things we've done in Ireland. The trails are incredibly well maintained and marked (and the visitor center will point you in the right direction). The lower diamond hill hike is nice, but do the upper diamond hill hike for the views if you can.",
          "We decided to hike just part way up the mountain, until we ran into a couple with a 7 year old who had made it to the top on his own. So we did it. It is fairly steep and you need to be really careful I imagine if it is wet. We went when it was hot and dry. Bring your water!",
          "We experienced the sights via the day tour organized by Gallway Tour Company. The landscapes of Connemara are stunning! Mountains, bog lands, glacial lakes, would highly reccomend checking it out. Reminded my fianc\u00e9 and I a lot of the highlands in Scotland around the Glencoe",
          "Visited the park to hike upper Diamond hill This park has stunning views and several hikes you can do. We chose the highest point and the views did not disappoint. The hike is tough but if you are in decent shape it\u2019s not too bad.",

          "Spectacular views worth the drive. The visitor center was very welcoming and recommended some great well marked trails. It was a bit cold on the day we went, so we just got some pictures at the bottom of diamond mountain. Hopefully next time it\u2019s warmer or we dress better for",
          "Keep your eyes peeled for the Connemara ponies, we saw a few! The scenery here is amazing, lots of hiking trails and nature enrichment walks and talks. We were sadly limited on our time, so we did a guided driving tour throughout the area and were amazed by the unique",

          "Beautiful place with great trails. Views are fantastic. Easy hiking. Loved passing by the sheep, cattle and horses along the trail. Used it as a halfway stop on our route through the Connemara. Needed a hike to break up the long drive.",
          "We went to the visitors center and took the Diamond Hill hike from there. I think it took about an hour and twenty minutes to go to the top and back. Absolutely stunning views and totally worth the climb.",

          "We had visited the park on a previous holiday and enjoyed its natural wonders but decided to \u2018do\u2019 the Poetry Trail on our most recent visit. It starts in the Park and involves a circuit of the neighbouring village of Letterfrack, which has had a varied and frequently tragic",

          "This part of the country is an absolutely incredible sight! This is the Ireland that many of us come to the country to see and you will not be disappointed. There is much to this area that you will like as it is explored.",
          "Drive through mountains is peaceful and meaningful. Reflect on the lives loss during the famine. Sheep grazing everywhere.",
          "This is the loneliest stretch of scenery we encountered on our trip. It is a vast and rugged landscape, but is colorful and beautiful. It was a nice change from the green fields and walls, although Connemara has a few of them as well. But what I will always have in my mind",
          "It's a nice park. But coming from Canada, this is just average. Sorry for the comment. Just trying to be honest",
          "we took a stroll on an old long walk through the Connemara national park on bank holiday Monday just gone. We started out about 10.20am and while there was plenty of mist and fog on the lower parts of the walk the sun soon came out and made it a glorious mid morning and early",

          "I don't know how anyone could complain about this national park. It's well maintained and free to enter. When we went it was incredibly windy, but we still loved our hike up Diamond Hill. Our friends are less experienced hikers and they stayed on the easier trails and were",
          "Lots of brilliant photo ops but it\u2019s a narrow, hilly, sometimes dangerous road so be careful. Mountainous with lots of natural flora, sheep, brooks. Very enjoyable.",
          "Put the sturdy hiking boots on and be overjoyed and overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of this Oasis in the wild west of Ireland. Friendly, knowledgeable staff explain the trail options - yellow (leisurely loop stroll), blue (intermediate climbing) and red (about loop",

          "Great hike! Took just over 2 hours at a steady pace. Some scrambling up rocky areas but stone steps placed along the way up and down. We were fortunate to have great weather although the wind was still persistent throughout the climb. Wish I had more time for other hikes in the",
          "What a surprise to find mountains that high so close to the sea. Not much more than an hour (by car) from Galway, it\u2019s like being put into a different world. For driving around and exploring by car, one day will work. If you have time you should plan a night and do some hikes.",
          "A short drive north from Galway and you're in the Connemara National Park. Beautiful driving roads and stunning scenery.",
          "This area goes on and on and is beautiful in its own way. Ireland is the best place to visit fun, people and food. they have it all",
          "I dont know what state authority was involved in developing this park but it is really excellently done. The attention to detail on the trails is excellent. Old or young this is worth a visit. At the base is a friendly cafe and kids playground. There are 3 trails one an easy",
          "Great representation of the wilderness. No facilities, not well marked, and not much inside the park by way of amenities. Make sure you have a full tank and a good map. Roads are not well marked.",

          "Lovely trip of nature. The Connemara Marble Factory is very interesting & a great place to get a bargain.",
          "An Irish challenge you must take. Our day brought us mixed weather with some windy misty low cloud weather, but worth it!",
          "Watch out for the weather but the Connemara National Park offers many and varied walking experiences.",
          "Worth a stop for the cafe, information centre and museum alone, there are a number of short walks that give you a feel for the manic scenery of the Connemarra. These short walks also pass a number of enclosures that will give you an up close look at the Connemarra pony, so",
          "The drive through the park to visitors center is lovely. The visitors center itself is modest, but well laid out with helpful staff and some nice wildlife photos. The hike up to and over diamond hill is fairly moderate (~1.5hrs at modest pace), very well maintained, with",
          "Although it was raining, we drove from Galway to the Park and took the tour of the Kylemore Abbey. On the way back we stopped at a pub in Clifden and had lunch. We didn\u2019t see ponies but we did stop at the touristy Connemara Marble stores on the way. It was a nice day, despite",

          "I didn't read much about Connemara while planning our trip to Ireland but I'm glad we took a bus tour through the area. Kylemore Abbey is quite scenic and has a good story behind it. The quaint little town of Cong was exactly what I was hoping to see when I choosing Ireland for",
          "We stayed in Galway for two night and follow the Wild Atlantic Way to the Connemara National Park was a good surprise. The park is very beautiful, up to Diamond Hill the landscape is amazing. If possible, go on a sunny and not windy day (the experience will be better) =)",
          "A lovely area with fantastic hand-built stone fences that date back a long time ago. Fascinating that the mountains are the origin of Connemara marble. Make sure to find a gift shop to purchase the multitude of jewelry, rosary beads and crosses crafted from this gorgeous",
          "Only able to drive thru on my way from Galway to Achill Island, but the scenery reminded me a little of New Mexico, with the variety of browns and the lovely hills and mountains. Discovered later that the brown hues were the winter colour. Due to the late lasting winter, the",

Great local sea food available as well (try the chowder in Veldons Seafarer bar in Letterfrack!) Highly recommended area in Ireland!",
          "The park lies at the very west coast of Ireland. Small in its size, it offers three circular routes, with the longest one reaching at the top of a hill. The beauty of the surrounding area is surreal. Very colourful pictures and tranquil landscape. I totally recommend it.",

          "Rathbaun Farm was a visit as part of our Globus tour. What a wonderful experience. The lady of the farm demonstrated how to make real Irish scones and then we made our own and enjoyed them with a pot of tea. Her husband gave us a very interesting talk on farming today in",
          "This was a real treat. First, we made scones with the farmer's wife. Then we met with the farmer who gave a tour and exhibition on sheep shearing. Even the family dog joined in rounding up the sheep. We fed a lamb and heard all about the history of the farm. Later, we returned",
          "This is just a lovely little attraction visited as part of an organised tour. The thatched cottages, home made scones with whipped cream and home made rhubarb jam took me back to my childhood. And what about the wonderful people going that extra yard to make a visit such a",

          "This is the second visit to this farm and it is the favorite attraction. We had a group of 18 with a Globus tour. The owners are so polite and friendly, helpful and gave grate demonstrations. The ground are beautiful and having scones and coffee (the best we tasted) sitting",

          "Visiting the Rathbaun Farm was an unforgettable experience. Seeing the clever sheep dog at work, watching a sheep get sheared up close, and walking through a real, working Irish farm with the lovely smell of peat in the air was a fantastic experience. The Rathbaun Farm workers",
          "While the family was extremely nice and the farm very informative, this was more of a place to bring young children. Glad to have seen but will pass next trip.",
          "Delicious scones and rhubarb jam! Charming couple who share their sheep farm and ancestral cottage to the public. Learned that lambs wool from Ireland is not all top grade and that Irish wool sweaters are a bit of a misconception",
          "Our guided tour took us to Rathba\u00fan Farm and to be honest, I was not looking forward to it, but boy were we happily surprised. This place is so charming and the tea and scones were to die for. We received a demonstration, from the owner himself, about sheep living and farming.",
          "We went to the Rathbaun Farm on our own as a group of three. We arrived about 30 minutes ahead of a tour bus group, and thus had great freedom to wander the grounds, meet with the sheep, take photos, and play with the neighbor's giant dog, Thor, before the official tour",

          "This is a quaint working sheep farm. Such friendly people. Welcoming environment and educational too! Great for a family outing!",
          "My family of six were a bit disappointed with what we saw. Of course we are Irish and may have been expecting to see something we had not seen before. There were sheep of several different breeds in labelled pens. Even the Jacobs did not surprise us as my wife has had her wool",
          "We went on a walking tour of this beautiful facility. The tour guide was excellent and explained thoroughly about the operation of the stud. The horses are gorgeous, all former champions. After touring the grounds of the stud, we went through the Japanese garden, also enjoyable.",

          "We have had Ireland on our bucket list for over 25 years and just returned from a 10-day tour and visiting this farm was a highlight for me because I was able to hand feed a lamb, something I've always wanted to do! I'm a big animal lover at heart and seeing the sheep everywhere",
          "Like DVE1979, I was a bit put off by the lack of concern for the animals' comfort, but I did get over it. It is the difference between 'livestock' and 'pets'. They did nothing that was detrimental to their health, other than not caring that the animals are uncomfortable. Gosh,",
          "Our group tour was warmly welcomed. Frances and Finton do a great job of celebrating their family's Irish farm tradition and making an agritourism opportunity out of their working farm. It's a way to sustain a small farm which might otherwise not be economically viable. It was",

          "What an unexpected pleasure!! I really enjoyed my tour of this little sheep farm, from the thatched roof farm house, to the friendly lambs, to the delicious home made scones. If you ever find yourself in Galway, drop by this farm for a step back into history.",
          "We were greeted by Frances and her friendly team. They had fixed delicious scones with Ginger and Rhubarb Jam. She was quite funny and entertained us with information about the farm and house. She will also share her recipe and scone cutters for a small fee. It's worth it! As we",
          "The visit (a bit touristy!) was still fun. As part of a tour group, so sort of thing done. In any case, a lot of fun was had. Scone making (which were delicious) Saw the sheep and a few people fed the lambs. But the scones / jam and cream and tea was nice to top it off!",
          "I will always remember the wonderful homemade scones. We had the chance to feed the lovely goat and make some funny photos. It's worth to visit again.",

          "Great experience. Lovely farm owners and a nice look into the farm life in Ireland. The animals were fascinating and the sheepdog was quite the talent. The chance to feed a baby lamb was just priceless. The fresh scones and hot tea could not have been better. Clean bathrooms and",

          "What a fantastic time here! You didn't feel like a tourist but a guest in their home. As silly as it sounds it was fun to see a working sheep farm and the daily operations of running it. The kids will love seeing and petting the lambs in the barn. The best part is visiting",
          "Stopped at Rathbaun Farm on the last leg of a group tour around Ireland. As with most of my experiences in Ireland, it's the people who make the difference. Fintan and Frances Connolly (hope I'm spelling that right) are absolutely charming people who made us feel right at home.",

      "name": "Ross Errilly Friary",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Ross Errilly Friary (Irish: Mainistir Ros Oirialaigh, often anglicised in 18th & 19th century sources as Rosserelly) is a medieval Franciscan friary located about a mile to the northwest of Headford, County Galway, Ireland. It is a National Monument of Ireland and among the best-preserved medieval monastic sites in the country.  Though usually referred to by locals as \"Ross Abbey,\" this is not technically correct as the community never had an abbot.The church and bell tower are to the south of a small but well preserved central cloister and domestic buildings are to the north.   Amongst these are a kitchen (equipped with an oven and a water tank for live fish), a bake house, and a refectory or dining area.  The dormitories are on the upper levels.  One unusual feature is a second courtyard or cloister, built to accommodate the friary's growing population.\nLike many other abandoned Christian sites in Ireland, Ross Errilly has continued to be used as a burial ground by area residents.  In addition to tombs that date from the friary's active period, many graves dating from the 18th through 20th centuries can be found inside the church walls.  In some cases, tombstones comprise the floors of walkways and crawlspaces.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\n\nBoth Luke Wadding and the Four Masters (who refer to Ross Errilly in their Annals as Ros-Oirbhealagh) record that the abbey was founded in 1351, but this date has been called into question by numerous historians.  Architectural cues and documentary evidence have given rise to a modern consensus that the friary was founded sometime in the middle of the 15th century, perhaps around 1460. The earliest existing documentary evidence however comes from a reference to the friary in the will of Galway man John Blake, son of Henry, who bequeathed the sum of 40 pence to the friary in 1469. But on the other hand some facts in support of the legend on the founding of the friary in 1351 cannot be overlooked. Firstly, history tells us that there was a plague \u2013 the \"Black Death\" rampant in the country in 1348 and succeeding years. Secondly, Archbishop MacHugh, who is credited with the foundation of the friary, was the metropolitan in Tuam. He was a Franciscan and a native of the Headford area and he died of the plague in 1349, and it could have taken three years to build the first part of the friary owing to the prevalence of the plague and the marshy condition of the soil. In any case, it is clear from the architectural evidence that any religious building that may have been on the site prior to that time was greatly expanded during the 15th century. Around 1473, a delegation of Franciscans from Ross Errilly went to Donegal at the request of the Tyrconnell clan and founded the Donegal Friary, where the Four Masters would later write their famous Annals.\n\n\n=== After the English Reformation ===\nLife at Ross Errilly was disrupted by the English Reformation.  The Franciscans had loudly opposed King Henry VIII's break with Rome, which would prove costly after the schism.  In 1538, English authorities imprisoned two hundred of the monks and banished or killed an indeterminate number of others.  The rest of the Franciscans' history at Ross Errilly would be marked by repeated evictions and other persecutions.\n\nAt the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the abbey was confiscated and given to Richard Burgh, the 2nd Earl of Clanrickarde.  Burgh, a descendant of the de Burghs who had helped found the abbey, quietly gave it back to the Franciscans.  In 1572, an enclosing ditch and wall were constructed around the friary.In 1584, the English crown again confiscated the monastery from the Franciscans and gave it to an English noble who evicted the monks and plundered the building's contents.  In 1586, the Earl of Clanrickarde purchased the monastery and again returned it to the Franciscans.\nBy the end of the century, however, the crown had once again expelled the monks and converted the monastery into an English garrison for use during the Nine Years' War.\nIn 1604, Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanrickarde, continuing to honour the de Burgh tradition of supporting Ross Errilly, financed the rehabilitation and reoccupation of the monastery by the Franciscans.  Their stay was short-lived; in 1612 Lord Arthur Chichester, Lord Deputy of Ireland, ordered the Protestant archbishop of Tuam, William Daniel, to expel the monks and to demolish the abbey's altars.  Daniel apparently complied with the order, but sent advance word to the residents of Ross Errilly and advised them to evacuate the abbey's most precious items.\nIn 1626, the monks returned to Ross Errilly and enjoyed a quarter-century of relative peace.  Records of the OFM in Ireland indicate that the community at this time consisted of just six priests and two brothers.  One piece of evidence for the friary's occupancy during this period is a handwritten testimonium, dated 27 November 1636, and signed by a Boetius Mac Egan, then a prelate in residence at the friary.\n\n\n=== Rebellion and the Cromwellian era ===\nOn 18 February 1642, Ulick Burke and the monks were involved in the rescue of about 40 Protestant refugees of the 1641 uprising, including the family of Dr. John Maxwell, the Protestant bishop of Killala. The refugees were being led from the town of Shrule when the Catholic soldiers comprising their escort massacred them.  It's not reliably known how many were killed, but one estimate placed the number of victims at 65.  Burke and the monks brought the survivors back to the Headford area and obtained shelter for them among the townspeople until safe passage to England could be arranged.\nThe Irish campaigns of Oliver Cromwell brought an end to this era of English tolerance of the Catholic Church in Ireland.  For a few nervous years, Ross Errilly served as an informal refugee shelter for Catholic clergy who had been flushed out of other parts of Ireland by Cromwell's forces.\nOn 10 August 1656, Cromwellian forces finally made their way to Ross Errilly.  The 140 Franciscans living there had fled a few hours earlier, but the soldiers ransacked the grounds, destroying crosses and other religious iconography and even defiling tombs in search of loot.  Legend maintains that the fleeing monks somehow found the time to remove the bell from the bell tower and sink it in the nearby Black River, where it remains today.  The English Restoration in 1660 brought Charles II to the throne. His nominally tolerant policies towards Catholics allowed the reoccupation and repair of the abbey in 1664.\n\n\n=== Final years ===\n\nThe Glorious Revolution of 1688, which deposed Charles' younger brother, the Catholic James II, eventually led to the Popery Act of 1698, which placed a bounty on Catholic clergy.  Once again, the Franciscans of Ross Errilly became fugitives and abandoned the premises.\nLocal records indicate that by 1712, Franciscans had returned to the abbey.  Some sources indicate that the abbey was abandoned again in 1731, for reasons which are unclear.  What's certain is that by 1753, they had returned to the site.  The property was now owned by Lord St. George, a local noble, who picked up where the Clanrickardes had left off and secretly patronised the abbey.  By this time, the Penal Laws were in effect and St. George risked life imprisonment by supporting the monks. A vengeful family who had lost a lawsuit to St. George reported to the authorities that he was sheltering Catholic religious at the monastery.  St. George learned of the accusations and the monks evacuated the monastery for the last time.  Before authorities arrived at the abbey, St. George had the abbey's interior whitewashed and had employed a group of weavers and their looms inside the building.  The inquiry was ended without further incident, but the sham factory was soon closed and the monks never returned again.\nThe monks built cabins of wood and stone on a small island in the Black River, about one mile (1.6 km) downstream from the abbey.  The island (which no longer exists) was known informally as \"Friars Island,\" and the community supported the monks with food, fuel and clothing via a wooden drawbridge.  For 36 years, the monks continued to celebrate Sunday Mass in the deteriorating abbey building.  In 1789, a Henry Lynch of Ballycurrin cheaply leased 16 acres (65,000 m2) to the dispossessed monks at the foot of a hill in the townland of Kilroe, near Headford.  By 1801, only three monks remained, though Mass continued to be said at Kilroe until 1804.  There were still three monks in the community when it was closed in 1832.\n\n\n=== Abandonment and neglect ===\n\nIn the meantime, the long-abandoned friary continued its descent into ruin.  In 1835, English tourist John Barrow described the abbey as \"a remarkably fine old ruin ... in a disgracefully neglected state.\"  In particular, Barrow was astonished by the large amount of unburied human remains at the site, which included \"moss-grown skulls and human thigh and leg-bones strewed about so plentifully that not a step can be taken without encountering them.\" Geographer Samuel Lewis noted the continued decay in 1837, writing that the abbey was \"partially covered in ivy\" and that the roof had collapsed in 1812.  Despite the neglect, Lewis was able to report that \"one of the windows is still perfect.\"William Wilde visited the abbey ruins in July 1866.  Like Barrow, he described \"heaps of skulls and bones\" in the church and claimed that the site had become notorious for its unburied remains.  Wilde noted with dismay that further \"desecration\" was being effected by sheep and cattle, which roamed freely through the ruins.  He also credited a nearby resident, Oliver Burke, with some early efforts to preserve the site by \"removing obstructions from between the mullions of the beautiful windows\" and making \"repairs to the tower, thereby rendering it accessible to the top.\" In 1868, Burke, a barrister by profession, wrote his own account of the friary's history.\n\n\n=== Today ===\nToday, the ruin of Ross Errilly is maintained by the Office of Public Works and is open to the public free of charge. It has been used as a filming location for Bad Karma, The Suicide Club, Moving Target & series Reign.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of abbeys and priories in Ireland (County Galway)\nHeadford\nSoraca Jonin\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMooney, Canice (1960), \"The Friary of Ross: Foundation and Early Years\", Journal of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society, 29: 7\u201314\nStalley, Roger (2003), \"The End of the Middle Ages: Gothic Survival in Sixteenth-Century Connacht\", The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, 133: 5\u201323\n\n\n== External links ==\nRoss Abbey at Irish Franciscans OFM\nTuam Herald, Saturday, August 7 1909 at Ireland Old News\nThe Irish Ecclesiastical Record, Vol. V, No. I, October 1868 at Library Ireland\nThe Dublin Penny Journal, Volume 1, Number 33, February 9, 1833 at Library Ireland\nA Topographical Dictionary of Ireland by Samuel Lewis at Library Ireland\nHistory of Ross Abbey at Headford.ie\nThe Annals of the Four Masters at University College Cork\nLong Ago in Ireland at Lawrencetown Village, Co.

        "wiki": "Galway ( GAWL-way; Irish: Gaillimh, pronounced [\u02c8\u0261al\u0320\u02b2\u026av\u02b2]) is a city in County Galway in the West of Ireland, in the province of Connacht. It lies on the River Corrib between Lough Corrib and Galway Bay, and is the sixth most populous city in Ireland, with a population at the 2016 Census of 79,934.Galway is renowned for its vibrant lifestyle and for hosting numerous festivals, celebrations and events such as The Galway Arts Festival. In 2018, it was named the European Region of Gastronomy. The city is currently the European Capital of Culture for 2020, alongside Rijeka, Croatia.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe city's name comes from the Irish name Gaillimhe, which formed the western boundary of the earliest settlement, D\u00fan Gaillimhe \"Fort Gaillimh\". (Mythical and alternative derivations of the name are given in History of Galway). Historically, the name was Anglicised as Galliv or Gallive, closer to the Irish pronunciation. The city's name in Latin is Galvia. Residents of the city are referred to as Galwegians.\nThe city also bears the nickname \"City of the Tribes\" (Irish: Cathair na dTreabh) because of the fourteen merchant families called the \"tribes of Galway\" who led the city in its Hiberno-Norman period.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nD\u00fan Gaillimhe (\"Fort at the Mouth (bottom) of the Gaillimh\") was constructed in 1124, by the King of Connacht, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088\u20131156). A settlement grew around it. During the Norman invasion of Connacht in the 1230s, D\u00fan Gaillimhe was captured by Richard Mor de Burgh, who had led the invasion. As the de Burghs eventually became Gaelicised, the merchants of the town, the Tribes of Galway, pushed for greater control over the walled city.\nThis led to their gaining complete control over the city and to the granting of mayoral status by the English crown in December 1484. Galway endured difficult relations with its Irish neighbours. A notice over the west gate of the city, completed in 1562 by Mayor Thomas \u00d3ge Martyn, stated \"From the Ferocious O'Flahertys may God protect us\". A by-law forbade the native Irish (as opposed to Galway's Hiberno-Norman citizens) unrestricted access into Galway, saying \"neither O\u2019 nor Mac shall strutte nor swagger through the streets of Galway\" without permission.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Galway was ruled by an oligarchy of fourteen merchant families (twelve who claimed to be of Norman origin and two of Irish origin). These were the \"Tribes of Galway\". The city thrived on international trade, and in the Middle Ages, it was the principal Irish port for trade with Spain and France. The most famous reminder of those days is ceann an bhalla (\"the end of the wall\"), now known as the Spanish Arch, constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin (1519\u201320). In 1477 Christopher Columbus visited Galway, possibly stopping off on a voyage to Iceland or the Faroe Islands. Seven or eight years later, he noted in the margin of his copy of Imago Mundi:\n\nMen of Cathay have come from the west. [Of this] we have seen many signs. And especially in Galway in Ireland, a man and a woman, of extraordinary appearance, have come to land on two tree trunks [or timbers? or a boat made of such?]\nThe most likely explanation for these bodies is that they were Inuit swept eastward by the North Atlantic Current.During the 16th and 17th centuries Galway remained loyal to the English crown for the most part, even during the Gaelic resurgence, perhaps for reasons of survival. However, by 1642 the city had allied itself with the Catholic Confederation of Kilkenny during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. During the resulting Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Cromwellian forces captured the city after a nine-month siege. At the end of the 17th century the city supported the Jacobites in the Williamite war in Ireland and was captured by the Williamites after a very short siege not long after the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. The great families of Galway were ruined. The city suffered further under the potato famines of 1845\u20131852, and it did not fully recover until the period of strong economic growth of the late 20th century (see Celtic Tiger).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike most of Ireland, Galway has an oceanic climate (Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, being one of the world's mildest cities for latitude, partly because it is on an island. Galway has a year-round mild, moist, temperate and changeable climate, due to the prevailing winds of the North Atlantic Current together with the Gulf Stream (on the other side of the Atlantic temperatures can be 20 \u00b0C cooler or more.). The city does not experience temperature extremes, with temperatures below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) being rare. The city receives an average of 1,156 mm (45.51 in) of precipitation annually, which is evenly distributed throughout the year. The average January temperature in the city is 5.9 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F) and the average July temperature is 15.9 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). The highest temperature ever recorded in Galway was 31.7 \u00b0C (89.1 \u00b0F) in July 1921, whilst the lowest temperature recorded was \u221211.7 \u00b0C (10.9 \u00b0F) in January 1945.While extreme weather is rare, the city and county can experience severe windstorms that are the result of vigorous Atlantic depressions that occasionally pass along the north west coast of Ireland. Most of these storms occur between late autumn and early spring. Due to the city's northerly location, Galway has long summer days. Sunrise on summer solstice occurs at 05:07 WEST and sunset at 22:07. By contrast, on winter solstice, the sun rises at 08:49 WET, and sets at 16:19.\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\nLynch's Castle on Shop Street is a medieval town house built by the prosperous Lynch family in the 16th century and is now a branch of Allied Irish Banks.\nThe Church of Ireland St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church is the largest medieval church still in everyday use in Ireland. It was founded in 1320 and enlarged in the following two centuries.\nThe Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas was consecrated in 1965 and is a far larger building constructed from limestone. It has an eclectic style, with a Renaissance Revival dome, pillars and round arches, and a Romanesque Revival portico that dominates the main fa\u00e7ade \u2013 which is an unusual feature in modern Irish church building.\nThe original quadrangle building of NUI Galway which was erected in 1849 (during the Great Famine or An Gorta M\u00f3r) as one of the three colleges of the Queen's University of Ireland (along with Queen's University Belfast and University College Cork).

The diocese is under the patronage Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas (Galway), Saint Fachanan (Kilmacduagh) and St Colman (Kilfenora). As the diocese of Kilfenora is in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Cashel the Bishop of Galway is its Apostolic Administrator rather than its bishop. The dioceses of Galway and Kilmacduagh are in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Tuam. The current bishop is Most Rev. Martin Drennan, installed 3 July 2005.

These operate from a number of locations:\n\nThe main bus and rail station in the city is Ceannt Station.\nGalway Coach Station, located at Fairgreen, is also a coach transport hub. Scheduled direct and commuter services operate between the Coach Station, Dublin and Dublin Airport, as well as services to Limerick, Cork and Clifden. These are operated by Gobus and Citylink.\nOther regional bus operators use various bus stops around the city centre, and many serve the NUIG and GMIT campuses as well.\n\n\n==== Rail ====\n\nGalway's main railway station is Ceannt Station (St\u00e1isi\u00fan Cheannt), which opened in 1851, and was renamed in honour of \u00c9amonn Ceannt in 1966. A major redevelopment, including a completely new urban district, Ceannt Station Quarter, has been proposed for the station and adjoining land.\nThe Midland Great Western Railway reached Galway in 1851, giving the city a direct main line to its Broadstone Station terminus in Dublin. As the 19th century progressed the rail network in Connacht was expanded, making Galway an important railhead. The nearby town of Athenry became a railway junction, giving Galway links to Ennis, Limerick and the south in 1869 and Sligo and the north in 1894. In 1895 the MGW opened a branch line between Galway and Clifden.\nThe 20th century brought increasing road competition, and this led the Great Southern Railways to close the Clifden branch in 1935. In the 1970s the state railway authority C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann closed the Sligo-Athenry-Ennis line to passenger services. It later closed to freight as well.\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann, Ireland's national rail operator, currently runs six return passenger services each day between Galway and Dublin Heuston, also serving intermediate stations. Travel time is just under 3 hours. Services on the Galway\u2013Limerick line have now resumed, with around 5\u20136 trains each way per day.\nFrom Galway railway services along the Western Rail Corridor link the city with Ennis, and Limerick where trains run to Cork via Limerick Junction (for Tipperary, Clonmel and Waterford) and Mallow (for Killarney and Tralee).\n\n\n==== Road ====\nFour national primary roads serve the city: the M6 motorway running east\u2013west (Athlone, Dublin), the M17 motorway running north from the M6 to Tuam, the N63, formerly the N17, connecting Galway with the Northwest (Tuam, Sligo, Donegal Town, Letterkenny and Derry), and the M18 motorway linking Galway to southern towns and cities Gort, Ennis, Shannon Town, Limerick and Cork joining up with The Wild Atlantic Way. In addition, there are plans for a semi-ring road of the city, the Galway City Outer Bypass. There is also an Inner City Ring (Cuar Inmhe\u00e1nach) route that encircles the city centre, most of which is pedestrianised.\nGalway is considered the gateway to Connemara and the Gaeltacht, including M\u00e1m, An Teach D\u00f3ite, Cor na M\u00f3na, Ros Muc, Bearna and An Cheathr\u00fa Rua. The N59 along the western shore of Lough Corrib and the R337 along the northern shore of Galway Bay both lead to this largely rural and highly scenic region.\n\n\n==== Waterways ====\nThe River Corrib is by far the most important waterway in Galway and a number of canals and channels were built above and through the city. The purposes of these to divert and control the water from the river, to harness its power and to provide a navigable route to the sea.  Of these, there were two major schemes \u2013 one between 1848 and 1858 and the other during the 1950s. The canals provided a power source for Galway and were the location of the first industries in the mid-19th century. The Eglinton Canal provided a navigation from the sea (at the Claddagh Basin) to the navigable part of the river (above the Salmon Weir Bridge). Most of the mills are still used today for various purposes; for instance, NUI Galway still uses a water turbine for electricity generation for their building on Nun's Island.\nCurrently, there are four bridges across the Corrib. Following the southward flow of the river these are, from the north: the Quincentennial Bridge, the Salmon Weir Bridge, the William O'Brien Bridge and the Wolfe Tone Bridge. There are plans for a fifth bridge as part of the Galway City Outer Bypass project. The Clare River flows from the North of the County Galway, through Tuam, Claregalway into Lough Corrib.\n\n\n==== Harbour ====\n\nGalway is the most central port on the West Coast of Ireland in the sheltered eastern corner of Galway Bay. The harbour can be used by vessels up to 10,000 tonnes deadweight (DWT) and the inner dock can accommodate up to 9 vessels at any one time. Pending approval, Galway Harbour may see major changes, should the \u20ac1.5 billion development plan go ahead.\nRegular passenger ferry and freight services operate between Galway and the tourist destination of the Aran Islands which is home to World Heritage Site D\u00fan Aonghasa. The islands also have regular links with the towns of Rossaveal and Doolin, which are physically closer but far smaller.\nCommuter ferry services have been proposed to the tourism town of Kinvara, on the opposite side of Galway Bay.Major work in the harbour area was carried out in 2009 to accommodate the stopover of the Volvo Ocean Race. This was one of the biggest events ever to visit Galway. The event returned with the finale of the race in June 2012. This was unprecedented in Volvo Ocean Race history.\n\n\n==== Walking ====\nThe city is planned as the start of the E2 European long-distance path, running for 4,850 kilometres (3,010 mi) to Nice, though the Irish section is as yet incomplete.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nGalway Textile Printers, located on Sandy Road, was the first major industry to come to Galway and quickly became one of the biggest employers in the west of Ireland. Some of those who worked there were specialists who were brought in to help set the factory up, but most employees were local. The Mills eventually went out of business in the early 1980s and its former site now hosts various small business establishments.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAs of 2002, there were 27 primary schools and 11 secondary schools in Galway.\n\n\n=== University ===\nNUI Galway was founded in 1845 as Queen's College, Galway, and was more recently known as University College, Galway (U.C.G.). It is divided into several colleges including the College of Arts, Social Science and Celtic Studies, the College Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences,  the College of Business, Public Policy and Law, the College of Science and the College of Engineering and Informatics. The university had an enrollment of 16000 in 2010.\nThe Biomedical Research Building was opened in 2014. It houses the Regenerative Medicine Institute (REMEDI). Also opened in 2014 were the Hardiman Building and a School of Psychology. The Hardiman Building is home to the university's collection of more than 350 literary, theatrical, political and historical archives. The building houses also the Moore Institute for Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences and the Whitaker Institute for Innovation and Societal Change. The National Institute for Prevention and Cardiovascular Health (NIPC) is an affiliate of NUI Galway.The offices of the Central Applications Office (C.A.O.) are also located in the city, this being the clearing house for undergraduate college and university applications in the Republic of Ireland; a related organisation, the Postgraduate Applications Centre, processes some taught postgraduate courses.\n\n\n=== Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) ===\n\nGMIT, in addition to having two campuses in Galway City, also has campuses in Castlebar, Letterfrack and Mountbellew. GMIT's Galway campus is based on the Dublin Road in Galway city, overlooking Galway Bay. It is the administrative headquarters for the Institute and has four Schools of study; the School of Business, the School of Engineering, the School of Science & Computing, and the College of Tourism & Arts.\n\n\n== Health ==\nPublicly funded health care and social services are provided in Galway by the HSE (West) division of the Health Services Executive.\nThe main city hospital, University Hospital Galway, is located on two campuses \u2014 Galway University Hospital and Merlin Park University Hospital.Two private hospitals \u2013 The Galway Clinic and the Bon Secours Hospital, Galway \u2013 also operate in the city.\nGalway Hospice provides palliative care for the people of Galway City and County on a homecare, inpatient and daycare basis.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of twin towns and sister cities in the Republic of Ireland\nThe Galway Line\nTerryland Forest Park\nGalway Technology Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Galway travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGalway City Council (local authority)\nGalway City and County Cultural Website",

          "Galway was always a little less conservative than many other cities in Ireland, but this visit proved it has really excelled itself. With pedestrianised winding old streets, many buildings done up, lots of pubs and restaurants, buskers, little interesting shops, arty shops,",
          "The Latin Quarter counts Galway's many tourists among its visitors, but also the local residents. There are many pubs, many with live music at night, and the occasional outdoor musician,",
          "Was not expecting what we found when we got to town. It is mainly pedestrianised, loads of independent shops, bars and eateries, such a pleasant change from the same old rows of chain stores. There were bands playing on the streets, and an Irish dancer all dressed in traditional",
          "The street entertainers kept us returning to the Latin Quarter again and again. Many small bars and restaurants, and a few souvenir shops, but the joy of the Latin Quarter are the street performers.",
          "The Latin Quarter is a pedestrian area with lots of activity. There are almost always buskers performing different types of music and many pubs and restaurants.",
          "Pedestrian zone in the oldest part of Galway, with buskers on the street performing everything from Danny Boy to Summertime Blues, as well as dancing, doing magic, and juggling. A great area to stroll and enjoy, with many bars and great restaurants along with shops and lovely",

          "Visited in order to see the venue of a fave BBC show (Jack Taylor) and greatly enjoyed our stay! The street music was amazing and the pub music very enjoyable. We were there only two days and loved every minute! Only downside was no one had ever heard of Jack Taylor?",
          "Lots of shops, restaurants and pubs. Musicians playing in the streets. There's a market on certain days til 2 pm with lots of local crafts and food. Great lively area.",
          "A busy spot with plenty of restaurants, bars, shops and street performers to watch and listen too. Take a stroll and you'll be sure to make several stops along the way.",
          "There isn't a real Latin Quarter in Galway and this is something that has been created. Having said that, it is on the fringe of the City and the Craic and pleasure of the immediate City are wonderful",
          "While in Galway make way to the Latin Quarter during the day to check out the shops and pubs. The town is very walkable unless you have limitations. It is cobblestoned and some shops can be very tight upon entry.",
          "There are plenty of shops and attractions here to see and visit. Lots of photo opportunities for tourists :)!",
          "Nice to walk around and see both locals and tourists drink beer standing outside of the pubs. Plenty of shops for your souvenirs.",

          "While I risk offending, I have to say the Latin Quarter in Galway was the least favorite spot on a two and half week visit to Ireland. Highly overrated, in my opinion, the quarter is overrun and very, very crowded. Mostly over-rated restaurants and shops now, the entire few",
          "All the streets merge in Galway and it is difficult to see when one finishes and the other starts, not like China Town etc. However, great bars & restaurants, buskers, great fun and lively make it a must see when in Galway.",
          "We loved it here. Lovely little streets with lots of little restaurants. There were also jewellery shops - all very Celtic or claddagh in style and a lovely old fashioned sweet shop. The area is really buzzing and happy with lots of street entertainers including Irish dancing",

          "Since the regeneration of this part of the city the Latin Quarter offers a variety of shops, pubs, eating places (usually connected with the aforementioned pubs), It comes alive early morning and stays alive until the beginning of the following morning",

          "Energizing area--we were concerned about safety, but did not experience any problems whatsoever even when it was getting late in the evening.",
          "I grew up in Galway nearly 60 years ago. The concept of a \"Latin Quarter\" then was very far from the minds of the fishermen and women wearing shawls so long ago! For visitors to Galway a stroll in the Latin Quarter is a must. As it's almost completely pedestrianised, it is very",
          "Good to spend a bit of time wandering around. Lot of tourists knocking about. Bars and restaurants very busy. Never ate or drank here though.",
          "There is so much going on in Galway and the Latin Quarter was so fun to walk around, enjoy the musicians and other performers on the streets and get a bite to eat in anyone of the great restaurants here. We loved this city so much and this area was a main reason why!",

          "There seems to be something always happening. Something to draw your attention or a shop with something curious to see. If not, there is always a pub to sit and chat while drinking a pint. Would love to return and do some more exploring.",
          "This is what in my mind has always been the picture of a typical \"European\" street: outdoor cafes, uneven streets, cobblestones, buildings of different shapes, sizes, heights, and colors, people strolling, local artists, and CULTURE!",
          "The many times I have been in this area (mostly in May and June) I have had a great time just browsing and people watching. It can be VERY busy all day long but when it's raining and you don't want to drive anywhere it will keep you entertained day and night.",
          "I walked this area twice in the last year. My recommendation is to just walk, and make turns. On one street, you think you are in Dublin. The next street in Greenwich Village, the next street in some olde European city.",
          "Full of people and lots going on, but it is pretty touristy. Better cheaper food can be found just off the main street in the quarter. It is without doubt worth walking through, but it is not over the top exciting either.",
          "If you are looking for a quiet, empty or tranquil setting, then this is definitely not the place, however if you are looking for a lively place full of energy, noise and people come to the Latin Quarter in Galway. It is a hive of activity, lots of street performers, some of whom",

          "Music, food & drinks, art, shopping - this is all about Latin Quarter. We enjoyed performances there and had a great meal in the Quay restaurant. The place is very touristy, so be ready to immerse in noise & hustle if you're going there.",
          "This only comprises a few of Galway's streets but there is so much going on. There are various performers on the streets and an atmosphere of a lively city. The diverse crowds add to this atmosphere.",
          "Walking around Galways Latin Quarter will make you happy. It's really getting into the soul of the city and what an atmosphere. There are many pubs and restaurants to sit outside and enjoy a coffee/drink or just watch the people walk by. It's got such a unique charm and is",

          "High Street flowing into Quay Street is the focus of this area, but the streets to the side include some nice pubs & restaurants (like Vina Mara) and are also worth exploring",
          "We made a city tour of Galway enroute to our next hotel. The Latin Quarter is a good place to grab lunch or just hang out in a bar for a few hours. I would not make a special stop to visit, but if you need a break this is a good spot. It's very walkable with plenty of eating",

          "I wouldn't call it very latin but it's a lovely area to roam around at your own leisure and soak up the atmosphere.",
          "First let us describe the relatively small area known as the Latin Quarter. Sttrat from the Spanish Arch and walk towards Wolfetone Bridge, turn right at Jurys Inn Hotel and go for a few metres down Quay Street, then turn left onto Kirwan's lane. When you reach Cross Street turn",

          "There is lots of shopping, restaurants and bars. A great atmosphere with lots going on, music and poetry ect",
          "Go to the museum first - it will help put everything in context and then just wander around - the King's Head is a good place for lunch or a late drink, but there are plenty of places to try. Everything comes in multiples of fourteen.",
          "Although Galway's Latin Quarter is a bit touristy we really enjoyed the atmosphere and the music on the streets. After some shopping we stopped at one of the pubs to have a couple drinks and listen to a live band playing Irish music. I would like to visit again on a non rainy",

        "wiki": "Baile Chl\u00e1ir or Baile Chl\u00e1ir na Gaillimhe (anglicized Claregalway) is a Gaeltacht village about 10 km north of Galway in County Galway, Ireland. Claregalway was founded on the banks of the River Clare, hence the derivation of its name: Baile Chl\u00e1ir na Gaillimhe meaning \"town on the Clare, in Galway\". Claregalway lies within the Gaeltacht and traditionally most of the locals would have spoken English only as a second language. Until September 2017, the village sat at the junction of the busy N17 and N18 national primary routes with over 27,000 vehicles having formerly passed through the village every day.\n\n\n== Irish language ==\nThere are 2,375 people living in the Baile Chlair ED and 12% are native Irish speakers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis village has an ancient heritage stretching back over a thousand years. It has many features of historical interest but two of the largest ones on the banks of the river include the Claregalway Friary, founded in mid-13th century, and a Norman watchtower (small castle) completed in the 16th century. During 2001, a restoration of an old bridge over the old course of the River Clare was completed. These nine stone arches are above the level of the current road.\nClaregalway Parish is one of the largest in the county and includes a number of townlands (small clusters of houses) some of the bigger being Carnmore, Lydican, Loughgeorge and Cregboy. Lydican is notable as the origin of the Irish ancestors (Patrick Lynch) of Che Guevara. Lydican was actually an O'Heyne Castle and the last of the chieftains, Connor Crone O Heyne, was living there in 1612. The lands of the O'Heyne chieftains was confiscated in the late 17th century and it was then that the Lynches took up residence there. The Lynches principal holdings were in the city of Galway.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAgriculture would once have been the main industry. In recent years the population has been expanding rapidly since the village is within the commuter belt of Galway City. Some city workers are choosing to live outside the city environs in a more rural setting. However, the larger population has also led to the growth of the service and retail sector and has provided additional local employment.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nClaregalway hosts a drama festival each year in March. Comp\u00e1ntas Lir is an amateur drama group which is based in Claregalway and Carnmore. The group tours nationally in the springtime as part of the All-Ireland Drama Circuit.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nClaregalway CLG is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club.\nClaregalway Basketball club participate in local leagues at underage through to senior level.\nClaregalway Handball club has members from 7 to 70+ years old. A new-arena style handball alley was opened by the club in 2018.\n\n\n== Annals of Connacht ==\n1469: O Domnaill led a great army into Connacht to meet Macwilliam Burke. They both proceeded to Claregalway and burnt the town in spite of Thomond and Macwilliam, spent a night encamped there and were refused battle then. The next day they burnt the whole of Machaire Clainne Taidc, killing many horses and many men, including Domnall, son of O Conchobair of Corcomroe.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nDana Rosemary Scallon, Irish singer and former MEP.\nHector \u00d3 hEochag\u00e1in Irish comedian, TV and radio presenter.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \u2014 a community-curated website for Claregalway\nClaregalway Castle - Claregalway's landmark castle\nIrish language study 2006",

        "wiki": "The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers is an underground comic about a fictional trio of stoner characters, created by the American artist Gilbert Shelton. The Freak Brothers first appeared in The Rag, an underground newspaper published in Austin, Texas, beginning in May 1968, and were regularly reprinted in underground papers around the United States and in other parts of the world. Later their adventures were published in a series of comic books.\nThe lives of the Freak Brothers revolve around the procurement and enjoyment of recreational drugs, particularly marijuana. The comics present a critique of the establishment, while satirizing counterculture.Fat Freddy's Cat appears in many of the stories, spinning off his own cartoon strip (which appeared as part of the Freak Brothers comic page, in the manner of older comic strip double features) and later some full-length episodes.\nAn animated version, The Freak Brothers, was released in 2020.\n\n\n== Comic strips ==\nThe Freak Brothers first appeared in The Rag, an underground newspaper published in Austin, Texas, beginning in May 1968. Their debut was in an advertising flyer for a winter 1968 film short called The Texas Hippies March on the Capitol. Freak Brothers strips soon became popular and were regularly reprinted in underground papers around the United States and in other parts of the world.\nThe Freak Brothers' first comic book appearance was in Feds 'n' Heads, self-published by Shelton in the spring of 1968 (and later re-issued in multiple printings by Berkeley's the Print Mint). They also appeared in the first two issues of Jay Lynch's Bijou Funnies. In 1969 Shelton and three friends from Texas founded Rip Off Press in San Francisco, which took over publication of all subsequent Freak Brothers comics. The first compilation of their adventures, The Collected Adventures of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers, had its first printing in 1971 and has been continually in print ever since. In addition to underground and college weekly newspapers, new adventures appeared in magazines such as Playboy, High Times, and Rip Off Comix; these too were collected in comic book form. Shelton continued to write and draw the series until 1992, in collaboration with Dave Sheridan (1974\u20131982, his death) and Paul Mavrides (1978-1992).\nThe majority of the comic books consist of one or more multi-page stories together with a number of one-page strips; many of the latter have a one-row skit featuring Fat Freddy's Cat at the bottom of the page. Issues #8-10 contained only the long-form story \"The Idiots Abroad\", which The Comics Journal listed as #44 of the \"100 Greatest Comics of the Century.\" The UK newspaper The Guardian said of a 2003 reprint of the story that, \"The graphic quality is, even in slightly muddy reproduction, astonishing. Depictions of various European cities recall Herg\u00e9 in their accuracy and detail ... As for the subject matter, considering the dates of composition, it has hardly dated.\"\n\n\n== Characters ==\nThe Freak Brothers are not siblings. They are a threesome of freaks (similar to, but distinct from, hippies) from San Francisco.\n\nFreewheelin' Franklin Freek, although laid-back, is the most street-smart of the trio. Apparently he has always been on the streets and it appears that he is several years older than the others. He is certainly old enough to be troubled at times by impotence. In one story he reveals that he grew up in an orphanage and never knew his parents. Tall and skinny, he has a big bulbous nose, a waterfall mustache and a ponytail. He wears cowboy boots and a cowboy hat. In one strip, he runs into an ex-girlfriend who has a child that bears a striking resemblance to him. He does his best to evade them and is relieved when she does not recognize him. In another strip, when he meets his own (possible) father, the same plot is inverted. Depending on the level of colorization used in the strip in question, Franklin's hair is red, blonde, or light brown.Phineas T. Phreak is the intellectual and idealist of the group. He has enough mastery of chemistry to create new drugs and takes an avid interest in politics. Of the three, he is the most committed to social change and environmental issues. He is from Texas and while his mother is relaxed and open-minded, his father is a card-carrying member of the John Birch Society. He is the hairiest of the brothers\u2014tall and skinny with a thick bush of black hair, a beard, a nose bearing more than a passing resemblance to a joint, and glasses. He is the stereotypical left-wing radical, bearing a superficial resemblance to Abbie Hoffman or Jerry Rubin.Fat Freddy Freekowtski is the least intelligent of the trio and is most likely to be preoccupied with food. He is fat, with curly yellow hair and a mustache. His compulsion to eat is the subject of several of the adventures of the group. Fat Freddy frequently gets \"burned\" during drug transactions; when he does \"score\" he typically contrives to lose the drugs in various ways, such as by dumping them out of a shopping bag in front of a cooling fan, which then blows them out the window onto a police car. Fat Freddy comes from an unexceptional large family in Cleveland.  In The Idiots Abroad, Freddy visits the Polish village of Gfatsk, where everybody happens to look like him. He is driven away by an angry mob as soon as they hear the name Freekowtski.Other recurring characters include:\n\nFat Freddy's Cat appears mainly in his own, separate strip at the bottom of the one-page Freak Brothers strips (getting his start just as Krazy Kat did). He also has several multi-page stories devoted to him. Many of his strips parallel a storyline in the corresponding Freak Brothers story, and often have themes of a scatological nature. He has several \"nephews\" who refer to him as \"Uncle F.\" and sometimes finds himself confronting an organized army of cockroaches or a huge tribe of mice who share the apartment with the Freak Brothers. He is far smarter than his owner (whom he frequently refers to as \"the obese one\") and regards the Freak Brothers with amused contempt. He is also the subject of several spin-off collections of stories.Norbert the Nark, an inept DEA agent who is continually trying, and failing, to arrest the Freak Brothers.Hiram \"Country\" Cowfreak, a hippy who grows vast quantities of marijuana at his isolated farmstead. He is referred to as the Freak Brothers' \"cousin\".Dealer McDope, one of the trio's dealers. He is often mentioned in the strips but rarely appears in person. The character was initially created by Dave Sheridan for the Rip Off Press title Mother's Oats Comix.Tricky Prickears, a blind, deaf and reactionary detective, sometimes billed as \"The Freak Brothers' favorite law enforcement officer\". The character is a parody of Dick Tracy, to the extent that Shelton drew his appearances in a different style, resembling that of Tracy's creator Chester Gould.Governor Rodney Richpigge, a stereotypically rich, corrupt politician whom the Freak Brothers hold in general contempt. The Governor's son is a cocaine dealer.\n\n\n== Story-lines and themes ==\n\nDrug use is the predominant theme that runs throughout all volumes of this title. The protagonists \"live in a state of blissful torpor relieved only by bursts of paranoia or stimulant-induced frenzy.\" Marijuana is the most frequently mentioned, but numerous other stimulants and hallucinogens are mentioned as well. Heroin is usually missing from the list. In one adventure, Franklin is shown to turn down an offer of \"smack\" when hitching a ride.Food is a recurring subject. These stories most often involve Fat Freddy and his marijuana-induced \"munchies\" (increased appetite). The squalor engendered by the Brothers' indolence is often highlighted; several strips feature the household's cockroach population, ruled over by a fascist monarchy. Several stories satirize governments, particularly the U.S. government. These stories invariably show politicians and their agents as corrupt, incompetent, or both. The theme of foreign travel is sometimes explored, most notably in the three-part Idiots Abroad series.\nIt is common for the story-lines to begin with an air of realism, but rapidly descend into comic pantomime.\nClassic Freak Brothers stories include:\n\nGrass Roots: The Brothers find a year's supply of cocaine and move to the country with the proceeds. They snort it all in two days. The Brothers are joined by a trio of hippie women who join them in their misadventures: the dilapidated farmhouse, Freddy's run in with a hillbilly drug dealer, the rumor of gold on the property, and Phineas running for sheriff.\nChariot of the Globs: Fat Freddy's Cat is abducted by aliens.\nThe Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers in the 21st Century: The Brothers experience life in the future.\nKnock 'em Dead: The Brothers for a punk band.\nThe 7th Voyage of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers: A Mexican Odyssey: The Brothers holiday in Mexico, are thrown in jail and escape with the help of shaman Don Longjuan, in an oblique parody of the Carlos Castaneda books.\nThe Idiots Abroad: The Brothers are split up attempting to travel to Colombia hoping to score cheap dope down there, yet none of them manages to reach Bogot\u00e1; Fat Freddy accidentally joins a group of nuclear terrorists in Scotland before disrupting the International Workers' Day military parade in Moscow, USSR and being subsequently sold to slavery in Africa; Franklin is almost killed by a native apocalyptic South American cult before joining a group of pirates; while Phineas ends up in Mecca and becomes the world's richest man after founding a new religion.\n\n\n== Catchphrases ==\nThe Freak Brothers comics include several catchphrases:\n\nDope will get you through times of no money better than money will get you through times of no dope.\n\u2014Freewheelin' Franklin. The Los Angeles Public Library featured Anne Herbert's modification of the original quote written by Gilbert Shelton: \"Books will get you through times of no money better than money will get you through times of no books\"; this was used on a in-library poster featuring the likeness of the Freewheelin' Franklin character.\n\"Don't get burned!\" (usually aimed at Fat Freddy as he sets out to purchase drugs)\nSmoking grass and drinking beer is like pissing into the wind.\nWhile you're out there smashing the state, don't forget to keep a smile on your lips and a song in your heart!\n\n\n== Other appearances ==\n\n\n=== In film ===\nIn 1973, without permission from Gilbert Shelton, The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers appeared in the full-length pornographic film Up in Flames. The story involved the brothers' attempts to raise cash to make their rent deadline (the trio being in danger of being evicted from their apartment). Fat Freddy gains employment at a local food store run by graphic artist Robert Crumb's character Mr. Natural (also used without permission).\nDirector Paul Thomas Anderson said the look of Joaquin Phoenix's lead character, Larry \"Doc\" Sportello, in Anderson's 2014 adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel Inherent Vice, was based in part on characters in the comics. \"[T]here's this documentary on Daniel Ellsberg, called The Most Dangerous Man in America. There's a great picture of a buddy of his who has this great set of glasses, a floppy hat and these mutton chops. I took a still frame from that and I sent it to [Phoenix], along with the omnibus collection of The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers comic, by Gilbert Shelton\u2014and that's probably the most we really talked about [Phoenix's portrayal of the character].\"\n\nIn 2006, the company Grass Roots Films began production on a feature-length clay-animation film based on the series, called Grass Roots, co-produced by German distribution company X Filme. In 2013, work on the film stopped.\n\n\n=== Animated TV show ===\nAn animated series based on the characters, set in modern San Francisco, is being developed for release in 2020. It features four cannabis-loving, time-traveling \u201cFreaks\u201d from the late 1960s \u2013 Freewheelin\u2019 Franklin, Phineas, Fat Freddy and Fat Freddy\u2019s Cat. Known as The Freak Brothers, the show features Woody Harrelson, Tiffany Haddish, Pete Davidson, and John Goodman as voice actors for the 3 Freaks & the cat.

        "wiki": "Salthill (Irish: B\u00f3thar na Tr\u00e1) is a seaside area in the City of Galway in the west of Ireland. Lying within the townland of Lenaboy (an L\u00e9ana Bu\u00ed), it attracts many tourists all year round. There is a 2 km long promenade, locally known as the Prom, overlooking Galway Bay with bars, restaurants and hotels.\n\n\n== Tourism and events ==\n\nSalthill was, until 2007, home to one of the biggest non-fee paying air shows in Galway, the Salthill Air Show, which took place in June over Galway Bay. The show annually attracted over 100,000 people and generated over \u20ac1m in revenue.The 1970s saw the introduction of a number of casinos and more leisure centres.\nSalthill was a centre point for the 2008\u201309 Volvo Ocean Race, as well as the Round-Ireland Powerboat race in 2010.\nEvery Christmas Day for many years it has been a tradition to jump into the sea from Blackrock Diving Tower. This record-breaking event is now a fundraiser for local charity in Galway.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSalthill-Knocknacarra is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. The team has won the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship, beating St. Gall's in the 2006 final.\nSalthill Devon F.C. are the local football team. They played in the League of Ireland's second tier, called First Division, from 2010 to 2013, before merging with Mervue United and GUST, the supporters trust of the defunct Galway United, to form Galway F.C..\nPearse Stadium, one of Galway GAA's two primary stadiums (the other being St Jarlath's Park), is found on Dr Mannix Road in Salthill.\nThe Galway Lawn Tennis Club, winner of Irish Tennis Club of the Year in 2002, is located on Threadneedle Road.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nSalthill railway station opened on 1 October 1879 and closed for passenger traffic in January 1918. The nearest station is Galway.\nCurrently there is one city bus service: Bus \u00c9ireann's route 401, which runs to Eyre Square only at a 20-minute frequency from 7am to 7pm Monday-Saturday and 40-minute at other times. That same operator also runs the regional buses 416 and 424 from the Bus Station into Connemara which pass via Salthill.Until December 2012, City Direct Galway ran route 413 from Eyre Square via Salthill to Knocknacarra, which carried the number 36 before City Direct's service renumbering and remapping in July 2012.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nThe Long Walk and the Salthill promenade are both referenced in the Steve Earle penned tune \"Galway Girl\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\nWild Atlantic Way\nGalway Bay\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Such a beautiful place. Went walking here during my time in galway. Beach and promenade very well maintained and views were amazing",
          "Just as the weather changes so does the Promenade at Salthill. We stayed in an hotel overlooking the promenade last week and I was amazed to see people walking it - hail, rain or shine from 7.00am till late. In fact watching the all-year round swimmers was amazing too - on the",
          "Lovely place if the weather is good. If it\u2019s raining, it can be a little miserable. There is a nice board you can dive off of into the water if you\u2019re into that. Also a cool aquarium nearby.",
          "Great place for a good coastal walk and the kids loved the pier jumping and swimming scene! This is definitely somewhere the locals flock at the weekend with lots of people watching to be had. Nice tiered seating area for those not brave enough for the cold sea",
          "We were staying in Galway so took a drive down the road to Salthill to walk along the Promenade. The sun was out and so were the swimmers. With a few brave souls diving in.",
          "Great Walk, Great Swiming Facilities. Outdoor changing areas. Amazing Areas to Walk. Kids loved the Spins on the Amusments. Coffee and Icecream all the way along. Great Day Out.",
          "We had a lovely walk on the promenade on a windy morning after Storm Ellen. It was very clean and litter free. Lots of seaweed washed op on the sand but that was due to the storm. We did a 2K walk but we couldn\u2019t find a toilet! That was a disappointment.",
          "It is a very nice walk with amazing views. Very easy for small kids as they can walk on the pavement or they can sit in a pushchair. The only thing to keep in mind is that it is a popular place and on a sunny day there are thousands of people! It can be very very crowded.",
          "Went here on a Sunday and it was packed-we found somewhere along one of the concrete piers to sit-nice that theres a few seperate beaches though",

          "Lovely spot to walk, run, swim or cycle etc. Weather can be changeable but definitely worth the visit. Plenty of parking available if you want to drive but its also close enough to city centre that you could walk if you fancied it. Plenty of coffee shops, restaurants and bars",

          "A trip to Salthill isn\u2019t complete without a walk on the prom. If you do nothing else you have to do this. My wife and I drive 80 minutes for a cuppa coffee and a prom walk and 80 minutes to get home. Hail, rain, snow and glorious sunshine it doesn\u2019t matter. The hail, rain, snow",

          "Walked from Galway town to charmless Salthill. The promenade is a poorly maintained slab of tarmac. Only one place to eat/ drink on the promenade itself, by the aquarium, as the others are set back behind a couple roads and a roundabout. Casinos and games arcades abound. The",

          "The promenade is a long, large and secure path to enjoy the gorgeous sea view. It starts at the Spanish Arch in Galway and it ends far far away at the end of Salthill area, beside the Golf fields. The runners have plenty of space to enjoy their activities and families with",

          "The Salthill promenade is an excellent place to take a walk, walk the dog or just jog and sit out. Though it was very cold, it didn\u2019t take away the beauty of the environment when I had a late afternoon stroll. You can walk up to the waste water plant at Mount Island which you",

          "A most iconic and magnificent promenade, which is beloved by Galwegians and visitors alike. Doesnt matter what time of the year you visit it (only of course, if its not blowing Gale Force 8 West/Southwest-), just get out and walk it. And what a healthy walk in the sea air it",
          "What an asset to Galway is this prom, it is a bracing walk on a windy day, and at full tide what an experience, especially at sunset. To manage to complete this walk both ways from end to end is the best form of exercise.",
          "Woke up to a beautiful morning on our 2nd day in Galway and decided to walk the Salthill Promenade. Both locals and tourists utilize the pathways along the way, moms with kids and babies in strollers, joggers, people riding bikes and people just ambling along the well paved",

          "Beautiful walk & scenery, especially at sun rise or shortly after when it's still quiet and peaceful.",
          "The walk was just beautiful. It is about a 2.5km walk along the shoreline. We had great weather and there are lots of small businesses to visit along the way.",
          "We truly had the luck of the Irish on this trip, as people were actually swimming in Galway Bay when we took an evening walk along the miles long Promenade. My only regret is that we didn't realize where to exactly be in order to watch the sun set over Galway Bay, but what we",
          "The rain squalls couldn't diminish our enjoyment of the walk along the sea. We even clambered over the stone wall to do some sea glass searching on the beach. This would be great for families!",
          "One of the best days of the trip involved walking along the promenade from Jury's Inn to Salthill, having a tasty lunch, and then seeing Downton Abbey (yes, ironic to be in Ireland and seeing it) for a matinee. The locals use it to exercise and just walk with family/friends.",
          "Has to be one of the most beautiful places in Ireland. Any time of the day or night. Busy or quite. It's just the perfect place to sit and watch the waves. And watch the sun go set over Galway Bay.",

          "Luckily this is only one block from my B and B. Always Activity when I have walked. Beautiful view of Galway Bay. You can walk to restaurants in the evening or watch the swimmers in the early part of the day. Hub of activity and usually if u are driving No problem parking. If u",

          "We drove over on a beautiful sunny Friday evening. The waiter in our hotel had told us about a local tradition of \"kicking the wall\"!! He said as a child his mother brought him over every Sunday and mad him kick the wall when they arrived and again as they left. It's supposed to",
          "This walk by the bay, Galway Bay, is a wonderful way we spent part of our morning. It was a sunny day which made it even more attractive to us. It is a good lengthy walk and it was busy with others walking too. The view of the Bay is tremendous. It is another must see!",
          "a lovely walk from galway city to salthill with fresh wild Atlantic air in your lungs. great scenery and the promenade is big enough to cater for the crowds. maybe a few more coffee shops and toilets on route would be no harm but worth the walk",

          "Past the Spanish Gate and cross the Wolfe Tone Bridge, we began our walk to Salthill. We continued along Claddagh Quay to Nimmo\u2019s Pier and South Park. It was a lovely day to enjoy the open spaces along the shore of Galway Bay. We took advantage of a park bench on the pier to",
          "From Galway City out to way beyond we went, the Salthill Promenade is accompanied by the stunning panorama of Galway Bay. If you get bored of the view, there are many options to nip over the road for a break at one of the cafes, or you can sit and people watch. Superb.",
          "Take a nice slow stroll...dress well for the weather. Can be blustery. We were there mid September.....",
          "Fantastic promenade to walk. I park up near the aquarium and walk towards town on the sea front. The path goes all the way in as far the claddagh and has no cars for approx 1/2 this distance. There\u2019s a causeway also which goes out into the bay, it\u2019s great to get the full feel of",
          "The boardwalk is a must see when in Galway. A walk along the promenade is very nice and relaxing. I miss it!",
          "I am biased, because I grew up in Salthill. But whenever I come back, it seems that they have extended the Promenade walk even further, and the whole place seems cleaner and more impressive than when I was a kid. Running on the Promenade was my favorite activity this summer.",
          "Great spot in the Salthill area for a walk along the water. Walk the entire way and see the swimmers in the water and diving off the platform. Be sure to kick the wall at the end just like they did 100 years ago!",
          "Lovely, tidy, clean, good walk way by the sea. Anytime I've visited it's been extremely breezy. Bring your jacket and a rain coat. Please of rain always to be had in Galway even in summer month but worth a visit.",

          "This will blow the cobwebs out very injoyable walk. Walk to the end towards the golf club and you can watch the locals jumping from the driving boards.",
          "This is a beautiful promenade to have a leisurely walk on and a great place to come visit with kids.",
          "This is a perfect spot to go for a walk and look at the sea and coastal attractions which are on the promenade.",
          "We visited on a sunny Monday evening and had a pleasant walk along this lovely stretch of beach. It\u2019s refreshing to see a lack of exploitation of tourists as there were no parking fees. They even have a funfair for kids. A nice mix of bars and places to eat. It\u2019s a popular spot",
          "Really enjoy looking at the sea, people venturing in to paddle board and swim, and runners going by. Very nice area to visit.",
          "If you're looking for some nice walk along the sea, just go there. View is beautiful, it's calm and along the way there are some shops and cafes so you don't have to be afraid that there's no possibility to buy some snack or coffee..",
          "Salthill is wonderful place at any time off Yr. Lovely walk, plenty food stops and coffee shops around. Loads off parking",

          "Unspoilt, and I could imagine my mum and dad as children, and my grandparents, enjoying the sea views, the sea breeze, and the lovely little town. Salthill is just a beautiful, peaceful place, and I hope they never develop it. It\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s special to me, and my family.",
          "I walked from Galway city to Salt Hill and visited Katie's Claddagh Cottage on the way which was a highlight of the afternoon, really beautiful. The lighthouse in the distance is pointed out as the last point of Ireland that many emigrants saw when leaving Ireland and this is",
          "Great spot for a morning run or walk. Beautiful views and plenty of places to stop along the way. Grassy parks out to the waters edge in places",

        "wiki": "Galway ( GAWL-way; Irish: Gaillimh, pronounced [\u02c8\u0261al\u0320\u02b2\u026av\u02b2]) is a city in County Galway in the West of Ireland, in the province of Connacht. It lies on the River Corrib between Lough Corrib and Galway Bay, and is the sixth most populous city in Ireland, with a population at the 2016 Census of 79,934.Galway is renowned for its vibrant lifestyle and for hosting numerous festivals, celebrations and events such as The Galway Arts Festival. In 2018, it was named the European Region of Gastronomy. The city is currently the European Capital of Culture for 2020, alongside Rijeka, Croatia.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe city's name comes from the Irish name Gaillimhe, which formed the western boundary of the earliest settlement, D\u00fan Gaillimhe \"Fort Gaillimh\". (Mythical and alternative derivations of the name are given in History of Galway). Historically, the name was Anglicised as Galliv or Gallive, closer to the Irish pronunciation. The city's name in Latin is Galvia. Residents of the city are referred to as Galwegians.\nThe city also bears the nickname \"City of the Tribes\" (Irish: Cathair na dTreabh) because of the fourteen merchant families called the \"tribes of Galway\" who led the city in its Hiberno-Norman period.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nD\u00fan Gaillimhe (\"Fort at the Mouth (bottom) of the Gaillimh\") was constructed in 1124, by the King of Connacht, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088\u20131156). A settlement grew around it. During the Norman invasion of Connacht in the 1230s, D\u00fan Gaillimhe was captured by Richard Mor de Burgh, who had led the invasion. As the de Burghs eventually became Gaelicised, the merchants of the town, the Tribes of Galway, pushed for greater control over the walled city.\nThis led to their gaining complete control over the city and to the granting of mayoral status by the English crown in December 1484. Galway endured difficult relations with its Irish neighbours. A notice over the west gate of the city, completed in 1562 by Mayor Thomas \u00d3ge Martyn, stated \"From the Ferocious O'Flahertys may God protect us\". A by-law forbade the native Irish (as opposed to Galway's Hiberno-Norman citizens) unrestricted access into Galway, saying \"neither O\u2019 nor Mac shall strutte nor swagger through the streets of Galway\" without permission.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Galway was ruled by an oligarchy of fourteen merchant families (twelve who claimed to be of Norman origin and two of Irish origin). These were the \"Tribes of Galway\". The city thrived on international trade, and in the Middle Ages, it was the principal Irish port for trade with Spain and France. The most famous reminder of those days is ceann an bhalla (\"the end of the wall\"), now known as the Spanish Arch, constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin (1519\u201320). In 1477 Christopher Columbus visited Galway, possibly stopping off on a voyage to Iceland or the Faroe Islands. Seven or eight years later, he noted in the margin of his copy of Imago Mundi:\n\nMen of Cathay have come from the west. [Of this] we have seen many signs. And especially in Galway in Ireland, a man and a woman, of extraordinary appearance, have come to land on two tree trunks [or timbers? or a boat made of such?]\nThe most likely explanation for these bodies is that they were Inuit swept eastward by the North Atlantic Current.During the 16th and 17th centuries Galway remained loyal to the English crown for the most part, even during the Gaelic resurgence, perhaps for reasons of survival. However, by 1642 the city had allied itself with the Catholic Confederation of Kilkenny during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. During the resulting Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Cromwellian forces captured the city after a nine-month siege. At the end of the 17th century the city supported the Jacobites in the Williamite war in Ireland and was captured by the Williamites after a very short siege not long after the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. The great families of Galway were ruined. The city suffered further under the potato famines of 1845\u20131852, and it did not fully recover until the period of strong economic growth of the late 20th century (see Celtic Tiger).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike most of Ireland, Galway has an oceanic climate (Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, being one of the world's mildest cities for latitude, partly because it is on an island. Galway has a year-round mild, moist, temperate and changeable climate, due to the prevailing winds of the North Atlantic Current together with the Gulf Stream (on the other side of the Atlantic temperatures can be 20 \u00b0C cooler or more.). The city does not experience temperature extremes, with temperatures below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) being rare. The city receives an average of 1,156 mm (45.51 in) of precipitation annually, which is evenly distributed throughout the year. The average January temperature in the city is 5.9 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F) and the average July temperature is 15.9 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). The highest temperature ever recorded in Galway was 31.7 \u00b0C (89.1 \u00b0F) in July 1921, whilst the lowest temperature recorded was \u221211.7 \u00b0C (10.9 \u00b0F) in January 1945.While extreme weather is rare, the city and county can experience severe windstorms that are the result of vigorous Atlantic depressions that occasionally pass along the north west coast of Ireland. Most of these storms occur between late autumn and early spring. Due to the city's northerly location, Galway has long summer days. Sunrise on summer solstice occurs at 05:07 WEST and sunset at 22:07. By contrast, on winter solstice, the sun rises at 08:49 WET, and sets at 16:19.\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\nLynch's Castle on Shop Street is a medieval town house built by the prosperous Lynch family in the 16th century and is now a branch of Allied Irish Banks.\nThe Church of Ireland St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church is the largest medieval church still in everyday use in Ireland. It was founded in 1320 and enlarged in the following two centuries.\nThe Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas was consecrated in 1965 and is a far larger building constructed from limestone. It has an eclectic style, with a Renaissance Revival dome, pillars and round arches, and a Romanesque Revival portico that dominates the main fa\u00e7ade \u2013 which is an unusual feature in modern Irish church building.\nThe original quadrangle building of NUI Galway which was erected in 1849 (during the Great Famine or An Gorta M\u00f3r) as one of the three colleges of the Queen's University of Ireland (along with Queen's University Belfast and University College Cork). The university holds the UNESCO archive of spoken material for the Celtic languages.\nThe Hardiman, (originally the Railway Hotel, then the Great Southern Hotel and then Hotel Meyrick) built by the Great Southern Railway Company in 1845. Sitting at the southern perimeter of Eyre Square, it is the city's oldest hotel still in operation.\nThe remains of Menlo Castle can be seen outside the city, on the eastern bank of the River Corrib. It was one of the ancestral homes of the Blake family, one of the Tribes of Galway from c. 1600\u20131910. The fa\u00e7ade of the family's townhouse (\"Blake's Castle\") is still extant next to Jury's Hotel at the bottom of Quay Street.\nEglinton Canal, named after a former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, joins the River Corrib to the sea, and flows for just more than a kilometre from the University to the Claddagh.\nThe Claddagh is the oldest part of Galway but little or nothing remains of its old thatched village. However, in a side altar of the parish church, St Mary's on the Hill, is the late medieval statue of Our Lady of Galway. The ancient ritual of the Blessing of the Bay takes place on the Sunday nearest the feast of the Assumption.\nThe Browne doorway, originally located on Lower Abbeygate Street but now standing at the north end of Eyre Square, was the doorway to the townhouse of the Browne family, one of the fourteen Tribes of Galway.\nThe Lynch Window, (on Market Street), at which is a plaque commemorating one of the city's legends. According to legend, in 1493, the then Mayor, James Lynch FitzStephen, hanged his own son for the murder of a young Spanish visitor who had the misfortune to befriend the girlfriend of the Mayor's son.\nThe Hall of the Red Earl (Halla an Iarla Rua) can be viewed through a protective glass wall off Flood Street. It is the earliest medieval settlement fragment surviving within the walls of the city. It was built by the de Burgo family in the 13th century and was a key municipal building for the collection of taxes, dispensation of justice and hosting banquets. It was the medieval equivalent of tax office, court house and town hall.\n\n\n==== The Claddagh ====\n\nOn the west bank of the River Corrib as it enters the sea is the ancient neighbourhood of The Claddagh. For centuries it was an Irish-speaking enclave outside the city walls. Claddagh residents were mainly fisher folk and were governed by an elected 'King'. The King of the Claddagh settled or arbitrated disputes among the locals and had the privilege of a white sail on his fishing boat. The last true king, Martin Oliver, died in 1972. The title is still used but in a purely honorary and ceremonial context. The current King is Michael Lynskey. The area is also famous for its association with the Claddagh Ring.\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nThe Galway City Museum has two main sections: one about the heritage of Galway and one about Irish artists from the second half of the 20th century. This museum also houses the statue of the poet, P\u00e1draic \u00d3 Conaire which was originally located in the Kennedy Park section of Eyre Square, prior to the Square's renovation. A replica of the statue was erected in Eyre Square in 2017. The museum is part of the Spanish Arch, the historical remnants of the 16th century wall.The city's University has numerous museums, including the James Mitchell Geology Museum and the Computing and Communications Museum of Ireland.\nThe Nora Barnacle House Museum in Bowling Green is the smallest museum in Ireland. Nora was the lover, companion and, later, wife of writer James Joyce.\n\n\n==== Cemeteries ====\nFort Hill Cemetery, on Lough Atalia Road, is the oldest cemetery still in use in Galway City. Inside the main gate is a memorial to sailors of the Spanish Armada who were buried here in the 1580s.\nRahoon Cemetery (officially known as Mount St. Joseph Cemetery), Rahoon Road, on the western edge of the city affords splendid panoramic views of the city.\nAmong the notable persons buried here are:\n\nMichael Bodkin, an admirer of Nora Barnacle, the wife of James Joyce, who was the inspiration for the character, \"Michael Furey\" in the story The Dead from Dubliners\nMichael Feeney, the \"lover\" in Joyce's poem She Weeps Over Rahoon\nthe actress Siobh\u00e1n McKenna.Bohermore Cemetery (or the New Cemetery, as it is more popularly known), Cemetery Cross, Bohermore, was opened in 1880. It contains two mortuary chapels and is the burial place of several important Galwegians, including P\u00e1draic \u00d3 Conaire the Gaelic author, William Joyce, more widely known as Lord Haw-Haw the Nazi propagandist, Augusta, Lady Gregory, co-founder of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin and Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin, a senior member of one the Tribes of Galway and former world president of the International Olympic Committee. A memorial to the 91 people who died on 14 August 1959 when Dutch aeroplane KLM Flight 607-E crashed into the sea 180 km (112 mi) west of Galway can be seen just inside the main gates. Several bodies of the passengers are buried around the memorial.\nThere are several smaller cemeteries within the city boundaries. Some are no longer in use or are used primarily by families with ancient burial rights. These are St James's Cemetery (Teampall) in Glenina Heights, Menlo Cemetery near Menlo Castle, Ballybrit Graveyard near the entrance to Galway Racecourse, and a very ancient early Christian graveyard at Roscam near Merlin Park. Several city churches have graveyards attached which were formerly used for the interment of clergy and parishioners \u2013 Castlegar Church, Claddagh Church', St Patrick's Church on Forster Street and St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church. Several bishops are buried in the crypt below the RC Cathedral but this not usually open to the public.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nInformation from the 2016 census shows Galway City has a population of 79,934, an increase of almost 4,000 over the 2011 census figures.If the current growth rate continues, the population of the city will hit 100,000 by 2020. Galway City is the fourth largest in the Republic of Ireland, and sixth on the island of Ireland.\nAs of 2009, approximately 80% of the population of Galway were Irish. Following an influx of immigrants to Galway during the 2000s, approximately 20% of the population is non-Irish. Slightly more than half of this group (11.3%) are white Europeans, coming from Poland and other Central European and Baltic States, such as Latvia and Lithuania. Smaller numbers of Asian and African immigrants come from East Africa, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka. In the 2006 Census, 15.4% of the population were aged 0\u201314, 76.1% were aged 15\u201364, and 8.5% were aged over 65. 51.9% of the population were female and 48.1% were male.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nWith a population of 79,934, Galway is the fourth most populous urban area in the State and the 23rd most populous area of local government. Services such as waste collection, recycling, traffic control, parks and housing are controlled by a fifteen-member city council elected to five-year terms by proportional representation through means of the single transferable vote. The City Council is chaired by a mayor who is elected to a one-year term by fellow councillors. The role of mayor is mainly ceremonial, although they do have the casting vote. The first mayor was Peirce Lynch Fitzjohn, elected in 1485. The current mayor, Cllr. Mike Cubbard, was elected in June 2019.The symbols of the office of the Mayor and the emblems of the dignity of the City Council are the Civic Sword (1620s) and the Great Mace (1710) which are carried in procession before the Mayor and Council on solemn civic occasions. When not in ceremonial use they can be seen at the Galway City Museum. In 1579, Queen Elizabeth I confirmed the city's charter and appointed the Mayor as 'Admiral of the Bay and of the Aran islands'. The title, though extant, is rarely used except for purely ceremonial purposes.Galway City is part of the Galway West constituency of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.

It is responsible for hearing small civil claims, certain family law cases, administers the liquor licensing laws and is responsible for indicting the accused and sending them forward for trial at the Circuit Court and the Central Criminal Court.\nThe Circuit Court in Galway tries all indictable offences (those cases triable by a judge and jury), except murder, rape, treason, piracy and genocide, which are reserved to the Central Criminal Court. It can also hear appeals from the District Court. Its decisions can be appealed to the Court of Appeal. Civilly, the court is limited to compensation claims of not more than \u20ac75,000. Both parties may waive this amount and grant the court unlimited jurisdiction. Divorce, Judicial Separation and probate cases can be heard provided they are within the financial parameters of the courts jurisdiction. Decisions in civil cases can be appealed to the High Court.The High Court sits four times a year in Galway to hear original actions (actions that are not appeals from lower courts). It also sits twice a year in Galway to hear appeals from the Circuit Court in civil and family law cases. Its decisions can be appealed to the Court of Appeal, or in some instances, to the Supreme Court, which sit in Dublin.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nGalway is known as Ireland's Cultural Heart (Cro\u00ed Cult\u00fartha na h\u00c9ireann) and is renowned for its vibrant lifestyle and numerous festivals, celebrations and events.

The main squares in the city are Eyre Square (containing John F. Kennedy Park) in the centre of the city, and Spanish Parade next to the Spanish Arch.\nIn 2007, Galway was named as one of the eight \"sexiest cities\" in the world. A 2008 poll ranked Galway as the 42nd best tourist destination in the world, or 14th in Europe and 2nd in Ireland (behind Dingle).

It was united with the diocese of Kilmacduagh (est. 1152) and given the administratorship of the diocese of Kilfenora (est. 1152) in 1883. Its full name is the Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Apostolic Administratorship of Kilfenora (in Irish \u2013 Deoise na Gaillimhe, Chill Mac Duach agus Riarach\u00e1n Aspalda Cill Fhionn\u00farach, in Latin \u2013 Diocesis Galviensis, Duacensis ac Administratio Apostolica Finaborensis). The diocese is under the patronage Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas (Galway), Saint Fachanan (Kilmacduagh) and St Colman (Kilfenora). As the diocese of Kilfenora is in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Cashel the Bishop of Galway is its Apostolic Administrator rather than its bishop. The dioceses of Galway and Kilmacduagh are in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Tuam. The current bishop is Most Rev. Martin Drennan, installed 3 July 2005. Of the 38 parishes in the RC diocese 14 are situated in the city and are divided into two deaneries \u2013 the deanery of Galway City West and that of Galway City East. In each deanery a Vicar Forane exercises limited jurisdiction on behalf of the bishop.\nIn the Church of Ireland, Galway is a parish of the United Diocese of Tuam, Killala and Achonry. The principal church of the parish is the St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church (founded 1320). Russian, Romanian, Coptic, and Mar Thoma Syrian Orthodox Churches use the facilities of St Nicholas Collegiate Church for their services. The Ahmadiyya-run Galway Mosque, opened in 2014, is the only purpose-built mosque in Galway.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nGalway has a diverse sporting heritage, with a history in sports ranging from horse racing, Gaelic games, soccer and rugby to rowing, basketball, motorsport, greyhound racing and others. The Galway Races are known worldwide and are the highlight of the Irish horse racing calendar. Over the years it has grown into an annual festival lasting seven days.\n\n\n==== Gaelic games ====\n\nBoth hurling and football are strong in Galway city. Pearse Stadium in Salthill is the home to Galway GAA, the county's Gaelic games body. The Galway hurlers compete annually in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship for the Liam MacCarthy Cup.  Despite having won the cup only five times in their history, Galway is considered as one of the top teams in the Championship. Galway reached the 2012 All-Ireland final only to draw with Kilkenny to force a replay, the first since 1959, which they eventually lost. In 2017 Galway lifted the Liam MacCarthy Cup for the first time in 29 years beating Waterford by 0-26 to 2-17. The footballers compete annually in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship for the Sam Maguire Cup. The Gaelic footballers have won the cup nine times with the most recent being in 2001.\n\n\n==== Association football ====\n\nGalway United FC is based in the city and plays in the League of Ireland Premier Division. The team plays its home games at Eamonn Deacy Park. The club was formed in 2013 and first competed in the 2014 season.\nThe previous tenants of Eamonn Deacy Park, also called Galway United, first competed in the League of Ireland since 1977, then known as Galway Rovers. Michael D. Higgins, later elected President of Ireland in 2011, served as a president of the club in a ceremonial capacity. Following struggles with debts, the club became defunct at the end of the 2011 season. The Galway United Supporters Trust (GUST) had been servicing many debts of the company and were able to keep the club afloat for the 2011 season, with it having been effectively abandoned by its directors. GUST withdrew their support for the team and applied to join the 2012 League of Ireland as a community enterprise, rather than as a private company, which the old club had been. This application was not successful, however.\nGalway F.C. was formed the following year from a merger of GUST with Mervue United and Salthill Devon, two other clubs in the city, who had competed in the First Division since 2009 and 2010 respectively.\n\n\n==== Rugby ====\n\n\n===== Professional =====\nThe professional team for the province, Connacht Rugby, is based in the city. The team play their home matches at the Galway Sportsgrounds which is the current provincial Rugby Stadium.\nThe team participate in the Pro14 League competition, and in season 2015\u20132016 won their first ever Championship by defeating reigning Champions Glasgow Warriors in the Semi-final and then beating four times champions Leinster Rugby in the Grand Final on 28 May 2016 played at Murrayfield Stadium.The team participated in European Rugby Champions Cup 2016/2017.\n\n\n===== Club (amateur) =====\nThere are two senior amateur rugby union teams in Galway, Galwegians RFC and Galway Corinthians RFC, who play in the All-Ireland League. There are also two junior clubs, OLBC RFC & NUIG RFC who both participate in the Connacht Junior League.\n\"Barna Knocknacarra Rugby Club\" (or Na Bairneacha\u00ed), established in 2007, offers \"mini rugby\" for children at levels U8 to U12.\n\n\n==== Swimming ====\nNearby Salthill has a 25m competitive swimming pool in the Leisureland complex and three competitive swimming clubs (i) Shark Swimming Club, (ii) Laser Swimming Club and (iii) Galway Swimming Club train there. There is also a handball and racketball club while there are several martial arts clubs throughout the city. There is a 25m pool at NUI, Galway as well as one at Renmore's KingFisher Club.\n\n\n==== Sailing and rowing ====\nSailing is common and rowing on the River Corrib is undertaken by seven rowing clubs. These provide related facilities and organise rowing competitions. These clubs include: Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol Rowing Club, Tribesmen Rowing Club, Galway Rowing Club, Col\u00e1iste Iogn\u00e1id ('The Jes') Rowing Club, St. Joseph's Patrician College ('The Bish') Rowing Club, NUIG Boat Club and Cumann R\u00e1mhaiochta Chol\u00e1iste na Coiribe.\nIn 2009 Galway hosted a stopover on the Volvo Ocean Race and the city was finishing point of the round-the-world competition in July 2012.\n\n\n==== Greyhound racing ====\nNear the city centre, on College Road, the Sportsground has greyhound races every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night. It was refurbished by the Irish Greyhound Board, Bord na gCon, and the facility is shared with the Connacht rugby team.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\nGalway City is the capital of Connacht. The city has experienced very rapid growth in recent years. Galway has a strong local economy with complementary business sectors, including manufacturing industry, tourism, retail and distribution, education, healthcare and services that include financial, construction, cultural, and professional.\nMost (47%) of the people employed in Galway work in either the commerce or professional sector, with a large number (17%) also employed in manufacturing. Most industry and manufacturing in Galway, like the rest of Ireland, is hi-tech (e.g. ICT, medical equipment, electronics, chemicals, etc.), due to the Celtic Tiger economic boom. Companies such as Boston Scientific, Medtronic, EA Games, Cisco and SAP AG have their regional offices or other offices in Galway City and environs. Tourism is also of major importance to the city, which had over 2.1 million visitors in 2000, and produced revenue of over \u20ac400 million.The head office of Smyths, a toy shop company, is in Galway.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\n\n==== Radio ====\nThere are two radio stations based in the city \u2013 Galway Bay FM (95.8 FM) broadcasts from the city to the whole county; Flirt FM (101.3 FM) is the student radio station for NUI Galway.\n\n\n==== Print ====\nOne of the main regional newspapers for the county is The Connacht Tribune which prints two titles every week, the Connacht Tribune on Thursday, and the Galway City Tribune on Friday. As of January 2007, The Tribune has a weekly readership of over 150,000. Another Galway-based newspaper is the Galway Advertiser, a free paper printed every Thursday with an average of 160 pages and a circulation of 70,000 copies. It is the main paper of the Advertiser Newspaper Group which distributes 200,000 newspapers per and more week to a variety of other Irish cities and towns.\n\n\n==== Online ====\nBeing a city of culture, Galway has a dedicated hub for all cultural events and organisations. Galway Hub is a free resource for both practitioners and the general public in which to engage with the arts and cultural events across the city and county.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Air ====\nGalway Airport, located 6 km (3.73 mi) east of the city at Carnmore, ceased to have scheduled passenger flights on 1 November 2011.  Because the runway is too short to take modern passenger jet aircraft, it it only capable of imited operations. Aerfort na Minna (22 km (13.67 mi) west of the city) operates regular flights to each of the Aran Islands (Oile\u00e1in \u00c1rann). Shannon Airport (90 km) and Ireland West Airport Knock (86 km) are the nearest international airports, both of which have flights around Ireland and to Britain, Continental Europe and North America (from Shannon).\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nBuses are the main form of public transport in the city and county. Routes operated by Bus \u00c9ireann include routes 401 (Salthill/Parkmore), 402 (Seacrest/Merlin Park), 404 (Newcastle/Oranmore), 405 (Rahoon/Ballybane), 407 (B\u00f3thar an Ch\u00f3iste) and 409 (Parkmore Industrial). Routes operated by City Direct include routes 410 (Salthill), 411 (Knocknacarra - Cappagh Rd), 412 (Knocknacarra Express), and 414 (Barna).Various bus companies also provide links throughout County Galway and nationwide.  These operate from a number of locations:\n\nThe main bus and rail station in the city is Ceannt Station.\nGalway Coach Station, located at Fairgreen, is also a coach transport hub. Scheduled direct and commuter services operate between the Coach Station, Dublin and Dublin Airport, as well as services to Limerick, Cork and Clifden. These are operated by Gobus and Citylink.\nOther regional bus operators use various bus stops around the city centre, and many serve the NUIG and GMIT campuses as well.\n\n\n==== Rail ====\n\nGalway's main railway station is Ceannt Station (St\u00e1isi\u00fan Cheannt), which opened in 1851, and was renamed in honour of \u00c9amonn Ceannt in 1966. A major redevelopment, including a completely new urban district, Ceannt Station Quarter, has been proposed for the station and adjoining land.\nThe Midland Great Western Railway reached Galway in 1851, giving the city a direct main line to its Broadstone Station terminus in Dublin. As the 19th century progressed the rail network in Connacht was expanded, making Galway an important railhead. The nearby town of Athenry became a railway junction, giving Galway links to Ennis, Limerick and the south in 1869 and Sligo and the north in 1894. In 1895 the MGW opened a branch line between Galway and Clifden.\nThe 20th century brought increasing road competition, and this led the Great Southern Railways to close the Clifden branch in 1935. In the 1970s the state railway authority C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann closed the Sligo-Athenry-Ennis line to passenger services. It later closed to freight as well.\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann, Ireland's national rail operator, currently runs six return passenger services each day between Galway and Dublin Heuston, also serving intermediate stations. Travel time is just under 3 hours. Services on the Galway\u2013Limerick line have now resumed, with around 5\u20136 trains each way per day.\nFrom Galway railway services along the Western Rail Corridor link the city with Ennis, and Limerick where trains run to Cork via Limerick Junction (for Tipperary, Clonmel and Waterford) and Mallow (for Killarney and Tralee).\n\n\n==== Road ====\nFour national primary roads serve the city: the M6 motorway running east\u2013west (Athlone, Dublin), the M17 motorway running north from the M6 to Tuam, the N63, formerly the N17, connecting Galway with the Northwest (Tuam, Sligo, Donegal Town, Letterkenny and Derry), and the M18 motorway linking Galway to southern towns and cities Gort, Ennis, Shannon Town, Limerick and Cork joining up with The Wild Atlantic Way. In addition, there are plans for a semi-ring road of the city, the Galway City Outer Bypass. There is also an Inner City Ring (Cuar Inmhe\u00e1nach) route that encircles the city centre, most of which is pedestrianised.\nGalway is considered the gateway to Connemara and the Gaeltacht, including M\u00e1m, An Teach D\u00f3ite, Cor na M\u00f3na, Ros Muc, Bearna and An Cheathr\u00fa Rua. The N59 along the western shore of Lough Corrib and the R337 along the northern shore of Galway Bay both lead to this largely rural and highly scenic region.\n\n\n==== Waterways ====\nThe River Corrib is by far the most important waterway in Galway and a number of canals and channels were built above and through the city. The purposes of these to divert and control the water from the river, to harness its power and to provide a navigable route to the sea.  Of these, there were two major schemes \u2013 one between 1848 and 1858 and the other during the 1950s. The canals provided a power source for Galway and were the location of the first industries in the mid-19th century. The Eglinton Canal provided a navigation from the sea (at the Claddagh Basin) to the navigable part of the river (above the Salmon Weir Bridge). Most of the mills are still used today for various purposes; for instance, NUI Galway still uses a water turbine for electricity generation for their building on Nun's Island.\nCurrently, there are four bridges across the Corrib. Following the southward flow of the river these are, from the north: the Quincentennial Bridge, the Salmon Weir Bridge, the William O'Brien Bridge and the Wolfe Tone Bridge. There are plans for a fifth bridge as part of the Galway City Outer Bypass project. The Clare River flows from the North of the County Galway, through Tuam, Claregalway into Lough Corrib.\n\n\n==== Harbour ====\n\nGalway is the most central port on the West Coast of Ireland in the sheltered eastern corner of Galway Bay. The harbour can be used by vessels up to 10,000 tonnes deadweight (DWT) and the inner dock can accommodate up to 9 vessels at any one time. Pending approval, Galway Harbour may see major changes, should the \u20ac1.5 billion development plan go ahead.\nRegular passenger ferry and freight services operate between Galway and the tourist destination of the Aran Islands which is home to World Heritage Site D\u00fan Aonghasa. The islands also have regular links with the towns of Rossaveal and Doolin, which are physically closer but far smaller.\nCommuter ferry services have been proposed to the tourism town of Kinvara, on the opposite side of Galway Bay.Major work in the harbour area was carried out in 2009 to accommodate the stopover of the Volvo Ocean Race. This was one of the biggest events ever to visit Galway. The event returned with the finale of the race in June 2012. This was unprecedented in Volvo Ocean Race history.\n\n\n==== Walking ====\nThe city is planned as the start of the E2 European long-distance path, running for 4,850 kilometres (3,010 mi) to Nice, though the Irish section is as yet incomplete.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nGalway Textile Printers, located on Sandy Road, was the first major industry to come to Galway and quickly became one of the biggest employers in the west of Ireland. Some of those who worked there were specialists who were brought in to help set the factory up, but most employees were local. The Mills eventually went out of business in the early 1980s and its former site now hosts various small business establishments.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAs of 2002, there were 27 primary schools and 11 secondary schools in Galway.\n\n\n=== University ===\nNUI Galway was founded in 1845 as Queen's College, Galway, and was more recently known as University College, Galway (U.C.G.). It is divided into several colleges including the College of Arts, Social Science and Celtic Studies, the College Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences,  the College of Business, Public Policy and Law, the College of Science and the College of Engineering and Informatics. The university had an enrollment of 16000 in 2010.\nThe Biomedical Research Building was opened in 2014. It houses the Regenerative Medicine Institute (REMEDI). Also opened in 2014 were the Hardiman Building and a School of Psychology. The Hardiman Building is home to the university's collection of more than 350 literary, theatrical, political and historical archives. The building houses also the Moore Institute for Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences and the Whitaker Institute for Innovation and Societal Change. The National Institute for Prevention and Cardiovascular Health (NIPC) is an affiliate of NUI Galway.The offices of the Central Applications Office (C.A.O.) are also located in the city, this being the clearing house for undergraduate college and university applications in the Republic of Ireland; a related organisation, the Postgraduate Applications Centre, processes some taught postgraduate courses.\n\n\n=== Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) ===\n\nGMIT, in addition to having two campuses in Galway City, also has campuses in Castlebar, Letterfrack and Mountbellew. GMIT's Galway campus is based on the Dublin Road in Galway city, overlooking Galway Bay. It is the administrative headquarters for the Institute and has four Schools of study; the School of Business, the School of Engineering, the School of Science & Computing, and the College of Tourism & Arts.\n\n\n== Health ==\nPublicly funded health care and social services are provided in Galway by the HSE (West) division of the Health Services Executive.\nThe main city hospital, University Hospital Galway, is located on two campuses \u2014 Galway University Hospital and Merlin Park University Hospital.Two private hospitals \u2013 The Galway Clinic and the Bon Secours Hospital, Galway \u2013 also operate in the city.\nGalway Hospice provides palliative care for the people of Galway City and County on a homecare, inpatient and daycare basis.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of twin towns and sister cities in the Republic of Ireland\nThe Galway Line\nTerryland Forest Park\nGalway Technology Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Galway travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGalway City Council (local authority)\nGalway City and County Cultural Website",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Oughterard (Irish: Uachtar Ard) is a small town on the banks of the Owenriff River close to the western shore of Lough Corrib in County Galway, Ireland. The population of the town in 2016 was 1,318. It is located about 26 km northwest of Galway on the N59 road. Oughterard is on the border of the Connemara region, and is the chief angling centre on Lough Corrib.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\nThree kilometres outside the town stand the ruins of Aughnanure Castle, a well-preserved example of a medieval tower house. Much of the surrounding area was occupied by the O'Flaherty clan, but was taken over by Walter de Burgh, 1st Earl of Ulster, in 1256. Ross Castle is also located a number of kilometres outside Oughterard. The mansion, which is visible today, was built by the Martin family in the 17th century but there is some evidence still present of the original castle structure, built in the 15th century by the O'Flaherty family, in its foundation.\nThe 'Quiet Man Bridge' is located 8 kilometres past Oughterard, down the Leam Road, which was the setting for the 1950s film The Quiet Man starring John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara.\nAlso close to Oughterard, the Glengowla Mines (abandoned in 1865) is a \"show mine\" with exhibits on the lead and silver mining history of the area.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nOughterard railway station opened on 1 January 1895 and closed on 29 April 1935. There are daily buses going from and to Galway and Clifden along the N59. City Link and Bus \u00c9ireann are the two bus services that travel to and from Galway.\n\n\n== Amenities ==\nOughterard has a primary school, 'Scoil Chuim\u00edn agus Caitr\u00edona', and a co-educational voluntary secondary school, St Paul's.

The two arches were part of the extension of the city wall from Martin's Tower to the bank of the River Corrib, as a measure to protect the city's quays, which were in the area once known as the Fish Market (now Spanish Parade). It was constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin in 1584, being called ceann an bhalla (the head of the wall).\nIn the 18th century the Eyre family of Eyrecourt, County Galway, created an extension of the quays called The Long Walk and created the arches to allow access from the town to the new quays. The designation \"Spanish\" is not historical to this period and was likely known as the Eyre Arch when built. \n\nIn 1755, the arches were partially destroyed by the tsunami generated by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.\nUntil 2006, part of the Arch housed the Galway City Museum. At that time, the museum was moved to a new, dedicated building located just behind the Arch.\nThe Long Walk is a promenade to one side of the Arches.\n\n\n== Cultural depictions ==\nAs a historical landmark, the Spanish Arch appears in several media works set in Galway, including the 1957 film The Rising of the Moon.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"History of Galway\", James Hardiman, 1820\n\"Old Galway\", Maureen Donovan O'Sullivan, 1942\nThe Tribes of Galway 1124-1642\", Adrian Martyn, 2016\n\n\n== External links ==\nGalway.Net Guide - Spanish Arch",

        "wiki": "Athenry (; Irish: Baile \u00c1tha an R\u00ed, meaning \"Town of the Ford of the King\") is a town in County Galway, Ireland, which lies 25 kilometres (16 mi) east of Galway city. Some of the attractions of the medieval town are its town wall, Athenry Castle, its priory and its 13th century Anglo-Norman street-plan. The town is also well known by virtue of the song \"The Fields of Athenry\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIts name derives from the ford ('\u00c1th') crossing the river Clarin just east of the settlement. Though other inaccurate explanations are still given, it was called '\u00c1th na R\u00edogh' ('Ford of the Kings') because it was the home area of the Cen\u00e9l nD\u00e9igill, kings of the Soghain, whose leading lineage were the \u00d3 Mainn\u00edn. On some medieval maps of English origin the town is called Kingstown.\nOriginally, Soghain was surrounded by U\u00ed Maine to the east, Aidhne to the south, and Maigh Seola to the west. However, after 1135, and by 1152, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair forcibly incorporated it into the newly created tr\u00edcha c\u00e9t of Clann Taidg, ruled by lords such as Fearghal \u00d3 Taidg an Teaghlaigh, who expelled the \u00d3 Mainn\u00edn family. In the 1230s the \u00d3 Taidg an Teaghlaigh family were in turn displaced by Meyler de Bermingham.The earliest remaining building in the town is Athenry Castle which was built sometime before 1240 by Meyler de Bermingham. In 1241, the Dominican Priory was founded, and became an important center for learning and teaching. It was ostensibly closed during the Protestant Reformation but survived until being desecrated and burned during the Mac an Iarla wars of the 1560s\u201380s, and was finally vandalised by Cromwellians in the 1650s. The medieval walls around Athenry are among the most complete and best preserved in Ireland with 70% of original circuit still standing, along with some of the original towers and the original North gate. The remains of the Lorro Gate were partially unearthed in 2007 during the redevelopment of road works in the area.\nIn the centre of the town is the 'square'; markets were held from the 17th century onwards and where the town's late 15th century 'Market Cross' is still located. The monument which is of Tabernacle or Lantern type is the only one of its kind in Ireland and the only medieval cross still standing in situ in the country. A Heritage centre now occupies the remains of the mid-13th century St Mary's Collegiate Church adjacent to the town Square. The original medieval church is largely destroyed but in 1828 a Church of Ireland church was built into its chancel.\nIn 1791, Jean Antoine Coquebert de Montbret visited the town, which he described as:\n\nIt covers 50 acres but has not more than 60 houses. [...] There is an abbey of which the ruins are almost all standing. There is a big uninhabited castle called Bermingham's Court [...]. In the middle of Athenry is the stump of a cross destroyed in the wars, on which a crucifix in bas-relief still remains. [...] I noticed at the door of a tavern a large cake decorated with a bouquet. It was a prize for the best dancer. [...] The road from Athenry is very beautiful and there are no barriers.\nMoyode Castle is another tall 16th-century fortified tower house of the Dolphin family, which went to the Persse family. The castle is now restored and inhabited and is located 3.5 miles (5.6 km) from the town of Athenry.\n\n\n== Economy and transport ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBy road, Athenry is served by the M6 motorway which links Galway city to Dublin. By rail, it is served by the Athenry railway station, which opened on 1 August 1851 and lies on the Galway\u2013Dublin main line of the Irish rail network. The town is at the junction of the Galway\u2013Dublin line, and the partially complete the Western Railway Corridor (Limerick\u2013Sligo).\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nIn 2015, Apple Inc. decided to build a \u20ac850m data center near Athenry, and a similar one in Viborg, Denmark. In May 2018, Apple announced cancellation of the Athenry development.In December 2017, funding was announced for a \"Food Innovation Hub\" in Athenry, projected by its promoters to create 360 jobs within 3 years, and to cost in the region of \u20ac3.9m.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nAthenry is home to the Gaelic Athletic Association St. Mary Club, who have won numerous All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championships.\nAthenry Athletics Club has a juvenile and a senior section. The club has produced two Olympic sprinters, Martina McCarthy and Paul Hession. McCarthy represented Ireland in the women's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay at the 2000 Summer Olympics and Hession competed in the men's 200 metres at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nAthenry is also home to Athenry F.C., founded in 1971. The club reached the 2006 final of the FAI Junior Cup, and the following year it became the Galway & District League champions for the first time, repeating the same achievement during the 2007\u201308, 2009\u201310, and 2014\u201315 seasons. In 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2016, Athenry also won the Connacht Junior Cup title.Athenry is also home of the Athenry Golf Club and Athenry Judo Club.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\nAthenry is twinned with the town of Quimperl\u00e9 in Brittany (France) and, since 2013, Renews-Cappahayden, Newfoundland and Labrador (Canada).\n\n\n== People ==\nThe following is a list of notable natives of Athenry:\n\n\n== See also ==\nBattle of Maigh Mucruimhe\nBaron Athenry\nFirst Battle of Athenry\nSecond Battle of Athenry\nThe Sack of Athenry\nThe Fields of Athenry\nNevin (surname)\nList of abbeys and priories in Ireland (County Galway)\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\n\n\n== Note ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAthenry History Archive\nAthenry Community Council",

          "On your visit to the historic town of Athenry, a visit would not be complete without seeing this fine example.",
          "Fascinating place to visit. As an archaeology student, I love visiting castles and tower houses, but what I liked most about Athenry castle was how well restored it is. It's done up just like how it would have been back in its heyday, and there are plenty of plaques around",
          "We were recently in Athenry and went to the Castle. It was a very interesting visit and the tour guide(Sorry I didn't get her name) was execellent and you could tell she really love her job !! She explained everything about the castle.",
          "We visited the Athenry Castle last week. It is well worth a visit. First we viewed the video which ran for about 20 minutes and this was very informative and interesting. It provided a historical prespective on this medieval castle and went on to give information of other",
          "The castle is fascinating,, and the staff was fun and informative! It wasn't crowded, and the town is lovely.",
          "Interesting castle smaller than some other castles but the best guide we had in all of Ireland. Very knowledgeable and passionate about history. Also great bakery in town called the Barracks.",

          "The town of Athenry with its castle, walled town and abbey is a great spot off the main tourist trail for history lovers. Easily accessible by train from Galway, it's an interesting area to explore especially for those who don't come from countries with such an ancient and rich",
          "This is a very nice restored castle. The style is typical of the kind of castles that you see in Ireland. There is a charge for entering, but it really is worth it because you can get a fairly good idea of what a castle of that time looked like. New steps, so your not",
          "I enjoyed walking around this Norman-Irish castle as much as I enjoyed walking around the market town. It wasn't open because I was there early in the morning, but it was lovely to look at.",
          "I really enjoyed my visit. Yes, I am a history buff so it was a real treat for me. Even my wife (who is not a history buff) could appreciate it. It's an old castle, built during the 1200. There isn't much to it, but you get a good feel for the time period. At the time I was",
          "Never really crowded and history buffs will enjoy. The castle itself is nicely restored but is quite bare inside. If you can invest in the experience by using your imagination to fill in some gaps. Reading up on the castle's history it makes the visit a lot more meaningful",
          "It's a really great example of a Norman-Irish castle and the surrounding buildings are also well worth a look. You can walk around and see the footprint of the ancient city still clearly defined. The video they have upstairs is about 20 minutes and well worth a look...provides",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to Athenry Castle today. We were greeted by such a friendly and knowlegeable member of staff who took time to give a personal tour as we were early visitors. The film show was excellent and further supported the historical context. An added bonus",
          "Disappointing in comparison to likes of Donegal Castle. Athenry Castle is just an empty sheel - no attempt at making it interesting with a bit of local history or artefacts.",

          "This is an interesting location to visit but not really restored or decorated to any degree. We were given no tour and there was no period decorating. I feel it was worth the visit for what it is, a medieval keep. I think it would be best to visit this castle after going",
          "I visited the castle and would say was really interesting! You discover the different phases of construction and a bit more about Athenry history! The video shown was really nice and informing about the full area around Athenry! It gave me many new ideas of cities to visit!",

          "Thanks to the visitor centre and displays, you get a good sense of the role this castle played in the town of Athenry's history. Be prepared to pay admission to see anything worthwhile.",
          "I definitely enjoyed this castle and the video that they showed. It's worth the visit and there's a friary and park near by!",
          "But still interesting to our pupils who are fond of history. It takes very little time, 30 minutes should suffice.",
          "Three of us stumbled upon the castle on a cold windy Sunday morning. Our Heritage card allowed for free access. The staff member on duty spent the next hour plus with us responding to questions on history, military tactics, and a variety of other topics. The castle is well",
          "We enjoyed our visit, adult and child under 10. Building is nicely restored and tour is interesting. Video was more interesting to adults.",
          "We went there as it lies just by the highway from Galway to Dublin. The castle does not have many things to see - it's basically an empty building. It has been restored and the 20 mins video was a good introductory of the history, but actually the abandoned abbey and church",
          "There's not much in Athenry for the Tourist, although the local bars and cafes are great as you might expect. This Castle was restored recently and is definitely worth a look around. There's a 20 minute video at the end and you can soak up all the history of the region.",
          "So disappointed. Dirty and hard to reach. If it was maintained and better kept, it would be a jewel of the town.",
          "A highlight of my trip to Ireland was a visit to Athenry Castle. The castle itself is small but interesting, an 800 year old Anglo-Norman Keep. What I really enjoyed was chatting to the staff. Irish people are so friendly but in August staff can be busy dealing with many",
          "Of the many relics, monuments, and historic places we've seen on this trip, Athenry is my favourite. The castle itself has been restored in a way that respects its heritage. Some parking is available, as are toilets for the comfort of visitors, and a good park and play area for",
          "There are helpful staff in the ticket office, but it would be good if there had been better guide books available. The castle dates back to Norman (I think) times and has been remodelled and modified over time. The current building has been restored to it 17th (?) century",
          "We went to the castle on a whim, and were so pleased we did. We had no idea of the history of the area, and learned so much. Make sure to see the film they show!",
          "Unfortunately I visited the castle on a day when it was raining which spoilt it slightly but the keep itself was dry and the film was informative .",
          "I'm amazed that this is just sitting in the middle of the town right next to a park which sits across the street from another historical landmark. We don't have this sorry of thing in the US.",
          "We were well pleased with our welcome, we had no idea the history, and the town had everything we needed to be at home!",

          "Worth checking out when visiting the heritage town of Athenry. Friendly helpful staff but there was no guided tour on the day I visited. The castle is carefully restored and the grounds are well maintained. There is a 20 minute information video provided on the top floor. I",
          "Great place to visit. Very well managed and excellent staff. When I visit these protected structures I often think of the men and women that built them. No power tools, no safety gear, everything done by hand. Video is very informative. Well worth visiting.",
          "Surprised to find a castle in this town, did not know how historic Athenry is! We were able to access most of the castle and a chat with the attendant filled us full of the history of this amazing castle. Well worth a visit if you are in the area.",
          "Well restored small castle but vastly under utilized. Bare walls and no furnishings. The high point is the medieval toilet. This could be a major tourist draw if furnished like Bunratty Castle in county clare.",
          "Great day out. Great castle. Good video shown and a pleasurable walk around Athenty discovering the history. Well worth a look",
          "A great castle that holds its place in history. I decided to stop here as it was a fair price and i was intrigued what the story was behind this fantastic building. It also allowed me to capture a fantastic photograph of a nesting bird in the castle window.",
          "It was early season when I went. The views from up high are really spectacular of the fields of Athenry. The tour I was offered was self-directed and the audio visual display wasn't working. A guided tour and working AV would have added to my enjoyment.",
          "Part of the medieval city of Athenry, the Norman castle is very well preserved. Built in 13th century the castle looks better than a tower and is surrounded by think, still standing walls. It was built on the shores of the river Clareen and the view is spectacular. I can only",
          "Small fortified castle. The castle consist from rectangular building only. It is possible to visit all three floors. Our time of visit was only 15 minutes. It is possible to see historic video about castle :).",

          "In a country that seems to be full of ruins, this is another one, but well worth the visit. In the quaint town of Athenry (pronounced \"Athen-rye\"), this is well worth the short detour of the M6 motorway, not far from Galway. When we got there, the place was almost deserted,",
          "It was quite a rainy day when we visited, and there were no other tourists to be seen. The castle is actually a structure called a tower house from the 12th century. Although it is small, it was still a very interesting and informative place to visit. The abbey was lovely as",
          "We stopped to visit the castle on our way to Galway. Neat place to visit, and a cool town around it. I think the castle had a good piece of history to it, as most do, but beautiful site no matter. We were able to look a little at the abbey, but the abbey itself was gated shut,",
          "A busy place with some great shops all close by. A nice range of coffee shops and reasturants at hand",

          "Nice to see TA getting Ireland muddled up yet again.. Ennis Abbey is of course in Ennis Co Clare. The Dominican Abbey in Athenry is as would be expected Athenry Priory and is listed as a National Monument. Anyway. With heritage week out of the way and the family over for a",

          "Visited Athenry earlier this year and was pleasantly surprised by this impressive castle that evokes days of yore, medieval jousting competitions and such like. There's a lovely green in front of the castle that's a pleasant place to lounge if the sun is shining.",
          "Athenry is a very historic town. The castle was a very interesting tour, and everyone was helpful in the town. You will enjoy other historic sites in Athenry. We were standing on a street corner and trying to decide which restaurant for a good cappuccino and light lunch,",
          "Bigger isnt always better- and Athenry Castle isn't bad, but it is a little small and unless you get a guided tour, there isn't a lot of information provided on site. All in all, the visit took about 15-20 minutes. I can see how castle buffs would be drawn to the restoration of",
          "Athenry is a historic town and worth a stroll around. The castle has been nicely restored and there is an audio visual presentation as well as good historical commentary on the walls. There are other ruins to visit in town as well: an abbey and city gate etc.",
          "Very good it was very interesting there was loads of activities such as archery",
          "The Medieval Town, coupled with the archetecture of the Fortified Keep and surrounding walls are worth the total expense of making the trip. The guided tour, which you will have to ask for...makes the visit a spendid historical adventure. Enering the town through the original",
          "After several days of coach tours out of Galway with other tourists my wife and I wanted to visit an authentic small Irish town. So we chose Athenry, which also happened to have a beautiful old castle. The people and town were lovely and we were not surrounded by mobs."

        "wiki": "Athenry (; Irish: Baile \u00c1tha an R\u00ed, meaning \"Town of the Ford of the King\") is a town in County Galway, Ireland, which lies 25 kilometres (16 mi) east of Galway city. Some of the attractions of the medieval town are its town wall, Athenry Castle, its priory and its 13th century Anglo-Norman street-plan. The town is also well known by virtue of the song \"The Fields of Athenry\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIts name derives from the ford ('\u00c1th') crossing the river Clarin just east of the settlement. Though other inaccurate explanations are still given, it was called '\u00c1th na R\u00edogh' ('Ford of the Kings') because it was the home area of the Cen\u00e9l nD\u00e9igill, kings of the Soghain, whose leading lineage were the \u00d3 Mainn\u00edn. On some medieval maps of English origin the town is called Kingstown.\nOriginally, Soghain was surrounded by U\u00ed Maine to the east, Aidhne to the south, and Maigh Seola to the west. However, after 1135, and by 1152, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair forcibly incorporated it into the newly created tr\u00edcha c\u00e9t of Clann Taidg, ruled by lords such as Fearghal \u00d3 Taidg an Teaghlaigh, who expelled the \u00d3 Mainn\u00edn family. In the 1230s the \u00d3 Taidg an Teaghlaigh family were in turn displaced by Meyler de Bermingham.The earliest remaining building in the town is Athenry Castle which was built sometime before 1240 by Meyler de Bermingham. In 1241, the Dominican Priory was founded, and became an important center for learning and teaching. It was ostensibly closed during the Protestant Reformation but survived until being desecrated and burned during the Mac an Iarla wars of the 1560s\u201380s, and was finally vandalised by Cromwellians in the 1650s. The medieval walls around Athenry are among the most complete and best preserved in Ireland with 70% of original circuit still standing, along with some of the original towers and the original North gate. The remains of the Lorro Gate were partially unearthed in 2007 during the redevelopment of road works in the area.\nIn the centre of the town is the 'square'; markets were held from the 17th century onwards and where the town's late 15th century 'Market Cross' is still located. The monument which is of Tabernacle or Lantern type is the only one of its kind in Ireland and the only medieval cross still standing in situ in the country. A Heritage centre now occupies the remains of the mid-13th century St Mary's Collegiate Church adjacent to the town Square. The original medieval church is largely destroyed but in 1828 a Church of Ireland church was built into its chancel.\nIn 1791, Jean Antoine Coquebert de Montbret visited the town, which he described as:\n\nIt covers 50 acres but has not more than 60 houses. [...] There is an abbey of which the ruins are almost all standing. There is a big uninhabited castle called Bermingham's Court [...]. In the middle of Athenry is the stump of a cross destroyed in the wars, on which a crucifix in bas-relief still remains. [...] I noticed at the door of a tavern a large cake decorated with a bouquet. It was a prize for the best dancer. [...] The road from Athenry is very beautiful and there are no barriers.\nMoyode Castle is another tall 16th-century fortified tower house of the Dolphin family, which went to the Persse family. The castle is now restored and inhabited and is located 3.5 miles (5.6 km) from the town of Athenry.\n\n\n== Economy and transport ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nBy road, Athenry is served by the M6 motorway which links Galway city to Dublin. By rail, it is served by the Athenry railway station, which opened on 1 August 1851 and lies on the Galway\u2013Dublin main line of the Irish rail network. The town is at the junction of the Galway\u2013Dublin line, and the partially complete the Western Railway Corridor (Limerick\u2013Sligo).\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nIn 2015, Apple Inc. decided to build a \u20ac850m data center near Athenry, and a similar one in Viborg, Denmark. In May 2018, Apple announced cancellation of the Athenry development.In December 2017, funding was announced for a \"Food Innovation Hub\" in Athenry, projected by its promoters to create 360 jobs within 3 years, and to cost in the region of \u20ac3.9m.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nAthenry is home to the Gaelic Athletic Association St. Mary Club, who have won numerous All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championships.\nAthenry Athletics Club has a juvenile and a senior section. The club has produced two Olympic sprinters, Martina McCarthy and Paul Hession. McCarthy represented Ireland in the women's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay at the 2000 Summer Olympics and Hession competed in the men's 200 metres at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nAthenry is also home to Athenry F.C., founded in 1971. The club reached the 2006 final of the FAI Junior Cup, and the following year it became the Galway & District League champions for the first time, repeating the same achievement during the 2007\u201308, 2009\u201310, and 2014\u201315 seasons. In 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2016, Athenry also won the Connacht Junior Cup title.Athenry is also home of the Athenry Golf Club and Athenry Judo Club.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\nAthenry is twinned with the town of Quimperl\u00e9 in Brittany (France) and, since 2013, Renews-Cappahayden, Newfoundland and Labrador (Canada).\n\n\n== People ==\nThe following is a list of notable natives of Athenry:\n\n\n== See also ==\nBattle of Maigh Mucruimhe\nBaron Athenry\nFirst Battle of Athenry\nSecond Battle of Athenry\nThe Sack of Athenry\nThe Fields of Athenry\nNevin (surname)\nList of abbeys and priories in Ireland (County Galway)\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\n\n\n== Note ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAthenry History Archive\nAthenry Community Council",

          "We stopped by this heritage center on a rainy Sunday. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. While the facilities are small, they make up for this with tons of history, and objects to fascinate the young ones (archery, weapons, heads on stakes!). We thoroughly enjoyed",

          "We went there on our way out of Galway. I had seen a mention of it my tour book and thought it would be a good way to spend an hour although I expected it to be slightly cheesy. Well, I was happily surprised. Yes, the decors and dress up might be a bit cheesy but the guide was",

          "The heritage centre may be small, but it certainly has a lot to offer. If you have little ones, definitely get the 'medieval experience' pass. They'll get to dress up and experience what life in an medieval town was like. If dress up isn't your thing, you can do the 'grown",
          "At first glance this gives the appearance of a cheesy mock-up but if you have a knowledgable guide, you will find that there is a lot of history about the place and the guide knows it. When I was there there were some families with kids and the children seemed to love it - the",

          "We had a great time in the somewhat shambolic atmosphere of the centre. The archery man was excellent - funny without being cloying but passionate and careful about health and safety. I could live without the dressing up but others in our party enjoyed that. The ad hoc play was",

          "Driving through we stopped to check this place out. We had great fun trying the archery, we had a competition between ourselves. The lady who did the tour was very informative and helpful. Dressing up in the medieval clothes was a bit of a laugh and made for some good photo",
          "We would like to thank Alan and the other staff at the heritage centre with regards to the info they gave us about the RIC in Athenry in the late 1800's. We had a wonderful tour both inside and outside of the church and learnt such fantastic information. We would like to",

          "Worth a brief visit when visiting the Castle. Housed in the old \"St Mary's Church\". It's adjacent to the Castle, but has a separate entrance. Not much different than most \"Irish\" heritage centres - but more specific to Athenry. Allow half an hour at the most.",
          "This is a great spot to spend a couple of hours, for people of any age. It's especially great for kids, as they can get up close an personal with some great medieval costumes and have a bit of fun. It is not a massive place, so it's worth checking ahead in advance if the outdoor",
          "This is our second or third time to this site, our first with children. The people who staff this place are a wealth of information and could not be more flexible and kind. They took our children into the closet and dressed them in period finery, which they absolutely loved.",

          "Used to come here quite often but since the price increase I just can't afford it. Adults have to pay an entry fee and even if our daughter just wants to go on the slide we still get charged full wack(\u20ac16) which in my eyes isn't right. Such a shame because it is a lovely place",
          "Love going here. Great facility with loads to do but can be busy on wet days. Only issue I have is the admission price can be different depending on staff member. Once I point it out it's usually ok but maybe worth noting. Also young children usually have breakfast at about",

          "We visited this place on a recommendation and because it was purportedly free for adults with each paying child - not the case when we arrived. The children played in the indoor area as the outdoor area was very busy. It's also smaller than portrayed on the brochure/leaflet.",
          "We went with a group of friends and family with children of all ages, there was something for everyone to enjoy. The smaller ones loved the indoor play area and the magical fairy walk. The older ones loved the outdoor playground and sandpit. The service and staff are amazing",

        "wiki": "Ballyvaughan or Ballyvaghan (Irish: Baile U\u00ed Bheach\u00e1in, meaning \"\u00d3 Beach\u00e1n's townland\") is a small harbour village in County Clare, Ireland. It is located on the N67 road on the south shores of Galway Bay, in the northwest corner of The Burren. This position on the coast road and the close proximity to many of the area's sights has turned the village into a local center of tourism activity. At the time of the 2011 Census Ballyvaughan had a population of 258. The area was officially classified as part of the West Clare Gaeltacht, an Irish-speaking community, until 1956.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe site was originally occupied by Ballyvaughan Castle, which stood right at the edge of the harbour. It was owned and occupied by the O'Loghlen family, except for a period in the 16th century when the O'Brians held it. In 1540, a stolen cow was found at the castle, and heavy fines were levied on the O'Loghlens\u2014loss of cattle, goats, sheep and the town of Ballyvaughan. In 1569 the castle was attacked by Sir Henry Sidney, but the O'Loghlens held on to the property. By 1840, the castle was in ruins. Only the foundations remain today.On the promontory on which the castle was situated (and on which the Irish Cottage scheme is today located), there were also other late medieval dwellings. According to Westropp's survey of Clare antiquities, the area contained \"three small forts and a much levelled ring of a great Caher.\" \n\nThe present village grew around the harbour in the 19th century, when it temporarily was a thriving port. Three older piers had been built by the villagers, who used them for herring fishing. However, these piers were almost unusable at high tide and in 1829, the Fishery Board had a new quay constructed. The pier was designed by Alexander Nimmo. By 1831, turf from Connemara was landed here in great quantities, despite the shallowness of the bay. At that point, the town had 23 houses and 151 inhabitants. In 1837, to facilitate the turf trade, another quay was constructed, apparently also based on a design of Nimmo's. By 1841 the village had grown to 235 inhabitants and 35 houses. The new quay was of great importance, as it allowed Ballyvaughan to export grain, bacon and vegetables and to import supplies from Galway. For a while, Ballyvaughan was the official capital of this region of Clare, sporting a workhouse, coastguard station and large police barracks. Over time, as the roads improved and the piers fell into disrepair, the town lost its importance as a fishing harbour.\nMore construction took place in the 1850s: in 1854, the old National School opened, and the present Roman Catholic church was built around 1860. There was also a Church of Ireland, but when this later closed, it was dismantled and re-erected at Noughaval. In 1943, it was rededicated, and it is now in use as a Catholic place of worship (St. Mochua) there.In 1872 a reservoir was constructed by Lord Annaly, southeast of the town, to supply water to the farms in the valley. This water supply was extended to the centre of town under the Public Health Act of 1874 by the Board of Guardians, using cast-iron pipes. In 1875 a fountain was erected by two brothers from Connemara, the Coyne brothers, stuck in town after their ship had sunk at Gleninagh pier.In May 1921, an Irish Republican Army (IRA) unit of approximately 25 men successfully ambushed a party of 10 Royal Marines and their sergeant in the village near the old post office. The IRA unit captured some weapons and withdrew. Privates Chandler and Bolton were mortally wounded, and Privates Lavin and Currell wounded.The location of the Workhouse, Court House, Fair Green, Police Barracks, Coast Guard, Blacksmith, Hotels, and other buildings of interest can be viewed on these historical maps of Ballyvaughan. The maps also show the location of surrounding pre-famine villages to Ballyvaughan, such as Wood Village in the townland of Knocknagroagh, as well as, other archeological sites that may be of interest.\nAt the time of the 1942/43 ITA survey, the number of inhabitants was 194. By 1991, this had dropped to 184.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nToday, Ballyvaughan's economy is mainly based on tourism. Its position on the coast road between Galway and the Cliffs of Moher brings significant pass-through tourism business to the village. Ballyvaughan has numerous pubs, restaurants, shops, B&Bs, self-catering cottages and other amenities. These include the new pier and slipway, constructed in 2006, which has opened up the area to boating, fishing, scuba diving and other maritime activities. Ballyvaughan is located on the Burren Way, a long-distance walking trail.  \n\nA previous landmark in the village was the Ballyvaughan signpost. Located at the T-junction in the center of the village, pictures of the signposts had long been used by Tourism Ireland to market the country internationally. The signpost had featured a number of colourful signs, many of which had been installed by private enterprises. Those were removed by the National Roads Authority in June 2011, causing an outcry from some residents.During the boom, Ballyvaughan had been tagged Ireland's 'Gold Coast' as a result of the huge rise in property prices in the area. Demand for holiday homes had seen the average house price in the town increase from \u20ac45,000 in 1995 to a top of \u20ac480,000 in 2005.Although the building of a local waste water disposal/treatment system has been discussed for many years, as of 2016 the sewage of Ballyvaughan is still pumped untreated into the sea. Construction of a treatment works was delayed until 2019.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nThe Burren: Each year botanists and naturalists roam this karst landscape in search of Arctic, Alpine and Mediterranean plants that grow in profusion over the limestone pavements. The Burren is renowned for its archaeology. Ballyvaughan is in proximity to numerous megalithic tombs such as Poulnabrone dolmen, situated 8 kilometres (5 mi) south of Ballyvaughan, ring forts such as Caherconnell Stone Fort, Ballyallaban ringfort or Cahermore ringfort as well as  medieval churches and castles/tower houses, such as at Gleninagh.\n3.5 km to the south is the Aillwee Cave, a show cave over 1 kilometre (0.6 mi) long.\nBeside the Aillwee Caves, just 400-metres north of the upper car-park is the novice rock-climbing location of Aill na Cronain.\nFor trained cave explorers, there is the Poll na Gollum, Faunarooska, and the Cullaun series.\nThe Burren College of Art is located outside of Ballyvaughan at Newtown Castle.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nDaith\u00ed \u00d3 Dr\u00f3na\u00ed, electronic music producer\nMary Ann Nevins Radzinowicz, academic\nSarah Poyntz, writer\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\nBurren Gold cheese\nGregans Castle\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ballyvaughan at Wikimedia Commons\n\nBallyvaughan on Clare Library Website \nClare County Council",

          "SO COOL......if your in ballyvaughan and want to do something then it's the Aillwee Caves . These caves are thousands of years old and so cool. It's about 40mins to walk the caves but well worth it. It's about \u20ac15 to do tour but much better to do caves and Birds Of Prey together",
          "Haven\u2019t been to Aliwee caves for many years. It was nice to visit the caves again which are located in the stunning landscape of the Burren. If your in the area include it on your list of sites to visit.",

          "I knew about the caves from the Father Ted episode, so was really looking forward to seeing it for myself. The whole family loved it and our guide Sandra was fantastic guiding us and explaining everything about the caves. With 2 teenagers in tow, they came out of the caves much",
          "Another very enjoyable visit to the caves. Other than keeping a safe social distance while walking the route, Covid 19 protocols have not impacted on a visit. The guide was very clear on communicating the requirements and even with us being a bit more spread out than usual her",

          "We visited last Friday with family (kids & grandkids). Tour guide while friendly was not very experienced. Social distancing meant that we were towards the back of the group & found it very hard to hear her. It became even harder when the group following us commenced their tour",
          "I did the cave and the birds of prey show. Both were very good. Our guide in the cave was very good although he spoke a bit too fast! The birds of prey show was amazing! It was pouring with rain and the girl who was giving the talk was brilliant, she didn\u2019t rush at all and the",
          "We made a last minute decision to stop here when driving through Ballyvaughan I saw it was only 10km in the opposite direction I thought we chance it seeing as we were so close, and it was certainly worth it. We went to the bird centre first, where we watched the show and got to",
          "Definitely visit here. A hidden gem and the tour and the history were brilliantly described by our guide.",

          "Are family was on a #daycation from Dublin and decided to come see the caves. Amazing experience. We all really enjoyed the tour. Special mention to Conor the guide who was great. Highly recommended if your down visiting The Cliffs of Moher as its only a 30 minute drive.",
          "Myself and mywife did a holiday around Ireland in 2016 when we couldn't travel and this was by far the best part of the trip. We returned this year and had an equally great time. The staff are so passionate and the whole place is run well. The birds seem to be happy and well",

          "Visited on a cold Jan day with my husband and thought it was great. The cave tour was really interesting and informative - the guide was excellent! The cafe had very nice food and then we visited the birds of prey area which was also excellent. Really enjoyed the audio guide",
          "Visited on a nice quiet day, so there were only 5 of us on the tour. Sandra, our guide, was knowledgeable and answered all our questions. Her passion for the place was apparent! The walk was not arduous at all, a lovely wee stroll with several stops to talk about the caves and",
          "We visited Santa this year at his workshop. The entry was very well organised and ran smoothly. The actual visit to Santa was so so disappointing. There are up to 7 families that visit Santa together. The elves that lead you in are chatting and getting the children to guess",

          "Visited Aillwee Caves Sunday for a visit at 12.05 to Santa green tags. We checked in with the nicest ladies ever. Went outside and hopped on the bus. The bus driver was just so nice. The kids loved him and really believed he was an elf. He was very good with the children and",
          "What an incredible experience from start to finish. The whole day was a huge success. We had a fairly big party of 4 children and 4 adults and it was thoroughly enjoyed by us all despite the weather the kids had plenty to do and see. I must say also that the staff were so",
          "Visited Santa's work shop in Ailwee caves on Dec 1st . Family with kids aged nearly 5 & almost 2 years old . Superb day out . Loved very much by the kids and nice mulled wine and mince pie for the adults . would highly recommend for something special for the Santa Experience",
          "Visited Santa's work shop in Ailwee caves. Family with kids age 3 and 6. Perfect family adventure for that age Something a bit different then usual visit to Santa. Loved very much by kids and adults . Will come back definitely to give better look at this place.",
          "My partner and I booked the total Ailwee Cave experience - the birds of prey, wallking the cave and, our best experience, the Hawk Walk. Our guide, Ava, took us into a forest area for a 45 minute walk with Sinead (mine, the dominant bird) and Al. She gave us a lecture about",

          "Visited this place on a school tour in the early 80\u2019s. This left a lasting impression on me. Went back again in Feb 2007 which brought back great memories. Brought my wife and two kids (8&10) there today, Nov 2019! They, like me were intrigued with the experience. There is",
          "The Aillwee caves are excellent and it\u2019s definitely worth doing the tour. The Guide will explain many different things such as the history of the caves, the rock formations and the bones they found within in it! The caves are beautiful and picturesque! Plenty of parking on site",
          "We did this tour after the bird show at the birds centre. I didn't really know what to expect, but to my surprise the cave was pretty decent. Our guide really made it more interesting with his commentary and knowledge of the caves. He was more than willing to have a chat",
          "Caves were pretty cool, the guide was knowledgeable, took maximum of an hour to finish the tour. Definitely recommend the bird sanctuary out of the two attractions though.",
          "Aillwee cave is Ireland's premier tourist cave. The staff are friendly well trained and well spoken. The cave itself is well maintained and safe to visit. The tours are fully guided and cost 15 euro per adult. There's free parking at the attraction and also offers a bird's of",
          "Ailwee Cave is an interesting limestone cave on The Burren. There are guided tours every 30 minutes. Our guide was knowledgeable about the geology and hydrology of the cave. The tour takes about 35 minutes. It was raining very heavily when we went and this made the water rise in",
          "We arrived for our Hawk Walk on a very rainy Monday. The folks at Aillwee were incredibly helpful and suggested we return the next morning when the weather would be better. We went ahead and took the informative cave tour and stayed for the interesting and exciting birds of prey",
          "We expected to spend a couple of hours here but we were there all day. The cave itself is not the best we have ever been in but it was made interesting by the guides; I was especially interested in what they were saying about the European brown bears that used to live in",
          "My sister and I took the time to visit the Aillwee Cave during our road trip around Ireland\u2019s coast and we loved it. HIGHLY recommended doing the archery class if it\u2019s available when you\u2019re there. The staff is just lovely and the experience is one of my most memorable thus far.",
          "Excellent informative visit to the caves. Very interesting walk through of 1km of cave and tunnel. Pleasant staff. Falconry exhibit was worth the extra money. Lots of different kinds of birds to see on display. Friendly staff. The demonstration, which only happens about three",
          "I'm really glad we visited this cave it was worth seeing.Also the story attached to it being discovered is wonderful.A guide takes you through the cave which is pitch dark when the lights get switched off.Some parts are wet and cold also quite narrow.Great visitors attraction",
          "We came here and did the cave tour and Birds of Prey show for 18 euro per adult. I advise buying your tickets online in advance as it will save you money. The cave tour is decently interesting but what really set this cave apart was the birds of prey center after. You get an",
          "The cave is interesting but not spectacular, the tour though was really funny and informative, just make sure your tour guide is Justin:)",
          "I liked the cave and the guided tour. Of course a cave is a cave and to my mind nothing that special so don\u2019t blame the Aillwee Cave for it. The tour was good and educative. My highlight was the part where they switch off the lights and you cannot see anything. This was quite",
          "The Aillwee Caves was an interesting guided tour. You walk about 500m into a cave system and a knowledgeable guide is available to answer any questions. It takes 35-45minutes. I thought it was a bit pricy for what the experience was, but we also went to see the birds of prey",
          "To be honest we only stumbled upton these caves by accident. I am so pleased that we did. The visit to this amazing attraction was so worth it. Our guide was so well informed and made this such a good find. Considering that these caves are reletivly new on the 'tourist",
          "The cave is an easy 45 minute walking tour. If you haven\u2019t visited many caves this is a great cave to start with to get basic information and see some nice beginning cave formations and some bones. Ive visited about 4 other caves and this is the first where I\u2019ve seen water",
          "An interesting and informative tour of the cave with a not too large group and the guide was clear and knowledgeable. Easy walking for the most part with mainly concrete pathways. Some low roofing but not too bad for me at 1.8m tall. Nice shop at the cave itself with a good",
          "It's a great 45 Minutes to explore the cave. It can't be freely accessed, but that's understandable, because actually quite dangerous! However, the walkways are very accessible and not very slippery, even though the cave is flooded regularly when raining heavily. At one point",
          "My partner and I stopped in at the Aillwee Caves today during a tour of the West Coast of Ireland. The tour was fascinating, we really enjoyed it; very informative and some great photo opportunities. What made the tour all the better was our tour guide Liz who was friendly and",
          "Visited Ailwee Caves and birds of prey show whilst on holiday last week in Ireland. The customer service was outstanding. As soon as staff realised my husband and daughter were Deaf (BSL users) they organised a 1:3 tour for us as they realised it would be difficult for us to",
          "Beautiful cave walk. Our tour guide was very good. Turning off the lights mid-walk was amazing and gave a brilliant insight to how dark it really is!! We had 2young kids with us and they loved it.",
          "I was visiting friends and we went to see the cave and the birds of prey center, and oh my god it was incredible. we saw the 4pm flying display and the birds and the falconers are amazing. I never knew that birds were of prey were so cool. the birds in the aviaries are",
          "This was our second time visiting Ailwee Caves. It\u2019s an amazing tour of this cave with very informative tour guides. The tours and run quite regularly so it\u2019s a must see if you are visiting Clare. There is also a farm type shop in the grounds which have the most amazing cheeses",
          "We really enjoyed the cave, Neville the tour guide was really informative and entertaining, he also treated our 2 children so well, he ensured their first cave experience was exciting and unforgettable. The Staff doing the bird show were also friendly and helpful",
          "Been before but worthy of a repeat visit.. coupled with the bird of pray worked well, birds, cave, birds.. cheese shop chaos though.. won't repeat that any time soon..",
          "Amazing experience. Liz our guide did agreat job in warning us when the cave was goinf to go lower and the light was brilliantly done. With informative info on the hibernating bears and stoneformations.There is a new tour every 15/30 minute. You would be able to go through it",
          "Enjoyed our visit. Our young guide was very informed and had time to answer all our questions. Well worth a trip if you're anywhere near. Wonderful natural cave.",
          "I visited here with my family and paid \u20ac40 to visit the caves only. You are stopped at the entrance and you pay while in the car. This struck me as strange as it has the potential to lead to a build up of traffic at peak times. The tour brings you 500m into the cavern and",
          "Myself and my partner had a wonderful day out here. The cave itself is fascinating, I had been there on a school tour when I was a child, and the memories came flooding back. It is enlightening to get a sense of the flow of time when a stalactite has only gown a millimeter in",
          "It is so amazing and beautiful to see and walk. My young kids love it. Yes it was quite chill but not complain about it. It help me to cool down with hot sunny outside. Ha.",
          "I recently went to this cave with my family. The price to go into the cave was not too expensive. There is also a large car park near the cave and before you enter the cave you can look around the small gift shop. The tour of the caves is quite short and it only takes about 40",
          "This is an experience you will enjoy if you like visiting caves but you won't be blown away by it as the cave simply isn't big enough, but it's still worth a visit. When you go though, do NOT miss the Birds of Prey experience. It's only an extra 7 euro on top of the 15 euro for",
          "This has to be one of the easiest caves to visit, mostly on the one level, ramps to the entrance and exit of the cave and as far as I can remember only a couple of steps. You do have to mind your head in a few areas, that you don\u2019t bang any rocks. I was here in the 80\u2019s not",
          "It's was a very scary experience for us, and amazing at the same time our guide make us a really interesting tour through the cave and a little science class.",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to these caves. The caves were breathtaking, our guide, Eva, was brilliant and very knowledgeable. I enjoyed the tour far more than I was expecting to",
          "We visited Aillwee cave as a time filler on our way home and we were very surprised with how good it was. Although we had read the literature, we had previously visited similar exhibitions elsewhere and were underwhelmed. Aillwee delivered in that is a relatively recent find,",
          "Spent the day there today and myself and my three lads really enjoyed it. The birds of prey is well worth going to, each person having a remote tour guide really helped my two special needs boys stay engaged. The tour in the caves was excellent, our tour guide Neville was",
          "Went to the caves with my 2 sons aged 9 & 6 years old. The caves are a must see and do if you are in the area. The staff are helpful, friendly and very knowledgeable. The birds of prey show was fantastic and our 6 year old got to hold a barn owl. Amazing flying display with",
          "We visited last week with our 19 month old and 3 year old toddler. When we approached main gate in car the attendant saw and acknowledged we had small kids in back of car and nothing was mentioned about buggies etc. We said we wanted to do caves and not the bird show. We drove",
          "Took a trip down memory lane from my childhood and re visited the caves . The tour guide was very informed & pleasant throughout . The tour itself through the cave is guided and takes about 30 minutes. Though you purchase your ticket at the entrance gate , when you get to the",
          "First the staff they are so helpful patient and genuinely friendly. The cave is always amazing no matter how often I\u2019ve visited. Food was cooked fresh which was very good. The birds of prey shows are spectacular and the trainers are incredible. All in all a great day out.",
          "From start to finish the staff could not have been more helpful, especially when my children wanted them to mind their newly bought bears incase they got wet in the cave. my daughter was scared so was encouraged that it wasnt scary and there were lights everywhere. our guide was",
          "We visited the cave on our tour through Ireland. The tour guide was interesting and the cave was OK, but we have been in many other caves that had a wow factor. We are pensioners, so the reduced admission didn\u2019t seem so bad, but the full price May have made us think twice",
          "We had a lovely visit to the cave. I haven\u2019t been for almost 10 years. The tour guide was great but I was a little disappointed with the many torches and phones being used to light the way through. I felt that the lighting was sufficient and they took away the cave ambiance. In",
          "We stumbled upon this cave while exploring the Burren and decided to do the tour. The tour guide was very friendly and gave good information, the tour was not very long and it was an easy walk. The caves\u2019 tour allows a better appreciation of the area\u2019s geology and history,",
          "Great tour with a real good guide! Wonderful natural tour and educational experience. The gift shop is also nice. Make sure to visit the Birds of Prey exhibit too, and the cheese shop!",
          "If you have kids, this is a pretty cool activity with a lot of \"spooky\" history. Not to challenging a climb down and back up and the video before the tour is a great little geology and history lesson for teens learning this stuff in school - and for the old lady like me who",

          "We stopped by for a cave tour, and had a great time. The tour was informative and fun, the cave are beautiful and well maintained. We had no problem navigating through with our five year old on the tour, and there were plenty of stops for photos. The price is very reasonable and",
          "We came to visit the cave and had a great time at the bird displays. The staff and presenters at both were excellent. The birds appeared happy. There was no impression of them being distressed. The cave is limited, but the information and humour of the guide made it worthwhile.",
          "We were staying in Lahinch and drove to the Aillwee Caves. When were arrived we had a short wait, 10 minutes to the next tour. It was \u20ac15 per person for the caves only. We were guided into the tour by a member of staff from the caves. She gave us lots of educational information",
          "This was my second time visiting the caves... Gift shop and tea room on arrival.. Staff very welcoming... Our tour guide made the visit fun.. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "We went here because we were told their farm shop had Burren Honey. You should visit just for that! They will wrap the jars for your stored baggage. But this is a beautiful spot that also has a bird of prey sanctuary and aviary.",
          "Not the largest or the most interesting of caves but still very much worthwhile. The guide provides fascinating insight and the fact that it doesn't last forever is a bonus. Along with the excellent parking, shops and very well equipped cafe made it all the more enjoyable.",
          "How many chances do you get to be guided through a dark, geologically fascinating cave with a hilarious Irishman? Justin was a terrific guide!",
          "Visited yesterday with some of my family and we had a great day. Loved the birds of prey. Was nice learning different facts and seeing them up close. Would be great if they could show more though. The caves were good. Our guide Gerry was great. Full of information and some",
          "Bird show was great and very informative, tour of the caves was excellent. These caves and bird show are well worth a visit for a enjoyable family day out.",
          "Stopped in coffee shop at aillwee caves on Saturday with 6 friends while cycling in the Burren. With a big climb ahead we needed some energy and we're spoiled for choice. Exotic cheese rolls, brilliant fruit cake and great coffee and we were ready to take on anything. Really",
          "If you have a very small children, or people that can only spend a short time in the cave environment, this might be OK. The tour is quaint, rather short, and the caves are nothing much worth mentioning. The largest stalagmite is about a foot tall. At the price of \u20ac12.50, for an",
          "The last time I was in the Alliwee caves was on a school tour 30+ years ago and I was very impressed and taken with them back then so it was great to go back with my own children. We got the combined Burren Birds of Prey centre and Alliwee caves ticket and its great value.",
          "Visited this activity with some friends who had children from 8 to 13 with them and all enjoyed an excellent. On arrival was met with super staff from the girl at front gate to the girls in both sections , birds of pray and the caves who made our visit a very pleasant",

          "Although it is not the most spectacular cave, it's still worth a visit. The guide was very friendly and motivated and gave an interesting tour. Good with kids.",
          "CAAAAVES! Caves everywhere! Who doesn\u2019t love caves? I love this tour. Our tour guide explained to us every cave we visited and its history. It was an interesting tour with so much helpful information to absorb. The staff members are so accommodating and friendly too.",
          "We came here with our 2 young kids. Our 6 year old loved it! It was very interesting and easy to access.",
          "We visited the caves with our 2 young girls - 5 & 2 1/2 - on a very wet & windy afternoon. We timed it perfectly (purely accidental) and walked straight on to a tour so there was no waiting around. The girls managed the walk through the caves absolutely fine & found the story",
          "The drive to this cave is through winding narrow country roads. But after the visit, I think the drive was well worth it. The staff was friendly, the tour guide was very knowledgeable. There is a water fall in the middle of the cave, which is unusual. The history of it all is",
          "The cave is really amazing. It was a 40 minute guided tour which was explained in a professional and humourous way. I wpuld recommend this to anyone in the area.",
          "Arrived very late for last tour of the evening only to find that we were the only people there on a wet windy cold day A personal guided tour was excellently given and very enjoyable and the cave is bigger than you think",
          "I\u2019ve seen bigger and better but it still was something to see. It is in Burren so the scenery was different",
          "Yes its a cave and yes it has bear bones. Do leprechauns leave there? Dunno, ask the lady who was in our group and was writing the book on the thing. Enough about this jib jab and let\u2019s get to business. The cave is nice and the tour guide gave a lovely overview of stuff that is",
          "We had lunch in the cafe, and the food and service were very nice. As an adult, I found the cave a little boring, but the kids really enjoyed it! The tour guide did an amazing job and shared lots of interesting info with us, but she talked a little too fast.",
          "We drove up while staying in Doolin and were glad we made the trip. We had already visited Doolin Caves and was also keen to visit here. Personally I found Doolin Cave and the incredible Stalictite had the edge but the perfect dark in this cave was almost as impressive. The walk",
          "Visited the Cave this week, hadn't been to the caves in about 15 years and i still loved it, i brought my canadian friends to the caves who were over for a few days and it was the highlight of the vacation they said. our tour guide \"Sandra\" was soo helpful and answered all the",
          "Visited here with family including small children (5 and 9). First part of the tour is the bird center where you sit outside in a small amphitheater setting and the guides bring out various birds of prey to show you and demonstrate them in flight. Initially very interesting, but",
          "Loved the caves! Interesting guided tour. The raptor center is exceptional. Make sure you plan your visit around a flying exhibit. The raptors receive excellent care and have a remarkable amount of freedom. I would advise going by car or tour. It\u2019s quite a walk from the bus stop",
          "We went on a 2h drive to the caves. We called ahead to make sure the tour was going ahead. We arrived at 16.55 and she told us the tour was already gone and there was no way to join the tour. The contact person was not helpful what so ever. Waste of time for an extremely",
          "This is well worth a visit as has more than just the Cave to visit.There is Birds of Prey, forest/hill walks,farm/local produce shop,gift shop and excellent Tea rooms.The Birds of Prey is educational with very experienced guides.Wonderful to see some of the birds in flight.You",
          "The caves are only accessible with a guide. It was quite busy when we arrived, and various groups of people were allocated a guide/tour time based on a coloured disc system. However, we didn't have long to wait, and there is a nice gift shop to have a browse when you are",
          "We stopped here on a whim! Lovely and knowledgeable staff a real gem! The tour is just long enough to be interesting but not too long to become boring. Highly recommend!",
          "This is an excellent Santa experience, right from the outset. Free punch/tea/coffee and mince pies on arrival, some fairground rides outside, lovely gifts when we signed in (mug and candle holder for the parents and Christmas activity pack for the kids), a puppet show,",
          "Take a trip to this wonderful cave while you are co Clare you will be amazed. Your guide know everything about the history of the cave",

          "This was our first visit to Santa at Ailwee caves with our 7-year-old boy. We have done five other venues throughout the years and this was by far the best experience. The staff were lovely and for the first time felt we got value for money. For the adults there was tea,",
          "We visited the caves for their Santa experience, it was brilliant, very well organised and professional, friendly staff! The first time I\u2019ve been to something like this in Ireland where everything was included in the price, gift bags for parents, present plus activity bag for",
          "I love caves! These are the caves that appear in Father Ted when they go to The Very Dark Caves! Great guided tour, really interesting and just the right length. We did this and the bird of prey centre afterwards and both together made for a fun day out!",
          "This is truly a spectacular outing. Plan to wear some comfortable shoes and clothing and plan to be overwhelmed by the knowledge received by the incredible staff",
          "Follow the signs which are plentiful and guide you directly to the entrance of the property. At the entrance of the property is the Bird of Prey Exhibit. Continue past this and up the road to the top parking area where the cave building is located. There is plenty of parking.",
          "You can't be afraid of enclosed spaces and go there. I enjoyed the history of how it was discovered and how it became an attraction. It's narrow and slippery in places, but certainly manageable.",
          "Combined this with the birds of prey centre well worth a visit. Very informative guided tours every half hour or so.",
          "I really enjoyed the caves ,it is 35 minutes long which was perfect.The guide was excellent and very knowledgeable..It was a cool experience.",
          "We visited aillwee cave as a family of five and thought it was only ok. The package for the cave and birds is great value. The tour guide was great but the cave itself is not amazing. Last year we visited the mitchelstown caves in cork which are geographically amazing. Aillwee",
          "Visited with our three young boys and found the tour to be very informative. Our eldest has been learning about rock formation so loved hearing about the stalactites. Very fascinating tour with natural waterfalls and learning how the cave was found. Our children really liked it",
          "Took a guided tour out to Co. Clare and got to go into this cave that was discovered in the 40's by a local farmer who was looking for his dog. The guide was very informative telling us about the history of the cave find as well as the age of the cave, how it came to be and",
          "The guides are great and give the tour in a very fun and informative way. Great sight to see and be amazed by the natural beauty in darkness!",
          "Loved the tour of the caves, got a discounted rate of \u20ac5 since I was with a Lally day tour. Justin, the tour guide, was awesome. Fairly certain I'm in love with him now \ud83d\ude02 very informative and funny",
          "We all enjoyed this and stayed for 2 bird displays. A bit off the tourist trail which suited us. Fun and informative. We now love vultures!",
          "The cave itself is interesting. The guide made it a very pleasurable tour. The walk was not difficult and is accessible to people of varying abilities. The exterior grounds are beautiful and there is a nice little caf\u00e9 / gift shop at the entrance of the cave.",
          "Visited the caves on a damp day which allowed us the opportunity to see the cave at work with waterfalls emerging from cracks in the walls and ceilings. Our tour guide was very informative. Unfortunately the cave walk was only 35 minutes long so afterwards there was only the",
          "The cave by itself is not mind blowing, but our guide Justin was incredible! It was a very funny and entertaining tour. We would recommend the tour with him as a true Irish experience. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 We were very especially impressed with his scientific terminology. \ud83d\ude09 All together",
          "We stopped here part of our drive through the area and we wanted to check the cave. We were luck to got into the last tour of the day inside the cave. Our tour guide was excellent. The problem was once we finished the tour and went to our car, the tour guide came warning us to",
          "We had the pleasure of visiting Aillwee Cave during our 2 night stay in Galway and it did not disappoint. The birds of prey display was informative and fun to watch and the cave tour was phenomenal. Justin was an excellent tour guide, making sure everyone's attention was kept on",
          "There are so many other beautiful & interesting case in other countries. 12euro is really too much for this cave. We are very disappointed.",
          "My wife and I visited the cave on 9/19/2018. Our guide was Justin, he was absolutely fantastic. He was knowledgeable and humorous as well. I have a prosthetic leg so, there are low parts of the cave and stairs, but you take you time and all went well. You will love\\freak, when",
          "I would recommend the cave tour and the Birds of prey center. Our guide made our experience memorable by teaching us, very entertainingly, about the Burren and geological features of the cave, how it was found and what they know about it. Our kids & we both enjoyed the tour of",
          "This is really cool, and worth the visit. We found out about it as an alternative activity to a cliff walk we had planned, but it was just too rainy. This is extremely interesting and well-preserved. The guide was helpful, and we are glad we had the chance to see this!",
          "I visited the cave with my 10 year old son last week and we both throughly enjoyed our tour. My son really liked when the lights were turned off so we could experience what the cave was like when it was first entered. I had previously visited the cave in 2013 and I did find that",
          "went with my 3 children who loved it .the guide was both funny and informative and the cave itself has its features well lit and explained.dont go if your claustrophobic or afraid of the dark(spoiler alert).",
          "If I had it to do over again, we would skip this due to the price. Interesting cave but it took too long to go through and it got boring. The tour guide tried but the commentary was a bit dull. Too many people in each group",
          "Fun time with family exploring the underground world of the Burren! The cave temperature was a welcomed reprieve from the summer heat wave taking place. Tour guide was very informative and amazing background story about the cave. Great rock features too!",
          "A lovely place to visit with the family. The guide was very friendly and witty. A nice family day out.",
          "i went with my three girls ,the guide made the experience a thoroughly enjoyable one. he was both funny and informative,the short journey through the cave was littered with illuminated points of interest and the total blackout moment was a great hit.in short i'd recommend it .",
          "Very well organised tour of the caves with a great guide. The whole experience was good with a fabulous farm shop and some members of our party loved the bird experience too",
          "The cave is interesting. It is a bit of a walk inside. Some stalactites and stalagmites but not a lot as in some other caves. But the tour guide made this stop memorable. He engaged the kids and the adults - all seemed to have a wonderful time.",
          "The cave is really interesting and is really recommended. Tour was good and the guide was well informed perhaps a little rushed though. It would have been nice to know how long it would take and mire opportunity for questions to be asked. Not sure if the non english speakers",
          "The ailwee caves have been famous for years but for me the birds of prey show is much more interesting especially for kids. For most of us city dwellers all we ever see are pigeons and robins etc. To go to a beautifully laid out sanctuary where yo can get up close to some rare",
          "I was underwhelmed. The tour guide made no effort to communicate with the entire group. He only spoke to the 4 or 5 people in the front row. But at least we got to see the very dark caves and when he turned off the light it was really like being blind.",
          "Uniquely interesting ..well run and very professional approach from staff made our visit very enjoyable ..would recommend.",
          "My family enjoyed its trip underground. It might not be the biggest or most spectacular cave, but it\u2019s certainly well worth a visit. The tour guide was extraordinary and made our visit truly memorable. We\u2019d definitely recommend Aillwee Cave!",
          "As a senior, I found this physically trying. It's certainly not friendly to tall people. I am only 5'3\" and I had to duck my head several times. Aside from that, it is not child friendly either. At least not for children under the age of 10. It is dark, difficult to see and to",
          "We stopped in here on our way to Lisdoonvarna, as we are big Father Ted fans and wanted to see the very, very dark caves. They were nothing special, but the birds of prey were a surprising bonus to us and we liked the tea room.",
          "We had coffee and sandwich in coffee bar. Coffee was excellent but sandwich bland. Service and staff are very nice. Went to cheese shop jams are a little expensive but they are unique in there own way so the price serves that purpose.",
          "The Caves are worth a visit, but Ballyvaughan is overpriced with nothing much to do there and full of expensive restaurants which are way overpriced!! Visit the caves, but give the village a miss or just stop off at the pier for 5 minutes. In those few minutes you will have",
          "Great day... the birds were spectacular and children got to hold them if they wanted. The caves where great. The your guide was great at telling the history. Children loved it. Had a cuppa and sandwich afterwards and visited the gift shops.. well worth the visit",
          "As we were already visiting the Birds of Prey Centre, we decided to add the Aillwee Cave to our visit. We were taken on an informative guided tour through the caves which lasted over 30 minutes. The history of the cave is very interesting and to be able to explore the the",
          "The cave was nice but not super impressive compared to what we have seen in the us. Very hard to hear the guide with all the people let in our group and kids talking over her. Food was not impressive.",
          "This is just amazing place visited last week with 3 friends. It's just a short drive off the road and pleasantly surprised with the entrance and a lovely smell of coffee from the tea rooms. Then a guided tour down the caves and got amazing details of the history from the guide.",
          "Kids loved it, plenty to see. They were really interested to hear about the bears. Makes for a good day tying it together with the excellent birds of prey",
          "Visited Birds of Prey and Ailwee Caves which are located in the Heart of the Burren and about 3 to 4 Km from Ballyvaughan. Our first stop was the birds of prey centre.(1st. car park). On admission you are provided with an audio device thereby giving you all the information you",
          "Arriving at lunchtime we expected to have to wait for a tour slot but we only had to wait 20 minutes as the next tour had space. The tour guide was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, however the actual tour group had almost 30 people which meant we spent a lot of time waiting for",
          "Visited Aillwee today with our two kids - one 6 and the other 2. It was a great tour for them, if a little short, but to be fair, nature didn't design some of her wonders with the length of a tour in mind. at the start of the tour the guide was outlining the presence of",
          "Whilst it's still fairly enjoyable for adults this feels more like a kids adventure. The natural waterfalls were great, good spot but was over before it really got going",
          "Yes if you are in the area it\u2019s worth a visit but I wouldn\u2019t rave about plenty of walking with a very informative guide if your tall watch your head We didn\u2019t visit the birds of prey show",
          "If you\u2019re in the Galway area to visit the Cliffs of Moher, make this stop part of your day. The location includes a woodland trail, a birds of prey exhibit and the caves. We took a 30 min tour of the caves and it was awesome. The guide explained the discovery of the caves and",
          "Spent a very interesting couple of hours at Aillwee Caves and it's Birds of Prey Conservation Site. It would have been a bit expensive but for a discount which we picked up in hotel brochure in Portlaoise. The birds were beautiful and the open air flying show was wonderful to",
          "This is definitely worth a visit if you are in This area.We got a great tour guide who brought a lot of entertainment to the tour.Very friendly and helpful staff in all areas.Its surroundings are beautiful and should you climb the mountain it has some great views.",
          "My partner and I visited the Aillwee cave and Burren birds of prey centre because neither of us had been in over 10 years. We paid for a combined ticket for the caves and birds, and were told that we could come back to catch the next bird show after we had been in the cave, so",
          "We were very disappointed with our tour and came out wondering what we had just wasted our money on!",
          "Visited the caves 2 weeks ago.. Had a lovely time.. They are defiantly worth a visit and our Tour guide was brilliant, very funny and easy to understand... But I'm sorry to have to say folks but your toilet facilities are disgusting... I nearly got sick with the smell, floor was",
          "I visited this cave with my daughters,one adult one teen. The expectation were big, but the cave and the guide made all even better than we expected. Long narrow tunnels, not for claustrophobic persons at all, but if you can take it, it\u2019s really place to visite.",
          "This place is easy to find because a lot of people go here and there are good signs. We had to pay at the bottom of the long uphill driveway (there was a gate). You can choose to do the birds of prey here, too, or just the cave. There are also multiple gift shops and food",
          "fab weather for our visit, falcon\\bird show a must see, shop on way to caves has a fab cheese and fudge selection, staff very friendly, cave tour interesting",
          "If you visit here - get the combined ticket for the cave and the birds of prey. The cave is interesting especially the story behind it - our guide was very interesting, but the best bit for us was the Birds of Prey. They have an audio guide that you can use to learn more about",
          "This is a great thing to do, we were late for the BIrds of Prey show but if going there, get a combined ticket as the recommendations for the show are good. The cave is simply amazing - constant temperature no matter the outside conditions, the guide was really knowledgeable,",
          "Thank you Stephen for a great tour. We enjoyed your enthusiasm and information provided :) Great Elvis interpretation :):):)",
          "Nice gift shop. Nice cafe. Cave tour is short but the guide made it interesting enough. There's only so much you can see but it's worth it if you appreciate the time it took to form!",
          "Went to caves the same day as Birds of Prey on the way to Cliffs of Moher. Our group had kids and teens and it was good for all ages to explore. Would recommend as a combined package.",
          "did the Hawk Walk at the Aillwee Caves and had a great time! Our guide was great, he was informative and you could tell really enjoyed his job. the grounds are beautiful. I apologize for not remembering names. this is a definite suggestion in my view.",
          "We very much enjoyed our visit to Aillwee Cave and the adjacent birds of prey exhibit and show. The folks running the place are very nice, and knowledgeable. If you sign up to go into the cave, you will have repeated warnings to watch your head. This is very sound advice,",
          "This was a well organised and run outfit. Tours go every 20-30 minutes with only one tour in the cave at a time. The cave is pretty cool with a couple of indoor waterfalls. Good chance to see some young stalactites and stalagmites.",
          "I was pleasantly surprised as I wasn't aware we were going to stop at Aillwee Cave on our day tour with a tour group. I love cave tours, so I was excited and wasn't disappointed. We had a delightful guide, who was very knowledgeable about the cave and about the geology of the",
          "This was a fun experience. There's not too many caves in Ireland and this one is a great one to see. I enjoyed taking photos inside of the caves.",
          "This is not the best example of a cave experience but a nice introduction. The people are nice and there are some unique things to see in the cave. It was a nice diversion as we stayed for 2 shows at the Burren bird center.",
          "Had been here as a child shortly after it opened and it\u2019s as amazing as it was then. The tour guide was great and it\u2019s well worth it. Entrance is a model of how to merge a tourist site into the landscape. Park in the birds of prey centre and walk up though the woodland walk.",
          "I never like being negative, but this destination is nothing but a damp hole in the ground. There's really nothing in the cave to compare to other places you've been. Stalactites and stalagmites that are a few inches long. The visitor center is architecturally interesting and",
          "This is an interesting place to visit and would be great for families with kids. The guided tour of the cave takes about half an hour. There are some low and narrow spots and some places can be a little slippery but all very do-able for virtually everyone. (Probably not the best",
          "While this is a fantastic tour to do, and is perfect in every way, it's such a pity to have modern pop music blaring out in the car park, overlooking such a beautiful vista. It also impedes the sound of the calling of the next tour groups. please drop it !",
          "This was worth a stop. The caves, while not the most beautiful I have seen, were atmospheric and intetesting.",
          "We decided to go to the Aillwee Cave since one of our group had never been in a cave before. It was a nice tour and very informative.",
          "Mighty place to visit and learn. In the Burren, might be a little hard to find but the staff are great and you will enjoy the whole experience. Something different!!",
          "We came across this by accident driving across the Burren and so glad we visited, it is a very well laid out facility with Woodland Walks as well as the Birds of Pray Show and the Cave. At \u20ac 12 per adult to do either the Cave or Birds of Pray show or \u20ac 18 to do both, I thought",
          "While on a short family break, the kids chose this as their favourite location to visit. The place is nice, the burren is one of my favourite places... quite stark and rough, but very scenic. The caves are nice, maybe not suitable for very small children, but ours did enjoy the",
          "It is a short and unappealing visit except for the guide's storytelling. The cave has nothing special to offer apart from an underground waterfall and it takes you a brief 25mins to see.",
          "The Aillwee caves were a great way for young teens to see real stalactites and stalagmites. A good way to turn a holiday into a wonderful learning experience. My daughter was initially apprehensive about spending a morning underground but when the guide started the tour, she",
          "Keen prices with Kelloggs offer. Good friendly staff. 35 mins tour. Informative guide. Free parking.",
          "We passed the section from Ballyvaughan to the Aillwee Cave tourist center. The distance given on the signs differs slightly from reality, nevertheless the entire route is an asphalt road. The road is not demanding. You can view the rocky hills of the Burren Park. There is a",
          "Fantastic tour guide Justin very funny made the tour. Plus the birds of prey centre excellent value day out very educational",
          "I visited here due to it appearing in Father Ted. The cave itself is worth a visit even if have never watched Father Ted. The tour is very good. Also they do turn the lights out in the cave and it is very dark! You can only visit the cave by tour.",
          "Maybe it's because I have been on cave tours before, but I was not super impressed with this tour. It was a bit pricey. We were a group of 4 added on to a tour bus group. Lots of people in a small dark space.",
          "There are several caves around, but we choose this one after seeing a video of it on the flight over from the US. It was a relatively easy walk, but do wear a coat as it can be a bit chilly in the cave (and damp) they also have a bird center with falconing trips which we",
          "I am rating this as I do because it was not worth my time or the drive. Thankfully it was included in my cruise as an excursion. A VERY dark cave with little to see. Gift shop was nice and food good but unless you REALLY like caves, skip it and go get a pint!",
          "Well, hopefully this review will alert someone to the fact that this is a deep, dark cave with very small spaces at some points. Of course this seems like common sense but for whatever reason I didn't really consider it because the pictures I saw seemed to be a quite open space.",
          "I don't care for caves, but my children (5&9) always seem to find them whenever we travel. I was thrilled when the tour guide announced that the cave tour would last approximately 35 minutes from start to finish. Our guide was very thorough, explaining the history of the cave",
          "Very dark and dangerous for small kids, not mush to it expect walking in the dark.... Would recommend the birds of prey and skip the cave!",
          "The tour is about one hour with guide to explain many of the interesting facets of the cavern. As usual with our experiences in Ireland, there are very few posted details along the tour.",
          "A local co-worker recommended the caves and took us there and it was a lot of fun. Best for people who haven't been into a cave before as it is relatively small but still great to go in and see it. The visitor center for the cave is impressive with a great coffee shop while you",
          "It was interesting to explore under the Burren. Tour was informative but cave was not that memorable. The staff and treats at the cafe were worth the visit. The cheese is amazing and people here couldn\u2019t be nicer.",
          "It was ok, but there wasn't a whole lot of things in there that were very interesting. The floor was very slippery and not well lighted in places.",
          "Though a modest attraction we enjoyed the walk through the caves, seeing what lies underneath the Burren. If you want to see the Birds of Prey show, check times before you go as we almost bought a combined ticket before finding out the next on was almost 3 hours away. Cave tour",
          "I hadn't been to the caves since I was a child on a school tour so it was nice to go back and experience them as an adult. We were greeted at the gate by a very friendly lady who told us the prices and if we bought a ticket for the caves and the birds of prey it would be \u20ac18",
          "We had a good tour guide who made the walk into the dark fun. He was knowledgeable, was able to fill us with good facts on the origin of the cave, and took small delight in shutting off the lights to let us see what true darkness is. It was an easy walk, fun to see how Mother",
          "This was our second time taking the kids to the Aillwee Caves, in particular to see the birds of prey. We looked at all the birds before the show started and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The two staff were really engaging and knowledgeable. They flew the 3 Harris Hawks, the two",
          "Went solely for the caves. Remebered them from going as a kid and had a ball. Was hoping the same when bringing my own. To be honest it was fine. The guide went through the motions, not personable. Its quite expensive and dont think I will be back",
          "It was a very rainy day so we opted to visit the caves. At 12 Euro per person we found it expensive and the tour of the cave was not that long. Some nice sights but nothing spectacular. If you have nothing else to do then give it a go.",
          "If you like caves you will like this. If you are not a cave enthusist this might be okay to skip. We enjoy all forms of caves and this was no exception.",
          "We were first time inside a cave and for us it seems pretty good. Our tour guide made the tour very interesting.",
          "Never knew how cool caves were until this tour! Our tour guide was very informative and made the tour very interesting. Well worth a visit but book online in advance because it was a few euro cheaper. Nice little cafe and gift shop as well as a nice mountain walk on top of the",
          "We arrived a bit late after touring the Burren (16.00). Nevertheless the gracious and welcoming young women at the counter got us into the 4:30 cave tour. They also arranged for us to visit the Birds of Prey Centre the next morning, as we had purchased both online in advance.",
          "Aillwee Cave is a great place for a family visit. The Christmas experience however is definitely one not to be missed. They offer great entertainment and the plus of meeting Santa in the Caves. Great family day out and would highly recommended.",
          "Great tour. Well worth a visit. We were day on a wet & cold day. But this had added benefits..1) the cave constantly & naturally stays at 10\u00b0 so it wasn't cold & 2) because it was raining it feed through to the waterfall in the cave. Well worth a visit. Bear bones not there at",
          "The Ailwee cave experience is fantastic. The tour lasts for 45 mins with informative and interesting commentary from the lovely tour guides. Took my 4 year old and they loved it but wouldn\u2019t recommend for smaller children, not for those who are afraid of the dark as they turn",
          "We have been travelling to the Aillwee Caves for many years to visit Santa Claus. It is the most seamlessly run event and our children have enjoyed it from a young age right up to the eldest who is now 15yrs old. We, the parents, look forward as much as our children to our visit",
          "We had a lovely 30minute guided tour through the ailwee cave. The tour was very educational and the guide explained the history and features in great detail. The pathway through the cave was a little slippy and narrow at areas. There is a lovely little cafe for tea and treats",
          "Had a wonderful time in the Aillwee Cave Caf\u00e9 - absolutely brilliant staff, fantastic portion sizes, and really good value for money. Strongly recommend!",
          "Had a very enjoyable visit to the caves recently. Our guide Justin was very entertaining and very well informed. Easy to get around,very nice walks around the attraction too. Lovely coffee shop and gift shop on site also.",
          "This is a great visit. A lovely gift shop and a nice caf\u00e9. The gift shop however is expensive but has some lovey things. The cave itself is amazing. very cool tour. Quite cold & Very dark so if you do not like small dark spaces be mindful that its exactly that. The tour only",
          "We visited the grounds on Sunday 31 December. It was wonderful to have an amenity open where we could park, take a walk, get refreshments, browse the artisan food shop and receive a warm welcome both in the shop and from the girl in attendance at the gate lodge. We brought home",
          "Checked online, it says open! Planned my trip and rented a car. Traveled all the way from Dublin to see it... worse and most dangerous icy slippery narrow mountain road! When arrived, the security at the gate said it\u2019s closed for special kids event to see the animals for",
          "We first visited this cave 20 years ago while we were on honeymoon and thought it would be nice to visit it again after 20 years as we were in the general area anyway. Naturally the cave itself hasn't changed but the tour guide appeared to be going through the motions and didn't",
          "I love the caves because it really is something different to do than the usual tourist attractions. Suitable for all ages, but be aware -they're dark and slippy! Wear appropriate shoes with grips and if you have issues with mobility or eyesight, be careful, hold onto someone.",
          "This was the best thing we done whilst in Co.Clare. We spent most of the day here and we loved every second. I have children from age 7 to 13 and they all loved every second of this visit. Thank you to all the staff. As a place I would have visited as a child myself, I am so",
          "The cave car park offers beautiful sweeping views of the Burren and coast. The cave tour itself is interesting, particularly the brown bear remains, and the period of total darkness on the tour. However, Crag Cave in Kerry and the Marble Arch caves in Fermanagh are more",
          "Guided tour through the caves with lots of interesting geology facts and how they were discovered. Not for the claustrophobic and also they turn all the lights off at one point if you don't like pitch darkness!",
          "If you are going to the Burren Bird of Prey Centre, you should get a joint ticket for here. It's interesting, & fun for kids. Only takes 30-40 min so it can be easily done before the bird show...",
          "We went here to see Santa with our two children. It was a great day out and everyone enjoyed the day. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The birds of prey show was really entertaining.",
          "My 11 year old wanted to go farther in! This 40 minute tour was well worth the visit. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and pointed out the sites in the cave. The cave made for some great pictures. Highly recommend!",
          "Very good, Kids loved it, going through the caves was a great adventure, maybe it could be improved by Santa having a real beard?",
          "This is a must see for any traveler , its an awesome site dating back millions of years , the site possess the only evidence that bears ever roamed the island of Ireland. We went in the summer and its quite cold in the cave so wrap up.",
          "Most entertaining Santa I have been to. Really enjoyed him and the fun with the children of all ages. A treasure. Birds of Prey display was great also. Good day out for all.",
          "We had a really nice time in Aillwee Cave. Tour itself is about 30 minutes long. Our tour guide (think her name is Liz) was really nice and she take her time explaining us interesting facts about cave. I would recommend to visit the cave but if you're short with time maybe to",
          "I bought a combo ticket for the cave and the birds of prey. Luckily the birds were excellent and made up for the cave tour. There is a great view of the burren and the valley and sea from the cave car park, but the experience is marred by the music playing all throughout the car",
          "We went to the Ailwee cave on the recommendation from our hotel. We hadn't known a thing about it beforehand and I'm so glad we went. We toured the cave first and it took about 40 minutes to go through. It was interesting, but not the coolest part of my day. The coolest part by",
          "Amazing experience seeing some history of Ireland. We felt safe going so far into this cave, rails and lighting well set up. Justin was a great tour guide!",
          "We had rented a car so we had the luxury of just taking any ol' turn off the main road that we wanted. This park was laid out nicely. It was an interesting cave with a bird center and a gift store. It was $12 to get in. The guide was friendly and knowledgeable. We enjoyed",
          "We had a great tour of Ailwee cave at halloween which was fantastic. They had a spooky cave tour with lots of creepy things around each corner and the tour guide was terrific. Our kids loved it!",
          "Nice spot for a family trip... Our children enjoyed it... Both under 10. Guide was good and cave is interesting.",
          "I was not expecting to feel any panic, but as soon as I started down the dark damp tunnel that led .5kms deep, I knew it would be a bad experience for me. Fortunately, they allow you to turn around anytime before the first stop. I did have a nice walk on the Burren above while",
          "This combined with birds of prey made for a fantastic family day. Very interesting tour guide and brilliant to see.",
          "Well worth a visit, unexpectedly the birds were allowed to fly freely, even my children got to hold the birds, fantastic day out",
          "What an incredible limestone cave system, so much larger than what I expected. I have visited a good few caves and mines in Ireland, but this is the most impressive one by far!",
          "I love Aillwee Caves, I've been quite a few times and anytime anyone comes to visit I always make sure we stop here. The tours are done really well and all the guides I have had are great and very knowledgeable.",

          "the cave is free if you pay for a hawk walk at the bird centre. if you're hesitant, at least check out the demonstrations at the centre, they are a lot of fun. the cave itself is pretty cool, the guide was great, was a pretty quick tour but worth checking out. not sure i",
          "Over the years I have been to a number of caves so unfortunately found this one quite average. It is still amazing how a tiny drop of water over hundreds of years can build the various structures. The path is easy though there are some stairs. The various formations and",
          "Vistited here as a couple, the tour is about 30 mins long and very good. you get to see loads of the cave. if you can you can climb the mountain outside. also the birds of prey tour is very very good! we booked a ticket online for 16 euro per person for both activties - i would",
          "We had this in our sites after stopping in Ballyvaughan. It's about a 45 minute tour and yes you are really underground. Nothing strenuous, but if you are a bit claustrophobic you might not want to go, Try to stay close to the guide, especially if there are kids on the tour as",
          "Was staying in Ballyvaughan and there's a good walking path from the north end of the village to the cave which avoids the main road. A gentle stroll takes about a hour and gives good views. I got there just after 10 and was on one of the first tours with about a dozen others.",
          "The story behind this cave is very interesting (if it's all to be believed). I'm glad the weather cooperated & we were able to actually tour the caverns. It is fascinating when you realize how long it takes for the smallest thing to even happen in there. It was OK & the guide",
          "We got here rather late in the day and ended up getting a \"private\" tour since we were the only ones there at the time. Our tour guide was very nice and knowledgeable. We had a nice time and learned quite a bit about the Burren area.",
          "We enjoyed the Alliwee Cave. To be honest with you I would of enjoyed it more if I hadn\u2019t visited the Doolin Cave prior as I found the Doolin cave better (Sorry). The staff (Ciara) and food were great \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "We visited here on a mid-week tour of the west coast - We had been to the Cliffs of Moher earlier in the day but had to leave as the weather was awful. We came to the Caves as it isn't weather dependent and it was highly recommended by friends and family. It didn't disappoint",
          "I actually enjoyed the tour a lot. The guide was funny and informative. The tour wasn't too long and wasn't that strenuous so most people would be able to do it. There is a gift shop and cafe attached as well. My favorite part is that right outside in the parking lot there is a",
          "What an awesome experience. The birds of prey should be on your what to do list. The bird show was great. Not only wre they able to take flight but at the end everyone that wanted to could hold them unlike other bird shows we have been to. The gift store and the prices are very",

          "This is a fascinating experience taking the guided tour into the cave. We went about 1/2 a km through twists and turns and some low and tight squeeze spots to the middle of the cave. The guide treated us to interesting information about the history of the cave, its features and",
          "Ailwee Caves are well worth googling to read up on the history. I'm not going into the history, just my experience today. Overall it's absolutely worth a visit but there are some things it would be helpful to know in advance. 1. It's a cave. It's very dark and although there",

          "We went as a family of four. We spoke to our tour guide before it started and seemed a really nice guy but once the tour started his voice changed into a \"I'm reading this off a script\" sing song voice which was so distracting and made it seem like he had no interest in being",
          "We visited here after a full day of heavy rain and it made the experience all the more enjoyable. It is very reasonably priced, especially if you combine the ticket with the Bird of Prey Center. The tour guide Cathal was very informative and was very good with the kids. He them",

          "We stopped here on our way from somewhere in Ireland to somewhere else (I can't remember - it's a bit of a blur). Spent the day watching the bird show and then decided to check out the cave. Our guide took us in, told us the history of the cave, discussed some science-y stuff,",
          "My wife and I visited the shop here especially to buy cheese ,fudge,honey and ja,. The shop has changed since we visited here last year all for the better. One can now see how the cheese is made on site. There is samples of the cheese to taste and help you decide on which ones",
          "Had a fantastic time at the caves yesterday. Very informative tour and the kids loved it. Glad we decided to chose these caves over Doolin as they had the added attraction of the birds of prey display also made for a fuller days activities.",
          "We were recommended these caves by our B&B hosts and we not sure what to really expect. We were pleasantly surprised with the caves and also the knowledge of the tour guide. Would recommend. Also some great pictures can be taken at the top of the views around.",
          "Brilliant day in the caves. Visited the cave with my 2 children tour guide Justin was so informative and chatty. He was great with the kids they loved it. The whole experience was fantastic,great day out",
          "Excellent. Went early and had a great tour. Low in some places but was amazing. Well worth a visit in any weather",
          "Well after being stuck on the road behind 3 buses trying to get past eachother and failing terribly, we got here after a 1 hour delay. The roads here need widening badly and also to have signage improved. When we arrived, we quickly got our tickets (booked online) and got placed",
          "Visited the caves as a family of 4, cannot recommend enough. The birds of prey display was fantastic and the staff are very knowledgeable about the birds and really get people involved in the show. The caves are fantastic and our guide was again very informative and made the",
          "We enjoyed the caves, as did my 9 year old, the tour guide was well informed. We also went to the birds of prey show which we enjoyed. They were very friendly at the gate advising us of the show times for birds of prey and advising us to visit caves first. Don't forget to get a",
          "We were advised to visit Aillwee Caves by a friend. It was a great visit. In addition to the caves there is a Farm Shop and a 'Birds of Prey' center. I found the people so lind, and lovely. They really were helpful. I recommend this visit to anyone in the Burren/Cliffs of",
          "If your vacationing the west coast of Ireland and have an hour or two free you should check out this cave. The price is a little steep but the overall experience is pretty good. The tour guide I had was really chatty and open with the discussion. She was informative and",
          "This isn't one of the more visited caves, which is nice because its less crowded, they do a fun sensory deprivation moment and there is a great story behind the discovery of the cave.",
          "Great place to visit. Superbly organised from the moment you drive up to the gate! Cave tour is fab. Super shop at caves. The birds are a must see and include the bird show. The keepers are so so knowledgeable. After the birds go across to the farm shop... the cheese is",
          "really like the long way out of the caves (apparently thats a more recent addition) fascinating story or irelands evolution and the extinct brown bear. love the birds of prey too, would have like to go see the chees shop too but with small kids,its hard to do everything,",
          "I have been in several caves and this is not the biggest nor most spectacular yet interesting and intriguing. Especially in the perspective of the Burren and its distinctive geology. The tour guide was personable and instructive, especially when the time came to experience",
          "We went here primarily because of Father Ted but was so impressed by the tour. Cannot rate our guide highly enough, he held the interest of young children and adults for the 35 minute tour! The caves are beautiful and fascinating and the tour was by far the best I've been on in",
          "We had been recommended to visit here by our holiday cottage owners. We were on our way from Galway to Limerick and it was very informative and interesting. we had a 15 year old who pretty impressed and the guide took plenty of time to answer the younger children's questions.",
          "Brought my friend who is totally blind to visit the Aillwee Cave last week and from start to finish a brilliant experience. I emailed and a lady called Nuala (the director I think) emailed me back and arranged that as I was going as a carer I was admitted free. When we arrived",
          "Well worth a visit for those who are not claustrophobic! We all thoroughly enjoyed the visit, although the admission charge is quite expensive.",
          "From start to finish this was such a great day out. I had been here as a kid and knew it was great but was so much more than I expected. The falconry was just brilliant with the best part being that my little boy got to hold a falcon ; coolest thing ever apparently! Next on to",
          "We really liked the cave. It's big and beautiful. A definite must see for all nature lovers. There is also farm market there, we bought a few local made cheese.",
          "We went to see the caves and the bird shows, it was absolutely brilliant, we had a lovely tour guided by Steve and he is very good at his job, we learned loads of history about the caves and the tour lasted about half an hour to 40 minutes, it was well worth the admission fee.",
          "Visited here with my 3 kids ages from 6 to 9 years and they loved it. Cave tour takes about 40 mins. You walk through the original passage where long extinct bears hibernated. Past a waterfall and other underground wonders. Great.",
          "We debated between this and the Doolin Cave, deciding on this one as the tour seemed shorter and easier going \u2013 and whilst interested, we weren\u2019t dedicated cave-seekers! Ailwee are the \u201cvery dark caves\u201d of Father Ted fame, so we chose the right ones! The tours are run for",
          "The Aillwee Caves is a short excursion and not particularly a spectacular one. It would be suitable for especially children introducing and giving them the experience about natural caves. The mountain walk just outside the Aillwee Caves is not a strenuous walk but hike boots",
          "These caves are a must see if you're touring in this area. Nice coffee. Pleasant helpful staff. The weather was marvellous which really added to the experience.",
          "Our drive through the Burren to Ailwee Caves and Bird Show was spectacular! Contrast of rocks and greenery with castles and flowers mixed in! We arrived and drove up to the top of the hill for lovely view as well as the entrance to the caves. The entrance is inside a",
          "Aillwee Cave is a small cave that is located in the Burren in Western Ireland. It is located about 25 miles north of Ennis, Ireland and about 145 miles west of Dublin, Ireland. It is also located on the side of a small, terraced mountain. This is a relatively small cave",
          "Enjoyable tour of the caves, guide was very knowledgeable of all the history involved. The Fudge and cheese in the onsite cafe and shop are very very tasty. Did not do birds of prey.",
          "We arrived in time to see the two o'clock bird of prey show. There are different birds flown at each show so we waited and also enjoyed the four o'clock show. After this we walked up to the caves and took the tour. The cave tour was fine, it lasted around 30 minutes and was",
          "The Caves are nice. It was a pleasant trek, but nothing really extraordinary. If you park near the Birds of Prey center, it is a nice little walk through the woods up to the caves, though you can forgo the walk and drive up to the caves themselves. The staff was friendly and",
          "We've been to similar caves in other parts of the world but liked this one because of the guide and the way that he dew our attention to various features in the cave as we walked along.",
          "A wonderful tour of the cave with a guide who was attentive and answering any question the group put before him.The tour lasted around 45/50 minutes and full explanation of the known tunnels and the history of it's original finding was most enlightening",
          "On your way to the Cliff's take an hour or two and visit the caves. Well set up easy walk through with a guide",
          "If you are in the area this cave is worth a look. I would not make it a destination unto itself. We were there to do the Hawk Walk (Great), Birds of Prey Demo (also very good), so the cave was an add on to an already great day. On its own, I would rather do the Doolin Cave (very",
          "Interesting cave, but not much to see. It was our first visit to Ireland and I could have skipped this. May be good for a family visit.",
          "When you come through the entrance & pay the fee, you'll have the option for just the cave walk or the cave walk + birds of prey. My group only did the cave walk but I suspect I might have been more interested by this location if we had done the birds of prey as well. Consider",
          "Worth a visit, this cave is well advertised & signposted (compared to the other Irish caves) and it's definitely worth the day out. Cool cave and interesting information. Recommended.",
          "Nice stop in a lovely part of Ireland. Tour of caves is fun and nice farm shop and tea room. Good facilities. Came back and was reminded they filmed a cracking episode of father ted there which made us all laugh that evening when watched. Hence the outrageously unPC signage",
          "We all loved this very interesting cave walk! Beautiful gardens, cafe and knowledgeable staff. Super place to take the kids to explore and learn about the history of the geography of the burren",
          "Met by a lovely helpful lady on the gate who informed us of times of the Birds of Prey display and advised us of order to do things in. My little boy got talking to the lovely Clodagh and Ian about his favourite birds vultures,they went out of their way to make the day special",
          "This was my absolute favorite attraction that wasn't a castle. The cave was very cool and our tour guide was great, but the real gem here is the Birds of Prey exhibit! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d We got the pleasure of watching Batty fly as well as two of his friends (a grumpy barn owl named Jess and",
          "Amazing look at what nature can do! Hard to believe that bears could hibernate there in small spaces. When the Lights were turned off it was dark and you literally could not see your hand directly in front of your face! Not a scary experience. Small entrance fee. Tours left",
          "If you are from the USA, visit a cave here. This one had the most ridiculous long narrow entry and exit. This was NOT my first cave.",
          "Well-signed off of N67 to the R480, the grounds also offer a cheese stand, and birds of prey demonstration. The caves are a 35 minute walking tour. It is always guided. Although there are some slick and wet areas, normal footwear should suffice. Pictures are allowed throughout.",
          "As you'll see from the title, the weather won't bother you here. First there's a really fantastic aviary where you can see all kinds of wild birds of prey. The staff are really knowledgeable and very friendly. It's a great place to go if you are interested in wildlife or even",
          "Ailwee cave is a nice walk around an Irish cave and lovely history in there and plenty of Stalactites.",
          "We enjoyed the Ailwee Caves. It's a very different experience to the nearby Doolin Caves - Ailwee is much more commercial and that has its pros and cons. The centre is well-equipped and benefits from the affiliation with the adjacent Birds of Prey Centre and Farm Shop (both",
          "Loved this tour! Well worth it, plus the birds of prey centre with display. Very well organised and interesting facts about the cave and the local area of the Burren. Highly recommended",
          "There are actually a couple of things to do when you enter the \"cave site\". When entering the gate we had to purchase the tickets from a nice lady, either the caves or see the birds of prey or get the combined ticket. The birds of prey run several times and if you happen to",
          "An interesting place with an entertaining guide. The cave isn't particularly stunning but it's very big and the story of its discovery is quite intriguing",
          "There's a good gift shop and cafe while waiting for the tour, reasonably priced. Tour itself last about 35 mins. It's interesting to see and hear the history of the caves. Guides are knowledgeable and interesting.",
          "Aillwee cave is a great way for the single traveler or a family to enjoy the wonders of nature. It's a great experience and the guides are excellent too. You get to explore the caverns and at one point in the caves the guide outs all electrical lights so you get to experience",
          "Have been to many caves over my years. This is good for kids now as years have passed health and safety is what is expected. But the tour is very short. If your unlucky to miss the tour just before it is about a 15 min wait but the tour is only about 30 min, so if your doing as",
          "Situated in a park with good walks around the area and a coffee shop available on grounds and within the cave area. The tour itself we found disappointing. Extremely dark inside and walls of caves only visible when the guide shone her torch at the structure or when she turned",
          "Enjoyed this, not as dramatic as advertised lol but enjoyable, nice overall experience, bird show/setting good, could spend good day there especially if you have children - shops good range from very cheap to very expensive! lovely staff :-)",
          "Complements to the tour guides and staff. they were super with the kids. Farm kitchen visit is a must for cheese lovers.",
          "Caves would not normally appeal to us, but our young daughter wanted to see if she could see any bats, so we ended up at Aillwee. when we got there, there was also a section on wild birds of prey so we done that as well. The bird show was interesting, as we learned a lot about",
          "After being told not to miss seeing the caves, we were disappointed considering how much we paid for it. Other than how it was formed and the fact that there were remains of brown bear activity in Ireland, the features in the cave were average compared to what we have seen in",
          "Great family day out. The caves are fantastic and the tour guide gives an interesting and knowledgeable talk throughout the tour. The highlight of the visit was the birds of prey show. The sight of the vultures, Henry and Dyson swooping in from the mountain is pretty",
          "This cave turned to be much more than I expected to see. Its really big. And cold. 10 degrees Celsius. Always. Whatever the season and weather outside. There is an underground waterfall!!! Special mention needs to be done about technical side of the tour. Its amazing. The guide",
          "I went with my 3 young kids and 2 of their friends. We arrived and got tickets for both the cave and the bird show. The birds are beautiful and the show was very interesting to hear the facts. Then we went to the cheese and fudge shop. I thought we would get to see it made but I",
          "Just visited the caves as time was short for us. There is birds of prey etc too. I was particularly impressed by staff on the gate who advised on prices and facilities before entry. Well equipped gift shop. Efficient girls at till to take money for tour. The tour started soon",
          "The caves itself is fantastic to explore. The tour guide is very knowledgeable and friendly. I only give 3 stars as the other activities on the property was no where to be seen. We went to the place where archery was, but no one there to help us",
          "If you've seen other caves, this experience won't be much different. However, my kids really enjoyed it and the tour guide was very good. There are some coupons to be had so don't pay full price -- just stop at any of the local tourism spots and ask for them (usually two for",
          "Do it. It's amazing. You get an hour with a hawk on your arm. On your arm!! It's moving and interesting and educational. Whatever your age. Our guide Ian was enthusiastic and knowledgeable. And then there is a show and a little shop where you'll be tempted with fudge, cheese,",
          "2nd time visiting here, last time was 6 years ago. Cave tour was fascinating and the birds of prey and display were brilliant. Absolutely brilliant day",
          "The caves are a must if your visiting the burren,fantastic guide and the caves are beautiful and the gift shop and cafe are lovely!!",
          "Just amazing. I didn't realise Ireland had facilities like this. I am a big fan of birds of prey. The family dinamic went from 60s to 30s to 3 year old. You are up close and personal with these magical people. My mother and my daughter and even I had the opportunity to feed",
          "We took a trip here from Galway on a mild spring day. The trip took about an hour travelling through the Burren where we passed through little villages and saw picturesque harbours and rolling green fields divided into a patchwork by dry stone walls. We parked by the little",
          "These caves are quite interesting. Not the most spectacular I've seen in my travels but the guide and the information make this a worthwhile 30 minutes.",
          "It was a terrible day in Galway so we went on a road trip to the caves instead! Three of us, one eight years old. She loved it, the caves were reasonably priced and very interesting. It takes about 30 minutes and we all enjoyed it. We had a bite to eat in the little coffee shop",
          "Neil took us on a very informative tour through the cave. The tour last about 30 minutes. It was interesting to hear the history of the cave. If you have to wait a few minutes for your tour to start settle in with an Irish coffee in the caf\u00e9.",
          "I've been to the caves before, so I wasn't as awed as I previously was. My partner enjoyed it, but my 4 year old was skeptical in the dark. We were the last tour of the day, and the only people. As we aren't particularly talkative the tour was short & quiet - bar the bits of",
          "I haven't been to many caves, so I don't know where this ranks, but I thought it was really neat. Some of the passageways are narrow and you have to duck, which just made it feel more exciting to me. And the guide was very helpful and informative. If you're nervous in small",
          "The Ailwee cave are a small collection of caves. But well worth a visit.Set on the top of a hill, you get really good views before entering the caves.The guided tour last 35 mins, our guide was knowledgable explain the history of the cave system. We experienced complete darkness",
          "I've done 3 or 4 underground visits in different places, and this one was the least interesting. The tour is about 30 minutes, mostly walking a long stone corridor (created largely by a long-dead underground river). There is one 'cavern' but not that big, and some stalactites",
          "With a 14 month old we didn't want to be out in the raw elements so we drove to the caves and did the 35 minute tour. It was a bit much for our son but it gave us a chance to walk and stretch our legs and learn a bit of history and see some amazing works of nature.",
          "Myself and my partner visited Ailwee Cave and Birds of Prey Centre not too long ago and found it to be a little gem. The cave itself was great and our guide Liz was extremely knowledgeable about the cave and its history. The Bird of Prey Centre was small but full of beautiful",
          "This ancient cave is well worth a detour. We had a lovely guide, who kept the group interested with stories and facts throughout the walk. It has just enough lights and fittings to make it safe, but still feels like an exploration into the deep. Watch the driveway up from the",
          "Well worth a visit, helpful and informative guide showing all the caves features and interesting little notes",
          "The cave is long and narrow but well worth a visit. We have been to larger caves but this cave is quite intimate and an essential visit to understand the Karst landscape fully.",
          "Visited last year and enjoyed the experience. Would recommend it to anyone holidaying in the area as an interesting place to go.",
          "No, I mean it. The place is really cool and has a constant temperature of 10 C. The guided tour is very nice as well. Sadly, the cave is too small.",
          "Visited with two kids - absolutely fantastic venue. Such a great tour in the cave, takes about 40 minutes in total and is surprisingly warm. Parts are dark so remember to have your phone torch well charged. There is a restaurant at the entrance with a shop. Food very fresh",
          "Went for santa visit in December and by far the best we've done yet. Very personalised experience and well organised. The whole thing lasted about 2 hours and we were kept entertained the entire time.",
          "Went out of season but everything was open. The cafe served really lovely fresh local food. The tour of the caves was the perfect length with loads of history packed in. All the staff were friendly and polite. The birds of prey were amazing. We almost had our own private show",
          "The caves are a quick little tour with some interesting info. The folks that work here are very nice!",
          "Aillwee Caves is a fantastic day trip from Galway City and 100% worth the visit out to see. The caves themselves are a good way to spend a couple of hours and the tour itself is very interesting and informative. Staff are always friendly and there's a lovely little shop and cafe",
          "Me and my partner came here on a Wednesday morning when it was quiet the staff were unbelievably friendly/helpful and the cave itself was very interesting . I would honestly recommend people to go see this great natural Irish attraction and I would highly recommend buying the",
          "Me and my buddy stopped here on our road trip around Ireland. We had a guided tour and our guide was friendly and knowledgeable. We were the only two people on the tour. She answered our questions and explained what we were seeing. There are a couple water falls and some bear",
          "It was good to see the history of how the caves were performed. Its nearly cool and shows wonders of nature. The guided tour was worth",
          "Visited the Caves for the first time recently. The caves themselves were amazing to see but the tour was very quick and felt it lacked detail. The tour was full of screaming children ( around 7 ) who were scared / excited of the dark caves, and made it very hard to hear the",
          "The caves are definitely a must see when in Clare. Very interesting and dynamic tour. We visited as part of a group of 7, overall everybody really enjoyed the tour, however the consensus of the group was that at \u20ac12 per person the tour was a little pricey. As Fr. Ted fans we",
          "I do enjoy exploring caves so I was excited to visit \"Ireland's Premier Showcave\" unfortunately the experience was disappointing and a bit of a let down. These caves are very commercialised and there isn't much here to see to be honest. It wasn't an awful experience but sadly",
          "The aillwee cave in right in the heart of the burren and you must drive through most of it to get to the cave. Really worth visiting.",
          "This is well worth seeing. I think that all caves are unique, in their own way. This should be part of your tour of County Clare.",
          "loved this, went hear on my holidays, they don't advertise Father ted although an episode was filmed hear....they should as it was brilliant. scary and educational, worth the money no questions.",
          "Superb!!! Nothing but wonderfull can describe our visit here to see Santa, We were two adult's and five kid's and from start to finish everything was fantastic, from the athmosphere, greeting from staff upon arrival, gift's, books + xmas ball for Adult, even the guy on the",

          "We visited here last year when Santa arrived and decided to come back again with friends. However, Santa wasn't here yet so we just did the normal tour that happens all year round. Tour guide spoke WAY too quickly and as there was such a large group, it was difficult to hear her",
          "Having heard many great reviews about the workshop it was a must visit for us this year. We have three girls; 10, 8 and 4, with 10 being a borderline believer. Step one was getting the necessary info off to Santa which was easily done thru email. Upon arrival we browsed the",
          "This is an amazing attraction. I wish we had arrived earlier in the day so we could have spent more time here. We bought the ticket that included both the birds and the caves right at the entry gate. The first stop was the bird center. You get a little audio device that you",
          "Absolutely fab....our twins aged 9 loved everything about it. The train up fm the bottom was a delight. Santa himself was first class, what a joy at this special time of yr. The puppeteer was amazing also, so good with the kids and they were glued to her for the duration and",

          "This was our first visit to Santa at Aillwee caves. We saw birds of prey first. It was very good. There was gift for adults and Christmas sock for children. I think it would be much better to gave chocolate to the children instead of hard sweets. Was fun going into the cave to",
          "Most recently visited the caves a few weeks ago but have been going with family for years. This is my favourite place to visit in the Burren, the caves are wonderful and house a number of interesting natural features, such as an underground waterfall. Our tour guide was really",

          "We went here as a part of a small group for a few hours after a lovely drive around the burren, our guide, Steven, was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the caves, tour is short enough but still worth the few euro to sample a little piece of county Clare history, Very",

          "Great tour of cave system. It is impressive in and of itself. But our tour guide Noel made it even more enjoyable. We came up hill to visit cave after the Birds of Prey show. Both are not to be missed make sure you leave enough time to see both and we had outdoor snack at the",

          "The caves are cool and intresting, nice to see if you're in The Burren area. We was on the guided tour, it was short, but intresting and with spectacular views over the caves. We saw a waterfall and some exiting tunnels, so it was totally worth to pay about \u20ac10 per person.",
          "Have to say we had a great family day out at aillwee cave , cafe and bird of pray show. The guided was very good and engaging at Aillwee Cave and the handlers of the birds of prat were very knowledgeable and very engaging with the younger kids. Very very good and lovely drive up",
          "Very interesting tour of the caves, especially the bear pits. I love the way they still turn off the lights to experience no natural light, pretty cool. Guide was very good and gave some very interesting facts about the caves, bears and the natural features. Very good for",

          "I have been to a few caves around the world and this was one of the oldest. Although it was ok for the discounted price i paid i was expecting a lot more. The waterfall is nice inside there and the guide is well informed. They do not however warn you that the lights are timed",
          "I went to the caves. It was good. Felt most of the things were like created and artificial and had been created. I have been to many places which are actual and resemble real - like old forts and palaces and wonders of the world. So one cannot compare to that. But nothing great",
          "The Ailwee cave is a terrific experience. Not too physical with wide secure footpaths and stairs that are manageable. Have to duck the head in a couple of spots but no real stooping or crawling around. The guides do a great job and when they turn the lights out it puts a new",
          "The Tour Guide really made this a must visit location. There is so much of the story that must be told. The history and story is amazing and is great to learn and see first hand.",

          "Best bit by far was when we were in total darkness. A very surreal experience. The cave is natural and therefore requires care when walking through it with the guide.",

          "We only visited the cave (not the bird park) as we were on a tight schedule. The tour of the cave was informative and worth the time spent. The little cafe in the cave serves great soup and the cheese shop down the road also well worth a quick stop.",
          "After seeing several leaflet about the cave we decided to visit. A good attraction for a cloudy afternoon but take a hat if it's wet as the bird of prey display is obviously outside. 18 Euro each to get in for both the cave and birds of prey. We had found a leaflet with vouchers",
          "Aillwee Cave is well presented, with good parking and signposting. It has additional attractions like the birds of prey demonstration to make the visit more rounded, which is good. The cave itself, however, is disappointing. It's deep, it's damp, it's dark - all the things",
          "The cave tour was quite interesting to both adults and children alike. They even turn off all the lights at one point of the tour so you can experience complete darkness (can't even see your own hand). Well worth the visit. You can also walk (carefully) along the Burren for",
          "We went here primarily for the cave but here is a lot more to do. There is a fabulous Gift shop and a cheese maker with exceptional cheese! The highlight for us was the bird of prey centre, The staff there are very knowledgeable and passionate about their work. They do displays",

          "Visited this Cave with my boyfriend on a round Ireland trip. We headed for the caves on the way to the Cliffs of Moher, which were far far superior and cheaper too. I feel the experience you get is not worth the price of admission. The first thing that bothered me was how the",
          "If you have never been to a cave of any sort ever before then give it a go,otherwise be prepared for a very commercial cave with little in its favour. Minimal natural decoration.The guides have an interesting spiel but nothing out of the ordinary. Overall rather disappointing",
          "After visiting the cliffs we made our way to the caves. Found the tour very interesting, it took about 45minutes and our tour guide Steve was very well spoken, informative and gave us a good few chuckles while on the tour with his funny anecdotes. The waterfall within the cave",
          "This is an excellent for a dull day visit. Good tour guide, it is of course rather dark and damp I used my torch as I was a bit unsure under foot. We combined it with the falconry display it is a bit cheaper for the ticket. Lots of parking space.",
          "I was driving near this place and decided why not. Just when I arrived they lady at the gate said they just started the birds of prey show, so I bought that ticket as well. Since I like birds it was a nice bonus. Then cave was cool too. You can grab a quick bite to eat here",

          "Traveling with young children is more about finding stops to involve the sense of wonder in their young minds and hearts. Aillwee Cave, Situated in the heart of the Burren, is such a place. During the peak season this place is busy...however it does calm down some during off",
          "Be prepared to get your feet wet. This cave is cool, but very commercialized. If you dont mind, go check it out.",
          "A very busy place. You need to book in advance. A Guide took us through the caves . He certainly knew what he was talking about. He told us how the caves were found and then developed. It takes from about forty five minutes up to an hour to complete the tour. A word of warning",
          "I really enjoyed the cave tour. It really gave you an idea of the history of the area, and the cave. It was a little difficult to hear the lady who gave the tour because of a child making constant noise. It would have been much better with no young kids. That beeing said I would",
          "This was a fun and informative tour. The guide was knowledgeable and interesting. This is a fun way to spend a couple of hours. Terrific gift shop if you need some souvenirs.",

          "Yes, there's too many undisciplined brat kids. Unfortunately, you're not going to get around that. I had a young couple with a toddler in the tour, a toddler...who was crying, ugh. BUT, stay all the way in the back of the tour, like I did. It's so dark, the tour guide will not",
          "This tour was not enjoyed. Very crowded. They had a large group of cyclists going through the cave at the same time we were. Tour was slow going as we had to stand back numerous times to wait for cyclist to bypass us. The cyclists were very loud, talking, hooting and hollering",
          "The cave was wonderful and the guide was excellent. There were maybe a few too many people and some unruly kids. Overall it was a good tour.",
          "I was impressed with the way the tour takes you right under the mountain. The tour guide was interesting and very willing to answer questions from even the youngest visitor. Well worth a look and a great activity for a wet day. It has a nice restaurant and a souvenier shop.",
          "Myself and my wife went with out four year-old daughter. We expected that she might be a bit scared etc but the tour guide (Alan) let her take the torch and involved her in the whole experience, had her walking at the front of the group and everything, cracking jokes with her,",
          "Visited the Cave as part of Healy Tours \"Cliffs of Moher & Burren Tour\". Only the 10am departure from the Coach Station, Galway, covers the Cave. Guide was interesting and helpful. Cooler underground and the semi-darkness was disconcerting to some. A little slippery at times",
          "I enjoyed visiting here and you can also get to see the birds of prey which is beside the cave. Good for most ages, if you are uncomfortable in the dark, there is enough lighting to see where you are going. Worth a visit.",
          "So, so, so disappointing. The guide rushed us through the caves, Did not give anybody the opportunity to take any photos, not that much to photograph anyway. The group was too large, so making it difficult to hear what the guide had to say. Also there were some very young",
          "We brought three Grandchildren to the Caves and they were very interested in the History as narrated by our Guide Cian. The ranged in age from 7 to 13 and were impressed with what they saw and heard. Before going into the Caves we visited the Birds of Prey centre which is on the",

          "The story of the caves from the formation of the Burren right up until the discovery of the caves in 1944 is fascinating. For anyone visiting the area, they are worth a look. Such interesting features in the caves include former resting sites of the European Brown Bear,",

          "I visited the Caves with my two teenagers. The staff was very friendly and professional but we found the hype about the site a bit exaggerated. We found it definitely less interesting than other caves in Europe (e.g. Rouffignac) where natural wonders are more striking and",

          "Nice and long walk in the Caves. Not for people with claustrophobia.",
          "Aillwee Cave reminds me of an American style tourist trap. A cave, a bird show, and a cheese making operation seem to make for an interesting combination of attractions, but it works. The cave tour was fun, short, and nothing too \u2026",

          "very nice time to spend an afternoon.",
          "Really a fantastic tourist attraction. Still small, you could almost call it cosy. The Farm Shop was worth a visit just for the cheese alone. The Gift Shop, up at the cave, was better value than The Rock Shop (pass the Cliffs of Moher).\nBut \u2026",

          "Great place to visit, took away one star as the pictures are misleading on their website. Birds of prey are worthwhile doing while you're there. Think the kids enjoyed that more than the caves. There's a shop there with cheese, Mead, Jam, Conserve. Great choice and tastes fantastic so definitely pick up something there.",
          "Small but nice cave.. great view outside the cave over the barren...",

          "Nice place to visit but the cave tour was far too short, somehow the corridor back to the starting point seemed way longer than the tour walk itself, maybe a few dioramas in that corridor would help.\nThe bird show was good fun all in all \u2026",

          "Ordinary caves. There are lots more caves throughout Europe that are much more impressive. Entry fee a tad high in my opinion. It was good to get away from the cold and wet weather outside though. Food on site ok, nothing special though.",
          "Could do with more light on caves4 uneven surface and potentially dangerous for older people.",

      "name": "Coole Park",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Coole Park is a nature reserve of approximately 1,000 acres (4 km2) located a few miles west of Gort, County Galway, Ireland.\nIt is managed by the Irish National Parks & Wildlife Service, part of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.\nThe park is in a low\u2013lying karstic limestone area characterised by seasonal lakes, known as turloughs, which are almost unique to Ireland. It has extensive woodlands. There are 6 kilometres of signposted nature trails plus a formal late 18th century walled garden.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe park was formerly the estate of the Gregory family. Coole House was built in the late 18th century for Robert Gregory: a three-storey house with a square porch and as principal rooms a dining room and drawing-room with bay windows facing out to Coole Lough and the Burren Hills, and a library in between them.In 1880, Robert's great-grandson, William Henry Gregory married Isabella Augusta Persse, who became Lady Gregory. The death in World War I of their only child, Robert, a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps,  inspired the poet W B Yeats to write works which included \"An Irish Airman Foresees His Death.\"\nThe walled garden contains an autograph tree, a copper beech that is engraved with initials of many of the leading figures of the Irish Literary Revival who were personal friends of Lady Gregory including Yeats, Edward Martyn, George Bernard Shaw, John Millington Synge and Se\u00e1n O'Casey. Yeats' poem The Wild Swans at Coole was inspired by the beauty of the swans in the turlough at Coole Park. Yeats's home at Thoor Ballylee was just 3 miles away; he also wrote \"Coole Park, 1929\", a poem that describes the park as a symbol for the revival of Irish literature:\n\"Here traveller, scholar, poet, take your stand, / \nWhen all these rooms and passages are gone /\nWhen nettles wave upon a shapeless mound /\nAnd saplings root among the broken stone.\"\nCoole House may have been damaged in the Irish Civil War (1922\u201323). Lady Gregory sold the estate to the Irish state in 1927, but retained life tenancy. She died in 1932 and the furnishings were soon auctioned off. By the 1960s the state had allowed the Gregorys' former house to fall into a ruin, a neglect deplored by Miche\u00e1l Mac Liamm\u00f3ir in 1964. Indeed, according to the National Archives, the building was actively demolished by the state in 1941. Today, all that remains is the plinth on which it stood.\n\n\n== Today ==\nThe grounds are open to the public all year round (free admission). A visitor centre located in the former outbuildings (late 18th century) operates during high season (April to September inclusive). The centre offers a tea room, an audio/visual presentation on Lady Gregory and the literary history of Coole Park, and also a multi-media exhibition called \"Coole Park through the eyes of 'Me and Nu', Granddaughters of Lady Gregory\".\nIn 2014, disease forced the felling of many trees in Coole Park for safety reasons, as confirmed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (Ireland).\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe ephemeral nature of turlough hydrology gives rise to a characteristic ecology. Turloughs have been designated as a Priority Habitat in the EU Habitats Directive.\nCoole Park is part of the Coole-Garryland Complex, a candidate Special Area of Conservation (site code SAC 252).Since 1990 Coole Lough & Garryland Wood has been protected as a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention.\n\n\n=== Protection for birds ===\nA wildfowl sanctuary, where the shooting of game birds is not permitted, is designated under the Wildlife Act 1976.\nThe park is included in a Special Protection Area for birds under the EU Birds Directive: this site of 520 ha (site code SPA 107) was designated in 1996 because of its importance for wintering waterfowl, notably whooper swan.\nThe SPA overlaps with a smaller Important Bird Area, Coole Park and Garryland complex.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nW.B.

        "wiki": "Galway ( GAWL-way; Irish: Gaillimh, pronounced [\u02c8\u0261al\u0320\u02b2\u026av\u02b2]) is a city in County Galway in the West of Ireland, in the province of Connacht. It lies on the River Corrib between Lough Corrib and Galway Bay, and is the sixth most populous city in Ireland, with a population at the 2016 Census of 79,934.Galway is renowned for its vibrant lifestyle and for hosting numerous festivals, celebrations and events such as The Galway Arts Festival. In 2018, it was named the European Region of Gastronomy. The city is currently the European Capital of Culture for 2020, alongside Rijeka, Croatia.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe city's name comes from the Irish name Gaillimhe, which formed the western boundary of the earliest settlement, D\u00fan Gaillimhe \"Fort Gaillimh\". (Mythical and alternative derivations of the name are given in History of Galway). Historically, the name was Anglicised as Galliv or Gallive, closer to the Irish pronunciation. The city's name in Latin is Galvia. Residents of the city are referred to as Galwegians.\nThe city also bears the nickname \"City of the Tribes\" (Irish: Cathair na dTreabh) because of the fourteen merchant families called the \"tribes of Galway\" who led the city in its Hiberno-Norman period.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nD\u00fan Gaillimhe (\"Fort at the Mouth (bottom) of the Gaillimh\") was constructed in 1124, by the King of Connacht, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088\u20131156). A settlement grew around it. During the Norman invasion of Connacht in the 1230s, D\u00fan Gaillimhe was captured by Richard Mor de Burgh, who had led the invasion. As the de Burghs eventually became Gaelicised, the merchants of the town, the Tribes of Galway, pushed for greater control over the walled city.\nThis led to their gaining complete control over the city and to the granting of mayoral status by the English crown in December 1484. Galway endured difficult relations with its Irish neighbours. A notice over the west gate of the city, completed in 1562 by Mayor Thomas \u00d3ge Martyn, stated \"From the Ferocious O'Flahertys may God protect us\". A by-law forbade the native Irish (as opposed to Galway's Hiberno-Norman citizens) unrestricted access into Galway, saying \"neither O\u2019 nor Mac shall strutte nor swagger through the streets of Galway\" without permission.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Galway was ruled by an oligarchy of fourteen merchant families (twelve who claimed to be of Norman origin and two of Irish origin). These were the \"Tribes of Galway\". The city thrived on international trade, and in the Middle Ages, it was the principal Irish port for trade with Spain and France. The most famous reminder of those days is ceann an bhalla (\"the end of the wall\"), now known as the Spanish Arch, constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin (1519\u201320). In 1477 Christopher Columbus visited Galway, possibly stopping off on a voyage to Iceland or the Faroe Islands. Seven or eight years later, he noted in the margin of his copy of Imago Mundi:\n\nMen of Cathay have come from the west. [Of this] we have seen many signs. And especially in Galway in Ireland, a man and a woman, of extraordinary appearance, have come to land on two tree trunks [or timbers? or a boat made of such?]\nThe most likely explanation for these bodies is that they were Inuit swept eastward by the North Atlantic Current.During the 16th and 17th centuries Galway remained loyal to the English crown for the most part, even during the Gaelic resurgence, perhaps for reasons of survival. However, by 1642 the city had allied itself with the Catholic Confederation of Kilkenny during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. During the resulting Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Cromwellian forces captured the city after a nine-month siege. At the end of the 17th century the city supported the Jacobites in the Williamite war in Ireland and was captured by the Williamites after a very short siege not long after the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. The great families of Galway were ruined. The city suffered further under the potato famines of 1845\u20131852, and it did not fully recover until the period of strong economic growth of the late 20th century (see Celtic Tiger).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike most of Ireland, Galway has an oceanic climate (Cfb) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, being one of the world's mildest cities for latitude, partly because it is on an island. Galway has a year-round mild, moist, temperate and changeable climate, due to the prevailing winds of the North Atlantic Current together with the Gulf Stream (on the other side of the Atlantic temperatures can be 20 \u00b0C cooler or more.). The city does not experience temperature extremes, with temperatures below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) and above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) being rare. The city receives an average of 1,156 mm (45.51 in) of precipitation annually, which is evenly distributed throughout the year. The average January temperature in the city is 5.9 \u00b0C (43 \u00b0F) and the average July temperature is 15.9 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). The highest temperature ever recorded in Galway was 31.7 \u00b0C (89.1 \u00b0F) in July 1921, whilst the lowest temperature recorded was \u221211.7 \u00b0C (10.9 \u00b0F) in January 1945.While extreme weather is rare, the city and county can experience severe windstorms that are the result of vigorous Atlantic depressions that occasionally pass along the north west coast of Ireland. Most of these storms occur between late autumn and early spring. Due to the city's northerly location, Galway has long summer days. Sunrise on summer solstice occurs at 05:07 WEST and sunset at 22:07. By contrast, on winter solstice, the sun rises at 08:49 WET, and sets at 16:19.\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\n\nLynch's Castle on Shop Street is a medieval town house built by the prosperous Lynch family in the 16th century and is now a branch of Allied Irish Banks.\nThe Church of Ireland St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church is the largest medieval church still in everyday use in Ireland. It was founded in 1320 and enlarged in the following two centuries.\nThe Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas was consecrated in 1965 and is a far larger building constructed from limestone. It has an eclectic style, with a Renaissance Revival dome, pillars and round arches, and a Romanesque Revival portico that dominates the main fa\u00e7ade \u2013 which is an unusual feature in modern Irish church building.\nThe original quadrangle building of NUI Galway which was erected in 1849 (during the Great Famine or An Gorta M\u00f3r) as one of the three colleges of the Queen's University of Ireland (along with Queen's University Belfast and University College Cork). The university holds the UNESCO archive of spoken material for the Celtic languages.\nThe Hardiman, (originally the Railway Hotel, then the Great Southern Hotel and then Hotel Meyrick) built by the Great Southern Railway Company in 1845. Sitting at the southern perimeter of Eyre Square, it is the city's oldest hotel still in operation.\nThe remains of Menlo Castle can be seen outside the city, on the eastern bank of the River Corrib. It was one of the ancestral homes of the Blake family, one of the Tribes of Galway from c. 1600\u20131910. The fa\u00e7ade of the family's townhouse (\"Blake's Castle\") is still extant next to Jury's Hotel at the bottom of Quay Street.\nEglinton Canal, named after a former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, joins the River Corrib to the sea, and flows for just more than a kilometre from the University to the Claddagh.\nThe Claddagh is the oldest part of Galway but little or nothing remains of its old thatched village. However, in a side altar of the parish church, St Mary's on the Hill, is the late medieval statue of Our Lady of Galway. The ancient ritual of the Blessing of the Bay takes place on the Sunday nearest the feast of the Assumption.\nThe Browne doorway, originally located on Lower Abbeygate Street but now standing at the north end of Eyre Square, was the doorway to the townhouse of the Browne family, one of the fourteen Tribes of Galway.\nThe Lynch Window, (on Market Street), at which is a plaque commemorating one of the city's legends. According to legend, in 1493, the then Mayor, James Lynch FitzStephen, hanged his own son for the murder of a young Spanish visitor who had the misfortune to befriend the girlfriend of the Mayor's son.\nThe Hall of the Red Earl (Halla an Iarla Rua) can be viewed through a protective glass wall off Flood Street. It is the earliest medieval settlement fragment surviving within the walls of the city. It was built by the de Burgo family in the 13th century and was a key municipal building for the collection of taxes, dispensation of justice and hosting banquets. It was the medieval equivalent of tax office, court house and town hall.\n\n\n==== The Claddagh ====\n\nOn the west bank of the River Corrib as it enters the sea is the ancient neighbourhood of The Claddagh. For centuries it was an Irish-speaking enclave outside the city walls. Claddagh residents were mainly fisher folk and were governed by an elected 'King'. The King of the Claddagh settled or arbitrated disputes among the locals and had the privilege of a white sail on his fishing boat. The last true king, Martin Oliver, died in 1972. The title is still used but in a purely honorary and ceremonial context. The current King is Michael Lynskey. The area is also famous for its association with the Claddagh Ring.\n\n\n==== Museums ====\n\nThe Galway City Museum has two main sections: one about the heritage of Galway and one about Irish artists from the second half of the 20th century. This museum also houses the statue of the poet, P\u00e1draic \u00d3 Conaire which was originally located in the Kennedy Park section of Eyre Square, prior to the Square's renovation. A replica of the statue was erected in Eyre Square in 2017.

It is sometimes referred to as the 'Bilingual Capital of Ireland', although like elsewhere in the Republic of Ireland, inhabitants converse mostly in English. The city is well known for its \"Irishness\", mainly because it has on its doorstep the Galway Gaeltacht. Irish theatre, television and radio production and Irish music form a component of Galway city life, with both An Taibhdhearc, the National Irish Language Theatre, in Galway city itself, while TG4 and RT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na Gaeltachta headquarters are in the Connemara Gaeltacht elsewhere in County Galway.

The Roman Catholic diocese of Galway was created in 1831 following the abolition by the Holy See of the Wardenship of Galway. It was united with the diocese of Kilmacduagh (est. 1152) and given the administratorship of the diocese of Kilfenora (est. 1152) in 1883. Its full name is the Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Apostolic Administratorship of Kilfenora (in Irish \u2013 Deoise na Gaillimhe, Chill Mac Duach agus Riarach\u00e1n Aspalda Cill Fhionn\u00farach, in Latin \u2013 Diocesis Galviensis, Duacensis ac Administratio Apostolica Finaborensis). The diocese is under the patronage Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas (Galway), Saint Fachanan (Kilmacduagh) and St Colman (Kilfenora). As the diocese of Kilfenora is in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Cashel the Bishop of Galway is its Apostolic Administrator rather than its bishop. The dioceses of Galway and Kilmacduagh are in the Ecclesiastical Metropolitan Province of Tuam. The current bishop is Most Rev. Martin Drennan, installed 3 July 2005. Of the 38 parishes in the RC diocese 14 are situated in the city and are divided into two deaneries \u2013 the deanery of Galway City West and that of Galway City East. In each deanery a Vicar Forane exercises limited jurisdiction on behalf of the bishop.\nIn the Church of Ireland, Galway is a parish of the United Diocese of Tuam, Killala and Achonry. The principal church of the parish is the St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church (founded 1320).

Pearse Stadium in Salthill is the home to Galway GAA, the county's Gaelic games body. The Galway hurlers compete annually in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship for the Liam MacCarthy Cup.  Despite having won the cup only five times in their history, Galway is considered as one of the top teams in the Championship. Galway reached the 2012 All-Ireland final only to draw with Kilkenny to force a replay, the first since 1959, which they eventually lost. In 2017 Galway lifted the Liam MacCarthy Cup for the first time in 29 years beating Waterford by 0-26 to 2-17.

The club was formed in 2013 and first competed in the 2014 season.\nThe previous tenants of Eamonn Deacy Park, also called Galway United, first competed in the League of Ireland since 1977, then known as Galway Rovers. Michael D. Higgins, later elected President of Ireland in 2011, served as a president of the club in a ceremonial capacity. Following struggles with debts, the club became defunct at the end of the 2011 season. The Galway United Supporters Trust (GUST) had been servicing many debts of the company and were able to keep the club afloat for the 2011 season, with it having been effectively abandoned by its directors. GUST withdrew their support for the team and applied to join the 2012 League of Ireland as a community enterprise, rather than as a private company, which the old club had been. This application was not successful, however.\nGalway F.C. was formed the following year from a merger of GUST with Mervue United and Salthill Devon, two other clubs in the city, who had competed in the First Division since 2009 and 2010 respectively.\n\n\n==== Rugby ====\n\n\n===== Professional =====\nThe professional team for the province, Connacht Rugby, is based in the city.

Most industry and manufacturing in Galway, like the rest of Ireland, is hi-tech (e.g. ICT, medical equipment, electronics, chemicals, etc.), due to the Celtic Tiger economic boom. Companies such as Boston Scientific, Medtronic, EA Games, Cisco and SAP AG have their regional offices or other offices in Galway City and environs. Tourism is also of major importance to the city, which had over 2.1 million visitors in 2000, and produced revenue of over \u20ac400 million.The head office of Smyths, a toy shop company, is in Galway.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\n\n==== Radio ====\nThere are two radio stations based in the city \u2013 Galway Bay FM (95.8 FM) broadcasts from the city to the whole county; Flirt FM (101.3 FM) is the student radio station for NUI Galway.\n\n\n==== Print ====\nOne of the main regional newspapers for the county is The Connacht Tribune which prints two titles every week, the Connacht Tribune on Thursday, and the Galway City Tribune on Friday.

Galway Hub is a free resource for both practitioners and the general public in which to engage with the arts and cultural events across the city and county.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n\n==== Air ====\nGalway Airport, located 6 km (3.73 mi) east of the city at Carnmore, ceased to have scheduled passenger flights on 1 November 2011.  Because the runway is too short to take modern passenger jet aircraft, it it only capable of imited operations. Aerfort na Minna (22 km (13.67 mi) west of the city) operates regular flights to each of the Aran Islands (Oile\u00e1in \u00c1rann). Shannon Airport (90 km) and Ireland West Airport Knock (86 km) are the nearest international airports, both of which have flights around Ireland and to Britain, Continental Europe and North America (from Shannon).\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nBuses are the main form of public transport in the city and county. Routes operated by Bus \u00c9ireann include routes 401 (Salthill/Parkmore), 402 (Seacrest/Merlin Park), 404 (Newcastle/Oranmore), 405 (Rahoon/Ballybane), 407 (B\u00f3thar an Ch\u00f3iste) and 409 (Parkmore Industrial). Routes operated by City Direct include routes 410 (Salthill), 411 (Knocknacarra - Cappagh Rd), 412 (Knocknacarra Express), and 414 (Barna).Various bus companies also provide links throughout County Galway and nationwide.  These operate from a number of locations:\n\nThe main bus and rail station in the city is Ceannt Station.\nGalway Coach Station, located at Fairgreen, is also a coach transport hub. Scheduled direct and commuter services operate between the Coach Station, Dublin and Dublin Airport, as well as services to Limerick, Cork and Clifden. These are operated by Gobus and Citylink.\nOther regional bus operators use various bus stops around the city centre, and many serve the NUIG and GMIT campuses as well.\n\n\n==== Rail ====\n\nGalway's main railway station is Ceannt Station (St\u00e1isi\u00fan Cheannt), which opened in 1851, and was renamed in honour of \u00c9amonn Ceannt in 1966. A major redevelopment, including a completely new urban district, Ceannt Station Quarter, has been proposed for the station and adjoining land.\nThe Midland Great Western Railway reached Galway in 1851, giving the city a direct main line to its Broadstone Station terminus in Dublin. As the 19th century progressed the rail network in Connacht was expanded, making Galway an important railhead. The nearby town of Athenry became a railway junction, giving Galway links to Ennis, Limerick and the south in 1869 and Sligo and the north in 1894. In 1895 the MGW opened a branch line between Galway and Clifden.\nThe 20th century brought increasing road competition, and this led the Great Southern Railways to close the Clifden branch in 1935. In the 1970s the state railway authority C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann closed the Sligo-Athenry-Ennis line to passenger services. It later closed to freight as well.\nIarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann, Ireland's national rail operator, currently runs six return passenger services each day between Galway and Dublin Heuston, also serving intermediate stations. Travel time is just under 3 hours. Services on the Galway\u2013Limerick line have now resumed, with around 5\u20136 trains each way per day.\nFrom Galway railway services along the Western Rail Corridor link the city with Ennis, and Limerick where trains run to Cork via Limerick Junction (for Tipperary, Clonmel and Waterford) and Mallow (for Killarney and Tralee).\n\n\n==== Road ====\nFour national primary roads serve the city: the M6 motorway running east\u2013west (Athlone, Dublin), the M17 motorway running north from the M6 to Tuam, the N63, formerly the N17, connecting Galway with the Northwest (Tuam, Sligo, Donegal Town, Letterkenny and Derry), and the M18 motorway linking Galway to southern towns and cities Gort, Ennis, Shannon Town, Limerick and Cork joining up with The Wild Atlantic Way. In addition, there are plans for a semi-ring road of the city, the Galway City Outer Bypass. There is also an Inner City Ring (Cuar Inmhe\u00e1nach) route that encircles the city centre, most of which is pedestrianised.\nGalway is considered the gateway to Connemara and the Gaeltacht, including M\u00e1m, An Teach D\u00f3ite, Cor na M\u00f3na, Ros Muc, Bearna and An Cheathr\u00fa Rua. The N59 along the western shore of Lough Corrib and the R337 along the northern shore of Galway Bay both lead to this largely rural and highly scenic region.\n\n\n==== Waterways ====\nThe River Corrib is by far the most important waterway in Galway and a number of canals and channels were built above and through the city. The purposes of these to divert and control the water from the river, to harness its power and to provide a navigable route to the sea.  Of these, there were two major schemes \u2013 one between 1848 and 1858 and the other during the 1950s. The canals provided a power source for Galway and were the location of the first industries in the mid-19th century. The Eglinton Canal provided a navigation from the sea (at the Claddagh Basin) to the navigable part of the river (above the Salmon Weir Bridge). Most of the mills are still used today for various purposes; for instance, NUI Galway still uses a water turbine for electricity generation for their building on Nun's Island.\nCurrently, there are four bridges across the Corrib. Following the southward flow of the river these are, from the north: the Quincentennial Bridge, the Salmon Weir Bridge, the William O'Brien Bridge and the Wolfe Tone Bridge. There are plans for a fifth bridge as part of the Galway City Outer Bypass project. The Clare River flows from the North of the County Galway, through Tuam, Claregalway into Lough Corrib.\n\n\n==== Harbour ====\n\nGalway is the most central port on the West Coast of Ireland in the sheltered eastern corner of Galway Bay. The harbour can be used by vessels up to 10,000 tonnes deadweight (DWT) and the inner dock can accommodate up to 9 vessels at any one time. Pending approval, Galway Harbour may see major changes, should the \u20ac1.5 billion development plan go ahead.\nRegular passenger ferry and freight services operate between Galway and the tourist destination of the Aran Islands which is home to World Heritage Site D\u00fan Aonghasa. The islands also have regular links with the towns of Rossaveal and Doolin, which are physically closer but far smaller.\nCommuter ferry services have been proposed to the tourism town of Kinvara, on the opposite side of Galway Bay.Major work in the harbour area was carried out in 2009 to accommodate the stopover of the Volvo Ocean Race. This was one of the biggest events ever to visit Galway. The event returned with the finale of the race in June 2012. This was unprecedented in Volvo Ocean Race history.\n\n\n==== Walking ====\nThe city is planned as the start of the E2 European long-distance path, running for 4,850 kilometres (3,010 mi) to Nice, though the Irish section is as yet incomplete.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nGalway Textile Printers, located on Sandy Road, was the first major industry to come to Galway and quickly became one of the biggest employers in the west of Ireland. Some of those who worked there were specialists who were brought in to help set the factory up, but most employees were local. The Mills eventually went out of business in the early 1980s and its former site now hosts various small business establishments.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAs of 2002, there were 27 primary schools and 11 secondary schools in Galway.\n\n\n=== University ===\nNUI Galway was founded in 1845 as Queen's College, Galway, and was more recently known as University College, Galway (U.C.G.). It is divided into several colleges including the College of Arts, Social Science and Celtic Studies, the College Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences,  the College of Business, Public Policy and Law, the College of Science and the College of Engineering and Informatics. The university had an enrollment of 16000 in 2010.\nThe Biomedical Research Building was opened in 2014. It houses the Regenerative Medicine Institute (REMEDI). Also opened in 2014 were the Hardiman Building and a School of Psychology. The Hardiman Building is home to the university's collection of more than 350 literary, theatrical, political and historical archives. The building houses also the Moore Institute for Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences and the Whitaker Institute for Innovation and Societal Change. The National Institute for Prevention and Cardiovascular Health (NIPC) is an affiliate of NUI Galway.The offices of the Central Applications Office (C.A.O.) are also located in the city, this being the clearing house for undergraduate college and university applications in the Republic of Ireland; a related organisation, the Postgraduate Applications Centre, processes some taught postgraduate courses.\n\n\n=== Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) ===\n\nGMIT, in addition to having two campuses in Galway City, also has campuses in Castlebar, Letterfrack and Mountbellew. GMIT's Galway campus is based on the Dublin Road in Galway city, overlooking Galway Bay. It is the administrative headquarters for the Institute and has four Schools of study; the School of Business, the School of Engineering, the School of Science & Computing, and the College of Tourism & Arts.\n\n\n== Health ==\nPublicly funded health care and social services are provided in Galway by the HSE (West) division of the Health Services Executive.\nThe main city hospital, University Hospital Galway, is located on two campuses \u2014 Galway University Hospital and Merlin Park University Hospital.Two private hospitals \u2013 The Galway Clinic and the Bon Secours Hospital, Galway \u2013 also operate in the city.\nGalway Hospice provides palliative care for the people of Galway City and County on a homecare, inpatient and daycare basis.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of twin towns and sister cities in the Republic of Ireland\nThe Galway Line\nTerryland Forest Park\nGalway Technology Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Galway travel guide from Wikivoyage\nGalway City Council (local authority)\nGalway City and County Cultural Website",

          "We stayed here with our tent, 2 nights. First night was pretty good although the light above our tent that could be used for lighting sportfields. The second night the tent field looked more like a carpark so much cars where in the field.\n\nWe stayed here during our cycling holiday cycling from Belfast to Dublin.",
          "It's the one site that we keep coming back to. Excellent location, immaculately clean. Spotless toilets and very well ran.  Coastal walkway to salthill leaves from campsite. Se\u00e1n runs a nice tight ship and find him very helpful and accomadating. A bit more expensive than some sights but I feel its worth it.",
          "Lovely location for a site with level ground for campervans, good ring road and parking spots, although they do then cram other vans between! However it\u2019s expensive at nearly \u20ac40 per night, and then you get charged for hot water for washing \u2026",

          "I have being coming here for years and every\nYear it gets better. The staff couldn't be more helpful and it's great this year that the site is open until the end of October. We love coming here and it's a pity it's not open all Year round",
          "Excellent site, close to everything. Great facilities and friendly owner and staff.",
          "Really nice site,but bit expensive ,showers I dont mind paying for ,but paying for water to wash delve is ridiculous, plus the owner is not very helpful he works in reception doesn't look like he wants to be there,I think the park next door I will be going the next time !!!",
          "Great little park but no electricity if your in a tent so bring your own means of generation.",
          "Site okay but few downsides such as no booking facility, 1 Euro to use showers and very smelly from seaweed on the beach.",

          "Lovely spot very clean and kept well ",
          "Nice view until they jam as many motorhomes as they can in the front. So far the most expensive camp we have being to in Ireland. This being the 11th one in 3 weeks. Only \n6 showers for the whole camp and even though it didn't effect us \u2026",

          "I mean fair enough a caravan park with descent grounds & facilities but should it really cost bloody 30 quid to put up a tent for 2 people?? Other expenses like showers etc come on top! Even the friggin stove costs money. But shurelook they \u2026",
          "Great facilities and close to salthill and Galway",

          "Owner is a nasty man. Stay clear of here. You have been warned",
          "Arrive early! To get a good spot - along the coastal edge as spaces are limited.\nYes the reception could have had a smile and it is a little expensive...however if you can see past this you will benefit. \nSalt Hills is within a 15 minute \u2026",
          "Salthill  park was 100 per cent perfect . never lets me down.",

Nice enough toilet blocks. On the coast and a pleasant walk past the weed smoking teens at the diving platform.",

This is not the first 1 you meet, this one is down at the shore line. highly recommended.  ",

          "Don't go (camping) here. It's expensive compared to other campings. The campsite does not provide electricity for tents. The showers and kitching close at 9 PM. Showering costs money and you need'll to pay 2 Euro so you can cook for 30 \u2026",
          "Very tidy and quiet. Toilets were spotless. Showers could do with an upgrade. Great location to walk along the salthill prom or a bus from the entrance to Galway city centre.",

          "This park is very over rated. Over priced and staff are not very welcoming. \nAfter visiting many parks in the west coast of Ireland this was the worst. Mainly due to staff being unacommadting.",
          "Must be one of the most expensive campsites in the world!\nAn eye watering 34 euros per night (cash only!) PLUS 1 euro for a shower and unless your quick becomes 2 euros; plus 50c for a bowl of washing up water.\nOn the plus side it's \u2026",

Lovely coastal walk beside entrance to campsite into Salthill. Many sandy beaches and pretty harbours a few kms away.",
          "No charm... quite expensive... nothing to add",
          "Owner is extremely rude and arrogant. Don't spend your money here!\nI arrived hoping to spend one night there to break up our journey up the country. When we arrived at the reception the owner was straight away very unwelcoming and once he \u2026",
          "Overpriced camping. Just 3 showers for around 100 men last Friday. Pitches don't have their tap of water. The service bay for filling was occupied by a bus.",
          "The \"beach\" is just a pile of rocks and seaweed, about 5 minutes walk from site.  \n\nYou don't get to choose parking, it is assigned.\n\nHighly organised and overpriced.  \u20ac36 for 2 people to park overnight, midweek.  \u20ac0.50 to wash dishes (push \u2026",

          "Nothing special, clean but expensive",
          "Don't camp here. \nThe owner isn't available before 11am for questions or check in. \nFacilities aren't clean!! \nThe showers cost 1\u20ac and hot water 0,50\u20ac.\nMaybe the campsite beneath is probably better then this one.",
          "Over prices (40 euro for 2 adults and 1 child aged 5) no structure to the camp site just put your tent anywhere .",
          "Don't camp here! High price for nonexistent or dirty installations. Beware, there are 3 different campgrounds right next to each other. I was on the first, lefthandside, coming from galway center. The other two sites i don't know! ",

          "Very friendly. Clean. Bus outside the gate to everything.",
          "Nice location with good views but I am unlikely to return here. I found it quite expensive compared to other campsites with superior facilities. For a start there was no soap in the toilets, and you have to pay to use wash up sinks, both of \u2026",
          "Narrow-minded staff",
          "Having arrived at this caravan park mid week it was amazing. This caravan park is the cleanest we have yet to experience. Plenty of room if you get here early. Yes like any site it\u2019s going to get busy but things here are perfection  you get \u2026",
          "Nice site great location but needs a kitchen and laundry facilities and a playground for the kids.",
          "Lovely location (very close to the sea).  Unfortunately the hygiene was insufficient for me (dirty batrhrooms etc.) and there was no electricity provided in the tent area. ",
          "Nice place to stay, great view over the ocean, beach near by, toilets and showers in great condition.",
          "Nice location and staff friendly however very expensive, we are used to paying extra for showers however having to pay for hot water to wash up was a step to far when we had already paid a fortune.  Slightly shabby for the price too.",
          "Clean,friendly, great location a small bit over priced but we liked it",
          "Childish management",
          "Very good and well run Park. Peaceful on the edge of Salthill in Galway and direct access to costal walk/cycle way to Galway city. Barna a nice village a short distance West is good for eating out I thought. Joyce supermarket nearby the \u2026",
          "We stayed there last week a beautiful caravan and camping park spotless and clean and very helpful staff",
          "Clean & friendly place but it's very busy.",

          "Excellent campsite I stay here every year and I love coming back. It is an ideal location to tour galway right beside the beach. They have also made some Huge improvements to the site over the last number of years.  ",
          "Situated next to the sea .Can be very exposed  in windy weather .Pitches narrow and close together . Expensive we paid \u20ac28 for pitch \u20ac6 for 10 amp elec .Showers are \u20ac1 and to wash your pots and pans will cost 50 cents.Nice views and it is convenient for visiting Galway .",
          "Avoid very ignorant the minute we arrived never even met or spoke to him before, just needs a customer courtesy course maybe, and expensive,  would sell u a token for breathing air if he could get away with it.",
          "Lovely view at this camping site.....bathroom facility was very clean. ",
          "Nice campsite closest to the city of Galway, about 45 minutes walk. Friendly staff and everything in order with toilets and free good showers",
          "After emailing a few months ago with exact dates I was told there was plenty of space and no need to book. Turned up to be told they are full! Complete change of plans! Didn't even apologise after I said I emailed them just said we are \u2026",
          "Camped there for 2 nights in a small tent. A bit over crowded by families who set up multiple tents for their group and take a lot of space. Showers were not free. Limited facilities in the kitchen.",
          "Fantastic  place, lovely  location, very clean \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Incredibly overpriced (we paid 50\u20ac for 4 people) plus you have to pay for everything (showers, and even water to clean your dishes!!) And they don't even take cards, that was the only campside in ireland where you had to pay cash.\nStaff \u2026",
          "Stayed on a Friday night in April 2018.\n\nOne of only a handful of sites around Galway open before May.\n\nThe site is on the edge of the town, overlooking the bay, and quite a few of the touring pitches have a direct view across it.\n\nThe site \u2026"
